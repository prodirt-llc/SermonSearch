Every \"Baptist \u0014\nDay\" the school would invite one of the greatest minds to lecture \u0014\nin the theological education center. One year they invited Dr. Paul \u0014\nTillich. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr.Tillich spoke for two and one-half hours proving that \u0014\nthe resurrection of Jesus was false. He quoted scholar after \u0014\nscholar and book after book. He concluded that since there was no \u0014\nsuch thing as the historical resurrection, the religious tradition \u0014\nof the church was groundless, emotional mumbo-jumbo, because it was \u0014\nbased on a relationship with a risen Jesus, who, in fact, never \u0014\nrose from the dead in any literal sense. He then asked if there \u0014\nwere any questions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter about 30 seconds, an old, dark skinned preacher with a head \u0014\nof short-cropped, woolly white hair stood up in the back of the \u0014\nauditorium.\"Docta Tillich, I got one question,\" he said as all eyes \u0014\nturned toward him. He reached into his sack lunch and pulled out an \u0014\napple and began eating it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Docta Tillich.. CRUNCH, MUNCH \"My question is a simple question,\u0014\n...CRUNCH, MUNCH...\"Now, I ain't never read them books you read\u0014\n..CRUNCH, MUNCH...\"and I can't recite the Scriptures in the \u0014\noriginal Greek\u0014\n...CRUNCH, MUNCH ...\" I don't know nothin' about Niebuhr and \u0014\nHeidegger\u0014\n...CRUNCH, MUNCH...He finished the apple. \"All I wanna know is:\u0014\nThis apple I just ate,------was it bitter or sweet?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Tillich paused for a moment and answered in exemplary scholarly\u0014\nfashion: \"I cannot possibly answer that question, for I haven't \u0014\ntasted your apple.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe white-haired preacher dropped the core of his apple into his \u0014\ncrumpled paper bag, looked up at Dr. Tillich and said \u0014\ncalmly, \"And you ain't never tasted my Jesus either.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1,000 plus in attendance could not contain themselves. The \u0014\nauditorium erupted with applause and cheers. Dr. Tillich thanked \u0014\nhis audience and promptly left the platform. Have you tasted Jesus?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus has risen... and he's coming back one day! Taste and see that \u0014\nthe LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.

Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a joke. \n\"Come\u0014\non Leon, cut it out! Seriously, Leon, how's your momma?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd first and foremost: \u0014\n\u0014\n1.

Earlier in the same chapter, Jesus tries to tell \nhis disciples they\u0014\n           should expect radical changes in how they would be treated \nwhile trying\u0014\n           to minister.\u0014\n                          ___In the past, Jesus had instructed them \nto take\u0014\n                          no money or luggage or even an extra pair of\u0014\n                          sandals when they traveled from city to \ncity. The\u0014\n                          people would take care of their\u0014\n                          needs, but when the religious\u0014\n                          leaders unleashed their full hatred\u0014\n                          on Jesus, the disciples also\u0014\n                          would be hated.\u0014\n                          ___Jesus issued new\u0014\n                          procedures. \"But now, if you have a purse, \ntake it,\u0014\n                          and also a bag, and if you don't have a \nsword, sell\u0014\n           your cloak and buy one.\" If we take this passage \nliterally, Jesus was\u0014\n           instructing his disciples to acquire arms and be prepared \nto defend\u0014\n           themselves with deadly force. Apparently, this is what the \ndisciples\u0014\n           thought Jesus meant. Two of them even acknowledged \npossessing\u0014\n           swords. Jesus even commented the two swords would be \nenough.\u0014\n           ___Immediately after his conversation, Jesus led the \ndisciples to the\u0014\n           Mount of Olives, where he asked them to pray. We know the \ndisciples\u0014\n           were exhausted and, in fact, fell asleep.\u0014\n           ___It is no wonder that when the contingent of soldiers \narrived to arrest\u0014\n           Jesus, Peter sprang to his defense. After all, Peter \nprobably still was\u0014\n           smarting from Jesus' rebuke, predicting Peter would deny \nhis Lord\u0014\n           within a few hours. To prove his allegiance to Jesus, \nPeter, perhaps in a\u0014\n           half-daze, struck one of the men, cutting off his ear.\u0014\n           ___ To Peter's amazement, Jesus not only did not \ncompliment him on\u0014\n           his fine swordsmanship, but rebuked him again and healed \nthe enemy's\u0014\n           ear.\u0014\n           ___ Despite the fact Jesus stopped the disciples from \ndefending him\u0014\n           with force, some today use these passages to defend their \nposition of\u0014\n           using deadly force to protect themselves and their \ninterests. In fact,\u0014\n           some right-wing military survival groups who call \nthemselves followers\u0014\n           of Christ advocate armed resistance as Christian duty.\u0014\n           ___ It is true that using deadly force on enemies was \npracticed by\u0014\n           God's people in the Old Testament. God himself instructed \nhis people at\u0014\n           times to destroy every inhabitant of certain cities. King \nDavid became a\u0014\n           national hero by \"bearing his sword\" against Goliath.\u0014\n           ___ However, Jesus came announcing a new covenant. God's \nweapon\u0014\n           of choice was no longer the sword but was now love and \nmercy. Jesus\u0014\n           made his position clear when he said, \"You have heard that \nit was said,\u0014\n           'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' but I say to \nyou, 'Do not\u0014\n           resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right \ncheek, turn to\u0014\n           him the other also.'\" Jesus also said, \"Love your enemy \nand pray for\u0014\n           those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your \nFather in\u0014\n           heaven.\"\u0014\n           ___ Even if there was room for confusion in what Jesus \nsaid, there was\u0014\n           no doubt about what he did. The Scripture tells us he had \nlegions of\u0014\n           warrior angels at his disposal, but he chose to endure the \nbrutality, the\u0014\n           scourging and the cross without so much as a verbal abuse.\u0014\n           ___ Enough said.\u0014",

You have used the phrase \"fixin' to\" during the last 12 months.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Someone you know has used a football schedule to plan their \nwedding date.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.

You can recall hot summers by the year they happened easier than \nyou can remember your mother's birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\n9.

    "words": "In Bill Gates' new book (Business @ The Speed of Thought), he lays \nout 11 rules that students do not learn in high school or college, \nbut should. He argues that our feel-good, politically-correct \nteachings have created a generation of kids with no concept of \nreality who are set up for failure in the real world. You might be \ninterested in his list:\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE I - Life is not fair; get used to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 2- The world won't care about your self-esteem. The world will \nexpect\u0014\nyou to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 3 - You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of \nhigh school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone, until \nyou earn both.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 4 - If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a \nboss. He\u0014\ndoesn't have tenure.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 5 - Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your \ngrandparents had\u0014\na different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 6 - If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine \nabout\u0014\nyour mistakes, learn from them.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 7 - Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they \nare now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your \nclothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before \nyou save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' \ngeneration, try delousing the closet in your own room.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 8 - Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but \nlife has\u0014\nnot. In some schools they have abolished failing grades, they'll give \nyou as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't \nbear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 9 - Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers \noff and very few employers are interested in helping you find \nyourself. Do that on your own time.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 10 - Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually \nhave to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nRULE 11 - Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for \none. Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced, you can't be \npromoted.\u0014",

    "words": "Abolitionists fare less well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Peter T. Chattaway \u0014\n\u0014\n                        It is a bitter irony, much noted by critics, \nthat many films dealing\u0014\n                        with the civil-rights movement and its \nlegacy--Mississippi Burning,\u0014\n                        Cry Freedom, and, most recently, Ghosts of \nMississippi, to name\u0014\n                        three prominent examples--have minimized the \nrole of black\u0014\n                        activists within their own movements while \nextolling the (at times\u0014\n                        fictitious) heroism of white people who came \nto their rescue. But\u0014\n                        what is equally true, and not so frequently \nnoted, is how these films\u0014\n                        secularize their white heroes and, through \nthem, the process of\u0014\n                        racial reconciliation. If religion is visible \nat all, it is typically found\u0014\n                        among racial minorities or on the lips of \nwhite villains.1 \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Ghosts of Mississippi is a classic case in \npoint. The film tells the\u0014\n                        true story of Bobby DeLaughter, an attorney \nwho successfully\u0014\n                        prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith in 1994 for \nmurdering\u0014\n                        civil-rights activist Medgar Evers some 30 \nyears before. In the film,\u0014\n                        the black activist and his family take a back \nseat to the white\u0014\n                        lawyer and his domestic troubles, while the \nfilm's only clearly\u0014\n                        articulated reference to religious belief \ncomes in a racist rant of De\u0014\n                        La Beckwith's. But when I interviewed the \nreal-life DeLaughter for\u0014\n                        a secular publication, he told several \nstories of the prayers that had\u0014\n                        been said by himself, by members of Evers's \nfamily, and even by\u0014\n                        the foreman of the jury. These prayers, he \nbelieved, helped bring\u0014\n                        the killer to justice, but there is no trace \nof them in the film. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        So how does one restore religion in general, \nand Christianity in\u0014\n                        particular, to historical narratives such as \nthese? For conservatives\u0014\n                        such as the Christian Film and Television \nCommission's Ted Baehr,\u0014\n                        the answer is, in effect, to seize control of \nthe mainstream--that is,\u0014\n                        to return to the days when Christians \nassisted Hollywood in\u0014\n                        creating a central, homogenous, American \nmyth. But in a world\u0014\n                        marked by increasingly diverse audiences and \na proliferation of\u0014\n                        independent filmmakers, religion stands a \ngreater chance of\u0014\n                        recognition if filmmakers are encouraged to \nbroaden their minds in\u0014\n                        general and reflect the pluralism--ethnic, \nreligious, and\u0014\n                        otherwise--that already exists. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        It is in this respect that Steven Spielberg's \nAmistad proves\u0014\n                        particularly interesting. Amistad is a \nmainstream film, with\u0014\n                        impeccable production values and recognizable \nactors. But as the\u0014\n                        first film Spielberg has directed for \nDreamWorks, the studio he\u0014\n                        cofounded four years ago with Jeffrey \nKatzenberg and David\u0014\n                        Geffen, it also enjoys some of the artistic \nfreedom one associates\u0014\n                        with an independent film. And it is this mix \nof the mainstream and\u0014\n                        the marginal that marks Spielberg's curious \ninterpretation of a\u0014\n                        pivotal moment in the history of American \nracial and religious\u0014\n                        politics. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        The basic facts are thus: In the summer of \n1839, in the coastal\u0014\n                        waters of Cuba, 53 slaves on board a schooner \nnamed La\u0014\n                        Amistad (Spanish for \"friendship\") broke free \none night and killed\u0014\n                        all of the crew but for Jos Ruiz and Pedros \nMontes, their nominal\u0014\n                        owners. The boat was then captured by \nAmerican naval officers,\u0014\n                        who promptly claimed \"salvage rights\" over \nthe slaves. Ruiz and\u0014\n                        Montes also claimed the slaves, as did the \nSpanish government,\u0014\n                        while the American courts pondered whether or \nnot it was within\u0014\n                        their jurisdiction to deal with the matter at \nall. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Into this bewildering array stepped an \nabolitionist coalition led by\u0014\n                        Lewis Tappan, a wealthy, devoutly evangelical \nNew York\u0014\n                        merchant. Tappan saw in the Amistad slaves an \nopportunity to\u0014\n                        generate sympathy for his cause and, should \nthe slaves be freed, an\u0014\n                        opportunity to begin missionary work in \nAfrica. For his part,\u0014\n                        President Martin Van Buren went out of his \nway to appease the\u0014\n                        Spanish government, encouraging Judge Andrew \nT. Judson to send\u0014\n                        the slaves back to Cuba on a boat he had \nalready prepared, should\u0014\n                        the proper verdict be rendered. Van Buren did \nthis to keep the\u0014\n                        approval of the southern states on the eve of \nhis re-election\u0014\n                        campaign, but to some it appeared that he was \n\"tampering with our\u0014\n                        courts of justice,\"2 and this ultimately \nbecame a factor in Van\u0014\n                        Buren's defeat in the 1840 election. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Because the abolitionists could demonstrate \nthat the mutineers had\u0014\n                        not been born slaves but, rather, had been \ntaken illegally from their\u0014\n                        homes in Africa, Judson decided in their \nfavor. The government\u0014\n                        appealed to the Supreme Court, which also \ndecided in favor of\u0014\n                        freeing the slaves in early 1841. Within a \nyear, most of the surviving\u0014\n                        Africans had returned to Sierra Leone, \naccompanied by\u0014\n                        Congregational missionaries intent on \nfurthering the work of the\u0014\n                        church--but that's another story. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Because these Africans were slaves for only a \nshort period of time\u0014\n                        and never did settle on any one plantation, \nSpielberg cannot do for\u0014\n                        American slavery what he did for the \nHolocaust in Schindler's List.\u0014\n                        He cannot show the day-to-day lives of third- \nor fourth-generation\u0014\n                        American slaves or the masters who had to \nlive with them and\u0014\n                        continually justify their relationship. But \nhe does convey some of the\u0014\n                        horrors of the slave trade in a harrowing \nsequence that chronicles\u0014\n                        the kidnapping, selling, and systematic \nmurder of African slaves en\u0014\n                        route to the Americas. And through it all, he \nkeeps his focus on the\u0014\n                        Africans themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Lest the white characters overwhelm the story \nonce the slaves are\u0014\n                        brought before the American courts, the film \nalso introduces a\u0014\n                        fictitious black abolitionist named Theodore \nJoadson (Morgan\u0014\n                        Freeman). Joadson is a former Georgia slave \nwho maneuvers\u0014\n                        between Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgrd), \ndefense attorney\u0014\n                        Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), and \nformer President\u0014\n                        John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) and \nunites their efforts. It\u0014\n                        may not be going too far to say that, within \nthe film, it is Joadson\u0014\n                        who makes it possible for these people to \nwork together, and\u0014\n                        without him they would go their separate \nways. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Joadson is Amistad's main attempt to give \nAfrican Americans\u0014\n                        mainstream representation. And to preserve \nthis characterization,\u0014\n                        the film seriously downplays--even \neliminates--the racism that\u0014\n                        existed in the northern states and would have \ndogged Joadson's\u0014\n                        steps at that time. Joadson is also \nremarkably free of religious\u0014\n                        convictions; those belong, instead, to such \nreal-life abolitionists as\u0014\n                        Lewis Tappan, and while Spielberg highlights \ntheir religious\u0014\n                        motivations--it's not often a film allows the \npositive use of a word\u0014\n                        like righteousness--he does so in a way that \nreflects Hollywood's\u0014\n                        distrust of evangelical Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        The abolitionist movement, as represented \nhere, is distinctly lacking\u0014\n                        in political savvy. Groups of abolitionists \nloiter both outside and\u0014\n                        inside the prison to sing off-key hymns; the \nslaves wonder who\u0014\n                        these \"miserable-looking\" people are and \nsuspect that they must be\u0014\n                        entertainers. One of the abolitionists \ncoerces a slave named Yamba\u0014\n                        (Razaaq Adoti) into touching his Bible; Yamba \nsnatches it from his\u0014\n                        hands in anger. And Tappan seems a bit too \nfond of martyrdom; in\u0014\n                        one scene, as he concludes that the Africans \nwill probably be\u0014\n                        executed, he remarks that they might be more \nvaluable to the cause\u0014\n                        in death than in life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Tappan almost certainly did not take this \nstance. There were,\u0014\n                        indeed, abolitionists who failed to \narticulate their ideals in the\u0014\n                        political arena, but the historical Tappan \ndoes not appear to have\u0014\n                        been one of them. Tappan and his friends \nbelieved so strongly in\u0014\n                        the slaves' freedom that they briefly \nconsidered taking up arms to\u0014\n                        break them out of jail,3 but they decided \nagainst this course of\u0014\n                        action because--apart from the fact that it \nwould have\u0014\n                        compromised their pacifism--they hoped the \nAmistad case would\u0014\n                        vindicate their faith in the American courts \nand in their own ability\u0014\n                        to persuade the public. If they could win \nthis case by working\u0014\n                        within the system, then perhaps America as a \nwhole could be\u0014\n                        cleansed of slavery from within. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Tappan also looked beyond the abolition of \nslavery and foresaw\u0014\n                        the need to integrate freed slaves into \nAmerican society. To that\u0014\n                        end, the abolitionists did a lot more than \njust sing at the Africans;\u0014\n                        they actively educated them in the English \nlanguage, taught them\u0014\n                        hymns, and introduced them to the gospel. \nTraces of this are\u0014\n                        preserved in Spielberg's film, but in a way \nthat is careful not to\u0014\n                        offend pluralistic sensibilities. At no point \ndo we see the Africans\u0014\n                        receiving any religious instruction, and at \nno point do we hear of\u0014\n                        Tappan's plans to make missionaries of them. \nHowever, Spielberg\u0014\n                        does show Yamba paging through his Bible and, \nsimply by looking\u0014\n                        at the illustrations of Gustave Dor,4 Yamba \ncomes to an\u0014\n                        amazingly comprehensive knowledge of the \nlife, death, and\u0014\n                        resurrection of Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Spielberg cross-cuts this scene with another, \nin which a district\u0014\n                        court judge named Coglin (Jeremy Northam) \nprays in church the\u0014\n                        night before giving his verdict. In a \nfictitious subplot, President Van\u0014\n                        Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) has removed Judson \nfrom the case and\u0014\n                        replaced him with Coglin because he thinks \nCoglin, being the\u0014\n                        grandson of a Catholic and \"insecure\" about \nhis heritage, will be\u0014\n                        easier to manipulate. Instead, Coglin \nsurprises his superiors by\u0014\n                        setting the slaves free, and the film makes \nit quite clear that it is his\u0014\n                        faith that enables him to do so.5 \u0014\n\u0014\n                        But it is not merely his personal piety that \nenables him; it is also his\u0014\n                        willingness to identify with the beliefs of \nhis ancestors. And this is a\u0014\n                        theme that Amistad draws upon heavily near \nthe end. Cinque\u0014\n                        (Djimon Hounsou), who instigated the original \nrevolt, declares that\u0014\n                        he will call upon his ancestors for help when \nhe stands before the\u0014\n                        Supreme Court; Adams, in his speech before \nthe Court, borrows\u0014\n                        the concept and invokes the memory of past \nAmerican presidents,\u0014\n                        solemnly declaring, \"Who we are is who we \nwere.\" Despite the\u0014\n                        fact, which goes unmentioned, that some of \nthese presidents were\u0014\n                        slaveowners themselves, Adams implies that it \nis by returning to\u0014\n                        their roots that Americans will overcome \nslavery in the end.\u0014\n                        (Tappan and his coreligionists are notably \nabsent from the story\u0014\n                        once the case goes before the Supreme Court.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                        And so Amistad promotes a pluralist vision of \ncooperation\u0014\n                        between different ethnic and religious groups \nand in doing so\u0014\n                        acknowledges, in part, the historical role of \nChristians. But it also\u0014\n                        pulls the story in a direction more congenial \nto contemporary\u0014\n                        fashion, a direction that allows for a sort \nof inner spirituality but is\u0014\n                        uneasy with that spirituality when it asserts \nitself in the public arena.\u0014\n                        It is to Spielberg's credit that he has \nbroadened his point of\u0014\n                        view--and that of his audience--thus far. But \nthere is still a ways to\u0014\n                        go. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Peter T. Chattaway reviews films for a \nvariety of publications in Canada\u0014\n                        and the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                             1. Glory (1989), directed by Edward \nZwick and set during the\u0014\n                             Civil War, reflects one aspect of this \ndichotomy the night\u0014\n                             before the soldiers go into battle. The \nblack troops conduct\u0014\n                             an impromptu outdoors religious service, \nwhile the white\u0014\n                             officers--one of them fictitious, the \nother the son of\u0014\n                             abolitionist parents--sit in a tent and \nnurse their drinks.\u0014\n                             2. From an article in the February 10, \n1840, issue of the\u0014\n                             Hartford Courant, quoted in Christopher \nMartin, The\u0014\n                             Amistad Affair (Abelard-Schuman, 1970), \np. 168.\u0014\n                             3.

Dor, born in 1832, was still a boy \nat this time and would\u0014\n                             not publish his illustrated Bible until \n1866, but why quibble?\u0014\n                             5. An argument could be made that \nHollywood feels more at\u0014\n                             ease relating to Catholics than it does \nrelating to\u0014\n                             evangelicals. In Amistad, a Catholic is \ninserted into the story\u0014\n                             where none existed before, and he steals \nsome of the\u0014\n                             evangelicals' thunder, sentencing Ruiz \nand Montes to prison\u0014\n                             even though, historically, it was \nTappan's lawyers who\u0014\n                             charged them with assault on behalf of \nthe Africans and thus\u0014\n                             had the Spaniards imprisoned. A similar \ndynamic can be\u0014\n                             observed in Robert Zemeckis's film \nadaptation of Carl\u0014\n                             Sagan's Contact, which transformed \nPalmer Joss from a\u0014\n                             realistically broad-minded \nfundamentalist preacher into a\u0014\n                             lapsed Jesuit. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Copyright(c) 1998 by the author or \nChristianity Today,\u0014\n                        Inc./Books & Culture Magazine.

Mendi people think\u0014\n                                 think, think. Nobody know. Teacher, \nhe know, we tell him some.\u0014\n                                 Mendi people have got souls. We \nthink we know God punish us if\u0014\n                                 we tell lie. We never tell lie; we \nspeak the truth, What for Mendi\u0014\n                                 people afraid? Because they have got \nsouls. Cook say he kill, he\u0014\n                                 eat Mendi people--we afraid--we kill \ncook. Then captain kill one man\u0014\n                                 with knife, and cut Mendi people \nplenty. We never kill captain if he\u0014\n                                 no kill us. If Court ask who bring \nMendi people to America, we\u0014\n                                 bring ourselves. Ceci hold the \nrudder. All we want is make us free,\u0014\n                                 not send us to Havana. Send us home. \nGive us Missionary. We tell\u0014\n                                 Mendi people Americans spoke truth. \nWe give them good tidings.\u0014\n                                 We tell them there is one god. You \nmust worship him. Make us free\u0014\n                                 and we will bless you and all Mendi \npeople will bless you, Dear\u0014\n                                 friend Mr. Adams.\u0014",

DAWIDOWICZ \u0014\n     published in The Holocaust and the Historians (Harvard \nUniversity Press, 1981); this excerpt is from pp. 34-38. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Despite the recent outpouring of popular and scholarly books on \nHitler, no work has yet been produced\u0014\n     that satisfactorily explains Hitler's obsessive ideas about the \nJews, the readiness of the German people to\u0014\n                                              accept those ideas, and \nHitler's ability to harness\u0014\n                                              an enormous apparatus \nof men, institutions, and\u0014\n                                              facilities 'lust in \norder to murder the Jews. Hitler\u0014\n                                              has proved to be an \nelusive and unrewarding\u0014\n                                              subject for \nconventional biography because the\u0014\n                                              explanations for the \nbaffling mystique he\u0014\n                                              exercised, for the \npower he came to wield, and\u0014\n                                              for his unspeakable \naccomplishments are not to\u0014\n                                              be found in the facts \nof a banal life, but in the\u0014\n                                              ideas and feelings that \ncreated the symbiosis\u0014\n                                              between him and the \nGerman people. Their\u0014\n                                              mutuality and \ninterdependence thrived, as Hitler\u0014\n                                              first expressed and \nlater gratified the Germans'\u0014\n                                              most arrogant and \nabominable ambitions. He\u0014\n     relieved their deepest fears and anxieties and, near the end, \ndisburdened them of both guilt and\u0014\n     responsibility for the wickedness they had given him warrant to \ncommit. J. P. Stern, an English literary\u0014\n     scholar and a refugee from Germany, perceived that the \nbiographical approach was likely to trivialize\u0014\n     rather than to illuminate this particular man: \"If sociological \ninterpretations lose sight of the man behind\u0014\n     the trends, it is the common failing of biographies that they \nabstract a man from his world--a procedure\u0014\n     that is particularly misleading in the case of one whose every \npublic word and every public act expressed\u0014\n     for almost the whole of his career the fears and aspirations of \nhis contemporaries. \u0014\n\u0014\n     That conclusion is borne out in the popular biographies by \nRobert Payne and John Toland, neither of\u0014\n     which adds much to our knowledge or understanding of Hitler. \nPayne, a prolific professional writer,\u0014\n     produced a briskly told account of Hitler's life which is \naltogether devoid of ideas. He tells little about\u0014\n     Hitler and the Jews: barely ten pages out of over 6oo are \ndevoted to the Final Solution, with a handful of\u0014\n     other references to anti-Semitism, though not even a mention of \nthe Nuremberg Laws. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Toland's book is more accomplished, yet despite massive research \nand countless interviews with\u0014\n     countless persons, he has not succeeded in telling (in over a \nthousand pages) anything important that we\u0014\n     had not known before. Asking few questions of historical \nsignificance of either his documents or his living\u0014\n     subjects, Toland approached this book on Hitler, he admits, \nwithout a thesis. The \"most meaningful\"\u0014\n     conclusion he reached was \"that Hitler was far more complex and \ncontradictory\" than he had imagined. \u0014\n\u0014\n     But the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's \nHitler's War. An amateur historian, whose\u0014\n     reputation as a German apologist and as a writer without regard \nfor accuracy or truth won him a\u0014\n     measure of notoriety, Irving produced a 926-page work intended \nto show that Hitler was kind to his\u0014\n     animals and to his secretaries, that he was \"probably the \nweakest leader Germany has known in this\u0014\n     century,\" and that he did not murder the Jews or even wish to do \nso, but that the murder was committed\u0014\n     behind his back, without his knowledge or consent. The killing \nof the Jews, Irving believes, \"was partly\u0014\n     of an ad hoc nature, what the Germans call a \nVerlegenbeitsldsung-the way out of an awkward dilemma,\u0014\n     chosen by the middle-level authorities in the eastern \nterritories overrun by the Nazis-and partly a cynical\u0014\n     extrapolation by the central SS authorities of Hitler's \nanti-Semitic decrees.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     Irving claims to have new evidence and fresh interpretations of \nknown documents, but in fact, all his\u0014\n     evidence is familiar. He develops his arguments mostly by \nsuppressing or ignoring the impressive body of\u0014\n     existing evidence and partly by applying a guileful literalness \nto cases of Hitler's Aesopian language. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Irving's thesis, which denies Hitler's responsibility for the \nmurder of the Jews, is too preposterous to\u0014\n     require refutation and argument, but one example will suffice to \nshow his \"scholarly\" method. As\u0014\n     seemingly irrefutable proof for his case, Mr. Irving offered an \nentry in Himmler's handwritten telephone\u0014\n     log. On November 30, 1941, at I:30 p.m., Himmler, then in \nHitler's military headquarters bunker \"Wolf's\u0014\n     Lair,\" telephoned SS Obergruppenfuhrer Heydrich, then in Prague. \nThe gist of the telephone message\u0014\n     was entered in four short lines in the log, though Mr. Irving \ncited only the last two lines: \u0014\n\u0014\n                               judentransport aus Berlin\u0014\n                               keine Liquidierung. \u0014\n\u0014\n     That is: \"Transport of Jews from Berlin. No liquidation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     From this Mr. Irving concluded that Hitler had somehow learned \nwhat Himmler was up to and had\u0014\n     ordered him to stop. An obedient Nazi, Himmler had called \nHeydrich in Prague to transmit Hitler's\u0014\n     order. But in view of everything we know about the destruction \nof the Jews, Irving's construction of\u0014\n     events makes no sense. If Himmler continued to kill the Jews \nlong after November 30, I941, why did he\u0014\n     order the liquidation of this one transport stopped? If he \ndeceived Hitler before and after about the\u0014\n     murder of the Jews, why should he be honest about it this once? \nBesides, what became of that transport\u0014\n     of Jews from Berlin? Were they returned home? Irving's \nconclusion fails to provide a satisfactory\u0014\n     explanation of those two lines in view of what actually \nhappened, though it serves to support his\u0014\n     perversely fanciful interpretation of Hitler's character. \u0014\n\u0014\n     To understand those two lines it is necessary to read also the \nfirst two lines of the telephone\u0014\n     conversation. Here is the full German text: \u0014\n\u0014\n                Verhaftung Dr. jekelius [name not fully decipherable] \u0014\n                Angebl [ich] Sohn Molotovs.\u0014\n                judentransport aus Berlin.\u0014\n                keine Liquidierung. \u0014\n\u0014\n     That is: \"Arrest Dr. jekellus. Presumably Molotov's son. \nTransport of Jews from Berlin. No liquidation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n     The last two lines now make sense. Himmler called Heydrich to \ninstruct him that a certain Dr. Jekelius,\u0014\n     presumed to be the Soviet Foreign Minister's son, was to be \ntaken in custody by the security police.\u0014\n     jekelius could be located in the transport of Jews from Berlin \narriving in Prague and, unlike the rest of the\u0014\n     transport, was not to be liquidated. (Perhaps the Germans \nintended to exchange Jekelius for one of their\u0014\n     officers captured by the Russians.) \u0014\n\u0014\n     Irving, wittingly or unwittingly, has in fact disproved his own \ntheory. For if Hitler was indeed responsible\u0014\n     for Himmler's call (there is no evidence that he was), then \nIrving has shown that Hitler did in fact know\u0014\n     all about the murder of the Jews. And indeed, how else could it \nhave been? The murder of the Jews was\u0014\n     Hitler's most consistent policy, in whose execution he persisted \nrelentlessly, and obsessiveness with the\u0014\n     Jews may even have cost him his war for the Thousand Year Reich.\u0014",

    "title": "\"THE LORD TOLD ME IT WAS ALL RIGHT\"",
    "words": "By: Deborah Baxtrom   from \"Liberty\" Magazie, May/June, 2000, p. 3\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelist John Wayne Punkin Brown picked up three-foot yellow \ntimber rattle snake while delivering one of his raucous sermons in \nAlabama in 1998.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey say it won't bite! Brown bellowed as the rattler twisted \nitself into the shape of a V. If it won't bite, there ain't no sense \nin being scared. But he had been bitten 22 times during his 18-year \ncareer as a snake-handling pastor of Southern Pentecostal churches. \nThe Lord told me it was all right, Brown continued. The Lord said \nit would be all right:' But he knew things didn't always turn out \nall right:' His wife, Melinda, had been fatally bitten by a \nrattlesnake at a revival three years earlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, as the preacher hopped across the stage, history repeated \nitself. The rattler struck, biting Brown on his left middle finger. \nThe preacher paid little attention to the bite, and it took a while \nfor the congregation to grasp the sad situation unfolding before them.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's still God, no matter what comes7 said Brown, his voice fading. \nA woman in the congregation screamed, and other members anxiously \nmopped the dying preacher's forehead. No matter what else, God's \nstill God. Ten minutes later Brown was dead, and his five young \nchildren had become orphans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown had been given custody of his children after his wife's death. \nBut custody had been granted under two conditionsthat he would agree \nnot to keep poisonous snakes in his house, and that the children \nwould not be allowed to attend snake-handling services. He defied \nthose orders, sincerely believing he was doing God's will, even \nthough the children had been known to wake up screaming from \nterrifying nightmares about snakes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile their father's death was a devastating tragedy, it offered an \nopportunity for the children to be freed from exposure to dangerous \nvipers. Instead they became pawns in a custody battle between their \ngrandparents. While their maternal grandmother wanted to keep them as \nfar away from snakes as possible, their paternal grandparents ran a \nsnake-handling church of their own.\u0014\nThis case presented unusual circumstances. Most people would probably \nagree that the Brown children would be best placed in the custody of \na grandparent who would keep them away from poisonous serpents. \nVirtually every U.S. court makes the child's best interests, \nparticularly personal safety, the top priority when deciding child \ncustody cases. But what if a judge or jury had a bias against an \nunpopular or misunderstood religion? Might a court find that being \nraised in a particular faith was not in the child's best interests, \npossibly even dangerous?\u0014\nPersonal and societal prejudices often come into play in custody \nbattles. Court decisions in cases involving religion have varied \nwidely, depending upon differing state laws and the personal opinions \nof judges and jurors.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeborah Baxtrom is a freelance writer living in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia.\u0014",

    "title": "5 AND A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRLS KILL 3-YEAR-OLD SISTER",
    "words": "Death at a Very Early Age\u0014\nIs it a crime when a 5- and a 6-year-old suffocate a 3-year-old?\u0014\n\u0014\nBY ANDREW MURR AND KAREN SPRINGEN\u0014\n\u0014\nTHOUGH STILL IN DIAPERS, 3-year-old Damion Stuffier knew enough to \nwriggle free when his older sister and a friend pushed his face down \ninto a muddy puddle in the yard of their grandmother's house. But \nthen his sister, who was only 6 herself, and the friend, a year \nyounger, tried another approach. As investigators say the girls told \nthem in Blythe, Calif., last week, one of the girls ran back to the \nhouse and came out with a pillow. They put the pillow over Damion's \nface. Then while one girl straddled the boy, the other sat on the \npillow until he stopped struggling. A few minutes later, the boy's \nfather, Gerald Stiffler, 33, arrived and sent his 12-year-old \ndaughter to look for Damion. She found him in the mud, with the \npillow still covering his face, and ran with him back into the house. \nDamion was dead before he reached the hospital, a little after 11 \no'clock on a hot Sunday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the case got less attention than the killing of first grader \nKayla Rolland by a classmate in Mt. Morris Township, Mich., last \nspring, it raised the same question for the criminal-justice system: \nwas this a prosecutable crime? On the one hand, the Riverside County \nSheriff's office was carrying the case as a murder by suffocation. \nAfter talking to the girls, investigators concluded they intended to \nkill Damion with the pillow, according to a spokesman. We don't \nreally have a motive, he added. To see these cute little girls tell \nthat awful storywas chilling, Investigator Kent Krisell told \nNEWSWEEK. On the other hand, there was little question of actually \ncharging, much less trying or punishing, the two girls. Under \nCalifornia law, children younger than 14 can be charged only if there \nis clear proof that at the time of committing the act... they [knew] \nits wrongfulness? The girls, says District Attorney Grover Trask, are \njust too young. The criminal-justice system is not prepared to do \nanything with kids 5 or 6 years old.\u0014\nGrandmother Mary Stiffler says, They got to playing too rough, [and] \nit got out of hand. That's in line with the thinking of \nchild-development experts, who contend that children of that age \ncannot even understand the irreversibility of killing. They would \nknow they had done something wrong, says Dr. Barbara Howard, a \ndevelopmental behavioral specialist at Johns Hopkins, but they \nwouldn't get how bad it is, that if they killed the baby, it was gone \nforever? But Howard also draws a distinction between what the girls \ndid and the killing o fKayla, who was shot to death by a classmate \n(who is now in foster care). It's easy to shoot someone, she points \nout. To suffocate a 3-year-old would not be easy. These children had \nenough anger to suffocate a child who would have put up a flght.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd such anger, Howard adds, is usually found only in children who \nhave been harmed themselveseither purposefully, neglectfully or \nvicariously, by witnessing violence to others. Last month Damion's \nmother, Sophia, filed for divorce from Gerald Stiffler, asserting in \ncourt papers that in five years of marriage we have never been able \nto get along together ... Respondent has physically abused me \nforthepast nineyears on and off Stuffier says that his wife's abuse \ncharges are exaggerated. But he also has two minor drug convictions \nand was ordered last year to attend a one-year domestic-violence \nprogram. His mother, Mary Stuffier, in whose home Damion and at least \nfive other children were staying when Damion was killed, was arrested \nin June on drug allegations and was free on bail. The adults who were \npresent can't be charged with homicide, but officials are exploring \nchild-endangerment charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe home itself is a ramshackle frame housewhich has been \nexpandedwith the addition of a dusty Airstream trailer in the yard. \nItsitsontheedgeofBlythe, asunbaked farming town and gas stop. Five of \nthe children who were living there, including the 5-year-old who \nallegedly helped kill Damion, were taken into custody by \nchild-welfare officials. But the Stuffier children were still there \nlast week, while a variety of agencies are working with Mr. Stuffier \nand his children to devise a course of therapy and care that will \nbenefit them, according to Dennis Boyle, who heads the county \nsocial-services agency. That includes the 6-year-old sister, \nsweet-looking with a brown pageboy. She came out, alongwith several \nchildren and an aunt, to meet a NEWSWEEK reporter last week. Without \nsaying hello, she kicked the reporter in the shins.\t\u0014",

    "title": "\"WIVES, BE SUBJECT?\"",
    "words": "Wives, Be Subject?\u0014\nby Frances Taylor Gench\u0014\nProfessor of New Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring my teenage years, I began to find myself deeply insulted by \nwhat I thought at the time to be Paul's view of women  appalled that \na number of his statements on this subject had found their way into \nmy Bible. I didn't care to read in First Corinthians that it is \nshameful for women to speak in church gatherings; nor was I pleased \nto hear Corinthian men advised that it is well for a man not to \ntouch a woman. Neither was I fond of First Timothy, which commands \nthat no woman is to teach or to have authority over men. Rather, \nwomen are to be silent and submissive, and to earn their salvation by \nbearing children. So much for just ifi cation by grace through faith \nalone!\u0014\n\u0014\nMy solution to this problem was simply to take my magic marker and \nclearly X these portions out of my Bible. But even that did not \nsuffice for Ephesians 5: Wives, be subject to your husbands as you \nare to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife just as \nChrist is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior. \nJust as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, \nin everything, to their husbands. When I came to Ephesians 5,1 got \nout the scissors. These were words that had to be excised from my \npersonal canon of scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-five years later, I find myself at a different place. By no \nmeans do I find myself endeared to Ephesians 5, but theological \neducation has mellowed me considerably, and I no longer perform \nradical surgery on the canon. For one thing, I find myself reconciled \nto the apostle Paul who turns out not to have penned this text (or 1 \nTimothy) and who was also more of an advocate for the freedom and \nequality of all people in Christ than I had imagined! What's more, I \ncan now admit that even Ephesians 5 deserves at least a grudging \nmeasure of my respect.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am now aware that the author of Ephesians, writing toward the end \nof the first century, sought to bring Paul's legacy to bear in \ndifficult new situations that Paul himself could not have foreseen. \nPaul had anticipated Christ's imminent arrival and felt sure that the \nstructures of this world were passing away. But there they were \nChristian husbands, wives, children,\u0014\nslaves still hanging around at the end of the first century. It \nappeared that they were going to be around much longer than Paul had \nexpected. How were they to live as Christians in a world that was not \nquickly passing away?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is for this reason that we find household codes in Ephesians 56 \nand in other New Testament epistles  tables of household duties for \nhusbands, wives, children, and slaves. Such passages begin to suggest \nconcretely how Christians are to be faithful to the gospel in the \nmidst of ongoing social responsibilities, and direct Christians to \nlive within the social structures of the world and there to express \nlove and obedience.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can appreciate this effort to discern how Christian faith shapes \nlife at its most intimate and critical points. So Ephesians 5 now \nstands undefiled in my NRSV. Moreover, I can now appreciate how \nremarkable, even startling, these words may have sounded to \nfirst-century ears. The opening sentences, to be sure, were anything \nbut startling: Wives, be subject to your husbands ... the husband is \nthe head of the wife. This was the norm in the first-century world. \nBut what was startlingly new was the threefold command to Christian \nhusbands to love, rather than dominate, their wives: love her (v. \n25), love her (v. 28), love her (v. 33)! And Christian husbands \nwere to make no mistake about what that means. Love is defined by \nJesus Christ. Husbands are to love their wives, as Christ loved the \nchurch and gave himself up for her. That is, the husband must spare \nnothing, not even his own life if need be, in concern and care for \nhis wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, the author of Ephesians admonishes Christian husbands not \nto stand on their secular prerogatives, but to join their wives in \nmutual submission out of reverence for Christ (v. 21). These are \nremarkable words in their first-century context. Indeed, no more \nelevated,\u0014\npositive description of marriage is found in all of Christian \nliterature than at the end of Ephesians 5, where the author, grasping \nat metaphors, suggests that the mystery at the heart of marriage is a \nprofound one  one that mirrors the very mystery of the love that \nexists between Christ and the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, let me hasten to assure you that Ephesians 5 was not \nread at my wedding! Yes, it does now command my respect, but not my \naffection. How could it, when it continues to provide countless \npeople with theological legitimation for a first-century patriarchal \npattern of wifely subordination! After all, the relation between \nChrist and the church, which the author uses to provide a parallel to \nmarriage, is not a relationship between equals. As the church is \nsubordinate to Christ, so (according to the author) is the wife \ncalled to be subordinate to her husband in everything. Neither does \nthe text address husband and wife as equals, for while the Christian \nhusband is addressed in terms of love, the Christian wife is \naddressed in terms of respect and submission. The author modifies his \npatriarchal context in remarkable ways, but the first-century \ncultural pattern remains reflected in the text, combined now with a \ntheology of Christ and the church and thus theologically legitimated. \nAs a result, Ephesians 5 has served through the ages to reinforce \ncultural norms in ways that I suspect its author never intended.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, Ephesians 5 has proved hazardous to women's health. Those \nwho minister among the battered bear witness that this is a difficult \ntext for abused women who are struggling to find self-respect and \nsome control over their lives.(1)  When the author advised Christian \nwomen to be subject to their husbands, he was by no means exhorting \nsubjection to physical violence. However, the text has often been \ninterpreted in ways that have made Christian women more susceptible \nto violence, and may have heightened the likelihood that battered \nwomen will remain in abusive relationships longer than they should.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, shouldn't we get out the scissors? Some would say that we need to \ndo radical surgery on the canon and that we need to start right here. \nBut on most days I would maintain that Ephesians 5 has a place in the \ncanon, and in fact a word for us today  whether we are single or \nmarried, male or female, straight or gay. For wherever we live and \nwork, whatever our circumstances might be, Ephesians 5 reminds us \nthat Christian faith does affect the structures of our lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us have families, whether we live under the same roof with \nthem or not, and sometimes we share the sentiment of the cynic who \nsaid, God gives us our relatives  thank God we can choose our \nfriends. Life together in families is not always easy, for there are \nno perfect parents, no perfect partners, no perfect children, no \nperfect in-laws. It stretches and strains us, and is one of the best \nchances God gives us to grow out of ourselves and into something more \nnearly like that which we were meant to be. Thus, like the first \ngeneration of Christians, we too try to discern the ways in which \nChristian faith shapes and transforms our lives at this most intimate \nand critical point how within our relationships with our partners, \nour parents, our children, or our siblings we can best love one \nanother, forgive one another, and live in service to one another \nafter the manner of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many of us, that discernment also includes life together in a \nseminary community or in Christian congregations. Most of us would \nprobably attest that our churches are not angel factories, any more \nthan is Union-PSCE! In fact, sometimes as we experience the reality \nof life in Christian community, we empathize with the little girl who \nwas asked by her Sunday school teacher if she wanted to go to heaven \nand replied, Not if all these people are going to be there. \nSometimes we realize that the commandment to love one another to love \nthose within the Christian community  is perhaps one of the most \ndifficult things Jesus asked us to do. But sometimes, despite \nourselves, are we not also reminded of the power of Jesus Christ to \ntransform our life together in Christian communityas we are \nempowered to be gracious to each other, to forgive one another, to \nreally listen to each other and disagree in love, and to embrace our \ndifferences, our diversity as a gift?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all these reasons, I would urge you not to run for your scissors. \nTo be sure, Ephesians 5 has had an unfortunate history, and I still \ndon't like it. But I trust that we can continue to be instructed by \nthe underlying concerns and commitments it reveals. For as we come \nbefore this text, it is the new community that we see envisioned \nhere, however imperfectly  engaged in acts of discernment that we \ncontinue in our time and place, however imperfectly.(2)  We see faith \nbeing enacted in love, and love seeking to effect its transforming \npower in the midst of this age. We even see remarkable, if halting, \nefforts to reform the structures of life together in the light of \nChrist's all-inclusive love  inclusive efforts in which we too \npersevere as a church reformed, always reforming (though sometimes \nhaltingly as well) as we continue on our way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe God made known to us in Jesus Christ continues to empower us to \ntransform the structures before us and to discern the ways in which \nwe can serve one another in this time and place. And ever before us \nis Jesus' cross  the perfect demonstration of self-giving love  the \nmanner in which we are to love one another, whether as members of \nfamilies, or as members together in Christian communities and in the \nbody of Christ. So let us rejoice, knowing that neither sin, nor \ndeath, nor institutions, nor structures, nor any aspect of our lives \ntogether can escape the transforming power of God's love for us in \nJesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n1 Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, Every Two Minutes: Battered Women and \nFeminist Interpretation, in Feminist Interpretation of the Bible, \ned.

    "title": "\"BIBLE CODES\"  ARE THEY REALLY THERE?",
    "words": "A Cracked Code\u0014\n\u0014\nQUESTION:\u0014\n . Are the Bible codes that are supposed to be discernable in the \nOld Testament really there? \u0014\nLorna Macintosh, Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not the form of the Scriptures or the sequence\u0014\nof its letters that conveys its truth,\u0014\nbut rather the content of the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nANSWER:\u0014\n \u0014\nMichael Drosnin's 1997 book, \"The Bible Code,\" and several later \nworks on the same\u0014\ntheme claim that there are secret linguistic codes in the Bible that \nconvey astonishing predictions about events that have happened long \nafter the Bible was written. These predictions include Watergate, the \nOklahoma city bombing, Yitzak Rabin's assassination, and Princess \nDi's death. Fascinating stuff but worthy of your skepticism because \nof the following problems:\u0014\n\u0014\nQgirky methods. The supposed codes are found by eliminating spaces \nbetween words, providing a string of letters that are then subjected \nto computer searches. This equidistant letter sequence (ELs) \nmethodology can mean skipping a few letters or words, or even a few \nhundred letters or words, to find hidden words. One search, for \nexample, used every fiftieth letter in the first chapter of Genesis \nto find the word Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Hebrew is written in a right-to-left direction, the \nresearchers also looked in the opposite direction to find many of the \nsecret codes. Which raises the question: Were these secret messages \nencoded both for those who have Hebrew as their primary language as \nwell as those whose languages, like English, read left to right?\u0014\n\u0014\nA deeper problem with Drosnin's methodology lies in the fact that we \ndo not possess the original copies of the Hebrew Bible, only copies \nmade many generations after the original authors wrote. At the level \nof lettering and words, these copies contain scribal variations that \nhave accumulated through the recopying of the texts. Drosnin and the \nothers must assume that the text they use has no scribal changes, \nerrors, or variation of word order. While Drosnin claims to use a \nuniversally accepted original Hebrew text as the basis for his \ncomputer searches, in fact no such text exists. Furthermore, as even \northodox Jewish scholars remind us, the most ancient texts themselves \ncome to us with numerous ancient emendations suggested in the margins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd one more problem: more often than not, vowels were not used in \nthe original Hebrew words. This means Drosnin often uses a text that \nhas the missing vowels supplied. So one wonders: who\u0014\nhas created the secret codes  the writers of the Hebrew, or \nDrosnin himself?\u0014\n\u0014\nDeliberate mistranslations. In an article in Bible Review (August \n1997), Ronald Hendel found that Drosnin and his fellow researchers \nused deliberate mistranslations in order to produce some of their \nstartling findings. One example: The words after the death of \nAbraham in Genesis 25:11 are rendered after the death of the Prime \nMinister (that is, Rabin). This result seems to have been arrived at \nby dividing into two words a particular Hebrew word even non-Hebrew \nscholars recognize: ab and raham.\u0014\n\u0014\n False representations. Drosnin claims that Yitzak Rabin's very name \ncan be found in a line in Deuteronomy. However, to find Rabin's name, \nhe uses an ELS of 4,772 letters (taking one letter each from \nDeuteronomy 2:33, 4:42, 7:20, 11:1, 13:11, 17:5, 21:5, and 24:5). But \nno single lines of text in the scrolls of the Hebrew Bible are 4,772 \nletters long. Thus when Drosnin provides Rabin's name spelled out on \nwhat appears to be one line on one page, this is deceptive. In \nreality, it would be more like one letter on the first page, the next \nletter on page 10, and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reality is that if you use the ELS method and apply it to any \nsufficiently long text, you can come up with names and messages of \nall sortsyou just need to keep trying different distances between \nletters and different directions until you get lucky. Brendan McKay, \na mathematician in Australia, applied the ELS method to Herman \nMelville's Moby Dick and found predicted the assassinations of Gandhi \nand Nicaraguan president Somoza, among others.\u0014\nThe Bible code theory may seem appealing at first glance  here we \nhave further scientific proof of the divine character of the Old \nTestament! Alas, there is a stinger in the tail. When the theory is \nshown to be bankrupt, it simply further discredits the Bible in the \nminds of those already prone to be skeptical. Martin Luther once drew \nan analogy between the rough-hewn manger and the baby within it and \nthe rough hewn Bible and its divine contents. It is an apt analogy. \nIt is not the form of the Scriptures or the sequence of its letters \nthat conveys its truth, but rather the content of the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne can prove a lot of things by statistics that, in fact, aren't \ntrue at all. In the end, the Bible does not need a Bible code \ndefense. As Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin, is credited \nwith saying, Defend the Bible? I'd as soon defend a lion.

    "title": "\"FIZZIT, MOMMY\"",
    "words": "A friend of mine recently shared a little \"parable in real \u0014\nlife\" that God sent her several years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen Cici's son was quite small, he had a small stuffed \u0014\ngorilla that he wagged around with him everywhere -- and I do mean \u0014\nEVERYWHERE -- he went.  She could sometimes sneak it away for a quick \u0014\nlaundering during nap time, but Heaven help her if her son awoke \u0014\nbefore his friend \"Rilla\" was out of the dryer!  As such '\"loveys\" \u0014\nwill do, Rilla's seams gradually began to weaken and his stuffing \u0014\nbegan to leak.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAs  Cici tells it, \"Poor old Rilla was in desperate need of \u0014\nsome corrective surgery, not to mention a stuffing transplant.  One \u0014\nday, John waddled up to me and held up his battered, beloved Rilla \u0014\nand said, 'Mommy, Rilla's broked.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\"I explained that I would be happy to fix Rilla up -- a \u0014\nlittle new stuffing, some seam reinforcement, and he would be 'all \u0014\nbetter' again.  John held Rilla out toward me, and said 'Fizzit, \u0014\nMommy!'  But, when I reached down to take the little gorilla in my \u0014\nhands, I found that it had a two-year-old firmly attached to it.  As \u0014\nall parents know, a tug-of-war with a two-year-old is frequently a \u0014\nlosing proposition, and is ALWAYS accompanied by loud cries and \u0014\ncopious tears.  Finally, in exasperation, I said, 'I can't fix it \u0014\nuntil you let go of it!!!'  And just at that moment, the Spirit of \u0014\nGod tapped me on the shoulder, as it were -- and I realized that God \u0014\nwas waiting for me to let go of several things, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\"This is one aspect of Christianity that I suspect will \u0014\nalways be a struggle for many of us-- \"tis not I, but Christ liveth \u0014\nin me\".  It's so hard for us to get out of his way and let him \u0014\n\"fizzit\" in his own good time, because we're living in the present \u0014\nmoment and He is living in eternity,\" Cici concluded.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWaiting on the Lord, whether it is for healing, for \u0014\nunderstanding, or a much needed job, is not an easy task.  But, I \u0014\ntruly believe it is essential for all of us to trust Him and be as \u0014\npatient with Him as He is with us.\u0014",

    "title": "'THE WILL OF GOD?\"",
    "words": "There is a blanket explanation that is used to explain everything \nfrom a\u0014\ntoothache to an earthquake. At one time or another it has been \nuttered by\u0014\nthe lips of every person here: \"the will of God.\" No matter how \nhorrible the\u0014\nevent may have been, some are content to say that it must have been \nthe will\u0014\nof God. For some reason, people find comfort in their losses if they \ncan\u0014\nexplain the car wreck and the heart attack and the factory closing as \nbeing\u0014\nthe will of God. Who knows, maybe those things are the will of God, \nbut if\u0014\nthey are then we are left to explain why a loving God wills for those \nbad\u0014\nthings to happen.\u0014\n\u0014\nA number of people mistakenly refer to Harold Kushner's best-selling \nbook as\u0014\nWhy Bad Things Happen to Good People. That's the question everybody \nwants\u0014\nanswered, but that is not the title of Kushner's book. Nor is that \nthe point\u0014\nof his book. The correct title of the book is When Bad Things Happen \nto Good\u0014\nPeople. Isn't that the best we can do? We can spend years wondering \nwhy, but\u0014\nit is beyond human capacity to make sense of most tragedies. We can \ntry our\u0014\nbest to explain evil, but most of it is beyond explanation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother way to deal with evil is to eliminate it altogether. It sounds\u0014\nimpossible, but there are folks working around the clock trying to \nrid our\u0014\ncommunities and world of evil. Various levels of government \nconstantly are\u0014\nproviding resources and services to ease human suffering. Vaccines \nare given\u0014\nto young children to guard against crippling and even fatal diseases.\u0014\nNutritional supplements are made available to people of different \nages and\u0014\nbackgrounds to help maintain good health. Federal officials negotiate \nwith\u0014\nother countries with the hope that war and unnecessary devastation \nmight be\u0014\nprevented.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are working in other ways to eliminate evil in all its \nmanifestations. Tremendous amounts of money are devoted to research \nwith the hope that cures to our most dreaded diseases will be found. \nAll sorts of technological developments may point the way to a better \nquality of life for us all. Educational programs are geared to equip \nus with the knowledge necessary to deal with everything from crime in \nour communities to adopting a healthier diet. Progress is being made \nin encouraging and producing better\u0014\ncitizenship. A lot of evil is eliminated when people resolve their \nconflicts in a civil way. Every time anger is channeled in a positive \nway, evil is curbed. Every time groups handle their differences of \nopinion in a mature way, possible acts of evil are averted.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvil not only comes when the hurricane trashes a town or the x-ray \nreveals\u0014\nbad news. We recognize evil in the abusive parent and the manipulative\u0014\nfriend and the irresponsible spouse. Despite our best efforts, we are \nnot\u0014\ngoing to eliminate all the evil around us, or even within us. We don't\u0014\nalways agree on how we should tackle certain problems. Some people \ncontinue\u0014\nto benefit from the evil in the world and they are not likely to work \nto\u0014\nturn things around. Evil persists in such a magnitude that \neliminating it\u0014\nseems very unlikely. The problems are numerous, the suffering is \ngreat, and\u0014\nthe sources are so uncontrollable that we will never eliminate evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, we can't explain evil and we can't eliminate it. What now? The \nonly\u0014\nanswer that we have for this problem of evil is to work around it. \nIt's the\u0014\nonly solution we have ever had.\u0014",

    "words": "CALVIN COLLEGE -   German Propaganda widely distributed\u0014\n                                                                \u0014\n\u0014\n Background: The following editorial by Ernst Hiemer comes from Der \nStrmer, Julius\u0014\n Streicher's anti-Semitic weekly. Hiemer was Streicher's second in \ncommand. The essay\u0014\n makes the claim that hatred against the Jews is a holy obligation \nfor Germans. Note too the claim that all Jews are alike, that each \nshares an identical hatred of Gentiles.\u0014\n\u0014\n The Source: Ernst Hiemer, \"Der heilige Ha,\" Der Strmer, #18/1943.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                          The Holy Hate\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             Ernst Hiemer\u0014\n\u0014\n One is overcome with horror upon reading the history of the Jews, as \nfor example in an\u0014\n unabbreviated and unfalsified version of the Old Testament. One \nfeels horror at the unique\u0014\n depravity of the Jews, at the crimes they have committed, at the \ndevilish hate they have from\u0014\n the beginning directed against all those who did not want to bow to \nthe yoke of Pan-Jewry! This\u0014\n horror becomes terror when one reads the rabbinical writings and \nreads such outbursts of\u0014\n Jewish rage as one finds in the Talmud Schulchan-Aruch. There it is \nwritten:\u0014\n\u0014\n                             From Mr. Sinai:\u0014\n\u0014\n      What does Sinai mean? Sinai is the mountain on which Moses \nreceived\u0014\n      the Jewish laws from the God Jahwe. From this mountain, the \nhatred of\u0014\n      the Jews against all other peoples of the world has spread. \n(Schabbath,\u0014\n      89a)\u0014\n\u0014\n      Every Jew has the obligation to see that Christian churches are \nburned\u0014\n      down and wiped out. The faithful must be insulted and the \nclergy killed.\u0014\n      (Schulchan Aruch, Jore dea, 146, 14)\u0014\n\u0014\n      The Gentile is human shit. He is just as unclean. (Orach \nChajim, 55, 20).\u0014\n\u0014\n That is what the \"holy\" books of the Jews say. Every Jew, regardless \nof whether he lives in\u0014\n Germany or America, whether he speaks Russian or Spanish, whether he \nlives in the ghetto or\u0014\n on Wall Street, thinks and feels as the Talmud commands him. The \nterm \"Old Testament\u0014\n hatred\" expresses the deep antipathy Jews feel toward Gentiles. \nDespite its inferiority, Jewry\u0014\n was able to survive over the millennia because of its satanic hatred \nagainst Gentiles.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jewish hatred today is as strong as it ever was. He who does not \nsubmit is their enemy. The\u0014\n Jew hates the enemy with all his heart and with all the strength of \nhis satanic soul. One needs\u0014\n only to recall the bitter rage Jews have always shown against those \nwho have attempted to\u0014\n rouse the Gentile nations to battle against their deadly enemy by \nrevealing the Jew as the Devil\u0014\n in human form. Following the old method, these men are defeated bit \nby bit until they are finally\u0014\n disposed of. The Jews systematically destroyed their honor and \ncleverly robbed them of their\u0014\n possessions until they suddenly died a \"natural death.\" We must \nleave to future historians the\u0014\n task of explaining how many of the \"heart attacks,\" \"suicides\" and \nother such causes of death\u0014\n for many opponents of the Jews were really the work of eternal \nJewish hatred. Things will be\u0014\n revealed that we do not even suspect today.\u0014\n\u0014\n Deep and boundless hatred is an essential characteristic of Jewry. \nIt is rooted in the Devil's\u0014\n blood of the Jews and can only be distantly understood by the other \npeoples of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n Still, it is our duty to learn from history. Gentiles, above all the \nGermans, were always too\u0014\n \"decent\" and \"objective\" to respond to Jewish hatred in the same or \nat least similar way. As a\u0014\n people of \"poets and thinkers,\" we thought it beneath our dignity to \nrespond with the same\u0014\n methods. We were not able even to make clear to the public the filth \nand depravity of our\u0014\n enemy. We were so \"sensitive\" that we avoided fighting the Jewish \ncreature.\u0014\n\u0014\n Now there is war! The Jews forced us into a struggle for life and \ndeath. The war has forced us to\u0014\n give up much we formerly thought was necessary. It has also forced \nus to give up the\u0014\n \"politeness\" that in reality is a weakness. A boxer in the ring must \nuse his fists to defend\u0014\n himself against his opponent. A fencer can only win when he uses his \nsword. We as a people\u0014\n will survive this war only if we eliminate weakness and \"politeness\" \nand respond to the Jews\u0014\n with an equal hatred. We must always keep in mind what the Jew wants \ntoday, and what he\u0014\n plans to do with us. If we do not oppose the Jews with the entire \nenergy of our people, we are\u0014\n lost. But if we can use the full force of our soul that has been \nreleased by the National Socialist\u0014\n revolution, we need not fear the future. The devilish hatred of the \nJews plunged the world into\u0014\n war, need and misery. Our holy hate will bring us victory and save \nall of mankind.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \u0014\n\u0014\n      [Translation copyright  1998 by Randall L. Bytwerk]\u0014",

Stanley stayed with Livingstone for five \nmonths and then went off to England to write his bestseller, How I \nFound Livingstone. Livingstone, in the meantime, got lost againin a \nswamp literally up to his neck. Within a year and a half, he died in \na mud hut, kneeling beside his cot in prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His African friends, former slaves he had \nfreed, buried his heart under an mpundu tree 70 miles from the shore \nof  Lake Bangweulu. Then they carried his body back to his own \npeople, an 11-month journey through equatorial jungle and open seas. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      All Britain wept. The whole civilized world \nwept. They gave him a 21-gun salute and a hero's funeral among the \nsaints in Westminster Abbey. BROUGHT BY FAITHFUL HAND OVER LAND AND \nSEA, his tombstone reads, DAVID LIVINGSTONE: MISSIONARY, TRAVELLER, \nPHILANTHROPIST.  FOR THIRTY YEARS HIS LIFE WAS SPENT IN AN UNWEARIED \nEFFORT TO EVANGELIZE THE NATIVE\u0014\nRACES, TO EXPLORE THE UNDISCOVERED SECRETS AND ABOLISH THE SLAVE \nTRADE. He was\u0014\nMother Teresa, Neil Armstrong, and Abraham Lincoln rolled into one. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the century and a quarter since his death, \nno missionary/explorer has been more constructed, deconstructed, \npsychoanalyzed (\"a congenital manic depressive,\" says one scholar), \nand turned into a stained-glass saint. There are well over 100 books \nabout him, and African cities bear his name. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He was such an important figure that the \nhistory of southern Africa can be divided into B.L. (Before \nLivingstone) and A.L. (After Livingstone). When he arrived in 1841, \nAfrica was as exotic as outer space, called the \"Dark Continent\" and \nthe \"White Man's Graveyard.\" Although the Portuguese, Dutch, and \nEnglish were pushing into the interior, African maps had blank \nunexplored areasno roads, no countries, no landmarks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone helped redraw the maps, exploring \nwhat are now a dozen countries, including South Africa, Rwanda, \nAngola, and the Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). He is the \nstuff of legend, indeed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But what can we presume about Livingstone \ntoday? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Latin on the run\u0014\n                      Livingstone's birth became the foundation of \nthe legend: he was born on March 19, 1813, in the grimy industrial \ntown of Blantyre, eight miles from Glasgow. His family (parents Neil \nand Agnes, two brothers, and two sisters) lived in a one-room \ntenement. The central figure of his childhood was grandfather Neil \n(senior), who entranced the boy with stories of the olden days. (He \nhad been a tenant farmer who had been evicted from Ulva, an island \noff the west coast of Scotland. Starting in the 1700s, the \nAnglo-Scottish gentry deliberately depopulated the countryside by \nevicting a million Scots, replacing them with vast sheep farms.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Key discovery. Livingstone was less impressed\u0014\n                      with many of his early discoveries than he was\u0014\n                      with this one: that central Africa contained a\u0014\n                      vast network of rivers, which could become a\u0014\n                      key to stopping the slave trade. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When David was a child, his father started\u0014\n                      his own business as a door-to-door tea\u0014\n                      salesman, so the room was constantly\u0014\n                      fragrant with the smell of tea. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At age 10, David went to work in the\u0014\n                      cotton mill, clambering under gigantic,\u0014\n                      steam-driven machines to fix broken\u0014\n                      threads. After 14 hours of labor that exhausted \nmost children, Livingstone attended classes for another two hours.\u0014\n                      He was so entranced with books that he spent \nhis first pay on a Latin grammar. He propped the book on a\u0014\n                      machine, and each time he passed it, he read a \nline or two. In this way, he managed to learn Latin and Greek, and\u0014\n                      plowed through Virgil, Horace, and a stack of \ntheological tomes. His father, a Calvinist Congregationalist who\u0014\n                      distributed tracts as he sold tea, disapproved \nof \"trashy novels\" (a title he bestowed on any nonreligious \nliterature)\u0014\n                      and science books. The only escapism David was \nallowed were travel books like Robinson Crusoe. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though his father condemned science as ungodly, \nDavid's life was changed by the writings of Thomas Dick, an\u0014\n                      eccentric Scottish theologian and amateur \nastronomer who proclaimed both science and religion revealed the\u0014\n                      complexities of God's world. After reading one \nbook, Livingstone later wrote, \"Immediately I accepted salvation\u0014\n                      by Christ and vowed to devote my life to his \nservice.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two years later, after reading an appeal from \nKarl Gtzlaff (see Hudson Taylor, issue 52 of Christian History ,\u0014\n                      page 35) for medical missionaries to China, \nLivingstone seized the opportunity. Not only could he merge scientific\u0014\n                      study and Christian service, he could also \nappease his father, who would not let him become a doctor unless it\u0014\n                      was for a religious purpose. At age 23, with no \nformal education, he registered in Anderson's College in Glasgow,\u0014\n                      where he studied medicine, theology, and \nscience. A year later, he applied to the interdenominational London\u0014\n                      Missionary Society (LMS). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By then, however, the door to China was slammed \nshut by the Opium War, leaving Livingstone looking for a new\u0014\n                      mission frontier. Within six months, he met \nRobert Moffat, a veteran missionary of southern Africa, who\u0014\n                      enchanted him with tales of his remote station, \nglowing in the morning sun with \"the smoke of a thousand villages\u0014\n                      where no missionary had been before.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Animal pleasure of traveling\"\u0014\n                      The newly ordained medical doctor set out for \nSouth Africa in December 1840, little realizing he would be gone\u0014\n                      16 years. The voyage, via Brazil, was so rough \nthe little sailing ship was tossed like \"a ship in a fit of epilepsy.\"\u0014\n                      Three months later, he arrived in Cape Town, \nthe main British colony, and set out immediately in an ox cart for\u0014\n                      Robert Moffat's station in Kuruman, 600 miles \nnorth. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      LIVINGSTONE'S TURF. Much of Livingstone's early \ntravels (1841-1856) took place along the Zambezi River. In his last\u0014\n                      journeys, Livingstone explored the area just \nnorth of Lake Tanganyika (top center). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After 25 years of patient work, Moffat had \ncreated a miniature Zion on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. He had\u0014\n                      built a dam and planted fruit trees. With its \nstone church and neat rows of houses, Kuruman was reminiscent of a\u0014\n                      village in Scotland. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unfortunately the \"smoke of a thousand \nvillages\" was an exaggeration. Moffat had fewer than 40 converts, \nhalf of\u0014\n                      whom were backsliders, and the surrounding area \nwas as unpopulated as the Scottish Highlands. Livingstone was\u0014\n                      disappointed at the prospects. Within a month, \naccompanied by a fellow missionary, Livingstone made his first of\u0014\n                      three exploratory tours, 500 miles northeast \ninto southern Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For ten years, Livingstone tried to be a \nconventional missionary. He opened a string of stations in \"the \nregions\u0014\n                      beyond,\" where he settled down to station life, \nteaching school and superintending the garden. After four years of\u0014\n                      bachelor life, he married the boss's daughter, \nMary Moffat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      From the beginning, Livingstone showed signs of \nrestlessness. After his only convert decided to return to\u0014\n                      polygamy, Livingstone felt more called than \never to explore. \"The mere animal pleasure of traveling in a wild\u0014\n                      unexplored country is very great,\" he wrote. \n\"Brisk exercise imparts elasticity to the muscles, fresh and healthy\u0014\n                      blood circulates through the brain, the mind \nworks well, the eye is clear, the step is firm.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During his first term in South Africa, \nLivingstone made some of the most prodigiousand most\u0014\n                      dangerousexplorations of the nineteenth \ncentury. His object was to open a \"Missionary Road\"\"God's\u0014\n                      Highway,\" he also called it1,500 miles north \ninto the interior. In 1849 his team became the first recorded\u0014\n                      Europeans to reach Lake Nagami, \"the lake \nbeyond the [Kalahari] desert,\" earning him a gold medal from the\u0014\n                      Royal Geographical Society. He was accompanied \nby William Cotton Oswell, a wealthy soldier and big-game\u0014\n                      hunter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On many of these early trips he took his wife. \nMary was born in Africa and was used to the hardships of pioneer\u0014\n                      missionariesbut not the sort of hardships \nLivingstone would put her through. Her newborn baby died after they\u0014\n                      had wandered through the Kalahari Desert for a \nmonth with limited water. In 1852, after seven years of marriage,\u0014\n                      Livingstone escorted Mary and the children to \nCape Town, his first visit to \"civilization\" in 11 years. He put them\u0014\n                      on the boat to Britain, and did not see them \nagain for four years. (Though often separated from her husband for\u0014\n                      years at a time, Mary gave birth to six \nchildren in their 17 years of marriage.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On these early journeys, Livingstone's \ninterpersonal quirks were already apparent. He had the singular \ninability to\u0014\n                      get along with other Westerners. He fought with \nmissionaries, fellow explorers, assistants, and (later) his brother\u0014\n                      Charles. He held grudges for years. He had the \ntemperament of a book-reading loner, emotionally inarticulate\u0014\n                      except when he exploded with Scottish rage. He \nheld little patience for the attitudes of missionaries with\u0014\n                      \"miserably contracted minds\" who had absorbed \n\"the colonial mentality\" regarding the natives. When Livingstone\u0014\n                      spoke out against racial intolerance, white \nAfrikaners tried to drive him out, burning his station and stealing \nhis\u0014\n                      animals. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though alienated from the whites, the natives \nloved his common touch, his rough paternalism, and his curiosity.\u0014\n                      They also thought he might protect them or \nsupply them with guns. More than most Europeans, Livingstone talked\u0014\n                      to them with respect, Scottish laird to African \nchief. Some explorers took as many as 150 porters when they\u0014\n                      traveled; Livingstone traveled with 30 or \nfewer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After Livingstone sent his family to Scotland, \nhe made an epic, three-year trip from coast to coast, reputedly the\u0014\n                      first European to do so. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"REASONABLE\" AFRICANS. While other\u0014\n                      Europeans beat and berated Africans, Livingstone\u0014\n                      treated his hosts with decorum. Tribes usually\u0014\n                      reciprocated by treating him like a visiting\u0014\n                      dignitary. \"Africans are not by any means\u0014\n                      unreasonable,\" he wrote. \"I think\u0014\n                      unreasonableness is more a heredity disease in\u0014\n                      Europe.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On this trip, he was introduced to the\u0014\n                      1,700-mile-long Zambezi, the twenty-sixth\u0014\n                      longest river in the world. It starts in the\u0014\n                      equatorial jungle of Angola and the Republic\u0014\n                      of the Congo, 600 miles from the Atlantic \nOcean, and bisects the continent. As it cuts through the Rift Valley, \nit\u0014\n                      boils over falls and thunders down cauldrons \ndeeper than the Grand Canyon until it disgorges into the Indian\u0014\n                      Ocean. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During this trip, he reached Victoria Falls, \nhis most awe-inspiring discovery. It was like being back in the mill \nat\u0014\n                      Blantyre, with God's steam machines thundering \nand pulsating, the wild water sending off sparks like \"bits of steel\u0014\n                      when burned in oxygen.\" The scene was \"so \nlovely,\" he later wrote, that it \"must have been gazed upon by angels\u0014\n                      in their flight.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      River of human misery\u0014\n                      Despite its beauty, the Zambezi was a river of \nhuman misery, the original \"heart of darkness.\" It linked the\u0014\n                      Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique, \nthe main suppliers of slaves for Brazil, who in turn sold to Cuba\u0014\n                      and the United States. Women and children, \nprisoners of war, and the survivors of famine were captured in the\u0014\n                      interior and shipped to the coast. Livingstone \nfrequently encountered parties of 50 to 100, chained and shackled,\u0014\n                      each yoked with a handle that extended behind \ntheir backs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone had a number of motives for his \nvast peregrinations. For one, he was planting the British flag,\u0014\n                      extending the borders of the Empirethough the \nBritish government repeatedly told him it had no interest in\u0014\n                      creating African colonies. But in Livingstone's \nmind, if Britain could drive a wedge through the upper Zambezi, it\u0014\n                      would have a chain of colonies up the spine of \nAfrica, from South Africa, through Uganda and the Anglo-Egyptian\u0014\n                      Sudan, clear up to Egypt (which was then a \nBritish protectorate). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone was always on the lookout for \nfertile, well-watered high landwith no tsetse flies or malariawhere\u0014\n                      he could transplant a colony of pious Scot \npeasants. He meticulously recorded the natural resources, coal and\u0014\n                      mineral deposits, forest and animal life, \nanything that might attract settlers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet Livingstone's primary desire was to expose \nthe slave trade and end it by cutting it off at the source. The\u0014\n                      strongest weapon, he believed, was Christian \ncommercial civilization. He hoped to replace the \"inefficient\" slave\u0014\n                      economy with a capitalist economy: buying and \nselling goods, like beeswax and ivory, instead of people. The\u0014\n                      tribes were more than willing to engage in \n\"legitimate commerce.\" In fact, Livingstone partially financed his \ntrips by\u0014\n                      trading goods from one native state to another: \nguns for bronze, bronze for elephant tusks, tusks for slaves (whom\u0014\n                      he escorted to safety and set free), arriving \nat the coast with cart-loads of ivory left over. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Eventually, Livingstone believed, this \nmercantile economy would be transformed into a \"progressive\" \nagricultural\u0014\n                      economy of cotton, coffee, and sugar, and based \non people working for wages. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The queen's cows\u0014\n                      In December 1856, having completed his \ncross-continental journey, wracked by pain and malarial fever, barely\u0014\n                      able to rise from his bed, David Livingstone \narrived in a dispirited England. For three years, the country had been\u0014\n                      mired in the Crimean War, a horrible nightmare \nthat produced the tragedy of the Light Brigade (\"Half a league,\u0014\n                      half a league, half a league onward, all in the \nvalley of Death rode the six hundred.\"). England desperately\u0014\n                      needed heroes, and Livingstone fit the bill. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He was given medals and an honorary doctorate \nfrom Oxford. When he had a private audience with Queen\u0014\n                      Victoria, he delighted her with an amusing \nstory of an African chief who asked, \"If the queen of England is so \nrich,\u0014\n                      how many cows does she have?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seizing the moment, Livingstone wrote his first \nmanifesto, a 400-page book called Missionary Travels and\u0014\n                      Researches in South Africa. It is still an \nimportant source for reconstructing the precolonial history of \nAfrica. It\u0014\n                      was an immediate bestseller, selling 70,000 \ncopies. As historian Timothy Holmes says in Journey to Livingstone\u0014\n                      (1993), it had something for everyone: \"The \nChristian's faith in God is strengthened by the author's very \nsurvival of\u0014\n                      every imaginable danger. The abolitionist is \ninspired by the prospect of stopping the slave trade. Medical men are\u0014\n                      intrigued by Livingstone's approach to disease \nand the value of his treatment for fever.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone made more than 120 times his 100 \nannual LMS salary from the royalties, which he used for his family\u0014\n                      and his expeditions. That was just as well, for \nLivingstone's relations with the lms soured during his furlough. The\u0014\n                      society, though admiring his feats, felt he \nshould take up more settled work, like his father-in-law, Moffat. He\u0014\n                      claimed his explorations were \"missionary \ntravels,\" and he was preparing God's Highway for those who followed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone and the LMSfinally split over his \nrole in a new mission south of the Zambezi. The lms wanted him to\u0014\n                      shepherd the group, but Livingstone would agree \nonly to help the missionaries cross the river. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Through the influence of his friends in the \nscientific and religious communities, the government appointed him\u0014\n                      leader of a \"voyage of discovery upon the \nZambezi,\" at a cost of 5,000. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In March 1858, with the cheers of England \nringing in their ears, the Zambezi Expedition set sail with \nLivingstone,\u0014\n                      his pregnant wife, Mary, and child, his brother \nCharles, two sailors, an engineer, artist, geologist, and a\u0014\n                      doctor/botanist. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They were to navigate upriver in a \nbrass-and-mahogany steamboat (as in the movie The African Queen ), \nfrom\u0014\n                      the mouth to Victoria Falls, a thousand miles \ninland, where they would establish a mission station of the\u0014\n                      Universities Mission to Central Africa ( UMCA). \nAmong their tons of supplies, they carried a prefabricated iron\u0014\n                      house, which they hoped to erect there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Ma Robert(\"Robert's Mother,\" the Makololo's \nname for Mary Livingstone) was state-of-the-art technology\u0014\n                      but proved too frail for the expedition. \nBesides using too much wood, it leaked horribly after repeatedly \nrunning\u0014\n                      aground on sandbars. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Like Moffat's tale of smoke from a thousand \nvillages, Livingstone stretched the truth about the Zambezi to his\u0014\n                      correspondents back home, minimizing the \ndangers and pushing his men beyond human endurance. When they\u0014\n                      reached a 30-foot waterfall, he waved his hand, \nas if to wish it away, and said, \"That's not supposed to be there.\"\u0014\n                      Mary, who had just given birth to her sixth \nchild, died in 1862 beside the river, only one of several lives \nclaimed\u0014\n                      on the voyage. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Abruptly Livingstone changed his plan: the \nUMCAwould establish a colony of freed slaves in the cool, fertile \nvalley\u0014\n                      of the Shire River, believed to be free of \nmalaria. It flows into the Zambezi from Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi),\u0014\n                      the second largest lake in Africa. \nUnfortunately a tribal war was creating havoc in the area, and a \nsevere drought\u0014\n                      and Arab slave traders from the north were \ndepopulating the land. The Zambezi Expedition, a nightmare from the\u0014\n                      beginning, now got worse (see \"The Other \nLivingstone ,\" page 32). Finally in 1864, the British government, \nwhich\u0014\n                      had no interest in \"forcing steamers up \ncataracts,\" recalled Livingstone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Carried through a swamp\u0014\n                      He reached London sick and dispirited but \nbrought himself back into the public eye with his book Narrative of\u0014\n                      an Expedition to the Zambezi and its \nTributaries. \u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nICON.

But more important to Livingstone was \nthe\u0014\n                      possibility of proving that the Bible was true \nby tracing the African roots of Judaism and Christianity. He believed\u0014\n                      ancient Egypt was a black culture connected to \ncentral Africa through the Nile and its tributaries. He drew\u0014\n                      similarities between ancient Coptic and the \nmodern languages of South Africa. \"One of my waking dreams,\" he\u0014\n                      wrote, \"is that the legendary tales about Moses \ncoming up into Inner Ethiopia with Merr, his foster-mother, and\u0014\n                      founding a city which he called in her honor \n'Meroe' may have a substratum of fact.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With no white companions, Livingstone set out \nwith 30 porters, Indian soldiers, boys from a government school\u0014\n                      for freed African slaves, and locally recruited \nmen. They deserted almost immediately, leaving only a few faithful\u0014\n                      servants. Among the faithful were Chuma and \nSusi, whom he had freed ten years before. The deserters spread a\u0014\n                      rumor that Livingstone had been murdered, and \nexpeditions were sent to find him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For two years he simply disappeared, without a \nletter or scrap of information. He reported later that he had been\u0014\n                      so ill he could not even lift a pen, but he was \nable to read the Bible straight through four times. Livingstone's\u0014\n                      disappearance fascinated the public as much as \nAmelia Earhart's a few generations later. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When American journalist Henry Stanley found \nLivingstone, the news exploded in England and America. Papers\u0014\n                      carried special editions devoted to the famous \nmeeting. In August 1872, in precarious health, Livingstone shook\u0014\n                      Stanley's hand and set out on his final \njourney. By October his health was failing. (He would never find the \nsource\u0014\n                      of the Nile, missing it by some 200 miles.) In \nJanuary he had to be carried through a swamp that came up to\u0014\n                      \"Susi's mouth, and wetted my seat and legs. \nWhen [my porter] sank into a deep elephant's footprint, he\u0014\n                      required two to lift him.\" They traveled only a \nmile and a half a day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It is not all pleasure, this exploration,\" he \nwrote. On May 1, 1873, at age 60, Livingstone, who had evaded death\u0014\n                      so many times, finally lost the battle. Chuma \nand Susi, preparing the body for burial, found a blood clot several\u0014\n                      inches long obstructing his small intestine and \nevidence that his death had been hastened by severe hemorrhoidal\u0014\n                      bleeding. They wrapped his body in calico and \ndried it in the sun to preserve it for the long trip back \"home.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Saint of the Empire\u0014\n                      Within ten years, the Africa Livingstone knew \nwas gone forever. One month after his death, the British forced the\u0014\n                      Sultan of Zanzibar to close the largest slave \nmarket on the east coast of Africa. Meanwhile, near Moffat's original\u0014\n                      station of Kuruman, acres of diamonds were \nfoundthe largest gold and diamond deposits in the world. This\u0014\n                      discovery set off the \"scramble for Africa,\" \nand independent African and Afrikaner states were conquered and\u0014\n                      carved into British, Portuguese, French, \nGerman, and Belgian colonies. Under empire builders like Cecil Rhodes,\u0014\n                      after whom Rhodesia was named (now Zambia and \nZimbabwe), and De Boers (the diamond cartel), the British\u0014\n                      were wildly successful, creating colonies from \nSouth Africa to Egypt. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For a generation and more, Livingstone was \"the \nSaint of the British Empire.\" Biographies poured forth and rarely\u0014\n                      mentioned his less congenial traits. The man \nand the legend inspired generations of men and women, like\u0014\n                      Alexander Mackay and Mary Slessor, to dedicated \nmissions work throughout Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During the anti-colonial 1960s, Livingstone was \ndebunked: he made only one certified convert, who later\u0014\n                      backslid; he explored few areas not already \ntraveled by others; he freed few slaves; he treated his colleagues\u0014\n                      horribly; he traveled with Arab slave traders; \nhis family life was in shamblesin short, to many he embodied the\u0014\n                      \"White Man's Burden\" mentality. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nonetheless, at a time when countries are being \nrenamed and statues are being toppled, Livingstone has not\u0014\n                      fallen. Despite modern Africans' animosity \ntoward other Europeans, such as Cecil Rhodes, Livingstone endures as\u0014\n                      a heroic legend. Rhodesia has long since purged \nits name, but the cities of Livingstone (Zambia) and Livingstonia\u0014\n                      (Malawi) keep the explorer's appellation with \npride. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Furthermore, the capital of Malawi, Blantyre, \nwas named for Livingstone's birthplace. And Livingstone's massive\u0014\n                      bronze statue still points to the world's \nlargest waterfall, Victoria Falls. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1996, among his own people, the National \nPortrait Gallery in London mounted an exhibit that honored the man\u0014\n                      and the \"Livingstone industry\" that created \nthis larger-than-life legend. He is the man who introduced Africa to \nthe\u0014\n                      English-speaking world, and as much as any \nindividual in its history, transformed it, for ill and for good. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Alvyn Austinis a writer and historian from \nToronto, Canada. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1997 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/ Christian History Magazine.

    "title": "70 EFFECTIVE RESOLUTIONS",
    "words": "70 EFFECTIVE RESOLUTIONS\u0014\n   by Eric Reed (and Jonathan Edwards)\u0014\n\u0014\n   Jonathan Edwards was a serious man. Even at 19, the young man\u0014\n   who would become a leading figure in the First Great Awakening\u0014\n   took his faith seriously. In several sittings over a one-year\u0014\n   period, Edwards drafted 70 resolutions by which he governed\u0014\n   his life and ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n   For such a young man, he wrote a life's code that was\u0014\n   amazingly well-rounded. He addressed personal spiritual growth\u0014\n   and physical temperance, and matters of attitude, behavior,\u0014\n   and relationship. Edwards wanted to live as if he had \"already\u0014\n   seen the happiness of heaven, and hell torments.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Edwards took his words seriously. Several resolutions address\u0014\n   his speech: Resolved, never to speak anything that is\u0014\n   ridiculous, sportive, or matter of laughter on the Lord's Day.\u0014\n   He wrote that one on a Saturday night.\u0014\n\u0014\n   He pledged that he would \"never speak anything but the pure\u0014\n   and simple verity.\" \"Let there be something of benevolence in\u0014\n   all that I speak.\" In a pledge that he would speak evil of no\u0014\n   one, Edwards added the caveat, \"except I have some particular\u0014\n   good call for it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Some might say Edwards was too serious. Although not in the\u0014\n   Resolutions, his pledge to spend 13 hours a day in the study\u0014\n   of Scripture isolated him from his congregation, and indulged\u0014\n   his solitary nature and his tendency to melancholy. Some in\u0014\n   his congregation complained about his absence from their daily\u0014\n   lives--they were accustomed to the regular rounds of most\u0014\n   parsons--but they could not complain about his moral integrity\u0014\n   or his commitment to the pulpit. Edwards reviewed his code of\u0014\n   ethics weekly, and subjected himself to rigorous spiritual\u0014\n   examination.\u0014\n\u0014\n   His commitment \"towards making, maintaining, establishing, and\u0014\n   preserving peace\" was ultimately tested when, after 23 years\u0014\n   of ministry among them, Edwards was terminated by his\u0014\n   congregation on account of a nasty doctrinal disagreement.\u0014\n\u0014\n   One of the most devout pastors in American history, and one of\u0014\n   our greatest theologians, was canned. Even so, he stayed on\u0014\n   and filled the pulpit, until the church called a replacement.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Edwards later took the pulpit of a tiny frontier church. He\u0014\n   pastored there six years, a productive period for Edwards the\u0014\n   writer, until he was called as president of Princeton\u0014\n   University.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Edwards served but six months, felled by a smallpox\u0014\n   vaccination at age 54.\u0014\n\u0014\n   As we mark the 300th anniversary of the birth of Jonathan\u0014\n   Edwards, let's consider a few of the resolutions that guided\u0014\n   Edward's ministry:\u0014\n\u0014\n   Being sensible that I am unable to do any thing without God's\u0014\n   help, I do humbly intreat him by his grace to enable me to\u0014\n   keep these resolutions, so far as they are agreeable to His\u0014\n   will, for Christ's sake.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, That I will do whatsoever I think to be most to\u0014\n   God's glory, and my own good, profit and pleasure, in the\u0014\n   whole of my duration.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved to do whatever I think to be my duty, and most for\u0014\n   the good and advantage of mankind in general.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved to do this, whatever difficulties I meet with, how\u0014\n   many and how great soever.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Never to lose one moment of time, but improve it the\u0014\n   most profitable way I possibly can.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Never to do any thing, which I should be afraid to\u0014\n   do, if it were the last hour of my life.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, To be endeavoring to find out fit objects of charity\u0014\n   and liberality.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, To maintain the strictest temperance in eating and\u0014\n   drinking.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Never to do any thing, which if I should see in\u0014\n   another, I should count a just occasion to despise Him for, or\u0014\n   to think any way the more meanly of Him.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, To study the Scriptures so steadily, constantly and\u0014\n   frequently, as that I may find, and plainly perceive myself to\u0014\n   grow in the knowledge of the same.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, To strive to my utmost every week to be brought\u0014\n   higher in religion, and to a higher excercise of grace, than I\u0014\n   was the week before.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, To ask myself at the end of every day, week, month\u0014\n   and year, wherein I could possibly in any respect have done\u0014\n   better.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Frequently to renew the dedication of myself to God,\u0014\n   which was made at my baptism, which I solemnly renewed, when I\u0014\n   was received into the communion of the church; and which I\u0014\n   have solemnly re-made this twelfth day of January, 1722-3.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Never hence-forward, till I die, to act as if I were\u0014\n   any way my own, but entirely and altogether God's.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, I will act so as I think I shall judge would have\u0014\n   been best, and most prudent, when I come into the future\u0014\n   world.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, Never to give over, nor in the least to slacken my\u0014\n   fight with my corruptions, however unsuccessful I may be.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Resolved, After afflictions, to inquire, what I am the better\u0014\n   for them, what good I have got by them, and what I might have\u0014\n   got by them.\u0014",

    "words": "153 Fish\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is so easy to get caught up in trivial interpretations of \nscripture and\u0014\nmiss the point.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake a look at John 21:11: \"Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged \nthe net\u0014\nashore. It was full of fish, 153, but even with so many the net was \nnot\u0014\ntorn.\" Now, why in heaven's name was there 153 fish? Have you ever \nwondered\u0014\nabout that? No? Well others have.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyril of Alexandria in the 5th century said that the 100 represented \nthe\u0014\nfullness of the gentiles, the 50 symbolized the remnant of Israel and \nthe\u0014\nthree of course was there for the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine's theory (5th century) was a little more complicated. He \nsaid,\u0014\nthere are 10 commandments and 7 is the perfect number of grace and \nthat's 17\u0014\nright? Now if you add all the numbers from 1 to 17 together, you know \n1 + 2\u0014\n+ 3 + 4 + 5 all the way up to 17 you'll get 153. And not only that \nbut if\u0014\nyou were to arrange them with 17 fish in the first row, and 16 in the \nnext\u0014\nrow, and 15 in the next row, all the way down to a row of 1 you get a\u0014\nperfect triangle which of course symbolizes the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nJerome, he also lived in the 5th century, suggested that there were \n153\u0014\ndifferent types of fish in the sea and it was symbolic of the church\u0014\nreaching all the people in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nPersonally I have my own theory, want to hear it? I think that it's\u0014\nmentioned because there were 153 fish in the net.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's another theory of mine: they had to divide them somehow, and \nso Peter\u0014\nbeing the Skipper he got 21% or 32 fish, and John being mate got 16% \nthat's\u0014\n25 fish, and the other five got 10.5 % each or 16 fish. You see we \ncan get\u0014\nso caught up in really trivial stuff and miss the point that we need \nto be\u0014\nobedient to Christ, today.\u0014",

    "title": "\"CHARISMA\" EDITOR TAKES UP WOMEN'S QUESTION -- AGAIN",
    "words": "Charisma editor tackles women's leadership issuesagain\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCharisma magazine editor Lee Grady's book, \"'10 Lies the Church Tells \nWomen,\" came out in 2000 -the same year Southern Baptist Convention \nmessengers approved a revised faith statement opposing women pastors \nand reaffirming an amendment that called wives to \"submit graciously\" \nto their husbands' authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nA conservative Pentecostal with Southern Baptist roots, Grady wrote \nan open letter the following year to then-SBC President James Merritt \nencouraging\u0014\nSouthern Baptists to reexamine the Bible and rethink their \nconclusions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response, Merritt reaffirmed the convention's doctrinal position \nconcerning women and -according to a Baptist Press report- SBC ethics \nleader Richard Land added that Grady \"stands convicted of having a \nsub-biblical view of the Bible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGrady, the mild-mannered father of four daughters and an award- \nwinning journalist affirms biblical inerrancy and shares much in \ncommon with conservative Southern Baptists. However, his conviction \nthat women are being held in spiritual bondage through misuse of \nscripture has brought him criticism from conservative Christians from \na variety of traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he has been called a liberal, a heretic and a Christian \nfeminist as a result of his earlier book, Grady has not backed away \nfrom his conviction that the church needs to take a closer look at \nthe biblical view of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently he released a second book on the controversial subject \ntitled 25 Tough Questions about Women and the Church: Answers From \nGod's Word That Set Women Free.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrady writes that responses to his earlier book as well as \nconversations with women and men attending national and international \nconferences have confirmed for him that many women suffer from \nserious spiritual and cultural bondage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These problems,\" Grady concludes, \"will never be solved until men in \nthe church repent of gender prejudice and release women to fulfill \ntheir God-given callings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"25 questions\" -which are sometimes presented as statements \n-include a few issues that are not relevant in most Baptist churches, \nsuch as women in the workplace and the church role of elder.\u0014\nHowever, those seriously open to examining biblical interpretations \non women's roles will likely find Grady's book to be a helpful \nresource. His writing is clear, and his respect for biblical \nauthority is obvious.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost noticeable, however, Grady is deeply concerned for the women he \nsees as unable to exercise their spiritual gifts or experience the \nfullness of life because of oppression. And he is convinced that the \ntrue biblical message does not support such oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrady points to Paul's words in Galatians 3:28 (\"There is neither Jew \nnor Greek, slave nor free, male or female, for you are all one in \nChrist Jesus.\") as a broad biblical pronouncement \"that the church \nwould not be an all-white boys' club, controlled by wealthy \npatriarchal forces.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also notes that Jesus never called for all church leaders to be \nmen and went out of his way to confront the oppression of women in \nIsrael. While staying close to biblical texts to build his case, \nGrady relies on logic analysis and even humor over hostility;\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sometimes the way we handle the issue of women ministers is \nlaughable,\" writes Grady: \" We make rigid rules to keep women out of \nleadership, but we can't II I the church without their involvement.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We don't want them at the top, but we need their money because they \nare usually the most faithful givers -and they often make up the \nmajority of the congregation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea that women in authoritative church leadership roles need to \nbe under male authority is at best \"Christian superstition,\" claims \nGrady: He argues that there is no biblical support for this position \noften claimed by fundamentalists.\u0014\n\"Paul's reference to a husband being the 'head of the wife' is an \nallusion to the Creation story, in which Eve was taken out of Adam,\" \nwrites Grady. \"Rather than establishing a chain of authority, the \nhead ship principle reminds us that husbands and wives enjoy a \nmystical union that is not paralleled in any other relationship.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGrady adds that \"headship implies connection and partnership,' not \ndominion and hierarchy:\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAn ordained minister, Grady also reveals a pastoral side in \nencouraging women to avoid negativism when confronted with oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Never take it personally when a church leader tries to restrict you \nministry or your calling,\" Grady urges. \"If he is motivated by gender \nprejudice or by a limited doctrinal position, then you must have corn \npassion on him.\"\u0014\nGrady adds that some women become hardened and cynical when faced \nwith opposition. As a result, they view all of life through their \npain. He encourages women not to put too much stock in the approval \nof all church leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n[W]e should never treat church leaders in a disrespectful manner,' he \nwrites. \"But at the same hobbes's we cannot elevate leaders higher \nthan God himself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I know some women who are stifling their gifts and callings because \nthey don't want to rock the boat. They don't want pastors or other \nrespectable people in the church to think of them as being 'out of \norder' or trouble makers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen ministers must \"get used to it,\" Grady adds. He points to the \nnegative reaction some fellow Baptists have shown to Anne Graham Lotz \n--and her perseverance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnne understands an important principle of ultimate accountability,\" \nwrites Grady; \"You too must understand that you are first and \nforemost accountable to God for the spiritual gifts he has entrusted \nto you. If you bury them just because a pastor told you to be quiet, \nwill God accept that as a valid excuse?.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile women ministers sometime face rejection, Grady suggests that \nprayer, patience and \"holy shrewdness\" can often open doors to \nmeaningful ministry; For Grady, this issue is not a passing thought \nbut a passionate concern.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My sisters in Christ have been told for too long to shut up and take \na back seat,\" he writes. \"It is hobbes's for a reformation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause his position does not align with the revised Baptist Faith \nand Message statement adopted by the SBC in 2000, Grady said his \nbooks are not available through SBC-owned Life Way Christian Stores. \nHowever, he said the Spanish translations of both titles have been \nfound in Life Way stores. \u0014\n(25 Tough Questions about Women and the Church: Answers from God's \nWord That Will Set Women Free by J.

    "title": "3 STEPS THE 99% SHOULD DO--BUT WON'T",
    "words": "While sitting in the Nashville International Airport reading the \nnewspaper recently, a mustachioed Frenchman sitting next to me \nstarted up a conversation. In the interest of space and clarity, I'm \nskipping my part of the conversation: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Occupy Wall Street is a paper tiger. All drums and no message. If \nyou want to change the system under which you Americans suffer you \nmust stop collaborating with it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"First, the 99 percent should go on strike. Do it the day after your \nThanksgiving. No one of the 99 percent goes to work. Do you think the \nfat cats on Wall Street can survive even a day without the 99 \npercent? Can they brew their own lattes? They will be defeated in \nmoments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Second, the 99 percent should boycott all elections except, maybe, \nthe most local. It doesn't matter which party wins in your system. \nThe only difference between them is which corporations get to feed \noff the people.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Don't vote. Let the 1 percent elect their man, they do so anyway. \nBoycotting the elections says you know the system is stacked against \nyou.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Third, the 99 percent should refuse to file tax returns. Instead \neveryone should file for an extension and mail it in on April 15 when \nyour taxes are due.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You are not refusing to pay, only filing for a legal extension. And \nkeep filing for extensions until there is no money to feed the beast. \nAgain you are sending a message: The people have the power because \nthe people have the numbers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Do these things until your demands are met: a minimum living wage, \nuniversal single payer health care, publicly funded education from \npreschool through college, ending corporate welfare and the \n\"corporations are people\" nonsense, and removing the influence of \nmoney from politics and government.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So, three things: call a general strike on Nov. 25; file for tax \nextensions on April 15; and boycott the elections on Nov. 4.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Will you do it? Of course not. Why? Because you would rather chant \nthan change, and organize drum circles than a revolution.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Because the government-military-corporate-entertainment complex \nkeeps you fat, stupid and afraid. Because given the choice between \nchange and cable, you will choose cable every time.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But who am I to talk? I am going back home to watch the EU dissolve, \nand wait for America to drag us into a war with Iran and China. Bonne \nchance, mon ami.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis plane to Chicago was called, and he got up and walked away. Who \nwas this mustachioed Frenchman? Obviously I have no idea, but I \nsuspect he would have left me a silver bullet if he could have gotten \nit passed security. Bonne chance indeed!\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Rami Shapiro\u0014\nNovember 23, 2011 Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Rami Shapiro is an author and educator.

Chesterton\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Would you know who is the greatest saint in the world: It is not he \nwho prays most or fasts most, it is not he who gives most alms or is \nmost eminent for temperance, chastity or justice; but it is he who is \nalways thankful to God, who wills everything that God wills, who \nreceives everything as an instance of God's goodness and has a heart \nalways ready to praise God for it.\" ~ William Law\u0014\n\u0014\nGratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday \nepiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how \nwe experience life and the world. ~ John Milton\u0014\n\u0014\nA thankful heart cannot be cynical. ~ A.W. Tozer\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, 'thank you,' \nthat would suffice.\" ~ Meister Eckhart\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We pray for the big things and forget to give thanks for the \nordinary, small (and yet really not small) gifts. How can God entrust \ngreat things to one who will not thankfully receive from Him the \nlittle things?\" ~ Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u0014\n\u0014\nA sensible thanksgiving for mercies received is a mighty prayer in \nthe Spirit of God. It prevails with Him unspeakably. ~ John Bunyan\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Gratitude as a discipline involves a conscious choice. I can choose \nto be grateful even when my emotions and feelings are still steeped \nin hurt and resentment. It is amazing how many occasions present \nthemselves in which I can choose gratitude instead of a complaint. I \ncan choose to grateful when I am criticized, even when my heart still \nresponds in bitterness. I can choose to speak about goodness and \nbeauty, even when my inner eye still looks for someone to accuse or \nsomething to call ugly.\" ~Henri Nouwen\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you are not content with what you have, you would not be \nsatisfied if it were doubled.\" ~ Charles Haddon Spurgeon\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Receive every day as a resurrection from death, as a new enjoyment \nof life; meet every rising sun with such sentiments of God's \ngoodness, as if you had seen it, and all things, new-created upon \nyour account: and under the sense of so great a blessing, let your \njoyful heart praise and magnify so good and glorious a Creator.\" ~ \nWilliam Law\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I thank Thee first because I was never robbed before; second, \nbecause although they took my purse they did not take my life; third, \nalthough they took my all, it was not much; and fourth, because it \nwas I who was robbed and not I who robbed.\" ~ Matthew Henry\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When we were children we were grateful to those who filled our \nstockings at Christmas time.

    "words": "3 Temptations Faced by Christian Leaders \u0014\nIrcel Harrison\u0014\nDecember 15, 2011 \u0014\n \u0014\nA friend recently shared with me a book written about 20 years ago by \nHenri Nouwen titled \"In the Name of Jesus: Reflections on Christian \nLeadership.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNouwen was one of the most prolific and popular spiritual writers of \nthe latter 20th century. He wrote more than 40 books and taught at \nNotre Dame as well as at Yale and Harvard.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the 10 years before his death in 1996, Nouwen was part of the \nL'Arche Daybreak community in Toronto, sharing life with people with \ndevelopmental disabilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his move to this community, Nouwen was asked to address a group \nof clergy on the subject of leadership. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis little book contains the material he presented as part of that \nassignment. The underlying theme for Nouwen was the lessons he had \nlearned in moving from a high-profile academic setting to a \nchaplaincy role among \"the least of these.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing the biblical passages on the temptation of Christ (Matthew \n4:1-11) and Peter's call to be a shepherd of God's people (John \n21:15-19), Nouwen identified the three temptations of contemporary \nChristian leadership, the appropriate response to each, and the \nspiritual discipline that empowers each response.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first temptation is to be relevant. By relevance, he refers to \nthe tendency of many of us today to depend on the findings of \nsociology, psychology, anthropology and other disciplines to the \npoint that we say, \"We can take care of ourselves. We don't need God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe response to this is a call to answer Jesus' question, \"Do you \nlove me?\" If we do, we will depend on power in God and not ourselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nNouwen states, \"Many Christian empire builders have been people \nunable to give and receive love.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe spiritual discipline undergirding the way of love is \ncontemplative prayer in which we look to God for understanding, \nacceptance and guidance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second temptation is to be spectacular or popular. This is the \ntemptation to pursue individualism at the cost of true community. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe response is the task to \"feed my sheep.\" We must acknowledge that \nwe need one another and support one another on the Christian journey. \u0014\n\u0014\nA true servant leader understands that he or she needs the people as \nmuch as they need the leader. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe spiritual disciplines involved are confession and forgiveness, \nnecessities for healthy community life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third temptation that Nouwen cites is to covet power. He \nsuggests, \"Maybe it is that power offers an easy substitute for the \nhard task of love.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps it is easier to be God than to love God and easier to control \npeople than to love them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe challenge is to understand that the true servant leader will find \nhimself or herself led into \"unknown, undesirable and painful \nplaces.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe discipline supporting this is theological reflection.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn using this term, Nouwen calls for a lifestyle based on the Word of \nGod  \"a deep spiritual formation involving the whole person  body, \nmind and heart.\" He points out that such thinking is hard to find \namong ministers!\u0014\n\u0014\nNouwen summarizes it this way: \"My movement from Harvard to L'Arche \nmade me aware in a new way how much my own thinking about Christian \nleadership had been affected by the desire to be relevant, the desire \nfor popularity and the desire for power.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, God calls Christian leaders to \"a life of downward mobility\" \nembodied by prayer, vulnerability and trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nNouwen's words challenge us to review our approach to leadership in \nlight of a different standard. They are more meaningful because of \nthe life and example of the writer himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates \nand director of the Murfreesboro Center of Central Baptist \nTheological Seminary.\u0014",

    "title": "5 CHANGES THAT INFLUENCED CHURCH STAFFING",
    "words": "5 Changes That Have Influenced Church Staffing\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Ircel Harrison\u0014\nMay 15, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nIn going through some files recently, I came across a church \nnewsletter from April 1976. It provided an interesting snapshot of \nthis particular church at that time. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis county seat Baptist church in a southern state was averaging \nmore than 650 in Sunday morning worship. What caught my attention was \nthat they had only three full-time staff members!\u0014\n\u0014\nToday we talk in terms of a church needing one full-time staff member \nfor every 100 worshippers. The same church today runs about 450 on a \nSunday and has the equivalent of six full-time staff ministers. What \nchanged?\u0014\n\u0014\nA lot has changed in three and a half decades. Let me suggest five \nprimary changes that have impacted churches, their staffing \nexpectations and their effectiveness in mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, society has changed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this particular case, what was once a small county seat town is \nnow part of a metropolitan area made up not only of individuals \ncommuting 45 to 60 minutes to work, but of professionals and \nblue-collar employees in locally situated medium-sized and even large \nindustries. \u0014\n\u0014\nLifestyles have changed, and people are busier with more personal and \nfamily activities. The community has a number of dynamic service, \neducational and recreational organizations. Church participation is \nnow just one of many options from which residents can choose.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, as a result of the first change, there are fewer volunteers \navailable to lead in programs, and those who do are often pulled to \nother activities as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church of 1976 included fathers who worked in the community, \nstay-at-home mothers and a strong tradition of volunteer service. \u0014\n\u0014\nNone of those things is true today. This is not meant to be negative, \nbut it is a fact. People have more choices of where to invest their \ntime and energy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the church scene has changed. Let's be honest: There is more \ncompetition between churches for members than there was three decades \nago. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough we don't want to admit it, most churches are growing by \ntransfer growth rather than conversions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this particular community, there was one large Baptist church; now \nthere are at least four large Baptist churches with multiple staff \nministers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the competition is not only between churches of the same \ndenomination. This community has a number of nondenominational \nchurches that draw people of Baptist background, and believers seem \nmore willing to check out other denominations when they seek a church \nhome as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, congregations expect more of their ministers. Perhaps due to \nthe competition among churches, more is expected of ministers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the fast-paced media age in which we live, ministers must not only \nbe competent but extraordinary. We expect to be \"wowed\" whenever they \nspeak before the congregation, do leadership training or initiate a \nnew ministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe want specialists in every area of church life  preschool, \nelementary, middle school, high school, college, young adult, \nsingles, married young adults, median adults, senior adults and so \non. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe stress this creates in the life of a minister is a downside of \ntheir service.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, an accepted church growth strategy is to staff for the growth \nyou want and your church will \"grow into it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not a bad concept, but sometimes a church staffs for \nnumerical growth and the growth doesn't happen. \u0014\n\u0014\nPopulation shifts, emphases change and the economy tanks. This \nresults in more staff members than the church can support and \nunwanted decisions about downsizing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe primary challenge I would make to churches today is to be \nrealistic about where you are and what you can expect of staff \nleadership. Culture, people, needs and methodologies have changed. \u0014\n\u0014\nCompetent staff members want to address today's, not yesterday's, \nissues in order to encourage church health. At the same time, they \ncannot do it alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch members must step up and accept responsibilities with the \nsupport of these professional staff ministers. There are some things \nthat staff ministers can do and should do, but the church is made up \nprimarily of lay believers, not professionals.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best staff members are both ministers and equippers, but the \nchurch needs those who are willing to be equipped.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates \nand director of the Murfreesboro Center of Central Baptist \nTheological Seminary.\u0014",

    "title": "2,000 CONVICTED THEN EXONERATED IN 23 YEARS",
    "words": "Study: 2,000 convicted then exonerated in 23 years \u0014\n\u0014\nBy PETE YOST \u0014\nAssociated Press  5/21/12\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 2,000 people who were falsely convicted \nof serious crimes have been exonerated in the United States in the \npast 23 years, according to a new archive compiled at two \nuniversities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no official record-keeping system for exonerations of \nconvicted criminals in the country, so academics set one up. The new \nnational registry, or database, painstakingly assembled by the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School and the Center on Wrongful \nConvictions at Northwestern University School of Law, is the most \ncomplete list of exonerations ever compiled.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe database compiled and analyzed by the researchers contains \ninformation on 873 exonerations for which they have the most detailed \nevidence. The researchers are aware of nearly 1,200 other \nexonerations, for which they have less data.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey found that those 873 exonerated defendants spent a combined \ntotal of more than 10,000 years in prison, an average of more than 11 \nyears each. Nine out of 10 of them are men and half are \nAfrican-American.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly half of the 873 exonerations were homicide cases, including \n101 death sentences. Over one-third of the cases were sexual assaults.\u0014\n\u0014\nDNA evidence led to exoneration in nearly one-third of the 416 \nhomicides and in nearly two-thirds of the 305 sexual assaults.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers estimate the total number of felony convictions in the \nUnited States is nearly a million a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe overall registry/list begins at the start of 1989. It gives an \nunprecedented view of the scope of the problem of wrongful \nconvictions in the United States and the figure of more than 2,000 \nexonerations \"is a good start,\" said Rob Warden, executive director \nof the Center on Wrongful Convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We know there are many more that we haven't found,\" added University \nof Michigan law professor Samuel Gross, the editor of the newly \nopened National Registry of Exonerations.\u0014\n\u0014\nCounties such as San Bernardino in California and Bexar County in \nTexas are heavily populated, yet seemingly have no exonerations, a \ncircumstance that the academics say cannot possibly be correct.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe registry excludes at least 1,170 additional defendants. Their \nconvictions were thrown out starting in 1995 amid the periodic \nexposures of 13 major police scandals around the country. In all the \ncases, police officers fabricated crimes, usually by planting drugs \nor guns on innocent defendants.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegarding the 1,170 additional defendants who were left out of the \nregistry, \"we have only sketchy information about most of these \ncases,\" the report said. \"Some of these group exonerations are well \nknown; most are comparatively obscure. We began to notice them by \naccident, as a byproduct of searches for individual cases.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn half of the 873 exonerations studied in detail, the most common \nfactor leading to false convictions was perjured testimony or false \naccusations. Forty-three percent of the cases involved mistaken \neyewitness identification, and 24 percent of the cases involved false \nor misleading forensic evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn two out of three homicides, perjury or false accusation was the \nmost common factor leading to false conviction. In four out of five \nsexual assaults, mistaken eyewitness identification was the leading \ncause of false conviction.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven percent of the exonerations were drug, white-collar and other \nnonviolent crimes, 5 percent were robberies and 5 percent were other \ntypes of violent crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It used to be that almost all the exonerations we knew about were \nmurder and rape cases. We're finally beginning to see beyond that. \nThis is a sea change,\" said Gross.\u0014\n\u0014\nExonerations often take place with no public fanfare and the 106-page \nreport that coincides with the opening of the registry explains why.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn TV, an exoneration looks like a singular victory for a criminal \ndefense attorney, \"but there's usually someone to blame for the \nunderlying tragedy, often more than one person, and the common \nculprits include defense lawyers as well as police officers, \nprosecutors and judges. In many cases, everybody involved has egg on \ntheir face,\" according to the report.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite a claim of wrongful conviction that was widely publicized \nlast week, a Texas convict executed two decades ago is not in the \ndatabase because he has not been officially exonerated. Carlos deLuna \nwas executed for the fatal stabbing of a Corpus Christi convenience \nstore clerk. A team headed by a Columbia University law professor \njust published a 400-page report that contends DeLuna didn't kill the \nclerk, Wanda Jean Lopez.\u0014",

    "title": "14 PIECES OF ADVICE FOR NEW MINISTERS",
    "words": "14 Pieces of Advice for New Ministers \u0014\nBill Wilson\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, May 24, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe landscape of hiring and managing staff is rapidly changing for \ncongregations. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the implications for the men and women who desire to serve \nin those congregations? What does this dawning of a new era in \ncongregational life mean for those who feel called to a life in \nministry?\u0014\n\u0014\nSpecifically, what can a man or woman who wants to serve God in the \ncontext of local church ministry expect with regard to finding a job, \nkeeping a job and enjoying a job?\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, our son graduated from divinity school. The world he faces \nis very different from the one I entered in 1980. It is rapidly \nchanging and difficult to navigate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I think about my advice to him at the beginning of his life in \nministry, it goes something like this:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Living out of a sense of call is more important than ever. If you \nare not deeply and divinely called to the life of a minister, you \nwill quickly find that the aggravation, financial arrangements and \ngeneral work environment will quickly dissuade you from any romantic \nnotions about making the ministry a career. Even with a strong dose \nof call, many of us find it is difficult to live out that call in the \ncurrent culture. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Prepare to be underwhelmed by the free call process that is \nstandard in many Protestant traditions. Economic priorities dictate \nthat very few people remain who devote their full time to placement \nconcerns. That leaves a patchwork network that is heavy on \nrelationships and short on logic. It will probably drive you crazy. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Take care of your spiritual life. What is at the heart of you \nmatters more than any other single factor when thinking about a life \nin ministry. You must cultivate a profound sense of connection to \nChrist, Scripture and leadership of the Spirit. That is the rock upon \nwhich to build your life. Resist the lure of a ministerial life built \non the sand of methodology or metrics or trying to please others. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. Take care of all of you. Your family, your body and your mind \nmatter to God and to your life in the church. Spend quality time with \nthem, take time off, eat well, rest, exercise, read, think, go to \nconcerts and movies, play. In short, live an abundant life. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Have a life outside the church. I hope you will always have \nhobbies, friends, interests and experiences that transcend the \nboundaries of the local church. You will be a better minister and \nperson if you do. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. What is your \"escape hatch\"? That's what one friend calls your \navocation. That is, the thing you would do if your primary vocation \nwere taken away from you. Think about that and prepare for that. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. Remember that your congregants really want to know two basic \nthings: Do you love God, and can you love them? Spend most of your \ntime focused on these two things. The majority of that will happen \nbetween Sundays, by the way. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. Can you spell entrepreneur? Can you be an entrepreneur? I hope so. \nThe life of a minister in the future will require it. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. Remember, EQ (emotional intelligence) usually trumps IQ. \u0014\n\u0014\n10. Learn multiple skills. The chances are that you will be asked to \ndo a multitude of jobs, whatever your title may be. Expect it and \nembrace it. No whining. The era of specialists is closing, and the \nmost valuable clergy will be those who love the whole church, not \njust their silo. \u0014\n\u0014\n11. Consider what you will do when you find it necessary to be \nbivocational. This is going to be the standard experience for many in \nyour generation. \u0014\n\u0014\n12. Take an interest in anything that teaches you how to be a more \neffective leader. That is the skill congregations and organizations \nare yearning for. Read about it. Think about it. Watch good leaders \nin any field and learn what makes them effective. Learn from the \nfailures as well, for they will teach you invaluable lessons. Study \nJesus the leader. He's the finest model available. \u0014\n\u0014\n13. Pay attention when professors, books, articles or conferences \nspeak to the leadership required to lead the transition from \nprogrammatic models toward missional models. You'll be glad you did. \u0014\n\u0014\n14. Live simply. Salaries for ministers have never been high, and \nthey may have peaked. The future looks lean in terms of pay and \nbenefits. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor every ministerial author who writes eloquently about leaving \nchurch, there are thousands of women and men who serve congregations \ndiligently and faithfully across a lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember, for all the pain and aggravation, the life of a minister is \nthe finest and highest calling one could hope for.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour grandfather loved every day of his life in ministry. Your dad \ncan say the same thing with enthusiasm. I pray the same will be true \nfor you.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

    "words": "7 Strategic Habits of Jesus to Focus Your Church\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Bill Wilson   June 8, 2012  EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nBuilding a congregation's life around a clear vision and purpose is \nan easy thing to believe in. Aligning that purpose with biblical \nteaching and witness is an agreeable notion. \u0014\n\u0014\nI seldom encounter a leader or leadership group who resists the idea \nthat the path toward a vibrant and engaging congregation is to embody \nGod's mission in clear, dynamic and powerful ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problems emerge when we begin to talk about the 'how' of living \nout God's call to be his people on a mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike barnacles on a ship, our preferences, traditions, icons and \ncultural accommodations have encrusted the mission and threaten to \nsmother it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been thinking about using Jesus as a model for how to live out a \nclear and compelling mission. In his life and practices, perhaps \nthere are some insights for us in our struggle to stay true to our \ncalling.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow about this for a list of healthy habits of congregations on a \nmission?\u0014\n\u0014\nSolitude: Jesus knew the value of time spent with a compass rather \nthan a calendar. He repeatedly frustrated those who prized \nefficiency. From the beginning, he was prone to pull back from the \nlimelight and reconnect with the divine dream and mission. Rather \nthan allow others to sway his agenda and trajectory, he clearly \ndefined who he was and what he came to do. The wilderness was his \nfriend, and solitude was a regular habit. Planning and preparation \nclaimed a healthy portion of his time.\u0014\n\u0014\nRuthless adherence: For the kingdom vision to take root, Jesus found \nit imperative to avoid every temptation to water down or diverge from \nthe vision with which he had been entrusted. Repeatedly, he declined \nopportunities that would have compromised the mission. Instead, he \ndemonstrated an iron will that held fast to the calling despite \npopular acclaim or the threat of rejection.\u0014\n\u0014\nRight people: Jesus chose men and women to help him carry out the \nmission with an eye toward their visible and invisible gifts. He \ntaught a diversity of gifts in the kingdom, and his followers were a \nliving example of that lesson. He paid attention to individuals and \npushed them to become what they had been intended to be. Missing in \nhis actions was an insistence upon lock-step behavior or thinking. \nWhen he spoke of unity, it was a unity of purpose, not style. In the \ndiversity of the disciples and other followers, he found a powerful \ncombination that turned the world upside-down.\u0014\n\u0014\nRepetition: On a regular and consistent basis, Jesus taught and \nre-taught the basics of the kingdom dream. Using parables, he helped \nthose around him visualize what it would look like for the kingdom to \nactually come to earth as it was in heaven. Whether it be a story \nfeaturing a waiting father, a good Samaritan, a lost coin or a bridal \ncelebration, he repeatedly reinforced the new way of living and being \nGod's people.\u0014\n\u0014\nReinforcement: Not content with mere theory, Jesus illustrated his \nprevailing vision with real-life examples. Blind men, innocent \nchildren, lepers, wayward women and demon-possessed men all served as \nvehicles for him to reinforce and drive home the core teaching of \nthis new kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nCelebration: Along the way, there were victories that needed to be \ncelebrated, and Jesus focused on those successes to build a growing \nsense of movement among his followers. When bodies were healed or \nlives redirected, the resulting exclamations and joyful dances served \nnotice that this was going to be a kingdom whose end result was \nabundance and joy. The gospels are permeated by glimpses of joy and \nlaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntegrity: Jesus insisted that all of his life with his disciples be \ncongruent with his teaching. He was the one who noticed the beggars, \nthe blind, lame and diseased. He was the one who stayed true to a \nlife of simplicity and singular focus. When others wanted to crown \nhim king or build him a temple, he redirected them to the deeper \nmeaning of his coming. Even when the mission led him to the garden \nand the cruelty of the cross, he remained true to his calling and his \ndivine mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf our churches were willing to exercise these habits in our quest to \nlive out the mission God has entrusted to us, perhaps we would ask \nthese types of questions:\u0014\n\u0014\nHow much time do you spend in quiet solitude reconnecting to the \nvision?\u0014\n\u0014\nAre you willing to say no to lesser things so that you can say yes to \nthe mission? \u0014\n\u0014\nAre the right people leading the effort? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow often do you simplify, repeat and reinforce your reason for being?\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes this journey make you smile, laugh and resonate with joy? \u0014\n\u0014\nDoes this mission embrace your whole being? \u0014\n\u0014\nLip service to the kingdom is easy. Missional living? That's another \nstory  a Jesus story.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

    "title": "1ST PERFORMANCE OF SAMUEL SMITH'S \"AMERICA\"",
    "words": "July 4, 1832 \u0014\n\u0014\n1st Performance of Samuel F. Smith's \"America\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and \nvery poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiledThe Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian!

    "words": "Kids are still dying in hot cars!\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the efforts of child advocates and federal highway safety \nofficials, Americans keep leaving young children in hot vehicles. In \nthe first week of August, eight children across the USA died from \nheatstroke in hot vehicles -- believed to be the most ever in a \nsingle week.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis year, 23 children have died of hyperthermia in cars in 13 \nstates, the advocacy group Safe Kids Worldwide says. There were 33 \nsuch deaths in all of 2011 and 49 in 2010, the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Never leave your child alone unattended, not even for a minute,\" \nsays Kate Carr, president and CEO of Safe Kids Worldwide, a network \nof organizations dedicated to protecting children from injuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe eight deaths Aug. 1-7 are believed to be the highest one-week \ntotal ever, NHTSA Administrator David Strickland says. \u0014\n\u0014\nHeatstroke is the leading cause of non-crash vehicle-related deaths \nfor children under age 14, according to NHTSA. San Francisco State \nUniversity researcher Jan Null found that from 1998 to Monday, 550 \nchildren died when left unattended in hot cars. Null says children \nhave died in a wide range of outdoor temperatures -- from a death in \n2009 in El Cerrito, Calif., (67 degrees) to a death July 9 in Mesa, \nAriz., (113 degrees).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bodies of infants and children heat up three to five times faster \nthan those of adults, says Leticia Ryan, a pediatric emergency \nmedicine physician at Children's National Medical Center in \nWashington. \u0014\n\u0014\nNHTSA has made child heatstroke deaths a priority. Last month, the \nagency warned parents about the unreliability of electronic devices \ndesigned to alert parents of a child's presence in a vehicle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Even one death is too many,\" Strickland says.\u0014\n\u0014\nReggie McKinnon found that out two years ago. McKinnon, 40, a \ntelecommunication supervisor in Cape Coral, Fla., left his \n17-month-old daughter, Payton Lyn, in his SUV at work March 8, 2010. \nHe had taken her to a morning doctor's appointment and forgot she was \nin the vehicle. He came outside around 3 p.m. that day. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"To my horror, when I went to put my laptop in the backseat of my \nSUV, I found Payton still in her rear-facing car seat,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding his daughter like that was the hardest thing he has ever \nendured, he says. The second-hardest was telling his wife, Julia, a \nthird-grade teacher, what had happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore his personal tragedy, McKinnon says, he would see stories \nabout children dying in hot cars and think: \"That only happens to \npeople who are uneducated, drunk, drug addicts. Not me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more information about \\reprints & permissions, visit our FAQ's. \nTo report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor \nBrent Jones.

    "title": "8 TIPS FOR TELLING A GOOD STORY",
    "words": "Storytelling is a vital component of good teaching and preaching. I \nhope these guidelines will improve your teaching as much as they have \nmine.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Never introduce a story by telling your audience how they should \nfeel: \"This story is so funny\" or \"You're going to love this \" It \nputs artificial pressure on your audience to react a certain way. \nBesides, if you tell the story well, it should have the desired \neffect.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Never end with the equivalent of \"So the moral to the story is \" \nIf the point is not self evident, I've got bad newsit's not a good \nstory.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. If your story involves some area of expertise, humbly concede your \nlack of knowledge. If you do your audience will be more forgiving of \nany unintentional misstatements. Say \"I'm certainly no authority on \nstring theory, but as I understand it \" as opposed to \"This is the \nway string works \" Or say \"I've never been to Rome, but people who \nhave been there tell me \" as opposed to \"Rome's Eiffel Tower is \nsimply stunning \"\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Embellishments and superlatives become tiresome: \"I've never been \nso scared in my life!\"; \"It was the most awesome moment!\" Remember: \nif everything has emphasis, nothing has emphasis.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Spontaneity is overrated. Practice telling your story, aloud if \npossible. As you rehearse your delivery, you'll find better ways of \nturning phrases and getting the timing right.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Don't let the story become the entre. Stories are appetizers and \nsides; the gospel is the entre. In a sermon, stories should \nillustrate not dominate. Stories that are too long or even overly \naffecting can actually distract from the main message.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Be humble. Personal stories that demonstrate your flaws are \nusually better than those that have you as the hero. If the point of \nmost of your stories is that you're a saint, they will be met with \nrolling eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Know your audience. And tell stories that will connect with them. \nCowboy church in Montana probably doesn't want to hear about the \nKardashians.\u0014",

    "title": "21 LESSONS IN POLITICS FROM A BAPTIST PREACHER",
    "words": "21 Lessons in Politics from a Baptist Preacher\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Gary Furr\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, September 6, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA little unsolicited advice for pastors:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. You have to learn how to build consensus. Winning 51-49 is not \nwinning. You don't need unanimity, but until you accomplish good for \nall, you haven't won.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. You will learn humility willingly or eventually. Willingly is much \nless painful.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Since politicians seem to evidence almost no persuasive ability in \nthe current moment  I add this one: \"Learn to tell a story. Keep it \nsimple. Tell the truth. Truth doesn't need help.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n4. The same people you defeat will have to help pay for it in the \nend. They are not enemies, so unless you can regain their support, \nyou lose in the long run.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. It's dangerous to claim God is on your side and never leave room \nfor disagreement. Even if you and your mother think so. God is not \ntoo keen on preachers as court jesters and is intolerant of people \nmisusing the divine name, so you've been warned.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Preaching that doesn't turn into good deeds doesn't amount to \nanything.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. You have to trust others to make real changes. Nobody does it by \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Those who live by demonization die by demonization.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Forgive and move on. It's just that simple. Holding grudges is a \nwaste of valuable energy.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Sometimes you just do what is right and let the chips fall. There \nare worse things than losing your job.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. Believe in Someone or Something larger than you. Without a real \nvision, not only do the people perish, but nothing really happens.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. It's not your church. It's not their church. It's God's church. \nSeems to me this applies to countries, property, power and prosperity.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. If there isn't any money, you can't spend it. It's not rocket \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\n14. Doesn't hurt to let someone else take credit now and then, even \nif it's your idea.\u0014\n\u0014\n15. A good staff makes a poor preacher look great.\u0014\n\u0014\n16. Principles matter the most when they are most inconvenient and \nunpopular. Lose 'em and you might as well quit anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. No matter how high and mighty you get, the Almighty gets the last \nword.\u0014\n\u0014\n18. Don't do the devil's work for him.\u0014\n\u0014\n19. Know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. Even a great idea \nahead of its time will lose to anxiety and fear and misinformation.\u0014\n\u0014\n20. As a friend of mine put it, \"Everything happens for a reason. \nSometimes the reason is you're stupid and you make bad decisions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n21. Love really is the great truth of life. Politics, even with the \nnoble concept of \"justice,\" will degenerate into darkness without the \ntemper of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Furr is pastor of Vestavia Hills Baptist Church in Birmingham, \nAla.\u0014",

    "title": "\"NONES\" ON THE RISE",
    "words": "One-in-five adults in the United States  and a third of adults under \n30  say they have no religious affiliation. The numbers are out in a \nnew report called Nones on the Rise, put out by the Pew Forum on \nReligion and Public Life. That 20 percent of the population is up \nfrom 15 percent just five years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, two-thirds of the 46 million Americans self-identifying as \nhaving no religion also say they believe in God. And 21 percent of \nthem say they pray every day. A large portion of this group  37 \npercent  say they consider themselves spiritual but not religious.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe increase in disaffiliation goes hand-in-hand with an overall lack \nof trust in American institutions across the board, from the \ngovernment to the news media, and now, to our houses of worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nones overwhelmingly say religious institutions are too \nconcerned with money and power, and 67 percent say they both focus \ntoo much on rules and are too involved in politics. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo where are the nones coming from? That uptick in those checking \nnothing in particular comes largely from a shrinking number \nidentifying as evangelical or mainline Protestant  a decline from 53 \nto 48 percent since 2007. An influx of Latin immigration has \nsupplanted any decline of Catholic affiliation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut another source is simple generational replacement, as the \nunaffiliated are overwhelmingly concentrated in the millennial \ngeneration.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillennials Drop the Labels\u0014\n\u0014\nPew Forum senior researcher Greg Smith said not only are millennials \nmore likely to be unaffiliated, but theyre more likely to be \nunaffiliated than previous generations were at their age  meaning, \nthe group is unlikely to change as they get older. \u0014\n\u0014\nThirty percent of millennials overall (age 18-31) identify as \nunaffiliated. But when you break that down to younger millennials \n(age 18-25), a full third of our youngest voting bloc says they have \nno religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is in large part to the fact that unaffiliation among parents is \non the rise.

    "title": "\"NONES\" SAY, \"WE DON'T NEED YOUR LABELS\"",
    "words": "by Sandi Villarreal 10-09-2012 Sojourners\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich religious tradition do you most closely identify with?\u0014\n\tProtestant \u0014\n\tCatholic \u0014\n\tMormon \u0014\n\tMuslim \u0014\n\tJewish \u0014\n\tOrthodox \u0014\n\tOther Faith \u0014\n\tUnaffiliated \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven these options  or even if you throw in a few more like \nBuddhist, Hindu, Agnostic  I would choose Unaffiliated. That puts \nme into a category with one-in-five other Americans, and one-in-three \nmillennials, aptly named the nones. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem? \u0014\n\u0014\nIm a Lutheran preachers wife who has spent her entire life in some \nmanifestation of the church, attends regularly, prays, reads her \nBible  you get the point.\u0014\n\u0014\nNones is a term that includes atheists and agnostics, but also \nanyone who does not identify with a traditional religious faith. \nTherein lies my concern. To lump members of a house church or small \ngroup (i.e., Bible-believing individuals who may not identify with a \nparticular religious tradition) into the same faction as atheists and \nagnostics limits the ability to truly understand any of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report even emphasizes, the absence of religious affiliation \ndoes not necessarily indicate the absence of religious beliefs or \npractices. In fact, 68 percent of the nones say they believe in \nGod. About 22 percent say they go to a church service at least \nmonthly. \u0014\n\u0014\nI appreciate this report for the trend it points out: the U.S. \npopulation, and the millennial generation in particular, continues to \nlose faith and trust in institutions  like churches, but also other \ninstitutions like the government and news media. But inasmuch as this \ndemographic may become the religious majority, its all the more \nimportant to take a stab at new classifications. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhats in a name?\u0014\n\u0014\nAn obvious question is why would I  as closely tied as I am both to \nthe big-C Church and my specific church  self-identify as \nunaffiliated?\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe its my generational distaste for all things labeled. Or a \ngeneral understanding that no one denominational doctrine has all of \nthe answers  and that its even worse when they claim to. Part of \nwhats behind the overall trend is that those who have left a \ntraditional church are now simply more likely to embrace the \nclassification of unaffiliated than in previous survey years, or are \nmore easily shedding the labels of their childhood faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in simpler terms: I was baptized into the Catholic Church, went \nto Catholic school, and grew up in a very devoted Mexican Catholic \nextended family. But I also grew up Southern Baptist on my mothers \nside, attended a very large Baptist church for most of my life, went \non mission trips to Mexico, and was a three-times-per-week youth \ngroup adherent. Then I went to Baylor  the worlds largest Baptist \nuniversity  and somehow found one of the five or so Missouri Synod \nLutherans (a pastor-to-be at that) and ended up his bride. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo I have a complicated history in the church. And its not fully \ncaptured by any one designation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut every one of my peers has a story to tell, whether similar to \nmine or  more commonly, unfortunately  one of what Ill call \nevangelical trauma, turning them away from traditional church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy the shift?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this group of nones is a general progressive or left-leaning \nagreement on social issues. While our churches are teaching \nabstinence, picketing abortion clinics, and preaching on the evils of \nhomosexuality, the nones tend to see things differently. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 70 percent say abortion should be legal in all or most \ncases, and 73 percent say they are in favor of legalizing same-sex \nmarriage. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile our religious leaders may have thrown their support behind \nevery Republican presidential candidate before Mitt Romney for fear \nof his Mormonism, a slight majority of the nones say they are \nuncomfortable with politicians discussing how religious they are. \nFurther, 50 percent say they dont want politicians talking about \ntheir particular faith or beliefs. A full 65 percent say its not \nimportant for a candidate to even have strong religious beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while our churches held as fast to traditions and rules as they \ndid to the Bible, I believe a faction of the nones just said \nenough. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf not this, then what?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the reasons I feel uncomfortable with the nones designation \nis because it implies that lack of religion means lack of faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor some  atheists, agnostics, secularists  that is certainly true. \nBut there is a subset of this group that I would argue are a more \nBiblical representation of Christs church than many of the \ntraditional denominations. \u0014\n\u0014\nI brought them up earlier  house churches, small groups, missional \ncommunities. Its a move away from inward-looking mainline or \nmegachurches and toward outwardly focused, neighborhood-centric, \ncommunity-based ministry that serves to transform lives. Its \nsomething people, mostly of my generation, are hard-pressed to find \nin any of the classifications offered by the survey. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo I would caution church leaders convening to address the crisis of \nthe nones. Before assuming theyre part of a dangerous trend away \nfrom the church, classifying them as a demographic in desperate need \nof saving, or stereotyping an entire generation, talk to them. You \nmay be surprised. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn that vein, I introduce our new blog series: Meet the Nones. \nThrough this series, I hope to encourage discussion, debate, and \nelucidate the full picture of what it means to be losing your \nreligion in America.\u0014",

This world is moving fast; in this \narticle I want to begin to imagine where it might be going soon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a bit of a fashion at the moment for blog writers to publish \nletters to their teenage selves. It is not a form I find either \namusing or edifying in general, but one I noticed concluded after the \nusual platitudes with \"I know you think they're about to go bust, but \nbuy some Apple stock. Just trust me on this one!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember the days when it really did look like Apple was about to \nfall out of the computer market well enough to know that predicting \nthe future is more of a fool's game when it comes to technology than \nalmost anywhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat said, there is value sometimes in trying to look at what might \nbe around the next corner and to begin to get ready for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial media is in its infancy: Facebook began in 2004; Twitter in \n2006. Its growth has been astonishing, but we have to assume it has \nnot even begun to find its stable maturity yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese two platforms may disappear, eclipsed by others that offer a \nbetter user experience  or a better way of making money. (Facebook's \nbiggest single problem is that its income-generating activities, \nadverts and so on don't work well on mobile devices  smartphones. \nUnless it sorts that out, it will disappear fairly soon.) Predictions \nhave to be short-term because this world is changing so fast.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think we can say that barring some sort of major collapse of \ncivilization, social media will become increasingly important.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt will continue to be what it has already become  a way for \ngeographically dispersed communities to maintain connection.\u0014\n\u0014\nEach new generation of school leavers or university graduates will \nembrace it as the best way to remain in touch as they move apart.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this, I suspect that one of the futures for social media will be \nan increased ability to separate channels: I will have my church \ngroup and my university friends group and my family group and my \nacademic colleagues group and my former students group and some \nothers. I will be able to tune in to each one selectively.\u0014\n\u0014\n(Google+ and Facebook are already trying to do this in different \nways; I suspect, though, the future is a new platform that gets it \nright.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, localization services will become increasingly important. \nAgain, this is just beginning  particularly through a platform \ncalled FourSquare  but with the increasing adoption of smartphones, \nand their increasing integration of social media platforms, I see it \ngrowing and growing.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of looking at the world's restaurant reviews, you will be \nable to see where your tribe has been eating in this town. You will \nget notifications when you happen to be geographically close to \nsomeone who is on that list. Some social media updates will screen \nfor location (for example, traffic comments from other road users \nwithin 10 miles).\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, social media is presently essentially text-based; Facebook, \nTwitter and other services  especially Pinterest  have the ability \nto share images or videos, but you interact with them through a \nkeyboard.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlatforms like Second Life demonstrate the possibility of full \ngraphical interaction. They have not really caught on, I think, \nbecause we do not have the right interfaces to engage adequately with \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, we do have the right interfaces, but they're not yet \nconnected up. Think of a games console interface  the Wii or the \nKinect  which uses motion sensors to enable physical interaction. \nThose same motion sensors are already in your smartphone and could be \nconnected to your computer. Now add in the microphone and camera \nthat's already there. You can act, listen, see and talk to other \npeople in a virtual environment.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometime in the next few years, someone will get this right, and I \nsuspect it will be the next huge story in social media.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, another technology that has not quite yet found its niche, \nbut that will, is augmented reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proof-of-concept games and apps have been around for a couple of \nyears. You can use your iPhone camera and location device to give you \na moving view of your surroundings with a layer of extra information \non top.\u0014\n\u0014\nLink that extra layer to your social media feeds, put it in a better \ninterface than walking around holding a phone in front of your face, \nand you can imagine seeing the world with notes attached, left by \nyour friends and tailored to your interests.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow let's imagine putting all this together: social media feeds \nintegrated seamlessly into an augmented reality experience, which you \ninteract with not through a keyboard but through speech and movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvite your friends to see through your eyes and hear through your \nears in real time. Find  well, anything  but say a local cinema, \nand discover reviews of the films from people you know or trust as \nyou walk toward it. Talk to a friend's avatar (computer generated \ngraphical image) that is super-imposed onto your view of the park you \nare relaxing in.\u0014\n\u0014\nGet on a treadmill, and race against friends in different countries, \nseeing them run ahead or fall behind. Play chess and watch their face \nas they puzzle over a move. Dance with a partner a hundred miles away.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then start to think about what an online church might look like \nin a few years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the technology to do all this exists. It has not yet been \npackaged together in these ways (and I suspect that we need some \nfaster mobile internet connections before it could really work, but \nthat's not a huge problem either; free citywide wifi has been trialed \nin Norfolk in eastern England, which is not exactly at the beating \nheart of the technological revolution.).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe challenge is to find the way to make it easy for people to engage \nand enjoy the experience without a steep learning curve or the \npurchase of expensive equipment. I have little doubt it will happen.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this a good thing? Media platforms are ways of interacting. We saw \nlast summer that they can be used to plan riots and also to \ncoordinate the cleanup. The more social media pervades our lives, the \nmore ways of using it for good or ill we will discover.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe already give astonishing amounts of information about our lives to \nthe companies that sell us products and services. Potential levels of \nsurveillance will only increase.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, we also need to think about more subtle questions: How \ndoes the nature of the platform shape and direct the communication? \nDoes it tend to promote or to damage the best forms of human \ninteracting, and similarly the worst?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we ask for a Christian understanding of social media  its \npresent, never mind its future  we need to think well theologically \nabout what it is to communicate. That will be the theme of my third \nand last piece.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteve Holmes is a Baptist minister who teaches theology at the \nUniversity of St Andrews.

    "title": "7 REASONS CHURCHES FACE A CONFLICT PANDEMIC",
    "words": "Whenever I address a group about the work our organization does, I \nmention that one of our frequent calls is to help a congregation, \nstaff, judicatory or organization manage conflict. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur conflict intervention calls are on the upswing. My colleague, \nChris Gambill, goes so far as to say that congregational conflict is \npandemic at this point in the 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nI usually ask the group why they think conflict is surging. Most \ntimes, they get it right. The primary culprits, in no particular \norder, seem to be:\u0014\n\u0014\nLoss of civility in our culture. Social scientists have documented \nthe erosion of civility and social capital in a variety of settings. \nOur current political climate is a searing indictment of the failure \nof healthy public discourse. We find members of most congregations \npatterning their behavior in the church after the brutal tactics of \nour culture rather than the teachings of Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Recession continues to create high anxiety and stress in \nthe lives of congregation members. Fear about our economic future is \nthe order of the day. Though our currency invites us to properly \nalign our faith (\"In God We Trust\"), the prevailing mood of \ncongregations is intense anxiety about money, and is fertile ground \nfor conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe metrics of nearly every traditional congregation are grim. David \nOlson's research shows that congregations that were birthed prior to \n1980 and average less than 2,000 attendees a week are nearly all \nplateaued or declining. These numbers hold without regard for worship \nstyle, theology, location and so on. These declines, if not managed \nin a healthy way, become grounds for scapegoating of staff and \nleadership. \u0014\n\u0014\nClergy and congregational staff are frazzled, frustrated and on edge. \nThe Great Recession has seen positions downsized or eliminated, \nsalaries stagnate, benefits reduced and perks eliminated. At the same \ntime, the pastoral care load in most settings is growing, as \ncongregants seek out care and guidance through their own crises and \nstruggles. Being asked to do more, while simultaneously taking a cut \nin pay or benefits, often sets up clergy to be prone to reactive \nbehavior when disagreements arise. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost congregations are in some stage of discovery about the fact that \nwe now live in a post-Christian culture. The privileged status that \nwe enjoyed for decades is no more. Protestants are not only a \nminority in the U.S. population for the first time, their methods and \npractices are rapidly losing influence and impact after years of \nsuccess. Things we took for granted no longer hold true, and our \nresulting anger about this monumental shift in our culture has us \npoised for reactive and confrontational behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is lack of clarity in a congregation about mission and vision, \nlittle transparent communication, and a low level of authentic \ncommunity. These three \"C's\" nearly always describe congregations \nexperiencing high levels of conflict. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe programmatic model of discipleship that we have practiced over \nthe last 60 years has proven unable to build widespread, deeply \nspiritual disciples on a consistent basis. When we honestly assess \nthe spiritual depth of our regular attenders, the results are \nsobering. (See the Reveal study at RevealNow.com for an example.) \nWhen conflict emerges, rather than acting out of biblically informed \nethical standards of behavior, congregants revert quickly to lowest \ncommon denominator behavior that is corrosive and highly destructive. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter congratulating most groups on their insightful analysis, I then \nask them to imagine a way out of the morass of conflict that \nthreatens the very survival of so many churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWise groups eventually go back to their problem list and use it to \ncreate a mirror-image path forward that is filled with hope and \npossibility. They usually say something like this:\u0014\n\u0014\nTeach Christian ethical behavior from birth to death on a weekly \nbasis. Elected and paid leaders in the congregation covenant to hold \none another accountable for practicing Christ-like behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nOffer real and substantial financial assistance and planning to \ncongregants who are navigating the difficult economy. \u0014\n\u0014\nSee the crisis of congregational life as an opportunity to reinvent \nyour church for the opportunities before you. You have never been \nmore needed. Come to grips with the fact that, while the Gospel is \ntimeless, the methods of living and conveying that Gospel are \never-changing. Embrace change as your friend, not your enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\nPay attention to and take care of your clergy and staff.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdopt a missional, rather than a privileged, mindset as a church. \nCultivate a pervasive external focus to balance our natural internal \nfocus. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf nothing else, be relentless about seeking and finding clarity for \nyour purpose and direction. Start in Scripture, then claim your \nunique DNA, then project your best stories forward and dream \nGod-sized dreams.\u0014\n\u0014\nStop playing church and start following Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nPracticing these habits is a prescription not only for lower levels \nof conflict, but for a healthy, vital and thriving congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

    "title": "\"EVANGELICAL\" NO LONGER MEANS WHITE EVANGELICAL",
    "words": "The day after the election, Southern Baptist Seminary President \n\\Albert Mohler said, I think this was an evangelical disaster.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot really. But it was a disaster for the religious right, which had \nagain tied its faith to the partisan political agenda of the \nRepublican Party  which did lose the election. But Nov. 6 was an \neven deeper disaster for the religious right's leaders, because they \nwill no longer be able to control or easily co-opt the meaning of the \nterm evangelical.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this election, much of the media continued to use the word as \na political term  as a key constituency of the Republican \nconservative base. But what the media really means when they use term \nevangelical is conservative white evangelical. All other kinds of \nevangelicals are just never counted.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as the 2012 electoral results finally revealed the demographic \ntransformation of America  which has been occurring for quite some \ntime  it also dramatically demonstrated how the meaning of the word \nevangelical is being transformed.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical can no longer be accurately used to mean white \nevangelical.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious right leaders like Ralph Reed, Franklin Graham, and Tony \nPerkins did everything they could to turn evangelicals to Romney, \nespecially in the final run-up to the election. Their efforts to turn \nconcerns about abortion and gay marriage into partisan arguments for \na Republican victory and to threaten dangerous consequences of a \nDemocratic win  were, by their own estimates, the most extensive \never. But they failed and didn't change the outcome of the election.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most evangelicals are still pro-life, abortion is not their \nonly concern. Not all are convinced that Republicans have the best \nanswers to all the life issues. While most evangelicals are strongly \ncommitted to strengthening family life, not all think equal rights \nfor gay and lesbian people are a threat to the family. Poverty \nreduction, immigration reform, a consistent life ethic, the creation \ncare of environmental protection, a less militaristic foreign policy, \nand a deep commitment to racial and economic justice are all issues \nof concern.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ironic and tragic thing about the religious right is how little \nof their own agenda they have achieved. And by voting for a \nconservative ideological agenda, they have actually hurt the poor, \nresisted immigration reform, promoted endless wars, and neglected the \nenvironment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a new evangelical agenda for a new evangelical demographic.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time to change the meaning of the word evangelical in America. \nIt's time to tell the media to look at the changing demographics, \nchange its terminology, and take account of all the evangelicals. \nAnd it's time to describe the broader list of moral and biblical \nissues that evangelicals care about. This is a new, diverse coalition \nfor a new America  and a changing evangelical demographic is a \ncentral part of that. The narrow conservatism of the religious \nright's white evangelicals is simply not a faith to and for that new \nevangelical world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest mistake the religious right made was to make the word \nevangelical a political term. Evangelical is a theological \ncommitment, not a political one. It's about the centrality of Christ \nand the authority of the Bible. It's following Jesus and our \nobedience to the Scriptures that leads us to defend the poor, protect \nthe most vulnerable, welcome the stranger, seek racial reconciliation \nand justice, and be good stewards of the environment and peacemakers \nin a world of war.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourners, 11/15/12\u0014",

Even if you get far into the hiring process in a \nnon-traditional way, most companies will still want a traditional \nrsum at some point.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont ignore metrics and quantifiable data. Businesses exist to move \nthe needle. Explain in numbers what you personally did to help your \norganization improve. Did you save the company a million dollars?

The language of business is numbers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont send rsums to the CEO if youre applying for positions deep \nin the organization. Try Human Resources. Try the hiring manager. \nMaybe try the department leader. Sending it to me doesnt help. Do \nyou think I read a rsum from someone I dont know and immediately \ndrop everything to make a phone call on your behalf?\u0014\n\u0014\nDont apply for a job if you have zero experience with no \nexplanation. If you really want a job in a new area, you will need \nanother way in. Sending a rsum for a job completely out of your \narea of expertise will immediately set off loud warning bells. If you \nhave a marketing degree, but want to move into sales, its possible, \nbut you need to explain it. Show your commitment with an effective \ncover letter addressing the rationale behind your wish.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont use automated, mass mailing services to send out your rsum to \nCEOs. I get these every week. I recognize the same envelope, the \nsame font and the same type. I throw them away without opening them. \nSome people swear by these services and say that its all about the \nnumbers and the timing. It may depend on the position you are looking \nfor and at what level in the organization. Theyre not for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont mark personal and confidential on an envelope to get my \nattention. If you somehow make it past all of the gatekeepers, I will \nnot be very happy to find it is neither personal nor confidential, so \nI wont likely help.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont have someone else send a note for you if you havent applied \nyet. Better for you to apply and have that person send an email or \nsupportive note. Heres the question you dont want a hiring manager \nto think about: Are you looking for special favors after you are \nhired, too?\u0014\n\u0014\nDont use colored paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont skip dates. If you have a gap in employment, explain it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont email a rsum without emailing it to yourself first.

Dont inflate.\u0014\n\u0014\nDont have a rsum for every job you can dream up. Any more than \nthree and it means you have no plan for your career.

    "words": "5 Skills Required for Today's Ministers\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Ircel Harrison\u0014\nFebruary 5, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe minister needs to learn the skills of the cultural anthropologist \nin order to fully comprehend the context in which he or she \nministers, Harrison says.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral blog writers that I follow have recently posted observations \nabout the needs of pastoral leaders in the contemporary setting and \nin the coming years. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey have asked questions like, \"What are the competencies required?\" \nand \"What type of preparation is needed?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of these blogs, Alan Roxburgh made the following observations \nabout the preparation of clergy:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a disconnect between the kind of leader seminaries are \nproducing and the growing sense of the kinds of leaders now needed on \nthe ground in congregations. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a heightening of anxiety across church systems that what \nseminaries are producing is simply out of step with what is needed. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a growing conviction that the established model of the \n'professional' clergy will go the way of the dodo bird. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are in need of shaping new kinds of contextual learning \ncommunities, which are working at discovering together what the new \nleadership needs to look like. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is not an abandonment of classical or intellectual skills but a \nloss of confidence in the existing professional, degreed models of \nleadership.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to share some ideas about addressing the apparent disconnect \nbetween the kind of pastoral leaders that seminaries are producing \nand the type of leaders that churches need or will need in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are several skill sets that ministers will need to meet the \nchanging needs of faith communities in the decades ahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, ministers must be equipped to be spiritual directors. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only will this strengthen the life of the minister, this will \nalso help the clergyperson to guide individuals as they identify, \nlearn and practice the spiritual disciplines that will enrich their \nrelationship with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a key aspect of discipleship and one that churches have long \nneglected. As a result, Christians have often felt compelled to \nexplore non-Christian practices to give them spiritual grounding.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, ministers need to learn how to read their culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean uncritically embracing the popular culture, \ncompromising the gospel message or \"going native.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt does mean that the minister needs to learn the skills of the \ncultural anthropologist in order to fully comprehend the context in \nwhich he or she ministers  the innate values and norms in the \nculture, the way that people really communicate with one another, and \nthe nature of authority, for example.\u0014\nIn so doing, the minister can function more effectively as a leader, \npastoral minister, proclaimer of the gospel, and change agent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the \"dirty little secret\" of many seminary degree programs is \nthat they devote very little time in the curriculum to developing \ncommunicators.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents can complete some courses of study and take only one \npreaching course. Of course, communication is not limited to \npreaching, but many seminary graduates are poor writers and have only \nthe basic skills of teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinisters need to be able to communicate effectively, both orally and \nverbally, in a variety of media and settings.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, today's and tomorrow's minister must be an intentional \nnetworker. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe or she must be able to connect with people in various contexts in \norder to advance the ministry that God has provided. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis starts in seminary by exposing students to leaders in all kinds \nof settings  religion, business, education, health, media  so that \nthey can \"learn the language\" and be able to relate to people both in \nthe church and in the marketplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, most 21st-century ministers will need to have \nentrepreneurial skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditional resources for ministry are becoming scarcer, so the \nminister is going to have to be able to find, cultivate and use \nresources  personnel, finances, space and technology  from new and \nunexpected places.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe resources are there, but they must be repurposed for Kingdom work.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, I realize that no one individual will possess all of these \nskill sets, but various ministry settings will require several of \nthese.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis will require both theological educators and prospective \nministers to embrace new approaches to formation for ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is coaching coordinator for Pinnacle Leadership \nAssociates and is associate professor of ministry praxis at Central \nBaptist Theological Seminary\u0014",

Now a group of noted \ntheologians has assessed Licona's controversial analysis in a \nroundtable discussion in the Southeastern Theological Review.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe journal, published by Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, \nalso included four articles related to Licona's book The Resurrection \nof Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach, which has been praised as \na landmark achievement but also has renewed concerns over biblical \ninerrancy because of the Matthew passage.\u0014\n\u0014\nLicona, of Houston Baptist University, was included in the \nroundtable, along with Danny Akin of Southeastern Seminary, Craig \nBlomberg of Denver Seminary, Paul Copan of Palm Beach Atlantic \nUniversity, Michael Kruger of Reformed Theological Seminary, and \nCharles Quarles of Louisiana College.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn The Resurrection of Jesus, Licona presents a defense of the \nhistoricity of the bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead, \narguing that Jesus' resurrection must have been literal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the passage at issue is Matthew 27:51-53, which reads: \"At that \nmoment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. \nThe earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies \nof many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out \nof the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city \nand appeared to many people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLicona, a former apologetics coordinator at the North American \nMission Board, writes, \"It seems best to regard this difficult text \nin Matthew as a poetic device added to communicate that the Son of \nGod had died and that impending judgment awaited Israel.\" The bodies \nof many holy people, Licona suggests, were not literally raised to \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/Grave Theology Debate\u0014",

    "words": "5 Things a Pastor Learned in the Hospital\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Chuck Warnock\u0014\nApril 9, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nWith an almost three-week hospital stay behind me, I realized there \nwere several things I learned from the experience. Here are five of \nthem: \u0014\n\u0014\n1. People who are in the hospital are really sick\u0014\n\u0014\nYou might think that would be obvious, but when I say sick, I mean \nreally sick. With today's cost-driven medical care, you've got to be \nreally sick to be admitted, and really, really sick to stay for \nalmost three weeks like I did.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecognizing the degree of a person's illness should have a great deal \nto do with how we minister to those in the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Brief visits are good visits\u0014\n\u0014\nI enjoyed seeing everyone who came to see me. However, when I was at \nmy sickest, the shorter the visit the more I appreciated it. There \nare several reasons for brief visits:\u0014\n\u0014\n? The patient is really sick.\u0014\n\u0014\n? Being really sick means your attention span, your strength and your \nability to carry on a conversation are all limited.\u0014\n\u0014\n? Hospital patients often have to use the bathroom more frequently \nthan others due to the nature of their illness and medications they \nmight be receiving.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeeping your visit short avoids the embarrassment of their having to \nask you to leave while they call for the nurse for assistance.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Privacy and dignity need to be preserved by visitors\u0014\n\u0014\nI discovered that being in the hospital means that doctors and nurses \nask you about bowel movements, urination, incontinence and other \npersonal body functions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften they do this right in front of everyone in the room, assuming \nthat it's OK to ask any question with guests present.\u0014\n\u0014\nVisitors should help the patient preserve what little privacy and \ndignity they have left by excusing themselves when the doctor enters \nthe room or when the nurse comes in to check on the patient.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy exhibiting sensitivity toward the patient's privacy and dignity, \nguests will show respect for the patient.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Let sleeping patients lie\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieve it or not, hospital life is not conducive to sleep.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost every night at 3 a.m., a lab technician would come in to draw \nblood for lab tests.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, she had to turn on the overhead light, and I had to sit up \nfor her to find an unused vein  they grew harder to find each day  \nfrom which to draw blood.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, if you come into a hospital room where the patient is asleep, \nwrite a note and then quietly leave. The patient will appreciate your \nvisit and your thoughtfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Offer specific ways you can help\u0014\nOffer specific ways you are able to help make the patient's stay \neasier. While there, we had people offer to take our dirty clothes \nhome and wash them. Others brought us food or drinks, and some \noffered to do so when we got home.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo men in our church installed a new shower head in our shower so I \ncould shower seated. Others offered transportation, help with travel \nand parking expenses, and many assured us of their prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaying, \"I can't do everything, but I can wash clothes. Can I take \nyours home and wash them and return them tomorrow?\" is a great way of \noffering to do something specific.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, I learned more than five things while in the hospital and \nmaybe I'll share some of those later.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for now, these are things that can enhance your hospital \nministry, whether you're a pastor or concerned church member.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat have you've learned from your experience being hospitalized? \nWhat things would you add to this \u0014\nlist?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nChuck Warnock is pastor of Chatham Baptist Church in Chatham, Va.\u0014",

A 29-year-old man from the \nhouse, identified as Alex Donald Jackson, was arrested on suspicion \nof cultivating marijuana.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe owner was cited previously because one of the dogs had attacked a \nhorse, Villa said. She did not immediately have details.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dogs were being kept under quarantine for rabies observation at a \nLancaster shelter, said Marcia Mayeda, the county's animal control \ndirector.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They're fine now,\" she said of their behavior. \"They're all \nseparated so they're not able to engage in a pack behavior, where \nthey group up together and may act aggressively.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir strange surroundings also may have intimidated them, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMayeda said the animals, five females and three males, are all adults \nweighing between 40 and 70 pounds, with the biggest being an \noverweight female Australian shepherd mix. The other mixed-breed \nappears to be a Labrador-collie, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all of the dogs are licensed, spayed or neutered as required by \ncounty and state law, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe agency will seek to have any dogs involved in the attack \ndestroyed, Mayeda said. The others will be licensed, spayed or \nneutered as required and three of them  the legal limit  will be \nreturned to the owner while the rest will be placed for adoption if \nthey are friendly, Mayeda said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there still was a chance that the attacking animals were \nstrays.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In these areas, you might have a situation where people dump animals \nout in rural areas,\" said John Mlynar, a spokesman for the nearby \ncity of Palmdale.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople living near the site of the attack said stray dogs constantly \nroam the area and have attacked people before.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's really scary,\" Diane Huffman, of Littlerock, told KABC-TV. \"I \ndon't know what to think. I really think I'm going to be getting a \ngun to protect myself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jogger's death was the latest of at least five deadly dog attacks \nin California in the past two years.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast month, Claudia Gallardo, 38, of Stockton, was mauled to death by \na pit bull in the front yard of a home where the dog lived.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn February, Elsie Grace, 91, of Hemet, was killed by a pair of pit \nbulls at a motel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn June 2011, two pit bulls escaped from their yard and mauled a \nneighbor in her San Diego backyard. Emako Mendoza, 75, suffered arm \nand leg amputations before dying months later. The dog's two owners \nwere convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn June 2012, an 8-month-old boy, Tyzhel Latella McWilliams, was \nmauled to death by a pit bull at a home in Lemon Grove, near San \nDiego.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnyone who spots an aggressive dog, even behind a fence, can contact \nLos Angeles County animal control officers to investigate, Mayeda \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf behavior problems are found, the owner will be cited for \nviolations or encouraged to seek dog training.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They'll be put on notice that there are people concerned about their \nanimals,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press\u0014",

    "words": "10 reasons why you should pay attention to the new seniors (Part 1)\u0014\nJune 2, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres a wave coming, and most churches are not ready for the new \nseniors. This is extremely unfortunate because the United States is \nabout to experience one of the greatest waves of adults retiring \nand/or reinventing themselves and starting a second or third career \nbased on their lifetime of experiences in the business world. Baby \nBoomers are retiring in massive numbers every day and will present \ngreat opportunities to churches that havent written off senior \nadults. One thing is for sure: the new seniors wont look and act \nlike the present senior adults in our churches. Treat them like they \nare, and youll lose them fast.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are living longer these days (during the Roman Empire, average \nlife expectancy was 22 years; in 1900 the average life expectancy in \nthe U.S. was 47; by 2050 it is projected that Americans will live to \nan average age of 89). Like it or not, our congregations are going to \ngray. Only a few churches will be ready for this massive wave of new \nretirees. Just how massive is it? Lets see.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people known as seniors are actually 3 generations in 1. \nSeniors were influenced by the Great Depression; The Greatest \nGeneration lived through WWII and started families (and the baby \nboom); the Silent Generation were relatively small in number and \nfinancially secure.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are 10 reasons why you should pay attention to the new seniors\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans age 65+ are the fastest growing segment in the population\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of Americans 65+ has increased 12-fold (3.1M to 37.9M)\u0014\n\u0014\nAn American turns 60 every 7 seconds; 24 hours from now, 11,520 more \nadults will have turned 60\u0014\n\u0014\nThe senior segment of the population will double by 2030 (39.6M in \n2009 versus 72.09M in 2030)this is according to the US Census Bureau\u0014\n\u0014\nThe older population grew 18 times as fast as the younger generation \nbetween 2000 and 2010 (US Census data)\u0014\n\u0014\nCentenarians (people living to age 100) will grow from 134,697 in \n2020 to 600,909 in 2050; we are living longer\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 2030, 20% of the US population will be age 65+ (thats one in 5 \nAmericans)\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 2020, 22% of the workforce will be men age 65+; 14% will consist \nof women age 65+\u0014\n\u0014\n10 states have senior adult populations of over 1M people \n(California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas)\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to LifeWay Research, for the decade between 2000 and 2010, \nsenior adults are the only group that has ended the decade with a \nhigher number of baptisms than it began with 10 years ago; in fact, \nthe number of baptisms among seniors has been very constant across \nthe years in this past decade (in other words, you can still reach \nseniors with the gospel).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new seniors (the Boomers who are retiring) arent going to be \nlike the present group of seniors in our churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill you and your church be ready for this new wave of retirees, or \nwill you get wiped out when the wave hits? Do you think you can \ncontinue with your potluck dinners and game nights and reach the new \nwave of retirees? You wont.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you written off older adults and focused your ministry on \nyounger adults? You should rethink your plans!\u0014",

Alex Johnson, staff writer, NBC News\u0014\n\u0014\nA 5-year-old boy was killed when a 150-pound dog attacked him in \nArkansas, where he was staying with family friends after a tornado \nthat devastated Moore, Okla. last month, destroyed his family's home, \nauthorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy, whose name hasn't been released, was pronounced dead at a \nhospital Sunday after the dog attacked him about noon (1 p.m. ET) at \na home in Jessieville, about 50 miles west of Little Rock, Garland \nCounty sheriff's deputies said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy and his 2-year-old sister were staying there while his \nparents worked to rebuild after a powerful tornado killed 24 people \nand injured almost 400 others May 20 in Moore, near Oklahoma City.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To me, it's heartbreaking,\" Garland County sheriff's Deputy Scott \nHinojosa told NBC station KARK-TV of Little Rock. \"I've got a \n5-year-old daughter. You can't imagine what this family and friends \nare going through right now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities said the boy was upset and crying, which the dog, a \nBullmastiff, possibly interpreted as an aggressive act.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dog's owner, Lynn Geiling, 50, a friend of the boy's parents, \ntold investigators she tried to pull the dog off the boy but got \nthere too late. He was pronounced dead at Mercy Hospital in Hot \nSprings with severe lacerations to his head and his neck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dog ran away after the attack, but investigators found it Monday \nand said it would likely be destroyed. It wasn't known yet whether \nits owners will face charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bullmastiff isn't the same breed as the notorious pit bull \nterrier, which is often bred to be an aggressive fighting dog. But it \nis bred to serve as a watchdog and to protect the home. The American \nBullmastiff Association says the breed needs no special training to \n\"react appropriately if his family is threatened.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Never leave a child unattended with your Bullmastiff,\" \\the \nassociation warns on its website. \"They are pack animals and will \nfind their natural place in the pack if left to natural processes. \nThat place may be at the top of the pecking order instead of below \nyounger family members if left unchecked.\"\u0014",

But after their dad abandoned the family, a week after \ntheir 22nd birthday, Karl disappeared. For 23 years Leslie kept \nsearching for his brother. Finally, on May 5th, 2013 the police found \nKarl dead on York Lane in Sydney. Karl had died where he had spent \nmuch of the second half of his lifeon the street as a homeless \nperson.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the police contacted Leslie, he travelled to Sydney to take his \nbrother back home and bury him. Much to his surprise, Leslie found a \nbank account in Karl's name that was worth $30,000. The Australian \nDepartment of Human Services had been depositing a check into Karl's \naccount every month for the past 23 years. Leslie wanted to use the \nfunds to support the dedicated people and shelters which had \nsupported his brother. Unfortunately, the money was earmarked for the \nnext of kin, which in this case was Karl and Leslie's father, the man \nwho had abandoned both brothers decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Leslie also discovered an exception to the financial regulations: \nHe could use the money from the account to pay for Leslie's funeral \nand burial expensesthe entire balance of $30,000. So Leslie \norganized a lavish service for Karl. Before the funeral, he hosted a \ndelicious hot lunch with a bouquet of flowers on every table for all \nthe men and women who lived at the shelter that Karl frequented. For \nthe funeral Leslie hired the finest organist in Sydney to play hymns. \nLeslie designed and printed a beautiful order of service on the best \npaper available. Flowers filled the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the eulogy for his brother Leslie said, \"I never gave up \nlooking for my brother.\" Leslie chose the following verse from the \nGospel of Luke: \"'My son,' the father said [to the prodigal son], \n'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had \nto celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and \nis alive again; he was lost and is found.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Dr. Laurel Moffatt, \"Lost and Found,\" Centre for Public \nChristianity (6-18-13)\u0014",

    "words": "13 Things I Learned About Church History From 'The Story of \nChristianity, Vol. 2' by Just L. Gonzalez\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRachel Held Evans Christianity Today \u0014\n\u0014\n1. People who say religious dialog is more vitriolic than ever know \nnothing about church history. See the Martin Luther insult generator \nfor some examples.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Luther wasn't a biblicist. While he insisted on the centrality of \nScripture in the Christian life, he believed that final authority \nrested neither in the church nor in the Bible, but in the gospel of \nJesus Christ, who is the Word of God incarnate. The purpose of \nScripture, he believed, was to point to Christ. (And he wasn't a fan \nof the Epistle of James or the book of Revelation.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Fun story: This dude named John Knox really, really, really hated \nCatholics. He also really, really, really hated women. So he wrote \nthis book called The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous \nRegiment of Women, attacking many of the Catholic women who then \nreigned in Europe. His work, writes Gonzalez, was poorly timed, \nfor it had scarcely been circulated in England when Mary Tudor died \nand was succeeded by Elizabeth. Elizabeth was Protestant and a \npotential ally of Knox's. Although the book was written against her \nnow dead half-sister, continues Gonzalez, Elizabeth resented much \nof what it said, for its arguments based on anti-feminine prejudice \ncould just as easily apply to her. This hindered the natural alliance \nthat should have developed between Elizabeth and John Knox, whose \nretractions did not suffice to appease the English queen. LESSON: \nDon't expect women to forget your sexist remarks the minute you need \ntheir political help. Also, I call dibs on The Monstrous Regiment of \nWomen for a band name.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n4. More Anabaptists were martyred in the 16th century than Christians \nas a whole in the three centuries of persecution that preceded \nConstantine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n5. At a time when Christians were condemning, expelling, and killing \none another over doctrinal differences, a guy named Georg Calixtus \nhad the crazy idea that perhaps one could hold to one's convictions \n(his were Lutheran) without condemning as heretics those with whom \none disagrees. He argued that there was a difference, after all, \nbetween heresy and error. This made far too much sense, and Calixtus \nwas largely written off by his contemporaries. But he sounded cool to \nme so I gave him hipster glasses and a hat:\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Every so often, someone convinces a bunch of people that the end \nof the world is at hand. They are always wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n7. One of these guys, an Anabaptist named Melchior Hoffman, convinced \nhis followers to take over the city of Mnster and make it the New \nJerusalem, where everyone had visions and practiced polygamy. It's \nkind of a skeleton in the Anabaptist closet. But that's okay. Pretty \nmuch every denomination has several thousand such skeletons...many of \nthem literal... so none of us should get too proud. (You Calvinists \nhave Michael Servetus.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n8. King Jameslike of the King James Biblewas probably gay. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Christians have been using the Bible/religion to support violence, \ncolonialism, slavery, ethnic cleansing, misogyny, anti-Semitism and \nreligious intolerance for centuries. We cannot gloss over this \nreality. (Also, I know there's this big push among the neo-Reformed \ncrowd right now to make the Puritans seem not-so-bad, but the \nPuritans did some pretty bad thingsto women, to Native Americans, to \nQuakers, and to religious dissidents. Seems like we should be able to \nlook at the Puritans with a bit more nuance, without glorifying them \non the one hand or demonizing them on the other.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n10. John Wesley did NOT want to break from Anglicanism. He never set \nout to start a new denomination, but felt compelled to reach those \nwhom the church was not reaching and as a result, inevitably \ngenerated a separate church, due mostly to practical concerns rather \nthan theological ones. This really bothered him until his dying day. \nAnother interesting fact: Wesley didn't support the American \nrevolutionary war because he could not fathom how the rebels could \nclaim they were fighting for freedom while they themselves held \nslaves.\u0014\n\u0014\n11.Teresa of Avila is the only woman in the history of the church to \nhave founded monastic orders for both women and men.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. The center of Christianity is shifting from the global West to \nthe global South and East.\u0014",

    "words": "10 Things Ive Learned About Church History From The Story of \nChristianity, Vol. 1 by Justo L. Gonzalez  \u0014\n\u0014\nRachel Held Evans\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Christians have never been in full agreement when it comes to \ntheology. (And our little ideological blog spats have NOTHING on the \nArian controversy or the Inquisition, let me tell you!) But often, \nthese disagreements and controversies lead to important developments \nin Christian thought, theology, and practice. The Nicene Creed, for \nexample, was formulated largely as a response to Arianism. (The \nApostle\\u2019s Creed is older.) I find this oddly comforting. \nThere\\u2019s less pressure to figure everything out. We\\u2019re \nalways in process, always debating and discussing, always getting a \nlittle bit right and a lot wrong.&nbsp;\u0014\n\u0014\n2.Constantine was not baptized until just before his death. And his \nconversion to Christianity is as big a deal as we make it out to be. \nIt changed Christianity forever and marked the beginning of an \nongoing, uncomfortable, and at times destructive relationship between \nChristianity and power.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Calls for social justice arent new or trendy, but have been a part \nof church teachings for many centuries.See the writings of John \nChrysostom, Basil, Ambrose, St. Francis, and many others. If one who \ntakes the clothing off another is called a thief, why give any other \nname to one who can clothe the naked and refuses to do so,\" wrote \nBasil. The bread that you withhold belongs to the poor; the cape that \nyou hide in your chest belongs to the naked; the shoes rotting in \nyour house belong to those who must go unshod.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Also not as new as I once thought: bishops, and church hierarchy \nin general.\u0014\n\u0014\n5.I always thought that the Council of Nicea marked the final \nacceptance of orthodoxy when it came to the divinity of Christ. But \nArianism the belief that Jesus was created by God as a subordinate \nand separate entity, not the incarnation of God made a pretty serious \ncomeback, and with the support of the empire, it nearly won the day! \nJerome wrote that the world woke up as from a slumber, and discovered \nitself to be Arian.Athanasius and other supporters of Nicene theology \nwere exiled and persecuted for defending orthodoxy, but in the end, \ntheir tenacity, patience, and thoughtfulness prevailed. Also, \nAthanasius was nicknamed \"the black dwarf.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n6.Pretty much every time I conclude that a Church Father seems like a \npretty cool guy, I learn that he hated Jews and/or women.\u0014\n\u0014\n7.I think it's safe to say Saint Anthony was an introvert.\u0014\n\u0014\n8.In the fourth and fifth centuries there was a Christian sect called \nDonatism. Some Donatists peasants were convinced that there was no \ndeath more glorious than that of the martyrs, but since the \npersecution of Christians had ended, they committed to violently \nresisting those they perceived to be heretics. Gonzalez writes that \nin some cases, this quest for martyrdom rose to such a pitch that \npeople committed mass suicide by jumping off cliffs.\" There's always \nthis tendency to take a good thing to its extreme, whether it's \nrespect for martyrdom, veneration of the saints, asceticism;and \nsolitude, or engagement with the culture\";\u0014\n\u0014\n9.Monastics have always struggled to hold in tension the desire for \nsolitude with the importance of community and service.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've found that most Christians know very little about the history of \nthe church. And we Protestants have the unfortunate habit of skipping \nfrom the epistles of Paul to Martin Luther and the 95-theses, leaving \ncenturies of church history in the dust.\u0014\nHow can we do better?\u0014",

    "words": "13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do \u0014\nNovember 13 by Amy Morin in Communication, Motivation\u0014\n\u0014\n1. They Don't Waste Time Feeling Sorry for Themselves\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people don't sit around feeling sorry about their \ncircumstances or how others have treated them. Instead, they take \nresponsibility for their role in life and understand that life isn't \nalways easy or fair.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. They Don't Give Away Their Power\u0014\n\u0014\nThey don't allow others to control them, and they don't give someone \nelse power over them. They don't say things like, My boss makes me \nfeel bad, because they understand that they are in control over \ntheir own emotions and they have a choice in how they respond.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. They Don't Shy Away from Change\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people don't try to avoid change. Instead, they \nwelcome positive change and are willing to be flexible. They \nunderstand that change is inevitable and believe in their abilities \nto adapt.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. They Don't Waste Energy on Things They Can't Control\u0014\n\u0014\nYou won't hear a mentally strong person complaining over lost luggage \nor traffic jams. Instead, they focus on what they can control in \ntheir lives. They recognize that sometimes, the only thing they can \ncontrol is their attitude.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. They Don't Worry About Pleasing Everyone\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people recognize that they don't need to please \neveryone all the time. They're not afraid to say no or speak up when \nnecessary. They strive to be kind and fair, but can handle other \npeople being upset if they didn't make them happy.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. They Don't Fear Taking Calculated Risks\u0014\n\u0014\nThey don't take reckless or foolish risks, but don't mind taking \ncalculated risks. Mentally strong people spend time weighing the \nrisks and benefits before making a big decision, and they're fully \ninformed of the potential downsides before they take action.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. They Don't Dwell on the Past\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people don't waste time dwelling on the past and \nwishing things could be different. They acknowledge their past and \ncan say what they've learned from it. However, they don't constantly \nrelive bad experiences or fantasize about the glory days. Instead, \nthey live for the present and plan for the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. They Don't Make the Same Mistakes Over and Over\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people accept responsibility for their behavior and \nlearn from their past mistakes. As a result, they don't keep \nrepeating those mistakes over and over. Instead, they move on and \nmake better decisions in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. They Don't Resent Other People's Success\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people can \\appreciate and celebrate other people's \nsuccess in life. They don't grow jealous or feel cheated when others \nsurpass them. Instead, they recognize that success comes with hard \nwork, and they are willing to work hard for their own chance at \nsuccess.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. They Don't Give Up After the First Failure\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people don't view failure as a reason to give up. \nInstead, they use failure as an opportunity to grow and improve. They \nare willing to keep trying until they get it right.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. They Don't Fear Alone Time\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people can tolerate being alone and they don't fear \nsilence. They aren't afraid to be alone with their thoughts and they \ncan use downtime to be productive. They enjoy their own company and \naren't dependent on others for companionship and entertainment all \nthe time but instead can be \\happy alone.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. They Don't Feel the World Owes Them Anything\u0014\n\u0014\nMentally strong people don't feel entitled to things in life. They \nweren't born with a mentality that others would take care of them or \nthat the world must give them something. Instead, they look for \nopportunities based on their own merits.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. They Don't Expect Immediate Results\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether they are working on improving their health or getting a new \nbusiness off the ground, mentally strong people don't expect \nimmediate results. Instead, they apply their skills and time to the \nbest of their ability and understand that real change takes time.\u0014",

His body \nwas found the following day. Previous threats and persecution of his \nfamily indicate he was targeted because of his familys faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe unprecedented torture and death of this innocent child sadden \nour hearts incredibly, says K.P.

In this horrible tragedy, we find strength and hope in \nJesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Yohannan, persecution of Christians has increased by \nmore than 400 percent in the past few years.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnmols parents last saw him when he left their home for Sunday \nschool. When he did not return, they filed a missing persons report \nwith local authorities. By Monday evening, they identified their \nchilds body at the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnmols face was burned, his hands were slashed and destroyed by \nfire, and his mouth was tied shut. Hot fragments of coal or firewood \nhad been placed on his stomach, burning his abdomen, and his toes \nwere broken.\u0014\n\u0014\nAutopsy reports came back indicating Anmols final cause of death was \ndrowning.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least 200 people attended the final viewing and funeral.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wail of the people and the parents was heartbreaking, says one \nofficial. It was truly a painful and intolerable incident. The \nkidnappers had tortured the child in such an inhuman way. It was very \nclear that he was brutally killed.\u0014",

I just didnt want the media, the press, all that \nkind of stuff. So I just kept putting it off and putting it off, and \nputting it off.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally at the behest of the Western Canada Lottery Corp., he agreed \nto go public and have his photo taken.

    "words": "10 reasons Why Men Should Not Be Ordained For Ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. A mans place is in the army.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. The pastoral duties of men who have children might distract them \nfrom the responsibility of being a parent.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. The physique of men indicates that they are more suited to such \ntasks as chopping down trees and wrestling mountain lions. It would \nbe unnatural for them to do ministerial tasks.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Man was created before woman, obviously as a prototype. Thus, they \nrepresent an experiment rather than the crowning achievement of \ncreation.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Men are too emotional to be priests or pastors. Their conduct at \nfootball and basketball games demonstrates this.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Some men are handsome, and this will distract women worshipers.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Pastors need to nurture their congregations. But this is not a \ntraditional male role. Throughout history, women have been recognized \nas not only more skilled than men at nurturing, but also more \nfervently attracted to it. This makes them the obvious choice for \nordination.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Men are prone to violence. No really masculine man wants to settle \ndisputes except by fighting about them. Thus they would be poor role \nmodels as well as dangerously unstable in positions of leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. The New Testament tells us that Jesus was betrayed by a man. His \nlack of faith and ensuing punishment remind us of the subordinated \nposition that all men should take.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Men can still be involved in church activities, even without being \nordained. They can sweep sidewalks, repair the church roof, and \nperhaps even lead the song service on Fathers Day. By confining \nthemselves to such traditional male roles, they can still be vitally \nimportant in the life of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nUPDATED 5/2: Thanks to our commenters, weve tracked down the \noriginal source.

It has weaknesses and flaws.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur illusions are shattered and we have to face reality. I like to \ntell people: If you are looking for a perfect church, don't join it \nbecause you will ruin it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third crisis comes when we feel misunderstood or neglected by the \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fourth is when we feel disappointed with ourselves because of all \nthe anger, jealousies or petty frustrations that boil up within us.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing in community forces us to confront these crises.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are some who will leave the church when facing these \nchallenges, but those who are committed to the community and work \nthrough these challenges are those who deepen their spiritual lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who remain become wiser, better, stronger and more \ncompassionate and loving.

    "words": "1st Meeting of \nthe Council of Chalcedon\u0014\n                                                                     \nChurch History Timeline\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen Jesus asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" he \nreceived a multitude of answers. Some said he was John the Baptist, \nsome said he was Elijah or Jeremiah or another one of the prophets. \nThe disciple Peter came up with the correct answer when he said, \"You \nare the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" The early \tChristians \naccepted Peter's confession, but they had many different ideas of \nexactly what it meant for Jesus to be the Christ. What was Jesus' \nreal nature and person like? How was he related to God and to the \nFather? To what degree was he truly human? There were many debates \nover these issues in the fourth through the sixth centuries of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen Constantine became emperor of the Roman Empire and made \nChristianity a legal religion, he believed unity of the Church was \nimportant to the political strength of the empire. So, in 325 he \ncalled a Council at Nicea to settle disputes over the nature of \nChrist. The council issued the Nicene Creed, agreeing that Christ was \nboth man and God and that as the Son of God he had the same divine \nnature as the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOnce it was accepted that Jesus was both fully God and fully man, \ndebates began to rage over how Christ's deity was related to his \nhumanity. One group, the Apollinarians, said the divine Word of \nChrist took the place of Jesus' human mind and will so that his \ndivine nature was always predominant. Others argued back that if \nJesus did not have a human mind and will he could not be fully human. \nYet another group argued that at the incarnation the divine and human \nwere so combined in the person of Christ as to produce a new, unique \nindividual. Others again thought that the divine and human natures of \nJesus were kept so separate that it was almost like he was two \npersons. Very often each conflicting group became associated with a \nparticular city - Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, Constantinople, so that \npolitical rivalry became entangled in theological debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 450, Emperor Theodosius died from a fall off his horse and \nhis brother-in-law Marcian ascended the imperial throne. Spurred by \nhis wife, the Empress Pulcheria, one of Marcian's first acts was to \ncall a church council to deal with some of these religious problems. \nHe hoped for religious unity as a support to the political unity of \nthe empire -- a political unity to face the growing military threat \nfrom the east. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, October 8, 451, the largest of all church councils \nopened at Chalcedon, near Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Five or \nsix hundred bishops were present representing the many conflicting \nviews found within the church. After much debate, on the 22nd of \nOctober, a Chalcedonian creed was adopted which re-affirmed the \ndivine and human natures of Christ recognized at Nicea and further \nstated that the two natures of Christ were \"without confusion, \nwithout conversion, without severance, and without division.\" Jesus \nwas affirmed as being both fully divine and human. His two natures \nwere combined in one person without his becoming less divine or less \nhuman. The work Christ did was the work of his whole person, not of \none nature or another. In that day Pope Leo stated the Chalcedonian \nposition that in Christ the \"lowliness of man and the majesty of God \nperfectly pervade one another...the two natures make only one person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Egyptian, Turkish and eastern Christians could not bring \nthemselves to accept the Chalcedon Creed, but it has been accepted by \nthe Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. \nThe Chalcedon Creed is an important basic statement on the nature and \nperson of Christ, but even this creed which has stood for centuries \ncannot fathom fully the wondrous depths and mystery of Christ's \nperson and nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

Rehearsals are every Wednesday night, which means that for those \nfew hours, you will significantly reduce your risk of contracting \ntendonitis from nonstop use of a TV remote control or computer mouse. \u0014\n9. Because you wear a choir robe every Sunday, you are liberated from \na task many men find quite challenging: finding clothes that match \nproperly. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. From your special vantage point every Sunday, in which you look \nout at the entire congregation from the choir loft, you will develop \ninteresting new hobbies. Among these is a little guessing game called \n\"Who's Praying, Who's Sleeping?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n7. On the other hand, sitting in full view of many people on a weekly \nbasis makes it much less likely that you yourself will give in to a \nchronic lack of sleep...although it has been known to happen. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. If you think your singing in the shower sounds good now, just wait \ntill you've been singing with us for a few weeks. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Singing in a choir is one of the few activities for men that does \nnot require electronic equipment or expensive power tools. This could \nbe good for the family budget. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. For the fitness buffs, singing in the choir is not only heart \nhealthy but soul healthy. There are no monthly membership fees, and \nit's a lot easier on the knees than jogging. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. If you think you've done everything there is to do, and there are \nno great challenges left in life, try singing with us and staying on \npitch, guys. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Choir rehearsal lasts half as long as a professional football \ngame, but is at least twice as satisfying. (Don't worry, though, the \nrehearsals are on Wednesday, not Monday nights.) \u0014\n\u0014\n1. When people ask if you've been behaving yourself, you can say with \nthe utmost sincerity, \"Hey, I'm a choir boy.\" (from Pastor Tim's \nCleanLaugh list)\u0014",

    "words": "13 Southern Sayings that the Rest of America Wont Understand\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted on May 19, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nLanguage discrepancies naturally arise in different geographic \nregions, like the raging pop vs. soda debate. But the South \nundoubtedly takes the cake.\u0014\n\u0014\nConversations south of the Mason-Dixon line will befuddle anyone not \nborn there.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe chose 13 of the most ridiculous Southern sayings  and tried to \nexplain them\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Were living in high cotton.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton has long been a key crop to the Souths economy, so every \nharvest farmers pray for tall bushes loaded with white fluffy balls \nin their fields. Tall cotton bushes are easier to pick and yield \nhigher returns. If youre living in high cotton, it means youre \nfeeling particularly successful or wealthy.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. She was madder than a wet hen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHens sometimes enter a phase of broodiness  theyll stop at \nnothing to incubate their eggs and get agitated when farmers try to \ncollect them. Farmers used to dunk hens in cold water to break \ntheir broodiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou dont want to be around a hormonal hen after shes had an ice \nbath.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. He could eat corn through a picket fence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis describes someone with an unfortunate set of buck teeth. They \ntend to stick up and outward, like a horses teeth. Imagine a horse \neating a carrot, and youll get the picture.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. You cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pigs ear may look soft, pink, and shiny, but youre not fooling \nanyone by calling it your new Marc Jacobs bag. A Southerner might say \nthis about her redneck cousin who likes to decorate his house with \ndeer antlers.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. You look rode hard and put up wet.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, this isnt Southern sexual innuendo. The phrase refers to a key \nstep in horse grooming  when a horse runs fast, it works up a sweat, \nespecially under the saddle. A good rider knows to walk the horse \naround so it can dry off before going back to the stable. A horse \nwill look sick and tired if you forget this step, much like a person \nwho misses sleep or drinks too much.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Hes as drunk as Cooter Brown.\u0014\n\u0014\nCooter Brown is an infamous character in Southern lore. Legend tells \nthat he lived on the Mason-Dixon line  the border between the North \nand South  during the Civil War. To avoid the draft on either side, \nCooter decided to stay drunk throughout the entire war, making him \nineligible for battle.\u0014\n\u0014\nInebriated Southerners have measured their drunkenness by him ever \nsince.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Shes as happy as a dead pig in the sunshine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a pig dies, presumably in a sty outside, the sun dries out its \nskin. This effect pulls the pigs lips back to reveal a toothy \ngrin, making it look happy even though its dead. This phrase \ndescribes a person whos blissfully ignorant of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Shes got more nerve than Carters got Liver Pills.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarters Products started as a pill-peddling company in the latter \npart of the 19th century. Specifically, Carters repped its Little \nLiver Pills so hard a Southern saying spawned from the omnipresent \nadvertisements.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlas, the Federal Trade Commission forced the drug-group to drop the \nliver portion of the ad, claiming it was deceptive. Carters \nLittle Liver Pills became Carters Little Pills in 1951, but the \nSouth doesnt really pay attention to history. The phrase stuck.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Im finer than frog hair split four ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoutherners mostly use this phrase to answer, How are you? Even \nthose below the Mason-Dixon know frogs dont have hair, and the irony \nmeans to highlight just how dandy you feel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe phrase reportedly originated in C. Davis Diary of 1865.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. He thinks the sun comes up just to hear him crow.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn farms (not just in the South) roosters usually crow when the sun \nrises. Their vociferous habit wakes up the house, signaling time to \nwork.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn extremely cocky rooster might think the sun rises simply because \nhe crows. Similarly, an extremely cocky man might think the same when \nhe speaks  and also that everyone should listen to him.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. Thats about as useful as tits on a bull.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly female dairy cows produce milk. Male cows are called bulls. And \neven if you could milk anything with nipples, bulls tend to be \nrather ornery. Good luck with that.\u0014\n\u0014\n12. That thing is all catawampus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatawampus adj: askew, awry, cater-cornered.\u0014\n\u0014\nLexicographers dont really know how it evolved, though. They \nspeculate its a colloquial perversion of cater-corner. Variations \ninclude: catawampous, cattywampus, catty wonkus. The South isnt \nreally big on details.\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Hes got enough money to burn a wet mule.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1929, then-Governor of Louisiana Huey Long, nicknamed The \nKingfish, tried to enact a five-cent tax on each barrel of refined \noil to fund welfare programs. Naturally, Standard Oil threw a hissy \nfit and tried to impeach him on some fairly erroneous charges \n(including attending a drunken party with a stripper).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Long, a good ole boy, fought back. He reportedly said the \ncompany had offered legislators as much as $25,000 for their votes to \nkick him out of office  what he called enough money to burn a wet \nmule.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe Northerners may not know what that means, but at least we know \nwhere it comes from.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonus: Bless Your Heart\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost everyone knows Southern women drop this phrase constantly. But \nit might not mean what you think it means.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reality, the phrase has little to do with religion and more to do \nwith a passive-aggressive way to call you an idiot. Depending on your \ninflection, saying bless your heart can sting worse than any insult.\u0014\n\u0014\nContent courtesy of Business Insider.\u0014",

As far back as 1944, a government inspection report of \nthe Tuam home described some of the children as \"fragile, pot-bellied \nand emaciated.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recently discovered death records for St Mary's show the 796 \nchildren died from malnutrition and infectious diseases, such as \nmeasles and TB.\u0014\n\u0014\nConservative Catholic teaching at the time denied children of \nunmarried parents baptism and therefore burial in consecrated lands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe home was knocked down many years ago to make way for new houses, \nbut the area around the unmarked mass grave has been maintained by \nlocals.\u0014\n\u0014\nA fundraising committee has now been formed and it is hoped that a \nmemorial will be built with all the names and ages of the children \ndisplayed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Archbishop of Tuam Michael Neary said he would meet leaders of \nthe Bons Secours Sisters to assist with the memorial.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said that if a public \ninquiry into the 'mother and baby' homes in Ireland was not \nestablished then a social history project was necessary.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin also said he supports \"excavating what may be unmarked graves\" \nat these sites.\u0014\n\u0014\nA junior government minister has called for an inquiry to be \nestablished and the issue is expected to be discussed at cabinet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe development is a yet another damning disclosure of a Church-run \ninstitution in Ireland following almost countless revelations of \nabuse and neglect at Catholic-run schools or institutions in recent \ndecades.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2014 AFP     MSN News 6/4/14\u0014",

    "words": "1st of \nMany George Whitefield Sermons\u0014\n                                                                and \nother biographical information\u0014\n\n                                                                             \nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Whitefield made it his business to find salvation for his \nsoul. He joined a group of like-minded men, the Holy Club, to which \nJohn and Charles Wesley also belonged, and exceeded the other members \nin zeal and good works. He was a familiar visitor of prisoners. For \nlong hours he studied religious works. He fasted until his health \nbroke. He prayed on his knees under a hedge in the cold. For all his \nhard work his soul was unsatisfied.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would have despaired, except he felt the Lord had promised him he \nwould yet be saved. The Wesleys sailed to Georgia on a futile \nmission. They, too, would find peace only when their hearts were \nwarmed by the Holy Spirit. This did not come about until each \nrecognized that salvation was by grace, a free gift through Jesus \nChrist rather than by works. To live a life of faith was to be born \nagain; it was to be \"in\" Christ and have Christ in oneself. Once \nWhitefield grasped this, peace flooded his heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned to school, pouring out this truth to others. As his \nhealth recovered, he trained toward being ordained so that he could \nenter full-time ministry. His efforts at private evangelism \ncontinued. What before had been labor was now an act of joy. But as \nordination neared, he trembled. Despite having studied the scriptures \nline by line on his knees, he felt unprepared. As the day for \nordination approached, he found relief in prayer. In May he was \npublicly examined by men who desired to embarrass him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Benson believed Whitefield was the kind of man the church \nneeded. To quiet the young man's mind, he promised there would be no \npublic examination at his ordination. June 20, 1736 came. \"I \nattempted to behave with unaffected devotion, suitable to the \ngreatness of the office I was to undertake.\" He read over Paul's \nadvice to Timothy and determined to let no one to despise him for his \nyouth.\u0014\n\u0014\nA week later, on this day, June 27th, 1736, Whitefield preached his \nfirst sermon. He took as his topic the need for Christians to help \none another. At first he was awkward, for his mother, his brothers \nand sisters, and many who had known him as a youngster were in the \naudience. As he proceeded, the Spirit filled him. Those who came to \nlisten were so moved by the authority of his words that parishioners \ncomplained to the bishop that some had gone \"mad.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield himself wrote, \"Glory! Glory! Glory! be ascribed to an \nAlmighty Triune God.\" He went on to preach thousands more powerful \nsermons. He became a force in the Great Awakening which brought fresh \nlife to America's churches. His last sermon was preached in 1770. He \nwas then desperately ill but, mounting a barrel, urged his listeners \nto examine themselves whether they were in the faith. To be saved, \nthey must be born again, he urged. The following morning he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniels, W. H. Illustrated History of Methodism. New York: Hunt and \nEaston, 1890.

In \n1749, George Whitefield campaigned for its legalization, claiming \nthat the territory would never be prosperous unless farms were able \nto use slave labor. He began his fourth visit to America in 1751 \nadvocating slavery, viewing its re-legalization in Georgia as \nnecessary to make his plantation profitable. Partly through his \ncampaigns and written pleas to the Georgia Trustees, it was \nre-legalized in 1751. Whitefield purchased slaves, who then worked at \nhis Bethesda Orphanage. To help raise money for the orphanage, he \nalso employed slaves at Providence Plantation. Whitefield was known \nto treat his slaves well; they were reputed to be devoted to him, and \nhe was critical of the abuse of slaves by other owners. When \nWhitefield died, he bequeathed his slaves to the Countess of \nHuntingdon. His attitude towards slavery is expressed in a letter to \nMr B. written from Bristol 22 March 1751:\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the lawfulness of keeping slaves, I have no doubt, since I \nhear of some that were bought with Abraham's money, and some that \nwere born in his house.And I cannot help thinking, that some of \nthose servants mentioned by the Apostles in their epistles, were or \nhad been slaves. It is plain, that the Gibeonites were doomed to \nperpetual slavery, and though liberty is a sweet thing to such as are \nborn free, yet to those who never knew the sweets of it, slavery \nperhaps may not be so irksome. However this be, it is plain to a \ndemonstration, that hot countries cannot be cultivated without \nnegroes. What a flourishing country might Georgia have been, had the \nuse of them been permitted years ago? How many white people have been \ndestroyed for want of them, and how many thousands of pounds spent to \nno purpose at all? Had Mr Henry been in America, I believe he would \nhave seen the lawfulness and necessity of having negroes there. And \nthough it is true, that they are brought in a wrong way from their \nown country, and it is a trade not to be approved of, yet as it will \nbe carried on whether we will or not; I should think myself highly \nfavoured if I could purchase a good number of them, in order to make \ntheir lives comfortable, and lay a foundation for breeding up their \nposterity in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. You know, dear \nSir, that I had no hand in bringing them into Georgia; though my \njudgement was for it, and so much money was yearly spent to no \npurpose, and I was strongly importuned thereto, yet I would not have \na negro upon my plantation, till the use of them was publicly allowed \nin the colony. Now this is done, dear Sir, let us reason no more \nabout it, but diligently improve the present opportunity for their \ninstruction. The trustees favour it, and we may never have a like \nprospect. It rejoiced my soul, to hear that one of my poor negroes in \nCarolina was made a brother in Christ. How know we but we may have \nmany such instances in Georgia ere it be long?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield died in the parsonage of Old South Presbyterian Church, \nNewburyport, Massachusetts, on September 30, 1770, and was buried, \naccording to his wishes, in a crypt under the pulpit of this church. \nA bust of Whitefield is in the collection of the Gloucester City \nMuseum & Art Gallery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was John Wesley who preached his funeral sermon in London, at \nWhitefield's request.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe funeral was held on October 2 at the Old South First Presbyterian \nChurch. Thousands of people were unable to even get near the door of \nthe church. Whitefield had re- quested earlier to be buried beneath \nthe pulpit if he died in that vicinity, which was done. Memorial \nservices were held for him in many places. John Wesley said:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, what has the church suffered in the setting of that bright star \nwhich shone so gloriously in our hemisphere. We have none left to \nsucceed him; none of his gifts; none anything like him in usefulness.\u0014",

    "words": "TWISP, Wash. (AP)  About 300 homes  twice as many as previously \nestimated  have burned in the largest recorded wildfire in \nWashington state history, a county sheriff said Friday, July 25, 2014.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials had placed the number of homes destroyed at 150 in \nnorth-central Washington's Carlton fire complex. But Okanogan County \nSheriff Frank Rogers said he knew that figure would rise because \ncrews hadn't been able to reach some of the burned areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe updated estimate came after Rogers and his deputies drove 750 \nmiles of roadway through the blackened area, surveying the \ndevastation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's every road. Every road lost something,\" Rogers said. \"It looks \nlike a moonscape; there's nothing left. There's hundreds of dead \nlivestock. It's horrifying.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt nearly 400 square miles, the lightning-caused Carlton Complex has \neclipsed the 1902 Yacolt Burn, which killed 38 people and consumed \nabout 373 square miles, or 238,920 acres, in southwest Washington. \nThe Carlton Complex has been blamed for the death of a man who \nappeared to suffer a heart attack while trying to protect his \nproperty.\u0014\n\u0014\nFire crews have reported good progress in the last few days, with \ncooler weather and rain helping in getting the fire a little more \nthan half contained. But officials were concerned that hotter, drier \nweather and wind gusts in the forecast could increase fire activity.\u0014\n\u0014\nMSN NEWS  July 26, 2014\u0014",

    "title": "15 PREACHING BEST PRACTICES",
    "words": "Tips from great preachers that \nmake a difference in the pulpit\u0014\n\u0014\nAaron Damiani \u0014\n\u0014\nposted 08/19/13    Preaching Today\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the last four years I have been learning how to preach. I started \npreaching as an assistant pastor in Washington DC, about one to two \ntimes a month, and I have recently started preaching as a church \nplanter to my new church in Chicago. Along the way, I have been \nscouring resources on preaching, pumping feedback out of people, and \ndoing my best to adapt. I made a list of the best practices that have \nworked for me. Of course, this is highly subjective, incomplete, and \nI'm no final authority. With those disclaimers, here's the best \nadvice on preaching that I have been able to pull together, and some \nsuggestions for preachers and articles that stand as strong examples \nfor each of these practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter scouring resources and pumping feedback out of people, here's \nmy list of the 15 best practices I've been learning about preaching. \u0014\n\u0014\nEstablish personal credibility with your audience before you dive \ninto the text, usually by talking about a shared human experience. \nThis is not necessary if it's already established. Ideally, describe \nhow the problem addressed by the biblical text has impacted your \nlife. (See Andy Stanley, Communicating for a Change.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBegin by describing a real problem that the biblical text addresses. \nBrian Chapell calls this the \"Fallen Condition Focus.\" Turn the screw \nby uncovering a predicament that we all face. If you have time, let \nthe problem fester by unpacking its unsavory implications. Do not \njump quickly to the solution; this increases people's interest in the \nrest of the message. Make sure this problem is consistent throughout \nthe message. (See Brian Chapell's Christ-Centered Preaching and see \nhis example in his sermon \"When the Bottom Falls Out.\" Also, notice \nhow Vaughan Roberts introduces his sermon by describing a problem we \nall sharedeathin his sermon \"Good News When Confronted by Death.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nBe intentional about transitions. Slow down when you're turning a \ncorner in your sermon by explaining terms, telling people what's \nahead, and reminding them why they need to listen. (Tommy Hinson at \nChurch of the Advent is a master at this. See \nhttp://www.adventdc.org/Sermons)\u0014\n\u0014\nWalk people through the movement of the text in a passionate way. \nAnimate the arc of the text. Light up the logic of the Scripture. \nIt's not the dry part; it's the best part! Show how personally \ninvested you are in the words of the Bible, and invite people to \nshare that passion and interest. If you are preaching from narrative, \nre-tell the story using your own words. (See John Piper and Martin \nLloyd-Jones, Preachers & Preaching. See also Jeffrey Arthur's \narticles \"Let's Get Back to the Text\" and \"Five Hammer Strokes of \nCreating Expository Sermon Outlines.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nUse ONE main point (or Big Idea) that is memorable. People can \nremember one point, but they usually cannot remember two, three, or \nfour big ideas. Find one main point that you can introduce, teach, \nillustrate, and apply. Even if the sermon is too short because you \nonly had one point, no one will get mad. Build contrast, rhyme, echo, \nalliteration, or metaphor to craft a memorable main point. (See \nHaddon Robinson's The Big Idea in Biblical Preaching and \"Better Big \nIdeas.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeak to both non-Christians and Christians. Remove all insider \nlanguage, insider stories, and insider references that only \nChristians would understand. Be sensitive, not callous, to people who \nhave no Christian formation. Take the opportunity to communicate with \nyour non-churched visitors, engaging their questions, using their \nframe of reference, experience, and language. Use their sources of \nauthority to support (but not supplant) what the biblical text is \nsaying. If you're not already hanging out with non-Christians in \nnormal life, this will be hard. (See Tim Keller's Preaching in a \nSecular Culture and his interview \"A New Kind of Urban Christian Part \n1 and Part 2.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nClimb down the ladder of abstraction whenever possible. Picture a \nladder with abstract concepts (love, justice, salvation, mercy, \ndiscipleship) at the top of the ladder and concrete images of those \nconcepts at the bottom of the ladder. Now when you talk about \ncompassion (an important but abstract concept), help people see \ncompassion by coming down the ladder and giving a concrete image or \nstory. For instance, define what the Bible means by compassion, but \nthen tell a story about a little girl who picked up a diseased \n3-legged dog on the side of the highway. Use tangible metaphors and \nreal stories to translate the teaching of the Bible. But do not \ninsult your listeners' intelligence in the process. (Matt Woodley at \nPreachingToday.com is a master of this point. See page 6 of Jeffrey \nArthur's article on \"Five Hammer Strokes for Creating Expository \nSermon Outlines.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nGive one tangible point of application. Make sure it is both \nactionable and connected to your teaching. Consider presenting it as \nan experiment or a baby step. (See Andy Stanley, and Haddon \nRobinson's \"The Heresy of Application\" and \"Bible Content and Life \nApplication.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nShow how Jesus is the hero and resolution of the original problem. \nThe gospel, not moralism, is the good news. Use your sermon as a way \nto re-articulate what God has done for us in Christ, using the terms \nand the problem you have established in your sermon. This is the time \nto call people to repentance and conversion, so extol the gospel and \nits benefits. (See Bryan Loritts' \"A Cautionary Tale from Michael \nJackson's Father\" and Tim Keller's \"Preaching Morality in an Immoral \nAge.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nRecruit a team of people to intercede for people before you preach. \nEmail them with your preaching assignment, and give them tangible \nways to pray. (My friend Kevin Miller does thisand you can tell when \nhe preaches. See also \"How Prayer Transforms Sermon Prep.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nBuild your sermon orally by sharing your ideas and inviting feedback. \nSermons are primarily an oral medium, not a written medium. You will \nbe more comfortable preaching if oral, extroverted preparation is \nintertwined with written and introverted preparation. People are \noften honored to help you craft a better message. Consider recruiting \na focus group, or a content-filtering team. Find a way to include \npeople who do not attend church. (Perry Noble is an inspiration here. \nSee also question #9 in this Peter Scazzero article.)\u0014\n\u0014\nFinish early and rehearse your message. Embrace the awkwardness of \npreaching to an empty room so you can feel more comfortable with the \nmaterial when everyone is listening. If possible, rehearse more than \nonce (like Jeff Henderson).\u0014\n\u0014\nInvite people to imagine change. What would happen if the teaching of \nthe text (and by extension, the gospel) was put into practice on a \nlarger scale? What if we all practiced this together? (Andy Stanley) \nBut in doing so, we can't ignore the next point \u0014\n\u0014\nEliminate hype. People are sensitive to being over-sold. Preachers \nwho over-dramatize, hard-sell, exaggerate, or tell white lies will \nquickly lose credibility with their listeners. Be honest instead and \npeople will trust you more. (See Haddon Robinson's article \"Preachers \nWho Promise too Much.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nLand the plane once. Don't \"almost finish\" and then start up again. \nLet your conclusion happen once (Kevin Miller again).\u0014",

I have lived the majority of my life in St. \nLouis and am familiar with most of the smaller municipalities outside \nSt. Louis.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have had regular, first-hand experience as a youth, and now a \n40-year-old father of two, of being pulled over by police officers of \nvarious departments in the St. Louis region.\u0014\n\u0014\nI regularly experience the fear of driving through certain areas \nknowing that I will be pulled over by police simply because they \nthink I don't belong in the area.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese officers don't care, or take the time to find out, that I am a \npastor, a college professor and the executive director of a \ncommunity-based service agency that has sought to improve the lives \nof people in North St. Louis City for 21 years. None of this is \nimportant to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn defense of these officers, I understand why none of this is \nimportant. I was a St. Louis City police officer for five years and \nmy main concern was staying safe and making it home to my family in \none piece every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nI patrolled one of the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. I also \nworked in a special undercover detail driving an unmarked car in \norder to execute search warrants for drugs and guns on a weekly basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring my tenure on the department, I learned that some citizens \ndidn't necessarily care about me as an officer or person.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese people didn't care that I was the interim pastor of a church in \nthe neighborhood, or a father, artist or mentor to urban youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey only saw the uniform and had a preconceived idea of who I was \nand what I should do for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn multiple occasions, I helped other officers defend themselves \nagainst people who attempted to take their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was also helped by multiple officers as I defended myself against \npeople who attempted to take my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of these experiences, I will never second-guess the officer \nwho is at the center of the firestorm.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving been in what I perceived were life-or-death situations, with \nonly a few seconds to respond, I can sympathize with the officer's \nactions to defend himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat doesn't mean that I agree with, or justify, his actions. It only \nmeans that, if he believed that his life was immediately threatened, \nI can understand why he responded with force.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is important to me right now is how we respond to the fallout \nfrom this event.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat personal stance can we all take as we wait to find out what \nreally happened on that fateful day?\u0014\n\u0014\nI have three simple suggestions that I believe can help us all.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, allow your perspective to be influenced by the whole of \ninformation and not just bits and pieces.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe all want to know what happened and why. Unfortunately, we will not \nreceive all of the answers immediately.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't let your opinion be overly influenced by a lack of information \nand disinformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs much as we may want to trust news programs, bloggers and people \nthat tweet, we have to remember that they all have their own agendas \nwhen writing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether intentional or not, key information sometimes gets left out \nin order to influence our thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, we have the opportunity to respond to all of this through a \nlens of love and compassion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't have to hate those who don't think and feel like we do. We \ndon't have to vilify one another because we hold differing opinions \nabout all of the different social and economic aspects surrounding \nthese circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't have to look for new enemies, especially during a time when \nunity and cooperation are needed more than ever.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, as much as this event is about racial profiling, and about \nteaching our children the value of earning what they have instead of \ntaking and stealing from someone else, and about respecting \nauthority, this is also about the unseen spiritual fight that has \nbeen waging from the earliest times.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fight between the forces of spiritual darkness that seek to \ncontrol this world and have its inhabitants devour each other and the \npresent yet coming Kingdom of God that seeks to shape all things into \nGod's loving image.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Ferguson, Missouri, and other cities and countries are \nexperiencing is about more than just economic inclusion and racial \nequality. It's about who will control this world and our lives for \ntime and eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we look at it that way, we can see who the real enemy is.\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrell Carter is minister of administration at Third Baptist Church \nin St. Louis\u0014",

    "words": "In many places, the true concept of the holiness and majesty of God \nhas been substituted for such a low view of God that, to quote Tozer, \nit is utterly unworthy of thinking, worshipping men. Exhibit A: \nVictoria Osteens words from her recent talk at Lakewood Church in \nHouston, Texas\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just want to encourage every one of us to realize when we obey \nGod, we're not doing it for GodI mean, that's one way to look at \nitwe're doing it for ourselves, because God takes pleasure when \nwe're happy. That's the thing that gives Him the greatest joy. So, I \nwant you to know this morning: Just do good for your own self. Do \ngood because God wants you to be happy. When you come to church, when \nyou worship Him, you're not doing it for God really. You're doing it \nfor yourself, because that's what makes God happy. Amen?\" (The \ncongregation applauds.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial media was abuzz recently with a video clip of the above quote \nthat ended with Bill Cosby saying: Thats the stupidest thing Ive \never heard. Not only is Osteens theology incorrect, its \nimpractical. It doesnt make sense of the despair we see in the \nPsalms, in Lamentations, or in the suffering of the Apostle Paul. One \nwonders how Christians today whose lives are marked by deep \nsuffering, tragedy, or persecution for their faith could apply \nVictoria Osteens words.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow would you respond to a God like Osteen describes if you were a \nChristian dying of cancer, or you just went through a miscarriage, or \nyour 16-month-old child just drowned? Youd want to spit in face of \nsuch a God. Only when we have met the biblical God, can we truly \ngrieve and bear the unhappy aspects of life in a fallen world as He \nwalks through those dark times with us (e.g. 2 Cor. 1:1-11)\u0014\n\u0014\nBible professor and author, Daniel Wallace, responded to Victoria \nOsteen's statement with deep concern that her view is the symptom of \na much larger problem:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Some of the most blatant narcissistic blather ever to come from a \npulpit can also be laid at their [the Osteens'] feet. Not only \nnarcissistic, but also blasphemous. One has to wonder how a \nmegachurch in the buckle of the Bible belt can go on and on without \nthe congregants waking up and smelling whats being shoveled in their \ndirection. If Lakewood Church is any indication of the biblical \nliteracy, genuine devotion to Christ, and fellowship of the saints of \nthe American evangelical church, we are in serious trouble.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The evangelical church in America needs corporate self-reflection \nand corporate repentance. How we treat one another, how we honor God, \nwhat our understanding of and commitment to the gospel is, and how we \nmeasure true success all need a serious overhaul. The root problem \nseems to be twofold: the marginalization of the word of God and the \nbuddyization of Jesus Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYour turn: What do you think of Victoria Osteens view of God? Is \nyour happiness what 'gives Him the greatest joy?'\u0014\n\u0014\nAlex Crain is the editor of Christianity.com\u0014",

    "title": "5 THINGS THAT SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DO THAT OTHERS DON'T",
    "words": "5 Things Successful People \nDo That Others Don't \u0014\n\u0014\nJuly 23, 2014 Leadership\u0014\n\u0014\nAre your actions leading you to success or failure? Try emulating the \n5 characteristics of successful people to achieve long-lasting \nsuccess. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause I never trusted my talents, my looks or my luck, and had no \nconnections, I studied what successful people did and tried to mimic \nit. Then I studied what unsuccessful people did and tried to avoid it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there are many things that seem to differentiate those who are \nsuccessful from those who aren't, Ive noticed one simple difference \nthat stands out the mostsuccessful people are more willing. What \nexactly are they more willing to do than others? Here are five key \nactivities they are more willing to do:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. They Go to Work to Prosper, Not Just to Work\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who are more successful go to work to get something \naccomplished. They work to make their dreams a reality, not just to \nget their eight hours in. They have a drive, even a greediness or \nself-centered push to get something done. There are millions of \npeople who go to work every day, yet few put themselves in a position \nor mindset to prosper.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnsuccessful people approach their work with a more limiting mindset. \nThey often refer to work in a negative way. For example, they'll say \nthe daily grind or my life as a drone. They typically complain as \nopposed to looking at work as a means to an end, to create a life of \nabundance. Workthe passion for it, the creation of it, your \ncontribution and what you learn from othersis what leads to goals \nbeing met and dreams becoming reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. They Exercise Incredible Drive\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most successful people I know are driven, and they push and shove \nuntil the job is done and targets are hit, and then they go again. \nThey're able to stay focused on getting results. They keep doing the \nhard things long after others are only doing what's comfortable.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnsuccessful people appear to spend a lot of time in emotions and \nconsiderations that cause them to stop or settle and then rationalize \nhow these feelings should be satisfied. What they don't seem to \nunderstand is this mechanism of drive is a muscle that can be \ndeveloped by practicing nonconformance with societys definitions of \nsuccess.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. They Never Make Excuses\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of how many excuses they make, successful people know that \nit will not change the outcome. Even justified excuses will not make \na project or person successful. When things go wrong, the successful \nperson sees it as an opportunity, not an insurmountable hurdle.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnsuccessful people spend a lot of energy and time making excuses, \nblaming the economy, the customer, prices or competition. Even if the \n\"excuses\" are all true, it won't improve the outcome, and successful \npeople know this. No matter how justified you are, never make an \nexcuse for any outcome.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. They Focus on Their Goals Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nSuccessful people are always focused on success. For instance, the \nfirst thing I do every morning is write down my goalsIve been doing \nthis for years. It's my experience that if I can stay focused on what \nI want, I will get it no matter how absurd the goal. Make the things \nyou want and haven't yet accomplished so real in your mind that they \nbecome real in your world.\u0014\n\u0014\nLess successful people seem to allow anything to drift into their \nenvironmentsthey aren't controlling what they focus on. The average \nAmerican consumes four hours of TV and Internet per day and writes \ntheir goals down once a year. Every day presents an opportunity to \nset and reach goals regardless of how large or small they are.\u0014\n5. They Are Willing to Fail\u0014\nThe old saying, no risk, no reward really applies to those who are \nsuccessful. These people go for it almost with a willingness to fail. \nOf course, they arent interested in failing, but they know that if \nthey dont put themselves in a position to fail, they'll never create \nthe ability to win. At some point in life, you'll have to go for it \nor you'll live the rest of your life regretting not doing so.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnsuccessful people play it safe. They dont speak up or offer ideas \nbecause they operate from a place of fear. They're afraid to fail \nbecause they're overly concerned with the judgment of others so they \ndo the minimum and try to fly under the radar. Never be afraid of \nfailure because behind every mistake is an opportunity to learn.\u0014\n\u0014\nBegin to willingly do these five things, and you'll soon see how \nthings change for the better in your business and life. Because doing \nwhat others refuse to do will give you the edge you need to find the \nsuccess you want.\u0014",

    "title": "10 TRAITS OF LONG TENURED PASTORS",
    "words": "By Tom S. Rainer\u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 29, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nI approached this issue by looking at over 30 pastors whose tenure \nexceeded ten years. And from my perspective, their tenures have been \nhealthy and loving. Here are the ten traits of those pastors:\u0014\n\u0014\nThey pray daily for their church members and staff. Many of the \npastors kept the church membership roll in front of them and prayed \nthrough the entire congregation and staff every year.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey view their family as their first line of ministry. They did not \nsee a dichotomy between church and family. To the contrary, they saw \ntheir family as the first priority of ministry in the church. I will \nelaborate on this matter in my post this Saturday, where I will share \nways Satan seeks to destroy the families of pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey connect with and love people in their community. Pastors are \nmore likely to stay at a church longer if they love the community in \nwhich they are located. That love must be deliberate and intentional.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey choose their battles carefully and wisely. Not every issue is \nworth a fight. Long-term pastors are not cowardly; they are just \nhighly selective and wise.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey welcome structures that make them accountable. Certainly, they \ndont seek structures that hinder their leadership. But a leader who \navoids accountability is headed down a path of destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey spend time developing staff. These pastors view their staff, \nwhether fulltime paid, part-time, or volunteer, as one of their \nhighest priorities for development and mentorship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey expect conflict and criticism. They are a reality in any family \nor congregation. But these leaders are not surprised or frustrated by \nconflict and criticism. They realize, if it is handled well, it can \nbe healthy for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey connect with other pastors and ministries in the community. They \nrealize that their congregations cannot minister to and reach the \ncommunity alone. Other churches and pastors thus become partners in \nministry rather than competitors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey affirm both theology and practical ministry. Their foundation is \nthe Word of God. They have a robust theology. But they dont neglect \nsuch practical issues as attendance trends, outreach ministries, \nfinancial health, and parking lot capacity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey ask long-term questions. They are constantly seeking to lead the \nchurch beyond their own tenure. They avoid short-term solutions with \nlong-term negative consequences.\u0014",

    "title": "1ST COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON",
    "words": "When Jesus asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" he \nreceived a multitude of answers. Some said he was John the Baptist, \nsome said he was Elijah or Jeremiah or another one of the prophets. \nThe disciple Peter came up with the correct answer when he said, \"You \nare the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" The early Christians \naccepted Peter's confession, but they had many different ideas of \nexactly what it meant for Jesus to be the Christ. What was Jesus' \nreal nature and person like? How was he related to God and to the \nFather? To what degree was he truly human? There were many debates \nover these issues in the fourth through the sixth centuries of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Constantine became emperor of the Roman Empire and made \nChristianity a legal religion, he believed unity of the Church was \nimportant to the political strength of the empire. So, in 325 he \ncalled a Council at Nicea to settle disputes over the nature of \nChrist. The council issued the Nicene Creed, agreeing that Christ was \nboth man and God and that as the Son of God he had the same divine \nnature as the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce it was accepted that Jesus was both fully God and fully man, \ndebates began to rage over how Christ's deity was related to his \nhumanity. One group, the Apollinarians, said the divine Word of \nChrist took the place of Jesus' human mind and will so that his \ndivine nature was always predominant. Others argued back that if \nJesus did not have a human mind and will he could not be fully human. \nYet another group argued that at the incarnation the divine and human \nwere so combined in the person of Christ as to produce a new, unique \nindividual. Others again thought that the divine and human natures of \nJesus were kept so separate that it was almost like he was two \npersons. Very often each conflicting group became associated with a \nparticular city - Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, Constantinople, so that \npolitical rivalry became entangled in theological debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 450, Emperor Theodosius died from a fall off his horse and \nhis brother-in-law Marcian ascended the imperial throne. Spurred by \nhis wife, the Empress Pulcheria, one of Marcian's first acts was to \ncall a church council to deal with some of these religious problems. \nHe hoped for religious unity as a support to the political unity of \nthe empire -- a political unity to face the growing military threat \nfrom the east. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, October 8, 451, the largest of all church councils \nopened at Chalcedon, near Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Five or \nsix hundred bishops were present representing the many conflicting \nviews found within the church. After much debate, on the 22nd of \nOctober, a Chalcedonian creed was adopted which re-affirmed the \ndivine and human natures of Christ recognized at Nicea and further \nstated that the two natures of Christ were \"without confusion, \nwithout conversion, without severance, and without division.\" Jesus \nwas affirmed as being both fully divine and human. His two natures \nwere combined in one person without his becoming less divine or less \nhuman. The work Christ did was the work of his whole person, not of \none nature or another. In that day Pope Leo stated the Chalcedonian \nposition that in Christ the \"lowliness of man and the majesty of God \nperfectly pervade one another...the two natures make only one person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Egyptian, Turkish and eastern Christians could not bring \nthemselves to accept the Chalcedon Creed, but it has been accepted by \nthe Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. \nThe Chalcedon Creed is an important basic statement on the nature and \nperson of Christ, but even this creed which has stood for centuries \ncannot fathom fully the wondrous depths and mystery of Christ's \nperson and nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

    "title": "3-YR-OLD KILLED BECAUSE OF SOILED PANTS",
    "words": "Man May Have Killed Stepdaughter, \n3, Over Soiled Pants\u0014\nBy J. DAVID GOODMAN and WINNIE HU   OCT. 19, 2014  NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nKelsey Smith routinely watched his new wifes two children, staying \nwith them in their Brooklyn homeless shelter apartment while she \nworked at a retail job. It was an arrangement that, from the outside, \nsuggested a growing stability in their nascent family.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut inside the apartment on Saturday afternoon, it all ended \nabruptly, the police said, as officers responding to 911 calls found \na 3-year-old girl dying, her 5-year-old brother beaten and Mr. Smith \non the run. The motive for the killing provided another shock: the \nrage that ended in the death of the girl, Jeida Torres, was prompted \nby little more than a pair of soiled pants, investigators theorize.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficers tracked Mr. Smith, 20, to an aunts home in Queens later on \nSaturday, where, relatives said, he had tried to slit his wrists, \napparently in a suicide attempt. He was taken into custody at \nElmhurst Hospital, where he remained on Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nLate Sunday, the police charged Mr. Smith, who is called Shawn, with \nfelony assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child. He was \nnot, however, charged with murder. Detectives were awaiting a final \ndetermination from the city medical examiner on the precise cause of \ndeath, which could bring elevated charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe killing drew neighbors out to the sidewalk along the street on \nSunday, and the Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams, held an \nafternoon news conference in front of the shelter to express his \nconcern over the death.\u0014\n\u0014\nGerman Lopez, who lives a few doors down Cooper Street, said he had \nbeen walking his dog on Saturday when he saw emergency workers trying \nto revive the girl in an ambulance. I have kids, I was upset, said \nMr. Lopez. Its an accident, he said, referring to the toilet \ntraining of young children.

    "title": "10 THINGS NOT TO SAY TO A GRIEVING PERSON",
    "words": "10 things you should \nnever say to a grieving person\u0014\n                                                                      \nNovember 16th, 2014\u0014\n                                                              By Tom \nFuerst   Ministry Matters\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\u0002Having come to know grief on a personal level over the last few \nyears, I've learned that when it it is time to comfort a grieving \nperson, people just do not know what to say or do. We sort of stutter \naround and try to navigate the awkwardness of it all because, in most \nof our lives, we just try to hide grief or deny it. So when we're \nundeniably confronted with it  at a funeral, in the face of a friend \nwho lost a child, in the announcement of a terminal illness  we \nsimply don't have the skills to navigate with wisdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis lack of skill leads us to say all kinds of things that seem \nwise, but are often just attempts to assuage our own discomfort. So \nin this post I will relay to you a number of things you should avoid \nsaying to grieving people. I'm going to be direct and even a bit \ncynical at points. But I really want to get my point across.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know how you feel.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, actually, you don't know how I feel. Even if you've lost your \ndad, you didn't lose my dad. Even if you lost your nephew, you didn't \nlose my nephew. The fact is, your situation may be similar on the \nsurface, but relationship is what makes each similar situation so \nvastly distinct. My love for my dad may have been like every son's \nlove for his father, but the particularities of our relationship  \nboth good and bad  make my love for him unique, and make your love \nfor your father unique. Yes, you may know the pain of losing a \nfather. And that pain may have some overlap with my pain. But our \npains are unique to the people and memories we lost. So, no, you \ndon't know how I feel.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod has a will in this. / There is a reason for everything. / God is \nin control.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've heard it said before that you should never utter something about \nGod that you can't say while standing before the gates of Auschwitz. \nI take that even further, never utter something about God that you \ncan't say to parents who lost a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo tell parents that there is a reason for everything or that God \nhas a will in this implies that God did this to them. To tell Jews \nin a concentration camp that God is in control implies that God did \nthis to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnless you believe that God is killing children or empowering the \nNazis, then you'd better just avoid these phrases altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan God bring good out of evil? Yes. Absolutely. But that is a very \ndifferent thing than saying that God is controlling evil and causing \nit to happen. It's a very different thing than saying that God has a \nreason he's taken kids from their parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow are you doing?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a difficult thing to tell you not to say because, at its \nheart, it does show compassion. It realizes that instead of pithy \nproverbs, the best thing to do is ask a question.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the nature of this question is what makes it off-limits. The \nquestion assumes the person has processed their feelings enough to be \nable to articulate them. The question assumes, as well, that not only \nhave they processed their feelings, but that they want to talk about \ntheir feelings with you.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther, grief is so multifaceted that when you ask me how I'm doing, \nI honestly don't know how to answer the question. How I'm doing \ndepends on the moment (grief comes in waves), and that means a given \nmoment in which you ask me the question may solicit a different \nanswer than if you asked me an hour later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is also so open-ended that when you ask me, I don't \nreally know how to answer. And because I have such mixed feelings, \nsuch waving grief, and because I know I'm going to have trouble \narticulating the complexities of it all, I'll probably settle for an \neasy answer (easy for both of us): I'm fine. I'm good. I'm okay. You \nasked a simple question to get at a complex problem. So I offer an \neasy answer. And the question never really gets answered.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe's in a better place.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst of all, you don't know this.The eternal condition of any human \nbeing is not for me and you to know with any kind of surety. This \nline is often thrown about with the assumption that everyone gets to \ngo to a better place just because. We know too little of the \nafterlife and we know too little of people's disposition toward the \nafterlife to warrant our confidence that everyone is simply in a \nbetter place. \u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, even if we have a lot of confidence that someone is in \neternal bliss, the fact is, God designed us to be earth dwellers. \nMade from the dust of the ground, humanity is an earth-bound, \nearth-loving creature. Our best place, the place for which we were \ncreated is right here. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we mean by a better place is that these people are in the \npresence of God and are no longer suffering. That's fine. And I'm \ngood with that. But I find it hard to believe, given how we were \ncreated, that heaven is better than earth, or that people are closer \nto God because they're in heaven. No, in biblical theology, heaven \nand earth are together and God is here in this place. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou can have another child. / At least you have other kids. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, of all, you don't know that a mother/father who just lost a \nchild can have other kids. You can't know this. So that, in itself, \nought to disqualify such a comment. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut more specifically, the comment is insensitive in that it attempts \nto distract the parent's pain by providing an opiate alternative. Is \nthe ability to have children automatically supposed to make the loss \nof this child somehow more manageable or better? No. It wouldn't. It \ndoesn't. So let's stop saying this one too. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod just wanted another angel. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only is this statement theologically wrong (people don't turn \ninto angels when they die; they remain people), but the more \ndangerous theological assumption in this comment is that God is \nsomehow involved in the taking of a child from parents. That God \nselfishly wanted this child to be present with him so he snatched \nthem from the parents to whom he gave the child not too long ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does such a thing actually say about the character of God? What \nkind of God gives children to parents and parents to children to take \nthem back after a short period of time simply because He wanted to be \nwith the kid? \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd might I point out a third theological problem? The statement \nassumes a strict dichotomy between heaven and earth  a birfurcation \nor division that is foreign to the biblical writers. To the writers \nof Scripture, God is just as present with us here on earth as he is \nin heaven. The Spirit of God indwells God's people, in particular. \nThis means that God doesn't need another angel, or another person \nbecause he's lonely or something. God is present with us. \u0014\n\u0014\nChildren were made for earth. They were not made to be angels. They \nwere not made for heaven. They were made to be creatures reflecting \nthe image of God. They were not, in fact, meant to die. And to place \nsuch silly reasoning  God needed another angel  at the feet of God \nis to completely misunderstand the character of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was his time to go. \u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not really sure what this means, especially in the face of \naccidental death or death by disease. If a person dies a nice, \npeaceful death in old age, then maybe I could understand such a \nstatement. But nice, old-aged, peaceful deaths are not generally what \nwe refer to as tragedy. In the case of genuine tragedies, part of \nthe pain is precisely that it was not the persons time to go. They \nwere taken early. They were taken against their will by a disease or \nan accident. To tell grieving people that it was their loved one's \ntime to go is actually not only dismissive of their pain, it's also \nobjectively, verifiably wrong.\u0014\n \u0014\nYou have to be strong for X \u0014\n\u0014\nThis gets said too much to grieving people. It places the burden of \nbucking up and pretending everything's okay on a person precisely \nat the time when nothing is okay. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs if a person doesn't feel enough pain, experience enough pressure, \nwe are now telling them that their grieving loved ones are going to \nbe worse off if they don't get themselves together and pretend like \neverything is okay and normal. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet's get this straight. What we're really asking these people to do \nis lie. We're asking them to pretend that they are in a reality of \ndaisies and sunshine when all around them there are gravestones and \ndarkness. And we're asking them to lie for the sake of their loved \nones, but who are we to assume we know anything about what their \nloved ones actually need? Maybe their loved ones need to see grief \nand vulnerability modeled. Maybe the last thing they need is someone \nelse trying to pretend like things are okay when they so clearly are \nnot. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod never gives us more than we can handle. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you know God never gives us more than we can handle? \u0014\n\u0014\nSeriously. How do you know that? \u0014\n\u0014\nDid you read that in Scripture somewhere? Did you see it on a bumper \nsticker? Did God come down and tell you that? \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause from everything I know about God, two things are absolutely \nclear: \u0014\n\u0014\nGod does not give tragedy to people. God does not cause evil. A God \nwho causes evil (for testing or because he needs another angel) is an \nevil God. I understand that there is a more nuanced philosophical \ndiscussion that could happen here, but at the root of it, I will \nalways insist that God never be the cause of evil. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second thing I'm clear about when it comes to God is that God is \nalways allowing people to find themselves in situations that are \nbigger than they can handle. That's the nature of learning to trust \nGod and understand God's loving care for us  it's all bound up in \nthe idea that when we are out of control, God is still sovereign and \nstill working the waves and the darkness and death into something, \nnot that we can control, but something that can be redeemed. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, no, on all accounts, this statement misses the point and should \nbe avoided, as well. \u0014\n\u0014\nIs there anything I can do for you? \u0014\n\u0014\nThis question often comes from a good place. Unlike many of the \ncomments and clichs above, this question at least focuses on the \nneeds of the grieving person instead of the discomfort of the person \nvoicing the trite comments. \u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, I advise avoiding this question because it isn't \nspecific enough. When you ask me if there is anything you can do for \nme, the options are too many. I may be too overwhelmed by everything \nI need to tell you only one thing, so I'll opt for saying, No, I'm \nfine. \u0014\n\u0014\nThink about it like this: When many of you went to church on Sunday \nyou were handed a bulletin. It probably had so many announcements and \nevents on it that your eye wasn't drawn to any one of them. Because \nof how many there were, you probably didn't read any of them unless \nthe sermon was just that bad. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe same thing can happen at restaurants. When there are too many \nchoices on a menu, I can get overwhelmed and instead of choosing \nsomething specific that is unique to the restaurant, I'll often just \nfall back on chicken strips. All because there are so many options. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a person is grieving, there are so many things they need  even \nthings they need that they're not aware of yet. Instead of asking the \ngeneral question, find out through the grapevine what their specific \nneeds are and then ask them, Can I do X for you? Or do you have \nsomeone else doing it? If they have something else specific for you \nto do, they can tell you at that time, No, someone else is doing \nthat, but could you do Y for me? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, most of the silly things we say to grieving people could \nbe avoided if we simply keep our mouths shut. Silence is better than \nstupidity, I think. In some of these sayings, we mean well, but the \nsayings don't effectively communicate our concern. In others of \nthese, we're not really concerned about the grieving person, we're \nconcerned with our own discomfort. So, really, if in this post I took \naway your go-to sayings, always know that the grieving person \ndoesn't need you to solve anything. A hug will do just fine. If Jesus \nis right and God blesses those who mourn, then the last thing we need \nto do is be a curse to them by saying things that are more hurtful \nthan helpful.\u0014",

    "words": "40 Men Died on Ice for Christ\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Agricola of Armenia was confronted with \"mutiny.\" Forty \nsoldiers refused to offer the sacrifice ordered by emperor Licinius. \nThe forty who stood before him that wintry fourth-century day in \nSevaste were fine specimens of manhood who radiated an aura of \ncourage. He was determined to make them see reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the soldiers were adamant. They refused to sacrifice. To do so \nwas to betray their faith in Christ. \"But what about your comrades?\" \nasked Agricola. \"Consider--you alone of all Caesar's thousands of \ntroops defy him! Think of the disgrace you bring upon your legion!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To disgrace the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is more terrible \nstill,\" replied the men. Exasperated, the governor threatened to flog \nand torture them. The soldiers stood firm, although they knew he \nwould carry out his threat. In the fourth century, there were few \ncivil rights. Boldly the men answered, \"Nothing you can offer us \nwould replace what we would lose in the next world. As for your \nthreats-- we despise our bodies when the welfare of our souls is at \nstake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPairs of guards seized each man and dragged them out into the cold \nwhere they were stripped and tied to posts. Whips laid open their \nbacks and iron hooks tore their sides. Still the forty refused to \nsurrender. Agricola chained them in his dungeons. Finally, he \ncommanded that they be stripped naked and driven onto the ice of a \npond below Sevaste.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"rebels\" did not wait for the sentence to be imposed, but tearing \noff their own clothes, ran to the pond in the raw March air. \"We are \nsoldiers of the Lord and fear no hardship,\" they said. \"What is death \nfor us but an entrance into eternal life?\" On this day, March 9, 320, \nsinging hymns, they stood shivering on the pond as the sun sank.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaffled, Agricola ordered hot baths placed around the pond. Surely \nthe warm water would lure the men off the ice! But the crisp night \nair carried a prayer to all ears: \"Lord, there are forty of us \nengaged in this battle; grant that forty may be crowned and not one \nbe wanting from this sacred number.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the men did lose his nerve, however, and crawled off the ice \nto a bath. He died the instant he touched the hot water. This was too \nmuch for one of the guards. He shucked off his clothes, marched onto \nthe ice and took the place of the man who had failed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBasil, St. \"Homily on the Forty Martyrs.\"\u0014\n\"Bravest Soldiers in the Army: The Forty Martyrs of Sevaste.\" \nGlimpses #146.

    "title": "4 MEN SENTENCED TO DEATH OVER MOB KILLING",
    "words": "4 Afghan Men Sentenced to Death Over Horrifying Mob Killing\u0014\n\u0014\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS          MAY 6, 2015. \u0014\n\u0014\nKABUL, Afghanistan  Four Afghan men were sentenced Wednesday to \ndeath by hanging over the filmed mob killing in downtown Kabul of a \nyoung woman falsely accused of burning the Quran, a case that \nhorrified the country and showed the dangers women face in the \nconservative society.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the family of the 27-year-old woman, a religious scholar named \nFarkhuna, immediately denounced the verdict as unfair as the judge \ndropped charges against 18 men for a lack of evidence. Judge \nSafiullah Mojadedi sentenced eight others to 16 years in prison. \nNineteen police officers accused in the case will be sentenced \nSaturday, their verdicts publicly announced the next day.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of Farkhunda's brothers, Mujibullah, told The Associated Press \nthat his family was angered by the court's leniency toward the \nmajority of the defendants.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The outcome of the trial is not fair and we do not accept it  you \nsaw just four people sentenced to death but everybody knows that more \nthan 40 people were involved in martyring and burning and beating my \nsister,\" said Mujibullah, who like many Afghans, including his \nsister, uses only one name.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The whole world has seen the crime that was committed against my \nsister,\" he added. \"I am not a cleric, but the Quran says that if \nanyone kills another human being, then they should themselves be put \nto death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 19, a mob attacked Farkhunda after an amulet peddler accused \nher of burning a Quran after she challenged him over selling his \nwares to women desperate to have children. Chilling mobile phone \nvideos recorded the horror of the last moments of Farkhunda's life, \nas she was punched, kicked, beaten with wooden planks, thrown off a \nroof, run over by a car and ultimately set afire on the banks of \nKabul River.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn outrage followed her death, as protesters marched in Kabul, some \nwearing masks bearing the image of her bloodied face. Mourners held \ncandlelight vigils in her memory, even in Washington as President \nAshraf Ghani visited the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Afghan presidential investigation later found that she had not \ndamaged a copy of the Muslim holy book, but nevertheless, some public \nand religious figures said the attack would have been justified if \nshe had in fact damaged a Quran.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trial over her killing, which began Saturday at Afghanistan's \nPrimary Court, was broadcast live across the country with just two \nfull days of hearings. On Wednesday, Farkhunda's parents and sister \nlooked on ashen-faced at the defendants, who included a man who threw \ntwo large rocks at her, the driver of the car that ran over her and \nthe man who set her body alight.\u0014\n\u0014\nFarkhunda's parents addressed the court before the judge handed down \nhis rulings, asking that the accused be dealt with according to the \nlaw.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Everybody saw what happened and I insist on justice,\" her mother, \nBibi Hajira, said. \"That's all I want.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defendants can appeal their sentences. The charges against them \nincluded assault, murder and encouraging others to participate in the \nattack. The police officers face charges of neglecting their duties \nand failing to prevent the attack.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfghanistan's judicial system long has faced criticism over its \ninability to provide the majority of Afghans access to justice. Women \nespecially are sidelined, despite constitutional guarantees of \nequality and protection from violence, a recent report by the United \nNations concluded. The attack on Farkhunda was widely seen as \nsymptomatic of the country's problems, where violence against women \noften goes unpunished.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome conservative lawmakers in recent years have tried to dilute a \nlaw that seeks to protect women from violence. That's sparked fears \nof a rollback in legislative gains that have been made for women \nsince the extremist Taliban were overthrown by the 2001 U.S.-led \ninvasion following the Sept. 11 attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nActivist Barry Salaam, who organized mass demonstrations in the days \nafter Farkhunda's slaying, said Wednesday's verdicts validated laws \naimed at protecting women.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The trial was far from perfect but it was held in open court, which \ndefinitely contributes to the strengthening of rule of law and gives \nthe Afghan people the feeling that at the end of the day, the law \ndoes prevail,\" Salaam said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut lawmaker Farkhunda Zahra Naderi criticized the judge's decision \nto separately hand down verdicts against the police officers in the \ncase, saying such a move could foment more mistrust of the police.\u0014\n\"I believe that a political game is afoot and there has been \npolitical interference,\" she said. \"Why else would the court postpone \nthe decisions in the case of the police?\"\u0014",

    "title": "1ST PERFORMANCE OF SAMUEL SMITH'S \"AMERICA\"",
    "words": "1st Performance of Samuel \nF. Smith's \"America\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           Samuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at \nAndover and very poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. \nThat is how it came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to \ntranslate some German verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among \nthe tunes he handed Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our \nNative Land.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United \nstates also needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian! It is, however, for \"America,\" that \nSamuel Francis Smith is best remembered.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "title": "1ST SALVATION ARMY SERMON PREACHED IN A TORN TENT",
    "words": "\u0014\nThe tent was tattered. Patches sewn onto it merely ripped the rotted \ncanvas further. The ground on which it was pitched was an unused \nQuaker graveyard. But the man who preached on this day, July 2, 1865, \nwas confident in what he had to say. Using revival methods pioneered \nby Charles Finney, he pointed to sinners and called them specifically \nto repentance. When William Booth preached the first of nine sermons \nin that tattered tent, he did so under the name of the East London \nChristian Mission; Thirteen years later, it became the Salvation Army.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Salvation Army: every major city in the United States and Britain \nhas a post, and there are many in other countries. Near Christmas, \nSalvation Army bells tinkle for donations. Their work helps the poor \nand suffering wherever they are found.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his teenage years William had worked in missions to save souls. \nIn fact William had a running skirmish with his particular group of \nWesleyan Methodists because of his impatience to preach without \nproper credentials and his eagerness to bring people to church who \nleft lice on the church pews. These Methodists did all they could to \nkeep him from preaching, and at one point they took away his \nmembership (class ticket) because he was suspected of being a \n\"reformer\" (a group which called for evangelization of the poor and \noutcast).\u0014\n\u0014\nLater William joined the Reformed Methodists and preached around the \nEnglish countryside. At about the same time, he met his wife, \nCatherine Mumford, who was deeply moved by the first sermon she heard \nhim preach. She had to go home sick from the meeting, and he escorted \nher. That was the start of their courtship. They married in 1855 and \nseldom have a man and wife labored together to do so much good.\u0014\n\u0014\nStanding in his patched tent, the misery of London's millions struck \nhome to William. Himself a child of poverty and often at his wit's \nend how to feed his own family, he understood only too well the \ndesperate needs of the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam's wife, Catherine, understood the need of the poor, too. Of \nhigher social standing and better educated than her husband, she \nnonetheless sympathized with the urban poor and had begun a work \namong London's prostitutes. A strong advocate of female ministry, she \npreached as often as her husband and just as well, if not better. \nOften her speaking engagements were the main support for the pair's \ngrowing family. Thanks to her insistence on allowing women to preach, \nthe Salvation Army had a majority of women ministers from the start.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam and Catherine realized that they had to meet more than \nspiritual needs: the physical needs were just too great. And that is \nwhat they did. Their approach met furious opposition in its early \ndays, especially from tavern keepers who saw their trade drop off \nwhen clients were converted. Among the Army's implacable foes were \npastors who detested its brash methods. William Booth was repeatedly \nattacked with hurled objects. Some of his workers were killed. But \nthe Salvation Army became a force for good in England, America and \nmany other lands. Today it is a world-wide institution.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBooth-Tucker, F. de L.

    "title": "3 TYPES OF HOMELESSNESS",
    "words": "There are at least three ingredients that lead to someone becoming \nhomeless: Material poverty \u0014\n\u0014\n1. At its best, society has a safety net that can support people \nthrough hard times, but this net is developing more and more holes. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are more vulnerable than ever, due to lack of affordable \nhousing, economic downturn and austerity, benefit sanctions, minimal \nsupport when leaving an institution (prison, army, hospital), and the \ninsecurity of zero hours contracts and split shifts. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most significant development in recent years is the pan-European \npoverty, which is affecting homelessness in London as many people \ncome from the European Union to London for work. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe had a group of Romanians sleeping on the steps of the church, who \nwould wake up early, cycle off to work around 6 a.m. and come back at \nnight to sleep. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey caused no trouble and their situation is a perfect illustration \nof material poverty: Often they are choosing to sleep rough and send \nmoney back home to alleviate poverty back home.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Poverty of relationships \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I managed two different emergency hostels for homeless young \npeople, I saw many issues that led to their circumstances, but one \nissue towered above the rest: the impact of broken relationships \nwithin their families. \u0014\n\u0014\nBelow the presenting issues of addiction and mental health were \nstories of family chaos and the absence of stability within the home. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe primary tragedy they shared was not material but relational. Just \nas material poverty creates insecurity, so does a poverty of \nrelationships. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet there is often reluctance to connect poverty to relationship \nbreakdown despite the close link that so obviously exists, perhaps \nfrom a desire to avoid blaming families, especially those who already \nhave so many challenges. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe have been more comfortable talking about individuals who have \n\"rights\" and how through deprivation have been denied what they are \nentitled to, rather than talking about how relationships are \nfundamental to identity. \u0014\n\u0014\nPurely \"rights-based\" approaches are too individualistic and do not \nhave enough appreciation of where people find true meaning and \nfulfillment - through loving others and being loved. We cannot get \naway from the importance of relationships. \u0014\nA poverty of identity \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Every week it seems that reports are issued concerning the rise in \nmental health conditions and especially anxiety and depression. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise in mental health issues are symptoms of a vulnerability that \nmany people have around their inner well-being. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor homeless people, their experiences of exclusion and trauma are \nboth a root cause and an ongoing reason for their mental fragility. \nIn response, the homelessness sector has focused in recent years on \nthe issues of resilience. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we build resilience in vulnerable people so that setbacks or \nproblems don't cause an unraveling of their whole situation? How can \nhomeless people feel in control of their own journey of recovery and \nunderstand more fully what they need to live a fulfilled life? \u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the three faces of poverty and how they relate to \nhomelessness. \u0014\n\u0014\nJon Kuhrt is executive director of social work at West London Mission \nand is a member of Streatham Baptist Church in South London.\u0014",

    "title": "3 REASONS PEOPLE OVER 60 LEAVE CHURCH",
    "words": "3 Reasons People \nOver 60 Leave Your Church \u0014\n\u0014\nJoe LaGuardia\u0014\nTuesday, September 22, 2015 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn reaching for one generation, we've left another behind by taking \npeople for granted, LaGuardia writes. \u0014\nChurches have been scrambling to attract young adults for the last \nfew decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nReaching this age group is a momentous task that requires changes in \nworship, leadership, preaching and outreach.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of this change has been for the better - an ever fluid and \nreforming church is usually one with an eye toward the Holy Spirit. \nChange comes with a cost, however; one that few pastors weigh.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my own community, just east of Atlanta, Georgia, I meet many young \npeople who attend church on a regular basis. The church market is \nflooded with young adult-friendly options.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the over-60 crowd that worries me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that whenever I meet people of older generations - Baby \nBoomers and the Greatest Generation, as they are called - I find out \nthat they don't go to church. Many claim that they no longer feel at \nhome in places of worship once familiar.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I dig deeper, themes emerge and people usually give me one of \nthree reasons why they stopped going to church:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Churches have changed worship to the point that older generations \nnow feel out of place and ill-prepared to keep up.\u0014\n\u0014\nComplaints focus on music and preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the large churches in my area have changed to contemporary \nworship. Although contemporary music is good, it tends to be too \nloud, according to many people I've polled.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd sermons are getting too long.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorried about the rise of biblical illiteracy in their congregations, \npastors have shifted from preaching sermons to teaching sermons. This \nhas led to longer sermons of a particular style with which older \nfolks fail to connect.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeep in mind that very few people are offended or opposed to \ndifferent styles of worship, but many do not appreciate what appears \nto be a growing disregard for choirs, tradition and a fundamental \nhonoring of the church hour (and, only one hour is needed!) as a \nsacred time with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone wants a church filled with energetic, enthusiastic young \npeople, but they don't want to attend a service that feels like a \nyouth group for adults.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Our culture has changed so rapidly, and churches are reactive \nrather than proactive in negotiating these changes.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch, the over-60 crowd argues, is supposed to be a safe place that \nhelps families transition into a future-looking faith, but not force \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prevailing feeling is that an encroaching culture of change in \nthe digital age has dumbed down faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdd to that narrative the perception that preaching now focuses on \nself-help gimmickry rather than \"Bible-based preaching\" (not my \nwords), then it seems the church has lost its way.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Seasoned saints no longer attend church because they are busy like \neveryone else.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis has to do with the changing landscape of family life and split \nfamilies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas families used to live in the same neighborhoods and attend \nthe same churches, many families are spread across the state or the \nnation. Grandparents have to travel in order to visit adult children \nand grandchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effects of cultural shifts, anxious churches trying to attract \nyounger churchgoers, and a transient family landscape have led to the \ndecline of church attendance in the older generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, we have not balanced the need to change with the honoring of \ntraditions that have brought stability over the years.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reaching for one generation, we've left another behind by taking \npeople for granted.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps it's time for us to right the ship, take a hard look at the \ncost of change, and be the presence of Christ for every generation \nthat values joining God at work in the world rather than simply \nmeeting God within the walls of a church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to worship and Christ's mission, no one should be left \nbehind.\u0014\n\\\u0002Joe LaGuardia is senior pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in \nConyers, Georgia.\u0014",

    "words": "So, here's a quick list of 12 ideas. They don't have to be limited to \nLent and can be practiced any time you feel the need to lessen your \nload. \u0014\n\u0014\nTake a walk to a destination you normally would drive. Most of the \nworld relies on transportation other than a personal vehicle. What \nmight God teach you if you weren't flying by at 45 miles an hour?\u0014\n\u0014\nFast from a certain food item. Meat, caffeine, sugar or fast-food \nmenus are the favorites, but the possibilities are endless. The key \nis designating a certain time for a certain purpose. Some Christians \nskip a meal and donate the savings to the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake a one-day vow of silence. This might be helpful not only for \nyour family and friends, but you might hear the inner voice speaking \nto you in the stillness.\u0014\n\u0014\nClean out a drawer, closet or room in your house. Use this time to \nask yourself what other clutter you have accumulated that can be \neliminated.\u0014\n\u0014\nGive up a grudge or at least make some effort to let go of a past \nhurt. This may include permission to forgive yourself and will likely \nbe more successful if you do so in the confines of a high-trust \nrelationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nStop judging others. While you're at interior cleansing, you might \nwrestle with how much kindness you offer others. How frequently do \nyou condemn the person who is ignorant, slow, offensive, selfish, \nloud, rude or troubled? It's amazing how prejudiced we have become \nagainst others who are prejudiced.\u0014\n\u0014\nCreate a media-free evening. Some give up Facebook for a season, but \nwhat if you unplugged everything: internet, TV, radio, iPod and video \ngames? I believe if we had no electricity, we would immediately stop \ncomplaining about how little time we had.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrive in silence. Our cars are our private sanctuaries, but we crowd \nthem with our gadgets and distractions. Being silent while driving \nalone will not only clear our heads, but make our roads safer, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nGive something of value away. We often give away our worn and used-up \nproperty, but what if we freed ourselves of something valuable? How \nquickly could we respond, if God said to us as was said to Abraham, \n\"Go to a land I will show you\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nDedicate a day in your calendar to God. This is a tough one, but what \nif you scheduled a day completely for God? What would you put in it? \nThat's between you and the Divine. At the very least, it's a great \nquestion to get you thinking. What would you do with a day totally \ndedicated to the Lord?\u0014\n\u0014\nReach out to the poor or suffering. They are not forgotten by God and \nshould not be forgotten by God's people. Just remember, your \nuneasiness is temporary. For them, it's permanent.\u0014\n\u0014\nGo live with the monks or nuns. Many places welcome folks for a \nshort-term stay of a week or a weekend. It is the retreat from the \nworld that allows us to enter back into the world. \u0014\n-\u0014",

    "words": "How To Kill a Mockingbird shaped race relations in America \u0014\nFeb 22nd 2016,  THE ECONOMIST\u0014\n\u0014\nIN 1988 in Monroeville, Alabama, Ronda Morrison, the 18-year-old \ndaughter of a respected local family, was found murdered in the \ntowns dry cleaning store. When the sheriffs office failed to make \nan arrest after months of investigation, the community grew angry and \nstarted accusing the police of incompetence. Spurred by criticism, \nofficials indicted Walter McMillian, a local black man whose affair \nwith a white woman had become the subject of heated town discussion. \nIn the absence of evidence, the State coerced witnesses into \ntestifying against him. Their statements didnt hold with the facts \nof the case, but that didnt matter much. Neither did the testimony \nof three black witnesses who confirmed that Mr McMillian had been at \na church fish fry at the time of the murder. He was convicted and \nsentenced to death; in fact, he had been held on death row before his \ntrial had even begun.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonroeville is best known as the hometown of Harper Lee and the \nsetting of her 1960 novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. (It is renamed as \nMaycomb in her novel.) The town has claimed her for bragging rights \never since the book became a bestseller, which was almost instantly. \nLocal leaders turned the courthouse into a Mockingbird museum. An \nacting troupe formed The Mockingbird Players of Monroeville to \nstage a theatre adaptation for tourists. More than just a marketing \ngimmick, the novel became a source of tremendous town pride. When \nBryan Stevenson, a young Harvard Law graduate, visited Monroeville in \n1989 to take up Mr McMillians appeal, he was struck by the \nMockingbird fervour: Have you read the book? a clerk pressed him. \nIts a wonderful story. This is a famous placeWhen they made the \nmovie, Gregory Peck came here.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for Mr Stevenson, Monroevilles delight in its literary eminence \nhad a sour taste. There were uncanny parallels between the McMillian \ncase and the novels famous trial: white paranoia about interracial \nrelations, the scapegoating of an innocent black man, a hasty \nconviction that flew in the face of evidence and common sense, and \ntown authorities bent on execution. Had the town learned nothing from \nthe novel it celebrated? In his memoir, Just Mercy, Mr Stevenson \nwrites, Sentimentality about Lees story grew even as the harder \ntruths of the book took no root.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter McMillian met a better fate than the fictional Tom Robinson; \nafter six years on death row, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals \noverturned his conviction. But the episode points to the strange \nbarriers people sometimes erect between literature and real life. In \nwriting Tom Robinsons trial, Harper Lee actually drew on local \nAlabama cases in which black men were unjustly convicted and killed. \nAlmost thirty years after the novels publication, however, Alabama \nand other states continued to condemn staggering numbers of black \nAmericans in trials warped by racism and dishonesty.\u0014\n\u0014\nChange has been slow to come to Monroeville, but this isnt to say \nthat Lees novel didnt have a tremendous influence on race relations \nin America. It has been credited with fuelling the civil rights \nmovement, much as Uncle Toms Cabin, the anti-slavery novel by \nHarriet Beecher Stowe, fuelled the abolitionist movement of the 19th \ncentury. It brought the ugly realities of discrimination, especially \nin the South, to international attention. As a popular work of \nfiction by a white woman, it also invited readers to think about race \nin ways that political treatises or speeches could not. \u0014\n\u0014\nAtticus Finch, the lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, became the \ninspiration for generations of justice crusaders. His model of \npeaceful but persistent resistance resonated with activists. In Why \nWe Cant Wait, Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote, To the Negro in 1963, \nas to Atticus Finch, it had become obvious that nonviolence could \nsymbolise the gold badge of heroism rather than the white feather of \ncowardice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways, America is still feeling the influence of Lees novel \ntodayin the national conversation about criminal justice, the Black \nLives Matter movement, even President Barack Obamas recent prison \nreforms. Last year saw a media frenzy surrounding the publication of \nGo Set a Watchman, an early version of Mockingbird, which it \nseems Lee never intended to publish. This is unfortunate, but it \nshouldnt obscure the legacy of To Kill a Mockingbird. The novel \nremains a testament to the ways fiction can expose a societys sins, \nalter consciousness, and advance the gradual work of social change\u0014",

Begin with infancy to give the child everything he wants.  In this \nway, he will grow up to believe the world owes him a living.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. When he picks up bad words, laugh at him.  This will make him \nthink he's cute.  It will also encourage him to pick up \"cuter\" \nphrases that will blow off the top of your head later.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Never give him any spiritual training. Wait until he is 21, and \nthen let him \"decide for himself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Avoid use of the word \"wrong.\"  It may develop a guilt complex.  \nThis will condition him to believer, later, when he is arrested for \nstealing a car that society is against him, and he is being \npersecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Pick up everything he leaves lying around--books, shoes, and \nclothing.  Do everything for him so he will be experienced in \nthrowing all responsibility on to others.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Let him read any printed matter he can get his hands on. Be \ncareful that the silverware and drinking glasses are sterilized, but \nlet his mind feast on garbage.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Quarrel frequently in the presence of your child.  In this way, he \nwill not be too shocked when the home is broken up later. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. Give a child all the spending money he wants.  Never let him earn \nhis own.  Why should he have things as tough as you had them?\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Satisfy his every craving for food, drink and comfort.  See that \nevery sensual desire is gratified. Denial may lead to frustration.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Take his part against neighbors, teacher and policemen. They are \nall prejudiced against your child.\u0014\n\u0014\n11. When he gets into real trouble, apologize for your actions by \nsaying, \"I never could do anything with that kid.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n12. Prepare for a life of grief.  You're very likely to have it.\u0014",

But the nineteen Catholic prisoners refused to \nrepeat the required words. They had already refused to renounce the \ndoctrine of transubstantiation. (Catholics teach transubstantiation, \nthat the bread and wine really become the body and blood of Christ, \nwhereas Calvinists view the bread and wine more as symbols.)\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the religious wars that followed the Reformation, hideous \natrocities were perpetrated on both sides. Another such was about to \ntake place. \u0014\n\u0014\nCatholic Spain had ruled the lowlands of Northwestern Europe with an \niron rod. In defiance of Spanish rule, much of the region became \nProtestant. Catholic and Protestants alike united in rebellion \nagainst Spain but their unity soon broke down over religious \ndifferences. Catholic Spain tortured Protestants; Protestant mobs \nsmashed Catholic images and looted their churches. (Eventually, some \ntime after the little states won freedom from Spain, the Catholics \nformed the nation we know as Belgium, while Protestants formed the \nNetherlands.) But meanwhile, there were pockets of Catholics within \nProtestant areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne such pocket was in the small coastal town of Gorcum. It had two \nCatholic parishes and a Franciscan friary.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the Protestant resistance was carried on from the sea by \nfighters known as Sea Beggars. The Sea Beggars seized Gorcum on June \n26, 1572. They captured the Franciscans and some other Catholic \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter their capture, the men were held in prison for several days. \nThen, early in July, they were brought by boat to Briel. There they \nwere paraded around the town square and forced to sing the Litany of \nthe Saints while their Calvinist captors jeered. Compelled to debate \nwith Calvinist preachers, they clung to their Catholic beliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, the farmers and fishermen of Gorcum demanded their \nreligious leaders back. Even Protestants called for mercy on the men. \nWilliam of Orange, leader of the resistance, sent an order commanding \nthat priests and other religious leaders be left alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Lumey, the admiral of the Sea Beggars, had other ideas. He \nordered the men hanged. On this day, July 9, 1572, under the \nsupervision of an ex-Catholic priest, they were strung up in a turf \nshed outside Briel and mutilated. Among the nineteen who died that \nday was Joannes van Hoornaer, a brave Dominican. When he heard that \nthe Franciscans were in captivity, he hurried to administer the \nsacraments to them. Another priest also voluntarily joined them. This \nman was notorious for his womanizing. When this was pointed out to \nhim, he said, \"Fornicator I always was; heretic* I never was.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n*A heretic is one who holds a doctrine defined by some group as false.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAlbers, P. \"The Martyrs of Gorkum.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

    "title": "1ST PERFORMANCE OF SAMUEL SMITH'S \"AMERICA\"",
    "words": "1st Performance of Samuel F. \nSmith's \"America\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and \nvery poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian!

For the most part, they are men and \nwomen who didnt want to be divorced. They wanted their marriage to \nsurvive. It may not have been an affair that killed their union. But \nthey had a spouse who didnt love them, their kids, or God, enough to \nkeep the marriage alive. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore Im bombarded with emails from Bible scholars accusing me of \nbeing, soft on divorce, let me share that nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. My parents divorce nearly killed me as a kid, and I \nseriously pondered suicide during my own divorce 20 years later. So \nlet me clearly state, I hate divorce. I love divorced people. Why? \nJesus loves them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what this injured group of people wishes others understood is:\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a Death\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of the circumstances, divorces signifies the demise of the \nmarriage. Its a relationship fatality. Its the death of the dream, \nthe death of the vow, and the death of, what should have been.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is Betrayal at a Soul Level\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I do becomes I dont, the gut response is excruciatingly \npainful. Its a rejection like no other. The person that you thought \nwould be your lifetime partner, your soft place to fall during the \nhard times, the one person you could trust when the rest of the world \nturns its back, says, You arent worth it. \u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a Soul Deep Accuser \u0014\n\u0014\nNight and day spousal rejection hauntingly whispers, You are a \nloser. You are unlovable. You are a failure. You deserve to be alone. \nLife is over. You will never be loved again. \u0014\nThis is true even if your spouse didnt have an affair. The \ndeclarations lurk even when he or she chooses drugs, alcohol, \npornography, abuse, or toxic habits over you. When a spouse decides \nthose things are more cherished than the vow they made, when they \nrefuse to stop destroying the marriageits devastating. \u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Becomes an Identity\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter my divorce, one of the most humiliating tasks was marking \ndivorced rather than married on a form. It was a label I hated. \nWhen I was single, that term didnt bother me. But divorce left me \nwith an imaginary huge red D stamped on my forehead for the world \nto seeand judge. \u0014\nIt took a long time, some great friends, and a terrific church to \nhelp me recognize that divorce was something I experienced. It was \nnot my identity.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Strengthened and Weakened My Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one hand, I knew Jesus was the only one who could carry me through \nthe pain. I had nothing and no one else to lean on. I contemplated \nsuicide often and my life was hanging by a thread. I was certain that \nHe alone could rescue me. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, feelings of failure and shame tempted me to run \nfrom the Holy One. The world called me to numb my agony with choices \nthat had sufficed before I knew Christ. I was on a precipice of \nrunning to Him and away from Him at the same time. \u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, my Father knows my heart and He loves me. He worked \novertime to woo me back into His loving embrace. He became the \nfaithful Husband I lost. He declared, I will make you my wife \nforever, showing you righteousness and justice, unfailing love and \ncompassion. I will be faithful to you and make you mine, and you will \nfinally know me as the Lord. (Hosea 2:19-20 NLT)\u0014",

    "title": "3 MISTAKES MOST PEOPLE MAKE WHEN READING REVELATION",
    "words": "3 Mistakes Most People Make When \nReading Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is for those who are tired of playing games with Revelation; who \nare ready to approach it in a new way  as Scripture  and to seek \nout its word to us in line with best practices in listening to the \nrest of Scripture. Because Scripture ought to be considered first and \nforemost as a word to those for whom it was written, from the Lord to \ngive them much-needed guidance. I have found this approach lends \nitself far better to biblical preaching and to the difficult task of \ndiscerning the challenges facing Christians in their settings \nworldwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nMistake #1: Reading Revelation as if it is all about us.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as Paul wrote all of his letters to address the challenges \nfacing particular congregations, so John wrote Revelation to address \nthe challenges facing seven real churches in late first-century Roman \nAsia Minor: John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to \nyou and peace. (Rev. 1:4) Comparing this verse to the openings of \nalmost all New Testament letters shows us something important: \nRevelation is also a letter, and asks to be read as such. \u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation will speak a word to us as well, of course, but it speaks \nthe clearest and most reliably when we read as we would 1 Corinthians \nor 1 Peter: when we think about it first as a pastoral word to the \nactual churches the author cared about, a word that was to be \nunderstood by them, to shape their perceptions of their everyday \nrealities, and to motivate faithful responses to their circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nMistake #2: Reading Revelation as if it is all about our future.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn speaks of his work as the words of this prophecy (Rev. 1:3; \nalso 22:7, 10, 18, 19). The first instinct of many interpreters is to \nthink of prophecy as murky prediction about some future event. \nRevelation has been read as prophesying events in John's own \nimmediate future (the preterist reading); events spanning the whole \ntime between John's own and the future, second coming of Jesus (the \nhistoricist reading); or events chiefly still yet-to-come for the \nmodern interpreters (the futurist reading). These three approaches \nshare the assumption that, by prophecy, John primarily indicates \nthat he is communicating predictions about specific events that will \nunfold at some point in his first audience's future, and that his \npredictions are the interpretative key to the book. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, if we were to canvass the prophetic utterances of the Hebrew \nBible and the phenomenon of prophecy within the New Testament and \nearly Christian worship, we might instead arrive at the conclusion \nthat, while prophecy could include a predictive element, it was \nprimarily a declaration of God's action in the present. In these \ncases, prophecy served as an announcement of God's evaluation of the \npresent actions of God's people, diagnosing problems and calling for \nrealignment with God's values. \u0014\n\u0014\nProphecy was essentially a word of the Lord breaking into the \nsituation of the Lord's people who need guidance, encouragement, or a \ncall to repentance and recommitment; it was also a regular experience \nin the worship life at least of the Pauline churches (Rom. 12:6; 1 \nCor. 12:10, 28-29; 14:3-4, 23-25, 29-31; Eph. 4:11). Prophecy was the \nrevelation of God's perspective on a situation that invited a radical \nre-orientation to one's circumstances, practices, or pursuits. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Revelation, the seven so-called lettersI prefer the seven \noracles, as each follows more the pattern of Thus says the \nLordto the seven churches are a prime example of early Christian \nprophecy. The risen and glorified Lord speaks a word to the churches \nthrough the prophet John, affirming their strengths, diagnosing their \nweaknesses, calling them to faithful action, threatening judgment \nupon the recalcitrant and promising favor for the penitent and \nfaithful. In short, they do precisely what so much of the prophetic \ncorpus of the Old Testament sought to do for the communities of \nIsrael and Judah. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere a prophet speaks of the future, he or she usually limits the \nprediction to the immediately forthcoming future, not the distant \nfuture: Yet forty days, and Nineveh will be destroyed; There will \nnot be dew nor rain for the next three years; and the like. John \nremains within this range, seen in his emphasis on the imminence of \nthe confrontations and events he narrates, his conviction that he \nspeaks about what must soon come to pass (Rev. 22:6; cf. 1:3, 19; \n4:1; 22:7, 10, 12, 20).\u0014\n\u0014\nMistake #3: Reading Revelation as a mysterious code, one that we're \nin a better position to unlock than anyone else.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the contrary, we are in a far less privileged position than the \nChristians in Ephesus or Pergamum when it comes to reading \nRevelation. Indeed, the realities with which Revelation interactsthe \nfeatures of a landscape very familiar to its first audiencesare for \nus elements of a quite distant and foreign landscape. As for being \nwritten in code, I am convinced that, if a copy of Revelation fell \ninto the hands of a Roman official of even modest intelligence, the \nsubversive intent of its imagery would not be difficult to grasp in \nthe least (especially with dead giveaways like 17:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the very first word of his book (Apokalypsis) John identifies \nhis work as an unveiling, not a cryptic encoding. Revelation was \nnot sent to those seven churches as a mysterious text needing to be \ninterpreted: it was sent to interpret the world of those readers. The \nfirst readers and hearers did not need a special key to unlock \nRevelation; Revelation was the key by which they could unlock the \nreal meaning of what was going on around them, and so respond to it \nfaithfully. Revelation lifted the veil from prominent features and \npersons in the audience's landscape so that those Christians could \nsee things in their world as they really were in light of the \nbigger picture of God's purposes for the world, and the larger \npicture of the great revolt against God, which God would ultimately \ncrush.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike similar apocalypses written in the centuries around the turn \nof the era, Revelation pulls back the curtain on the larger landscape \nin terms of heavenly and infernal spaces and personnel and in terms \nof how we got here and where things are heading, so as to put the \nseven churches' present realities within the interpretive context of \na larger, invisible world and a sacred history of God's activity and \ncarefully defined plan. The gift of the genre is to illumine the \nmoment for the ancient audience: it puts their mundane reality, along \nwith its challenges and options, in its true light and proper \nperspective, so that the faithful responses become evident and \nadvantageous. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow then should we read Revelation?\u0014\n\u0014\nReading Revelation as pastoral letter, early Christian prophecy, and \napocalypse orients us toward Revelation in a very different way from \nthose who read it as a road map for our future or as a countdown to \nthe end. It orients us to a way of reading, moreover, that coheres \nbetter with how we read the rest of Scripture; to a way that helps us \nhear more of Revelation's challenge to us in our situation apart from \nthe distracting conversation about determining if or when some \ncountdown has begun.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis approach to Revelation summons us to immerse ourselves in the \nsituations of the congregations addressed by John so that we can \ndiscover the following: \u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tWhat practices around and within the churches he found to be \nobjectionable\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tWhether the churches' responses to the challenges of living under \nChrist's lordship were commendable or objectionable\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tHow communities of disciples could live more fully in line with \nGod's purposes, seeking justice and wholeness for all people\u0014\n\u0014\nThis gives us a basis from which to discern what questions and \nchallenges John would pose to us as communities of disciples living \nin the midst of the contemporary social, political, economic, and \nglobal orders. Understanding how John brought the resources of \nScripture, prayer, and worship to bear on the situations of his \ncongregations gives us direction for our own process of discernment \nand our task of proclamation. \u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, this enables us to move closer to seeing our world from \nGod's point of view and, therefore, to knowing how to respond to its \nchallenges and entanglements in a way that reflects more closely our \nprimary allegiance to the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n***\u0014\n\\\\\\David deSilva is a Trustees' Distinguished Professor of New \nTestament and Greek at Ashland Theological Seminary.

    "title": "10 YEARS AFTER AMISH SCHOOL KILLING, GRIEF GOES ON",
    "words": "10 years after Amish Schoolhouse Killing, the Work of Grieving \nRemains\u0014\n\u0014\n        Elizabeth Evans | Religion News Service | Monday, October 03, \n2016\u0014\n\u0014\n{}The West Nickel Mines School is long gone. Two of the survivors are \nnow married. Several of the couples who lost their daughters have had \nmore children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe shooting 10 years ago in a placid Lancaster County hamlet made \nheadlines across the world as the Amish rushed to forgive the \nshooter. But the grief and pain live on.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Oct. 2, 2006, a heavily armed milk truck driver, Charles Carl \nRoberts IV, burst into the West Nickel Mines School shortly after \nrecess. By the time Roberts had committed suicide, less than an hour \nlater, five girls aged 6-13 were dead, and five others severely \nwounded.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the slaughter, Roberts allowed the boys, several visiting \nadults, and the teacher to leave: It was the teacher who raced to a \nneighboring home to ask a local farmer to call the police.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough there had already been numerous school shootings that year, \nthe invasion of a publicity-shy community committed to nonviolence, \nand the remarkable swiftness with which the Amish offered forgiveness \nto the killers widow and family, drew international attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nThousands of condolence letters poured in. So did more tangible \nassistance, including $4 million from funds established for medical \ncare for the girls who survived. One of them remains at home, her \ninjuries grave enough to confine her to a wheelchair and dependent on \nongoing medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the Amish generally do not accept charity, the medical \nexpenses associated with treating survivors would have been \nunsustainable without such help.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Hope school has replaced the old schoolhouse, which was razed \nsoon after the tragedy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe childrens teacher has married and left the profession.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the families talk about living with the new normal, which means \nmaking a place for the grief and pain, said Herman Bontrager, a \nbusinessman and longtime friend of the local Amish community who \nbecame their representative in the days after the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey all think of living their way through the tragedy, not getting \nover it. All the families are very grateful for all their children \nand they see them all as gifts from God.\u0014\n\u0014\nTerri Roberts, mother of Charles Roberts, has written Forgiven: The \nAmish School Shooting, a Mothers Love, and a Story of Remarkable \nGrace, explaining her search for healing and documenting the \ngenerous response of the Amish community. The shooters wife, Marie \nMonville, who has since remarried, has also written a book, One \nLight Still Shines: My Life Beyond the Shadow of the Amish \nSchoolhouse Shooting.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as Bontrager makes clear, the Amish understand forgiveness, and a \ndetermination not to seek revenge, as a natural response to faith \nteachings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Amish arent all perfect, said Bontrager. The first thing they \ntell me is that they are human, just like everyone else. But they \nhave led the way in this sense: they showed that a 500-year-old \nsubculture has been able, for a long time, to hold on to nonviolence \nand nonresistance. It takes practice and discipline.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimply stated, the Lords Prayer as it is taught is very important \nto us, said a local Amish church leader who has walked alongside the \nfamilies since that horrific first day.\u0014\n\u0014\nNicki Weisensee Egan, a senior writer for People Magazine who covered \nthe Nickel Mines shootings, said the nation was captivated by the \nAmish gesture of forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way that they were able to (reach out to the killers family) so \nquickly and hold on to their faith captured peoples hearts, \nincluding mine, she said. I think its extraordinary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs they grieved, the Amish community in Lancaster continued normal \npursuits: farming, construction and crafts.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think the families who had children in the schoolhouse found \npowerful therapeutic healing for their grief in the close bonds and \nnetworks of care in the Amish community, said Donald Kraybill, \nsenior fellow emeritus at Elizabethtown Colleges Young Center, and \none of the co-authors of Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended \nTragedy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best counseling was from the families who had girls pass away, \nwhen we all got together, said one father who lost his 12-year-old \ndaughter in the schoolhouse shootings but asked that his name not be \npublished. We did that a lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmish couples have traveled to towns affected by other school \nshootings, including Newtown, Conn., and Blacksburg, Va., the sites \nof two other mass shootings. Weve reached out and that was always a \nblessing, said the father. The best general message I could give to \nanyone is to actively seek Gods help because faith is very \nimportant.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there is someone who is struggling from the loss of a child, \nspouse or parents, the most important thing is to talk to someone \nabout it, he added. Find someone you trust, because bottling it up \ninside causes bitterness and bitterness brings hatred.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he says hes sure that the shootings werent part of Gods \nplan, this is something he permitted as a way to get his name \nrecognized in ways that might not have happened otherwise, he \nconcluded. Thats as much as my human mind understands, and a \nthought Ive become comfortable with.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Evans is a correspondent based in Chester County, Pa.\u0014",

    "title": "10 POISONS THAT WILL KILL ANY CHURCH",
    "words": "10 Poisons That Will Kill Any Church\u0014\nBy Todd Gaddis \u0014\n\u0014\nI read recently that thousands of churches close their doors every \nyear. Who knows how many others are on life support? We live in a \ntime when churches need revitalization and renewal. The eternal \ndestiny of people depend on the faithful witness of local churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I think about churches dying, Im reminded there are certain \npoisons that are causes of death. I call them poisons because they \nare deadly, but they avoidable. The churches that die from them do so \nby their own hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are ten poisons that will kill any church.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerformance without participation\u0014\n\u0014\nLike concerts, movies, and athletic events, much of our worship has \nbecome spectator-oriented. A handful of well-trained (perhaps paid) \nmusicians perform for the masses. Too often, we enjoy entertainment \nwithout experiencing engagement.\u0014\n\u0014\nInformation without inspiration\u0014\n\u0014\nWith advancement in technology and a multitude of media sources, we \nare drowning in information. Clearly, this phenomenon has spilled \nover into the church. Sermons, conferences, seminars, and Bibles \nstudies are good, but some have sat and soaked so long that theyve \nsoured.\u0014\n\u0014\nMirrors without windows\u0014\n\u0014\nToo many churches stare at themselves in the mirror, primping and \npreparing for the home town fans. Instead, we should be peering out \nwindows, looking for local needs and global opportunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttachment without commitment\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who used to attend two or three times a month are now coming \nonce or twice. Most people I run across claim an affiliation with a \ncongregation, yet too many lack affection for its mission. They want \nto be included on the roll without taking a role.\u0014\n\u0014\nRitual without spontaneity\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a young man was asked why he didnt go to church, he replied, \nIve been. Church services are too often boring, irrelevant, and \npredictable. We speak a different language on Sunday than the rest of \nthe week. Were saying the same things, singing the same songs, and \nvoicing the same prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsperity without generosity\u0014\n\u0014\nMost congregants are employed and making decent money, yet this good \nfortune isnt spilling over into the offering plate. Tithers are \ndying and tippers are taking their place. Donations are on course to \ndrop by 70 percent within twenty-five to thirty yearsdue to the \ndeaths of the most generous generations, says John Dickerson in The \nGreat Evangelical Recession. \u0014\n\u0014\nAddition without reproduction\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of what we call church growth is actually sheep swapping. We \nplay musical pews, as Christians hop from church to church. Some \nchurches may be adding to their membership, yet how many of these \nconstitute a net gain for the Kingdom?\u0014\n\u0014\nBirth without growth\u0014\n\u0014\nIts wonderful when the nursery is full of newborns, yet not so good \nwhen they make up a sizable portion of the congregation each Sunday. \nIf your first grade child or grandchild made an A on a test of \none-digit addition and subtraction problems, youd beam with pride. \nHowever, would you feel the same way if your high school calculus \nstudent aced that same set of problems?\u0014\n\u0014\nMembership without conversion\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Christian author and researcher George Barna half of \nall adults who attend Protestant churches on a typical Sunday morning \nare not Christian. Having spent 14 years as an unsaved church \nmember, Im especially sensitive to this sad situation. A name on the \nchurch roll doesnt forward to the Lambs book of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuty without love\u0014\n\u0014\nToo many 21st century congregations are modeling the first century \nchurch at Ephesus (Rev 2:1-7). Calendars are full but hearts are \nempty. Love for Jesus, fellow saints, and one another is growing cold \nin these later days (Matthew 24:12).\u0014\n\u0014\nItll take widespread revival to reverse these trends. In the \nmeantime, while we pray for and anticipate such a move from God, we \ncan strive to make sure the people we shepherd and churches we serve \nbuck the trend.\u0014",

    "title": "6TH COUNCIL GRAPPLED WITH CHRIST'S NATURE",
    "words": "6th Council \nGrappled with Christ's Natures\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Agatho was troubled. \"Believe your most humble [servant], my \nmost Christian lords and sons, that I am pouring forth these prayers \nwith my tears,\" he wrote the emperor and eastern bishops. The year \nwas 680. The cause of his distress was a dangerous heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgatho's concern led him to practical steps. He called a synod at \nRome to condemn the teachings of the heretics. He then dispatched a \nlengthy letter to Constantinople, which was then the seat of the \nRoman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe upshot was that a council of the church was called to deal with \nthe latest attack on Christ. The sixth general council of the church \nconvened on this day, November 7, 680 in Constantinople. The \npatriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch were present as was Emperor \nConstantine Pogonatus. Rome, Alexandria and Jerusalem sent \nrepresentatives. The council dealt with one issue only, the heretical \nteaching called monothelitism.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonothelitism effectively denied Christ's humanity, claiming that he \nhad only one will--the divine. It arose as an attempt to unify the \northodox and monophysite factions of the church in face of rising \ndanger from Persia and Islam in the east. Several notable church \nleaders had signed onto this error, including an earlier pope, \nHonorius, and the previous emperor, Constans II.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn eighteen sessions that took the better part of a year, the council \ngrappled with the issue. In the end, the assembled bishops left no \ndoubt where they stood regarding the writings of the heretics and the \nheretics themselves: \"...we find that these documents are quite \nforeign to the apostolic dogmas, to the declarations of the holy \nCouncils, and to all the accepted Fathers, and that they follow the \nfalse teachings of the heretics; therefore we entirely reject them, \nand execrate them as hurtful to the soul. But the names of those men \nwhose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust forth from the holy \nChurch of God...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council further declared \"...our Lord Jesus Christ must be \nconfessed to be very God and very man, one of the holy and \nconsubstantial and life-giving Trinity, perfect in Deity and perfect \nin humanity, very God and very man, of a reasonable soul and human \nbody subsisting; consubstantial with the Father as touching his \nGodhead and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood...the \npeculiarities of neither nature being lost by the union but rather \nthe proprieties of each nature being preserved, concurring in one \nPerson and in one subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons \nbut one and the same only-begotten Son of God, the Word, our Lord \nJesus Christ...we likewise declare that in him are two natural \nwills...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

    "title": "7 REASONS SOCIAL MEDIA IS DIVIDING AMERICA TODAY",
    "words": "Seven reasons social media is dividing America today\u0014\nMark Wingfield |   February 22, 2017  Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone knows America is a deeply divided nation: Trump supporters \nversus Trump critics, Republicans versus Democrats, traditionalists \nversus progressives, Yankees fans versus everyone else. But another \ndeep divide is emerging in the midst of all this: The proper use of \nsocial media.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can tell a lot about a persons personality and demeanor by what \nthey think about social media today. Fairly frequently, someone will \npost on Facebook: Taking a break from Facebook for a while. Cant \ntake all the politics. See you in a few months.\u0014\n\u0014\nA recent conversation among trusted colleagues amplified the point. \nSome argued that its called social media for a reason: It should \nonly be about social things, polite conversation and photos of daily \nlife. Others argued that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the like \nhave moved beyond their social origins to become a kind of town \nsquare for discussing and debating ideas. Some said social media \nprovides an outlet to process feelings and express themselves. Most \nall said they struggle with knowing how much to say on social media \nthat might elicit negative responses and how to deal with friends \nwith whom they disagree.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is this such a greater problem in 2017? At least seven factors \nseem likely:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMore people are reading more news on social media. A 2016 report by \nthe Pew Research Center found 62 percent of social media users get \nnews via those social media platforms  up from 49 percent just four \nyears earlier. Heres a line from that report: Facebook is by far \nthe largest social networking site, reaching 67 percent of U.S. \nadults. The two-thirds of Facebook users who get news there, then, \namount to 44 percent of the general population.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMedia outlets are increasingly using social media. Chances are, you \ngot to this post on the website Baptist News Global via social media. \nTypically, between 50 percent and 65 percent of all page views on BNG \ncontent pass through social media as a gateway. That is likely true \nof most major news outlets with an online presence, including major \ndaily newspapers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNot all news is really news. Social media news, however, may not \nbe balanced and may not even be legitimate. While mainstream media \noutlets with high journalistic standards (New York Times, Washington \nPost, for example) push out news via social media, so do all sorts of \nagenda-driven, profit-driven outfits with no journalistic standards. \nAdded to that, social media learns what we like and easily can \nreinforce our own confirmation bias.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tTheres a lot to be said today. Never in our lifetimes have \nAmericans been more riled up to speak their minds about important \nissues of the day. The natural outlet: social media.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome of us are conflict averse. A certain percentage of the \npopulation is, by nature, conflict averse. These are your friends who \nwistfully long for nothing but cat videos and posts about happy \nchildren and favorite recipes on Facebook. The emerging town square \nmodel of social media makes them most uncomfortable. If you follow \nthe breakdown of the DISC personality analysis, this could be around \n14 percent of the population, those who are firm conscientious \npersonalities.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tSome of us like conflict. A certain percentage of the population, \nby nature, thrive on some level of conflict. These are your friends \nwho love to debate any and all ideas, who will play devils advocate \nin a heartbeat and love to provoke you to move outside your comfort \nzone. They love the emerging town square model of social media \nbecause it extends their platform. Again from the DISC analysis, this \ncould be up to 18 percent of the population, those who are firm \ndominant personalities and tend to have a preference for a \ncompete conflict mode where there is a clear winner and a clear \nloser.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe news cycle is moving fast. Out of the 2016 election cycle and \nwith the dawn of the Trump administration, the American news cycle is \nmoving at warp speed. Speaking as a trained journalist, never in my \nlifetime have I seen such major events appear in the news and then \nget overcome less than 24 hours later by even more major events. What \nwe normally would have digested and discussed for weeks now has to be \ncomprehended in a day or less.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimply put: Social media now stands at the center of the kind of \nrapid change that we the people barely can comprehend. And since \ndifferent personalities process information and respond to change in \ngreatly different ways, its easy to blame the medium rather than the \nmessage. Or to blame the messenger rather than the message.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no more efficient way to disseminate information today than \nsocial media. Its fast, has broad reach and is free. But if were \ngoing to have conversations that matter, we need to find ways to move \nbeyond the screen to talk with each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisagreements we have about the proper use of social media may mask \nthe real challenges of our day. And that especially puts people of \nfaith  and clergy in particular  in a tough spot. Instead of being \nsolvers of conflict, we may take on the appearance of creating \nconflict just by being messengers of important information.\u0014\n\u0014\nConflict can be good. It can surface problems when they arise, and it \ncan deepen and improve relationships as we seek to resolve conflict. \nThe best part of conflict is naming the challenges before us. And \nthats exactly what so many are trying to do through social media \ntoday: Look at this! You need to know this!\u0014\n\u0014\nCommunication is essential to resolving conflict. Some studies have \nshown in a typical communication interaction, we get 55 percent of \nthe meaning from non-verbal cues, 38 percent from tone, and only 7 \npercent from the actual words. With its heavy focus on words, social \nmedia is missing 93 percent of the way people make meaning from their \ncommunications. Thats likely one of the reasons Facebook prioritizes \nphotos and videos in its algorithm that determines what you see in \nyour news feed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no more efficient way to disseminate information today than \nsocial media. Its fast, has broad reach and is free. But if were \ngoing to have conversations that matter, we need to find ways to move \nbeyond the screen to talk with each other. Who is willing to host \nthose conversations?\u0014",

G. Haykin, author of Rediscovering \nthe Church Fathers: Who They Were and How They Shaped the Church and \nEight Women of Faith. This post is part of our 10 Things You Should \nKnow blog series.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Patrick was not Irish.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis background was Romanized British, and he was a part of the upper \nclass who ran Roman-British society before the fall of the western \nRoman Empire in the fifth century. This means he was from either what \nis now Wales or England, or even possibly southern Scotland.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Patrick left two genuine writings: his Confession and his Letter \nto the Soldiers of Coroticus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is a defense of his mission to Ireland and the latter a \ndeeply emotional response to the brutal killing of some new \nChristians by a warlord named Coroticus.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Patricks conversion came as a result of his being taken as a \nslave to Ireland by Irish raiders.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had been raised in a Christian home, but tells us in his \nConfession that he had paid no attention as a youngster to what he \nhad heard in church. He was sixteen when he was taken captive and \nthat would have been around AD 406 or 407.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Patricks mission to Ireland from around AD 430 to 460 was \nvirtually the only evangelistic mission in fifth-century Western \nEurope.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would seem that many Roman Christians felt that the so-called \nbarbarians beyond the Roman Empire were not worth evangelizing. \nPeople in his home church in Britain actually opposed his mission to \nIreland because they felt he was throwing away his life among the \ngodless Irish.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Dreams play a prominent role at key turning-points in Patricks \nlife, but Scripture was the central factor in the major decisions of \nhis life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, he had a dream confirming his call to be a missionary to \nIreland. But it was passages like Matthew 28:1920, what we now call \nthe Great Commission, that were decisive in his going to Ireland. His \nmission was centered on the northern half of Ireland and thousands of \nIrish men and women were converted under Patricks preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. We have no idea if Patrick read any other books than the Bible, \nfor that is the only book he ever quotes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he did cite a creed, which may have been the confession of \nhis home church in Britain. The creed shows the clear influence of \nthe Nicene Creed from AD 381 that confesses the full deity of each of \nthe three persons of the Godhead.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Patricks love for the written words of the Bible was passed on to \nthe Celtic church, which became the most learned body of churches in \nWestern Europe during the early Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Patrick came to Ireland he would have found a society that was \nby and large mostly illiterate, but within two generations, the \nCeltic church was the most literate body of churches in Western \nEurope. One of Patricks great gifts to the Irish was literacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. At the heart of Patricks faith was his love for the doctrine of \nthe Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis love is found in a number of places in his Confession, and \nactually was at the heart of his reasons for going to Ireland as a \nmissionary. The Celtic church that he founded was also deeply \ntrinitarian and in this regard is a great model for churches today.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Legends about Patrick are legion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the reason that there are no snakes in Ireland is that \nPatrick kicked them all out of Ireland. Or that Patrick taught the \ndoctrine of the Trinity by means of the shamrock. Or that he \nregularly had showdowns with the leaders of Irish paganism, namely \nthe Druids. There is no evidence he did either of the first two, and \nwhile he does tell us he was often in danger of losing his life \nbecause of opposition, he never mentions the Druids.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Patricks mission to Ireland has been an inspiration to a number \ndown through the years.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, it inspired William Carey in his mission to India. And \nhopefully can do the same in our day!\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael A. G. Haykin (ThD, University of Toronto) is professor of \nchurch history and biblical spirituality at the Southern Baptist \nTheological Seminary and director of the Andrew Fuller Center for \nBaptist Studies. He has authored or edited more than twenty-five \nbooks, including Rediscovering the Church Fathers: Who They Were and \nHow They Shaped the Church.\u0014",

    "words": "Discovery of 3,000-Year-Old Donkey Dung Validates Biblical Account of \nKing Solomon\u0014\n\u0014\nVeronica Neffinger | Editor, ChristianHeadlines\u0014\n\u0014\nA new archaeological discovery has validated the Bibles account of \nKing Solomons riches and wealth.\u0014\nAlthough ancient donkey dung may be the least thing we may expect to \nhold historical secrets, that is exactly what archaeologists have \nbeen analyzing to learn more about the time period of the biblical \nkings David and Solomon.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn article in National Geographic reveals that the ancient manure was \npreserved by the arid climate of Israels Timna Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\nArchaeologists discovered the 3,000-year-old dung in an ancient \nmining camp, in an area filled with copper mines where ore used to be \nheated to turn into metal. This backs the biblical account \nreferencing King Solomons vast wealth, much of which likely came \nfrom these mines.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe thought maybe some nomads had camped there with their goats a few \ndecades ago, said archaeologist Erez Ben-Yosef said. But the \n[radiocarbon] dates came back from the lab, and they confirmed we \nwere talking about donkeys and other livestock from the 10th century \nB.C. It was hard to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother interesting thing archaeologists discovered was that the dung \nsamples contained seeds and pollen spores that helped researchers \ndetermine the animals diet. This revealed that their feed had been \nimported from more than 100 miles away, near the Mediterranean coast.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil recently we had almost nothing from this period in this area, \nBen-Yosef said. But now we not only know that this was a source of \ncopper, but also that its from the days of King David and his son \nSolomon.\u0014",

    "title": "17-YEAR-OLD GETS 2 DEGREES THE SAME DAY FROM RANDOLPH MACON",
    "words": "17-year-old graduating from Randolph-Macon Saturday; he enrolled when \nhe was 12 \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBy MICHAEL O'CONNOR Richmond Times-Dispatch       Michael O'Connor \u0014\n\t\tMay 25, 2017   Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA 12-year-old walks into a calculus class at Randolph-Macon College \nand none of the students can guess his age.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor asks students over the age of 18 to raise their hand. \nAll but one raises a hand. The professor asks everyone under the age \nof 18 to raise a hand, and the 12-year-old, Wils Hosken, is the only \none with his hand up. How old are you? the professor asks, though \nshe knows the answer.\u0014\n\u0014\nHosken, two months shy of his birthday, fibs. He says he's 13. Then \nthe professor tells the class that's the end of that conversation, \nand the college kids stop bugging their 12-year-old peer.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a huge relief, Hosken said.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years later, Hosken is still under the age of 18 and is \ngraduating with bachelor's degrees in psychology and English. The \n17-year-old said he is a bit nervous but relieved that he has passed \nall of his classes.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurreal is the first word that comes to Jo D. Hosken when asked to \ndescribe the experience of enrolling her 12-year-old into college and \npreparing to watch him graduate.\u0014\n\u0014\nRandolph-Macon's commencement is at 10 a.m. today at the Frank E. \nBrown Fountain Plaza on Henry Street. More than 300 graduates are \nexpected to participate.\u0014\n\u0014\nJo D. and her husband, Treve Hosken, credit Randolph-Macon for its \nsupport in helping Wils, their first child, navigate college and \navoid publicity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hoskens did not find much guidance on how to parent a \nkindergartner who read from the encyclopedia and had the Harry \nPotter series finished. Or a 4-year-old who did 500-piece puzzles on \nthe kitchen floor or a 3-year-old who taught himself to read. They \nfollowed Wils' lead.\u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't know that wasn't normal, Jo D. Hosken said. You do what's \nbest for your child.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes that meant doing Latin flash cards with Wils. Other times, \nit meant saving up frequent-flier miles in case he needed help when \nhe studied macaques in Japan.\u0014\n\u0014\nWils' road to Randolph-Macon started at St. Christopher's School in \nRichmond and led to Goochland County Public Schools. The Hoskens \npraised the public school system with creating an individualized \nlearning plan for Wils, who in second grade was doing \nmiddle-school-level reading and math daily. He took online classes \nwith Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocially, Wils was a quiet kid who could be found drawing by himself \nas other kids played. In addition to the usual stress of middle and \nhigh school, Wils sometimes struggled to interact with his peers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't actually realize I was different, Wils said. I wasn't a \nvery social kid.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Wils had taken all the math classes he could in Goochland's \nschool system, his family approached Randolph-Macon about enrolling \nhim in a summer math course.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe college had experience with younger students with above-average \nlearning skills. Greg Smith graduated from Randolph-Macon in 2003 at \nthe age of 13.\u0014\n\u0014\nRandolph-Macon had Wils take a test and the results were such that \nthe college said it would admit him as a freshman. The top of Wils' \neyebrows are all that can be seen in the picture on his student ID.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis parents work full-time jobs, so attending classes with Wils was \nnot an option they wanted to pursue. But there was a parenting \nphilosophy at work, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf he's going to do it, he's got to be able to do it on his own, Jo \nD. Hosken said. We didn't dictate what Wils should do.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut how did they know they had made the right call? A few weeks after \nWils started at Randolph-Macon, his lifelong stutter went away.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe's always shown us the way, Treve Hosken said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was the case when Wils decided to switch his math major to \npsychology after a class on the psychobiology of happiness got him \nhooked. Psychology helped Wils think about human behavior. It was a \nway of trying to understand the grief that happens when a loved one \ndies and to understand the stress of that comes with disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, he has to move on to the next step, Jo D. Hosken said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next step is moving to his own apartment in Orlando, Fla., where \nWils hopes to eventually do research in experimental psychology. He's \ntaking some time to grow before heading to graduate school. \nMeanwhile, Wils' younger brother, James, at 13 has just finished high \nschool and will begin studying math, science and computers at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nWils wants to be (physiologist Ivan) Pavlov, but he wants to do it \nusing technology rather than bells, Jo D. Hosken said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked what advice he would give his 12-year-old self, he has two \nthoughts: Ask Mom to get Amazon Prime, and try not to worry.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't stress, dude, said Wils, donning Batman-themed sneakers. \nPeople will try to reach out to others even if it doesn't seem like \nit.\u0014",

    "words": "Archeologists Find 1,600-Year-Old \nEvidence of a Female Church Benefactor\u0014\n\u0014\nLaura Lacey Johnson | Contributor to ChristianHeadlines.com | \nWednesday, November 8, 2017 \u0014\n\u0014\na Womem played a crucial role in the early church, and two \narcheologists recently discovered a mosaic that honors a female \nchurch donor.\u0014\n\u0014\nKinneret College archaeologist Mordechai Aviam and historian Jacob \nAshkenazi uncovered a 5th-century Greek inscription in western \nGalilee memorializing a female named Sausann (or Shoshana) credited \nfor the construction of a village church. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Times of Israel, this Sausann is thought to have \nbeen a woman of some standing, perhaps following in the footsteps of \nher presumed namesake, Susannah, who was among the women named in \nLuke 8:3 who provided for Jesus out of their resources.\u0014\n\u0014\nSausann was named on the mosaic without a spouse or male guardian, \na surprise considering the patriarchal culture of the ancient time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, according to Catherine Kroeger writing for Christianity \nToday, the early church contained an inordinate number of women, \nparticularly upper-class women. \u0014\n\u0014\nKroeger said, in the upper echelons of society, women often \nconverted to Christianity while their male relatives remained pagans, \nlest they lose their senatorial status.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a three-year grant from the Israeli Science Foundation, Avaim \ntold the Times of Israel the archaeologists are taking a \ncross-disciplinary approach to complete a modern study of Christian \nGalilee in Antiquity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAviam and Ashkenazi found seven lengthy 1,600-year-old inscriptions \nin three Byzantine churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor fear of vandals, the exact locations of the inscriptions are not \nyet public.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author:\u0014\nLaura Lacey Johnson is a blogger, speaker, and Bible study leader who \nwrites regularly for ChristianHeadlines.com.\u0014",

    "title": "4 REASONS NOT TO OVERLOOK JOSEPH AT CHRISMAS",
    "words": "4 Reasons Not to Overlook Joseph at Christmas\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Mark Dance    Lifeway Pstors   12/12/17\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph is missing from the large Nativity scene in our living room. \nWhen I asked Janet why one of the Magi was kneeling in Josephs spot, \nshe reminded me that she got that really nice set at a garage sale \nfor $9. \u0014\n\u0014\nSadder still is the fact that we have owned that Nativity for three \nyears! He is so easy to overlook in the Christmas story, yet he is \nlikely the one person in the Nativity I identify with the most.\u0014\n\u0014\nI looked in Matthews gospel for clues as to why God chose Joseph for \nthis sacred assignment. Part of the answer lies in pedigree. Matthew \nand Luke both trace Josephs family back to Davids royal family \ntree. Prophecy required that the Son of God also be the Son of David. \nBut surely he was not the only one qualified for that DNA/prophecy \nmatch. Here are four other reasons I believe God chose Joseph.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod chose Joseph because of his convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn first century Palestine/Israel, there was no legal difference \nbetween being engaged and married. The engagement set the marriage \ncontract in place, not in motion. The wedding was the formalization \nand celebration of it, similar to baptism. To get un-engaged, they \nhad to do more than cancel their wedding, they had to get a divorce. \nJoseph had an out that was both legal and moral. He could have \ndivorced her on the grounds of adultery and moved on with his life. \nBut:\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her \npublicly, decided to divorce her secretly. (Matthew 1:19)\u0014\n\u0014\nA divorce was allowed both according to the civil law and Scriptures, \nwhich is one of the reasons why God calls Joseph righteous. Before \nyou prematurely jump to judgment, consider Josephs point of view. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHis wife was pregnant. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe baby was not his. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe likely concluded that Mary had not only cheated on him, but then \nlied about it by making up some crazy story about being impregnated \nby the Holy Spirit! It seems like God commends him for desiring to \nkeep the divorce under wraps, but chose Joseph for the job because He \nknew he would do the right thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod chose Joseph because of his compassion.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph handled this sensitive situation in a compassionate way by \ndivorcing her privately instead of humiliating her publicly. Being \nrighteous means doing the right thing in the right way. This is the \nkind of father God chose to raise His only Son. It is also the kind \nof father God chose to raise yours. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood fathers and husbands dont intimidate and humiliate those God \ncalled them to love and lead. Joseph knew how to treat people, and \nquite frankly, so should we as pastors. Deuteronomy 22:21 gave Joseph \nthe legal right to have her stoned, though that was rare in the first \ncentury. We dont stone people these days, we sue them or bully them \non social media.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can tell a whole lot about a pastor by how they treat their spouse, \nkids, parents, employees, servers, or flight attendants. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod chose Joseph because of his courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome fear is healthy and normal. Fear of death makes us drive \nslowertheoretically. Fear of punishment prods us tell the truth to \nour spouses, friends, church members, and CPA. \u0014\n\u0014\nFear of being stoned for your fiances indiscretion is a good reason \nto keep from marrying her. His options were not obvious. There was no \neasy way out of this jam because if Joseph could not prove that Mary \nwas unfaithful to him, the divorce idea could backfire. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen the elders of that city will take the man and punish him. They \nwill also fine him a hundred silver shekels and give them to the \nyoung womans father, because that man gave an Israelite virgin a bad \nname. She will remain his wife; he cannot divorce her as long as he \nlives. (Deuteronomy 22:18-19)\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont think I can overstate what a huge step of faith this was for \nJoseph to believe Mary or the angel of God in his dream. I have had \ndreams that seem so real that it took me awhile to get my bearings \nwhen I woke up. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow could he verify whether this baby was a result of Marys \nindiscretion or Gods intervention? Joseph displayed great courage by \ntrusting his heavenly Father instead of his own feelings. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe accepted his leadership role as a husband and father bravely, and \nso should we. If our family has problems, perhaps we should pray over \nthem instead of panicking over them. Trusting God with the imperfect \npeople in our families and ministries takes courageous faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod chose Joseph because of his compliance.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph woke up, he did as the Lords angel had commanded him. He \nmarried her but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave \nbirth to a son. And he named him Jesus. (Matthew 1:24-25) \u0014\n\u0014\nGodly compliance is the result of blending convictions, compassion, \nand courage together. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph took a pregnant Mary almost 100 miles from Nazareth to \nBethlehem, then from Bethlehem to Egypt (760 miles) with their \nnewborn. Eventually he would back-track at least 900 miles from Egypt \nto Nazareth, having taken the long way to avoid trouble in Jerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph was not chosen because he was a smart man, a rich man, or a \nfamous man. Joseph was chosen because he was a yes man. \u0014\n\u0014\nBrothers and sisters, consider your calling: Not many were wise from \na human perspective, not many powerful, not many of noble birth. \nInstead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the \nwise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the \nstrong.

    "title": "13 SIMPLE WAYS THAT HELP RAISE WELL-ADJUSTED CHILDREN",
    "words": "Boundaries, routines and early bedtimes: 13 \nhabits that raise well-adjusted kids\u0014\n\u0014\nI keep seeing posts about entitled kids making the rounds lately. \nIn fact, you dont have to look hard before you see things written \nabout how lazy and narcissistic and downright terrible kids are \nthese days.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a parent of younger kids, you read these articles and feel \nparalyzed by overwhelm and fear and mixed messages. What exactly is \nthe right thing to do? Where am I going wrong? Should I give up and \nstart a savings account for my kids future therapy sessions?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe part that scares me the most is we are so overwhelmed by the \njudgement in modern parenting that it feels safer (and by far easier) \nto do nothing, to turn on the tv and hide in technology Never, Never \nLand.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou should know something.\u0014\n\u0014\nChange starts with one parent and one child at a time. You have a \nbeautiful window of opportunity to build the foundation that your \nchild desperately needs but also craves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foundation for things like generosity, responsibility, \nappreciation, warmth, kindness, helpfulness and hard-work ethic all \nstarts during the early years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeres the hard part.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt starts with us  the parents. Kids cannot even think at the \nmaturity level needed to break a behavior cycle, let alone do \nanything about it. So, as the parents, it has to start with us. The \nfoundation for well-adjusted kids always starts with us.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are 13 simple ways that help raise well-adjusted kids. Lets get \nback to basics.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Boundaries\u0014\n\u0014\nNo brainer, right? ButIts hard to set boundaries for kids and stick \nto them. This is especially true when kids push back, scream \nendlessly or threaten things like, I hate you. Remember that when \nkids act this way, they are meeting their own needs in the only way \nthey know how. Depending on the boundary, it can take a long time \nbefore a child lovingly accepts a parents boundary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen kids start to push back or scream less, this is actually your \nchild moving towards acceptance of the boundary. If your boundary is \nlike a wall (and not a door that confusingly swings open from time to \ntime) your child will bounce and eventually work to meet his or her \nneed in an alternative way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world is a very chaotic place. Boundaries help your child, not \nonly feel grounded, but thrive. Check yourself and think about what \nyour real boundaries are. Then remember, theyre brick walls, not \ndoors.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Routines.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres so much of childhood that is new and challenging for kids. \nLearning self-control and empathy. Learning how to be a friend and \ninteract with others. These are all very BIG things for kids. Using \nsomething as simple as these printable routine cards can help kids \nfeel grounded and relaxed. In fact, knowing what to expect at \nmealtimes, mornings and bedtimes can bring a sense of relief to even \nthe most carefree child.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave a strong-willed child? Even better. Routines allow kids to feel \na sense of control, something that is very important to a \nstrong-willed child.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Early bedtimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nSleep is the building block for healthy brain development. It helps \nus process the days events and learn from it. Kids brains are \nconstantly developing and creating new neural connections. They \nabsolutely must get sleep to nurture these connections.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween kid activities, school and always squeezing in tech time, \nkids are going to bed later and having a difficult time settling \nbefore sleep. One of the most basic things you can do for your kids \nbehavior, health and well-being is to help them get the sleep they \nneed.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Empathy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do kids really need to be happy and successful? The answer \nsurprises most: Empathy. Its the trait that allows us to walk in \nanother persons shoes. New research shows that empathy plays a \nmajor role in predicting kids happiness and success.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough kids are hardwired to care, they arent born empathetic, just \nlike they arent born knowing how to order a latte at Starbucks \n(wink). Its a learned behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpathy promotes kindness, prosocial behaviors, and moral courage, \nand it is an effective antidote to bullying, aggression, prejudice \nand racism. Its why Forbes urges companies to adopt empathy and \nperspective-taking principles, the Harvard Business Review named it \nas one of the essential ingredients for leadership success and \nexcellent performance.  Dr. Michele Borba, psychologist and \nparenting expert.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Hugs\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a saying by Virginia Satir, a respected family therapist, \nWe need four hugs a day for survival. We need eight hugs a day for \nmaintenance. We need twelve hugs a day for growth.\u0014\n\u0014\nHugging triggers the release of oxytocin, also known as the love \nhormone. This feel-good hormone has many important effects on our \nbodies. One of them is growth stimulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudies show that hugging can instantly boost the level of oxytocin. \nWhen oxytocin is increased, several growth hormones, such as \ninsulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) and nerve growth factor (NGF), \nare increased as well. The nurturing touch of a hug can enhance a \nchilds growth.  Pamela Li, creator of Parenting for Brain\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Playful parents\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren dont say, I had a hard day [] Can we talk? They say, \nWill you play with me?  Lawrence .\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont reserve much room in our lives for fun and games anymore. \nOur days are filled with stress, obligations and hard work, and \nwithout realizing it, we are more disconnected from our kids than \never. Play is the work of the child and to connect with our kids, we \nmust play with our kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaking the time to put down our phones and realize that our kids \nneed. us. to. play. It sounds silly, but all the mindless funny cat \nvideos and random Tasty recipes will still be there years later; our \nchildren wont.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Outdoor time\u0014\n\u0014\nMovement through active free play, especially outside, improves \neverything from creativity to academic success to emotional \nstability. Kids who dont get to do this can have so many issues, \nfrom problems with emotional regulationfor example, they cry at the \ndrop of a hatto trouble holding a pencil, to touching other kids \nusing too much force.  Meryl Davids Landau, author of Enlightened \nParenting\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Chores\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though it is more difficult at the time to persist in having \nchildren do chores, kids benefit from the experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearch indicates that those children who do have a set of chores \nhave higher self-esteem, are more responsible, and are better able to \ndeal with frustration and delay gratification, all of which \ncontribute to greater success in school.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, research by Marty Rossman shows that involving children \nin household tasks at an early age can have a positive impact later \nin life. In fact, says Rossman, the best predictor of young adults \nsuccess in their mid-20s was that they participated in household \ntasks when they were three or four. Deb Cohen, Center for Parenting \nEducation\u0014\n\u0014\n9. More screen-time limits\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order for the brains neural networks to develop normally during \nthe critical period, a child needs specific stimuli from the outside \nenvironment. These are rules that have evolved over centuries of \nhuman evolution, butnot surprisinglythese essential stimuli are not \nfound on todays tablet screens. When a young child spends too much \ntime in front of a screen and not enough getting required stimuli \nfrom the real world, her development becomes stunted.  Dr. Liraz \nMargalit, Behind Online Behavior\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Experiences, not things.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren require less things and far more meaningful experiences. \nWhen they grow up, its not the stuff in their life they will \nremember, its that time you tried to catch tadpoles at the lake, or \nthat sand castle you both built that the wave knocked over at the \nbeach [] The best life experiences cost little to nothing, like a \npicnic in the park, blowing bubbles in the backyard, making chalk \ndrawings on the sidewalk, or tossing a football around, but they all \nhave one thing in common: you do them together. What kids really want \nin life is quality time spent with their parents.  Sally White, \nparenting writer\u0014\n\u0014\n11. Slow moving days.\u0014\n\u0014\nI encourage parents to take some time to just watch their children, \nwhether they are playing, doing homework, or eating a snack. Take a \nmoment to drink them in. Remember and remind yourself how remarkable \nyour children are. That pause alone, even if momentary, can drive a \nshift in the pace. John Duffy, clinical psychologist\u0014\n\u0014\n12. Books read to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most important things parents can do, beyond keeping kids \nhealthy and safe, is to read with them. That means starting when they \nare newborns and not even able to talk, and continuing well beyond \nthe years that they can read by themselves. Study after study shows \nthat early reading with children helps them learn to speak, interact, \nbond with parents and read early themselves, and reading with kids \nwho already know how to read helps them feel close to caretakers, \nunderstand the world around them and be empathetic citizens of the \nworld. Amy Joyce, parenting writer\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Music.\u0014\n\u0014\nScience has shown that when children learn to play music, their \nbrains begin to hear and process sounds that they couldnt otherwise \nhear. This helps them develop neurophysiological distinction \nbetween certain sounds that can aid in literacy, which can translate \ninto improved academic results for kids, according to Time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis story was submitted to Love What Matters by Lauren Tamm of \nTheMilitaryWifeandMom.com.\u0014",

    "title": "3 CHILDREN PREDICTED SOMETHING AT FATIMA",
    "words": "3 Children Predicted Something at Fatima\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most extraordinary events of an extraordinary century had \nits inception on this day May 13, 1917. On that day three Portuguese \nshepherd children coming to Cova da Iria, a natural depression near \ntheir hamlet, claimed to have met a lady \"brighter than the sun.\" \nAccording to the three (Lucia dos Santos, Francesco and Jacinta \nMarto) the lady spoke to them and instructed them to return each \nmonth on the thirteenth. She said that she had an important message \nfor all nations and for all men and women. In October, she would, by \nthe power of God, work a great miracle which would substantiate her \nveracity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe children reported this unusual event. It was met with a good deal \nof incredulity and remains controversial. They were interrogated by \nthe local clergy, but stuck to their story. In August they were \nkidnapped and held by a civil prefect for two days during the usual \ntime of the apparition.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterest mounted when it became known the lady would work a miracle \nin October. In June, 50 people appeared on the site in the Parish of \nFatima. By September this number had swelled to 30,000. The children \nalone saw and spoke with the lady. The others saw only movement in \ntree and cloud.\u0014\n\u0014\nOctober 13th was different. A crowd of 50,000 massed on the site. \nSome were skeptics. The day was dreary and wet. Three inches of water \nstood on the ground in the depression of Cova da Iria.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lady appeared to the children and told them that she was Our Lady \nof the Rosary. At midday the sun suddenly appeared in the \ncloud-covered sky. It rotated fantastically, shooting off colored \nrays, its rim a rainbow. It was not too bright to gaze upon. The \ncrowd watched with smiles. It was said that the sun began to roam \namong the clouds, half disappearing behind cloud puffs. From time to \ntime it would stop and spin fantastically as at first.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally it became stationary and pulsated. Without warning it hurtled \ntoward the crowd, growing brighter and hotter. People screamed and \ncried for pardon from their sins. The children called to the crowd to \npray. As quickly as the phenomenon had begun it reversed itself. The \nsun returned to the clouds. It took on its usual bland noonday \nbrilliance. A great wind arose but the trees did not bend. The soggy \nground where the people had stood was now baked mud. Everyone's \nclothes were dry.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman Catholic authorities authenticated the miracle. Believers built \na shrine to the Lady of Fatima, which remains a major pilgrimage \ndestination.\u0014\n\u0014\nave glory to Mary, not to Christ. Why were Lucia's prophecies kept so \nhush hush for so long? (The Vatican recently announced that one of \nthe prophecies appears to refer to the assassination attempt on Pope \nJohn Paul II and the documents can now be viewed online). The miracle \nis unlike the miracles of the New Testament; Christ, for instance, \nrefused to give the Jews and Herod any prearranged signs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGillett, H.

He also \nloves Fortnite and has thousands of followers on Instagram.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside of school, his father said, Laurent Simons is like any child \nof his age.Credit...Alexander Simons\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBy Elian Peltier   Nov. 15, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nLONDON  He doesnt play chess or any musical instruments. But he \nloves Fortnite and Minecraft and watches Netflix.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon, Laurent Simons, 9, of Belgium will become one of the youngest \npeople in the world to graduate from a university. For this, his \nteachers and others have called him a genius.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe simply says, Im quite lazy. Thats because hes not into \nsports. \u0014\n\u0014\nA lot of people have stereotypes about young geniuses, his father, \nAlexander, a dentist, said in a phone interview.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats because the world has long been fascinated by prodigies \ncelebrated for their ability to master an instrument, graduate at a \nyoung age or achieve outstanding sports performances. Mozart composed \nmusic at age 5. Picasso was 9 years old when he made his first \npainting.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in an era when social media carries a certain cachet and \ninfluencers make gobs of money posing with products, Laurent is not \nyour typical child prodigy. Hes into Instagram, for one. And as of \nFriday, he had more than 13,000 followers.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaurent, who was born in Ostende, Belgium, studies electrical \nengineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the \nNetherlands. He entered when he was 8 and is set to complete a \nthree-year program in 10 months.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf all goes well and he completes his final project  about a \nbrain-connected electrical chip  he will walk out a graduate in \nDecember.\u0014\nThen, I want to study medicine, and do a Ph.D. and make artificial \norgans, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaurent grew up in Belgium with his grandparents while his parents \nworked in the Netherlands. He started primary school when he was 4, \nand went to high school at 6, according to his father. He now lives \nwith his parents in Amsterdam.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis grandparents always taught us hes very special, Alexander \nSimons said about his son. We thought they were taking him too \nseriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, he and his wife do, too. And Laurents teachers at the \nuniversity say they were blown away. \u0014\n\u0014\nLaurents absorption capacity is very high, which means that \neverything goes much faster and we can cover a lot more material in a \nshort span of time, said Peter Baltus, a professor of integrated \nelectronics at the university who is the boys mentor. Its been \nquite special and enjoyable.\u0014\n\u0014\nA spokeswoman at the university confirmed that the Laurent was on \ntrack to graduate before the end of the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside of school, Mr. Simons argued, Laurent was like any child of \nhis age: playing video games on his smartphone and sometimes taking a \nswim. On the other hand, he watches TV series like The Blacklist, \nand his I.Q. is 145, his father said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts fair to say that his parents have helped turned their son into a \nmini-celebrity, making him available for scores of interviews and \norganizing news conferences.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the age of instant fame, young bright minds on social media \nplatform do not go unnoticed for too long. On Laurents Instagram \naccount, a photo shows him sitting in front of a television crew. The \ncaption, Busy Week With Interviews!! \u0014\n\u0014\nOther photos show him by a pool next to women wearing bikinis, with \nthe former Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium and flanked by \nhis grandparents. Asked about the adult themes displayed on the \naccount created under his sons name, Mr. Simons said the parents \nmanaged the account.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe posts echo those of other accounts of young celebrities whose \nparents direct their presence  and fame  online. (A video posted \nthis week by the parents of a 9-year-old British drummer playing \nNirvana has been viewed more than seven million times.)\u0014\n\u0014\nFar from electronic chips or scientific labs, Laurents posts also \nshow him bobbing in swimming pools or with friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/ 9yr old Gets University \nDegree\u0014",

Officials said 23 \nrescue workers were killed while others were still buried under the \nsnow.\u0014\n\u0014\nWednesday's avalanche increased the overall death toll from the \ndisaster to 28.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome 300 emergency service workers were called to a highway near the \nmountain-surrounded town of Bahcesaray in Van province, which borders \nIran, after an avalanche struck late Tuesday. That snowslide killed \nfive people. Around noon Wednesday, the team was struck by the second \navalanche.\u0014\n\u0014\nGov. Mehmet Emin Bilmez said 23 rescuers' bodies were recovered from \nthe mass of snow on the steep slope. They included eight military \npolice officers, three government-paid village guards, three \nfirefighters and nine volunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmergency teams were searching for other colleagues who may still be \nburied under the snow, Bilmez said. He did not provide a figure.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome 30 emergency workers were either rescued or escaped from under \nthe snow and were hospitalized Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. \nThere was no further information on their conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nVideo from the scene showed at least three overturned vehicles at the \nbottom of a hill during a snow storm. Some rescuers were climbing a \nsteep incline to get out of the mass of snow while others dug \nfrantically into the snow with shovels and pick-axes. Fog, heavy snow \nand strong winds were hampering the rescue efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first avalanche buried a snow-clearing vehicle and a minibus. The \nvehicle's operator and seven passengers escaped alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said the operator, Bahattin Karagulle, \nwas trapped beneath the snow for 25 minutes before he managed to \nbreak a window and escape. He told the agency he walked toward a \nvillage to get help before being picked up by a vehicle.\u0014",

    "title": "6 CAUSES OF STOCK MARKET CRASHES",
    "words": "6 Things That Could Cause a Stock Market Crash Sharpley\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew Frankel, CFP     (TMFMathGuy)\u0014\nJul 5, 2018 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe stock market has crashed several times throughout history, \nincluding the infamous Crash of 1929, Black Monday in 1987, and the \nfinancial crisis of 2008. While the exact cause of each of these \ncrashes can get a bit complicated, stock market crashes are generally \ncaused by some combination of speculation, leverage, and several \nother key factors.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's a rundown of six different stock market crash catalysts that \ncould contribute to the next plunge in the market.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Speculation\u0014\n\u0014\nMany market crashes can be blamed on rampant speculation. The Crash \nof 1929 was a speculative bubble in stocks in general. The crash in \ntech stocks in the early 2000s followed a period of irrational \nspeculation in dot-com companies. And the crash of 2008 can be \nattributed to investor speculation in real estate (and banks enabling \nthe practice).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point is that when irrational euphoria about a certain asset \nclass or industry exists, it's not uncommon for it to end very badly.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Excessive leverage\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen things are going well, leverage (a.k.a. \"borrowed money\") can \nseem like an excellent tool. For example, if I buy $5,000 worth of \nstock and it rises by 20%, I made $1,000. If I borrow an additional \n$5,000 and bought $10,000 worth of the same stock, I'd make $2,000, \ndoubling my profits.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, when things move against you, leverage can be \ndownright dangerous. Let's say that my same $5,000 stock investment \ndropped by 50%. It would sting, but I'd still have $2,500. If I had \nborrowed an additional $5,000, a 50% drop would wipe me out \ncompletely.\u0014\nExcessive leverage can create a downward spiral in stocks when things \nturn sour. As prices drop, firms and investors with lots of leverage \nare forced to sell, which in turn drives prices down even further. \nThe most notable occasion was the Crash of 1929, in which excessive \npurchasing of stocks on margin played a major role.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Interest rates and inflation\u0014\n\u0014\nGenerally speaking, rising interest rates are a negative catalyst for \nstocks and the economy in general.\u0014\nThis is especially true for income-focused stocks, such as real \nestate investment trusts (REITs). Investors buy these stocks \nspecifically for their dividend yields, and rising market interest \nrates put downward pressure on these stocks. As a simplified \nillustration, if a 10-year Treasury note yields 3% and a certain REIT \nyields 5%, it may seem worth the extra risk to income-seeking \ninvestors to choose the REIT.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, if the 10-year Treasury's yield spikes to 4%, the \nREIT's dividend will (roughly) need to rise proportionally to attract \ninvestors. And lower stock prices translate to higher dividend \nyields, on a percentage basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom an economic standpoint, higher interest rates mean higher \nborrowing costs, which tends to slow down purchasing activity, which \ncan in turn cause stocks to dive. So, if the 30-year mortgage rate \nwere to spike to, say, 6%, it could dramatically slow down the \nhousing market and cause homebuilder stocks to take a hit.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Political risks\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future, it's a \nsafe bet that the stock market wouldn't like it much if the U.S. went \nto war with, say, North Korea.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarkets like stability, and wars and political risk represent the \nexact opposite. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \ndropped by more than 7% during the first trading session following \nthe Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, as the uncertainty surrounding \nthe attacks and the next moves spooked investors.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Tax changes\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should certainly have the effect of \nhigher corporate earnings, and is likely to be a generally positive \ncatalyst for the market.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, tax increases can have the opposite effect. One \npotential way to fix the Social Security funding problem would be to \nraise payroll taxes on employees and employers. There are several \nways this could happen, but this would mean lower paychecks for \nworkers and higher expenses for employers, and could certainly be a \nnegative catalyst.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same could be said if short-term capital gains taxes or dividends \nlose their favorable treatment, if the corporate income tax is raised \nin the future, or if any other significant tax hikes occur. This \nisn't likely to happen while the Republican Party is in power, but \nit's certainly possible in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Panic\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's important to point out that crashes aren't generally caused by \none or more of these factors all by themselves. It's typically a \ncombination of a negative catalyst and investor panic that causes a \nsharp dive in the stock market.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, the steepest market drop during the financial crisis \noccurred during September and October 2008. Yes, it was real estate \nspeculation and excessive leverage that led to the trouble, but fears \nthat the U.S. banking system could potentially collapse sent \ninvestors into a panic, which led to the actual crash.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome combination of these factors\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be clear, this isn't an exhaustive list of things that could \npotentially cause a stock market crash. And it's likely that more \nthan one of these factors could combine to cause a crash. The 2008 \ncrash, for one, was primarily caused by excessive speculation that \ncaused a bubble in real estate prices, along with excessive leverage \ntaken on by both consumers and financial institutions, as well as \ninvestor panic after banks started to fail.\u0014",

    "title": "2ND COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE",
    "words": "2nd Council of Constantinople\u0014\n \u0014\nControversy over the God-man nature of Christ disturbed both church \nand empire throughout the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. \nTheological quarrels became party politics and several church-wide or \n\"general\" councils met to resolve the issues. The first of these \ncouncils, the famous Nicea Council, denounced Arianism, a teaching \nthat Christ was a created being. The three councils that followed \ntook up other aspects of the relationship between Christ's divinity \nand humanity. But heresies continued to spring up like weeds, as they \nstill do today. On this day, May 5, 553, Emperor Justinian convoked a \nfifth general council, the second to be held at Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Justinian was a vigorous ruler. Unfortunately, he thought the \nonly way his empire could enjoy unity was to compel religious \nuniformity. Consequently, he closed heathen schools and baptized \npagans by force. He all but wiped out the Montanists in fierce \npersecution. (The Montanists believed in ecstatic spiritual \nexperiences and end-of-the-world prophecies.) Justinian also built \nchurch sanctuaries, including the breathtaking Hagia Sophia (Holy \nWisdom).\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpress Theodora favored the monophysite views taught by Eutyches the \nArchmandrite (an archmandrite was the head of a monastery or several \nmonasteries). Monophysites deny that Christ had both a divine nature \nand human nature. Eutyches' form of monophysitism held that Christ's \ntwo natures, the Divine and the human, united so completely that they \nbecame physically one, with the Divine absorbing the human. Its \ntheological rival was Nestorianism, which was said to overemphasize \nthe distinctions between Christ's two natures. Under Theodora's \ninfluence, Justinian called the council to condemn writings that \nsupported Nestorianism--the Three Chapters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Three Chapters had already been dealt with in the important \nCouncil of Chalcedon. The writings were rebuked but the writers were \nnot condemned. Apparently, the monophysites hoped by re-opening the \nissue to win condemnation of the three writers. In so doing, they \nwould discredit the Council of Chalcedon by making its judgments \nappear incomplete or inadequate, creating an opening for further \nMonophysite advances.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council opened on this day, May 5, 553. In eight sessions, it \nupheld Chalcedon on the two natures of Christ, but condemned \"those \nwho say that there are two Sons and two Christs. For one is he who is \npreached by us and you, as we have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, \nonly begotten as man, according to the saying of the most learned \nPaul.\" They condemned the writings but spared the reputation of two \nof the three writers of the Three Chapters. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Vigilius swayed back and forth on the issues. Although he \nrefused to attend the council, he was at a disadvantage, because \nJustinian would not let him return to Rome unless he subscribed to \nthe council's findings. Vigilius capitulated, putting himself at odds \nwith his own previous writings and possibly even with the council of \nChalcedon. A western synod excommunicated him and he had to change \nhis position again before the western church would accept him back.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nJedin, Hubert.

    "words": "From the book \"Vanguard\" (Olivia B. Waxman) (2020) \"You discuss a \nmyth about Sojourner Truths Aint I A Woman speech. What does that \nmyth say about how we frame, and how we mischaracterize, Sojourner \nTruth?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the aspirations of this book is to take Black women out of \nmyths, out of snapshots and snippets, and into the fullness of their \nown lives and their ideas as well as their activism. We learn a great \ndeal from historian Nell Painter, whose biography of Sojourner Truth \nin the 1990s aims right at the myth, to show us the woman, to show us \nthe life. One of the things she does is have us look side by side at \ntwo versions of the so-called mislabeled Aint I A Woman speech, to \nappreciate that there was a contemporaneous, written recording of the \nspeech she gave in Akron, Ohio, in 1851, that does not include the \nphrase Aint I A Woman at all. Its many years later that another \nwriter takes a kind of license with the speech and invents this \nrefrain.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth, over the course of her lifetime and subsequent to her \nlifetime, has been the object of myth-making. [This is] true for \nother women in Vanguard as well; they are held out at moments when \nthey are convenient or they seem to serve another argument or \npurpose. But too often we dont get the full sense of their lives and \nhow they are connected to their own histories and the histories of \nother Black women. Truth was a formidable speaker, but she wasnt a \nwoman of the South, not a woman of the country. Professor Painter \npoints out she likely spoke with a Dutch accent rather than a \nSouthern accent. So Aint I A Woman recasts Sojourner Truth as a \nwoman of the South, a woman of country origins, and while there are \nelements of that recreation that are in the spirit of Sojourner \nTruth, we know the writer takes those libertiesdespite having been \npresent for the original speech.\u0014",

The year \nwas 680. The cause of his distress was a dangerous heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgatho's concern led him to practical steps. He called a synod at \nRome to condemn the teachings of the heretics. He then dispatched a \nlengthy letter to Constantinople, which was then the seat of the \nRoman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe upshot was that a council of the church was called to deal with \nthe latest attack on Christ. The sixth general council of the church \nconvened on this day, November 7, 680 in Constantinople. The \npatriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch were present as was Emperor \nConstantine Pogonatus. Rome, Alexandria and Jerusalem sent \nrepresentatives. The council dealt with one issue only, the heretical \nteaching called monothelitism.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonothelitism effectively denied Christ's humanity, claiming that he \nhad only one will--the divine. It arose as an attempt to unify the \northodox and monophysite factions of the church in face of rising \ndanger from Persia and Islam in the east. Several notable church \nleaders had signed onto this error, including an earlier pope, \nHonorius, and the previous emperor, Constans II.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn eighteen sessions that took the better part of a year, the council \ngrappled with the issue. In the end, the assembled bishops left no \ndoubt where they stood regarding the writings of the heretics and the \nheretics themselves: \"...we find that these documents are quite \nforeign to the apostolic dogmas, to the declarations of the holy \nCouncils, and to all the accepted Fathers, and that they follow the \nfalse teachings of the heretics; therefore we entirely reject them, \nand execrate them as hurtful to the soul. But the names of those men \nwhose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust forth from the holy \nChurch of God...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council further declared \"...our Lord Jesus Christ must be \nconfessed to be very God and very man, one of the holy and \nconsubstantial and life-giving Trinity, perfect in Deity and perfect \nin humanity, very God and very man, of a reasonable soul and human \nbody subsisting; consubstantial with the Father as touching his \nGodhead and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood...the \npeculiarities of neither nature being lost by the union but rather \nthe proprieties of each nature being preserved, concurring in one \nPerson and in one subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons \nbut one and the same only-begotten Son of God, the Word, our Lord \nJesus Christ...we likewise declare that in him are two natural \nwills...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

This is \nequivalent to 15 percent of all children who were born or lived in \nthe 18 institutions investigated over nearly 80 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nearly 3,000-page report describes the emotional and even \nphysical abuse some of the 56,000 unmarried mothers  from farmhands \nto domestic servants  were subjected to in the so-called \nmother-and-baby homes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It appears that there was little kindness shown to them and this was \nparticularly the case when they were giving birth,\" the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe homes, many run by nuns and members of the Roman Catholic Church, \noperated in Ireland for most of the 20th century, with the last home \nclosing as recently as 1998. They received state funding and also \nacted as adoption agencies  with many of the children adopted to \nfamilies in the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nImage: Infant and baby shoes are hung along the playground fence as a \nvigil is held at the Tuam Mother and Baby home mass burial site\u0014\n\u0014\nInfant and baby shoes are hung along the playground fence as a vigil \nis held at the Tuam Mother and Baby home mass burial site on Aug. 25, \n2019 in Tuam, Ireland.Charles McQuillan / Getty Images file\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report found the responsibility for the harsh treatment of women \nwho gave birth outside of marriage rested mainly with their own \nimmediate families. However, it added that treatment was supported \nand contributed to by the \"institutions of the state and the \nchurches.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to anonymous accounts in the report, women giving birth \nwere sometimes \"verbally insulted, degraded and even slapped.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We did this to ourselves, we treated women exceptionally badly,\" \nIreland's Taoiseach, or prime minister, Michel Martin, told \nreporters Tuesday after the report was published. \"One hard truth in \nall of this, is that all of society was complicit in it,\" he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report also noted the \"appalling\" rate of infant mortality in the \nhomes, calling it \"probably the most disquieting feature of these \ninstitutions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the years before 1960, it said, mother-and-baby homes did not save \nthe lives of \"illegitimate\" children  instead, they significantly \nreduced prospects of their survival.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt did not include one single explanation for the high rates of \nmortality.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, Martin said the report revealed \"significant failures of the \nstate and of society,\" and hoped the publication would be a catalyst \nfor social change.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne religious order, the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and \nMary, which ran three of the homes investigated in the report, said \nin a statement to NBC News on Tuesday that it welcomed the \npublication.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For our part, we want to sincerely apologize to those who did not \nget the care and support they needed and deserved,\" the statement \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdding, \"It is a matter of great sorrow to us that babies died while \nunder our care.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Commission of Investigation Into Mother and Baby Homes, which \ncarried out the five-year inquiry, also looked at allegations that \nsome children in the homes were used in vaccine trials with no \nparental consent for their participation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report identified seven such vaccine trials, which involved \"a \nnumber of children,\" that took place from 1934 to 1973 in the homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nA former resident of one of the homes spoke with NBC News and said \nshe was used as a \"guinea pig\" for vaccines at a home in Cork, before \nbeing adopted by a family in Philadelphia in 1961.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a 'guinea pig' in an Irish institution. Now she's hoping for \njustice.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report said consent was not obtained from either the children's \nmothers or their guardians and the necessary licenses were not in \nplace during the trials.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother-and-baby homes took in women, some as young as 12, who had \nbecome pregnant outside marriage  taboo in the conservative country \n and were viewed as an attempt to preserve the country's devout \nCatholic image. Now, the homes are a byword for a dark chapter in the \nnation's history, say Irish politicians and survivors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn amateur local historian, Catherine Corless, first shed light on \nthe issue of maltreatment at the homes.\u0014\nShe discovered an unmarked mass graveyard at Tuam, in the western \ncounty of Galway, which prompted an investigation that uncovered the \nremains of at least 700 children buried from 1925 to 1961, a report \nfound in 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\nAhead of publication, details of Tuesday's report were leaked to the \nmedia, prompting outrage from the victims  including mother-and-baby \nhome survivor Philomena Lee, whose story was portrayed in a 2013 \nmovie, starring Dame Judi Dench.\u0014\n\u0014\nIreland has traditionally been a Catholic stronghold, but decades of \nabuse scandals have damaged the church's reputation and weakened its \ninfluence.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Francis begged forgiveness for the mother-and-baby homes scandal \nduring his first papal visit to the country in almost four decades in \n2018.\u0014\n\u0014\nNBC News has not yet received a response to a request for comment \nfrom the Vatican.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough compensation for the survivors was not explicitly outlined \nin the report, the Irish government said it would provide financial \nrecognition to specific groups, yet to be determined.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also said it would work with survivors and representative groups \nto oversee a national memorial, changes to Ireland's education \ncurriculum and provide counseling support.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeader Martin is due to issue a formal apology to the victims on \nbehalf of the state on Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nReuters contributed to this report.\u0014",

    "words": "4 Chaplains Set a High Standard of Heroism\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain Hans J. Danielsen of the Dorchester was uneasy. The coast \nguard had warned him that a U-boat was prowling the shipping lane off \nthe coast of Newfoundland. As icy night fell, he ordered the troops \nhe was ferrying to turn in with their life vests on in case the ship \nwas torpedoed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the 902 men aboard the ship ignored the order. The hold was \nhot and the life jackets were too bulky to sleep in. Their \ndisobedience cost many of them their lives. Four who obeyed the \ncaptain's command were the ship's chaplains.\u0014\n\u0014\nLt. George L. Fox, a Methodist; Lt. Alexander D. Goode, a Jew; Lt. \nJohn P. Washington, a Roman Catholic; and Lt. Clark V. Poling, Dutch \nReformed, had befriended the homesick and seasick men of the \ntroopship. Now they were to be put to a severe test.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 12:55 a.m. on this day, February 3, 1943, the German U-boat \nlaunched a torpedo at the Dorchester. The bomb hit with deadly \naccuracy well below the water line. Many men were killed outright by \nthe explosion. Others were flung wounded and screaming to the floor. \nAmmonia gas swirled through the hold, strangling others. In the \ndarkness and cold, men struggled to find their way out. Above the \ndin, the chaplains could be heard calming the men, comforting them, \nurging them to be brave and directing them where to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was evident the ship could not stay afloat. The captain gave the \norder to abandon ship. Men scrambled for life boats, overloading \nthem. On deck, the chaplains preached courage. They opened a locker \nwith life vests and handed them to the men who needed them. Quickly \nthe supply was exhausted. Each of the four chaplains then peeled off \nhis own jacket and handed it to a man. \"It was the finest thing I \nhave seen or hope to see this side of heaven,\" said John Ladd, one of \nthe 230 men who survived the attack.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-seven minutes after the Dorchester was struck, it sank. \nSurvivors said the last thing they saw was the four chaplains linked \narm in arm on the deck, praying. Moved by their heroism, Congress \nafterward marked February 3rd as \"Four Chaplains Day\" and issued a \nSpecial Medal of Heroism to the four, which their families received \nposthumously.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist taught us \"greater love has no man than to lay down his life \nfor his friends.\" We believe the four chaplains who laid down their \nlives received greater honor from Christ than any Congress could \noffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nColson, Chuck. \"No Greater Glory.\" Breakpoint. \n(www.pfm.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=BreakPoint1 \n&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=14387\u0014\nKurzman, Dan.

    "title": "2ND COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE",
    "words": "2nd Council of Constantinople   MAY 5, 553\u0014\nDan Graves, \u0014\n\u0014\nControversy over the nature of Christ disturbed both church and \nempire throughout the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. Theological \nquarrels became party politics and several church-wide or \"general\" \ncouncils met to resolve the issues. The first of these councils, the \nfamous Nicea Council, denounced Arianism, a teaching that Christ was \na created being. The three councils that followed took up other \naspects of the relationship between Christ's divinity and humanity. \nBut heresies continued to spring up like weeds, as they still do \ntoday. On this day, May 5, 553, Emperor Justinian convoked a fifth \ngeneral council, the second to be held at Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Justinian was a vigorous ruler. Unfortunately, he thought the \nonly way his empire could enjoy unity was to compel religious \nuniformity. Consequently, he closed heathen schools and baptized \npagans by force. He all but wiped out the Montanists in fierce \npersecution. (The Montanists believed in ecstatic spiritual \nexperiences and end-of-the-world prophecies.) Justinian also built \nchurch sanctuaries, including the breathtaking Hagia Sophia (Holy \nWisdom).\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpress Theodora favored the monophysite views taught by Eutyches the \nArchmandrite (an archmandrite was the head of a monastery or several \nmonasteries). Monophysites deny that Christ had both a divine nature \nand human nature. Eutyches' form of monophysitism held that Christ's \ntwo natures, the Divine and the human, united so completely that they \nbecame physically one, with the Divine absorbing the human. Its \ntheological rival was Nestorianism, which was said to overemphasize \nthe distinctions between Christ's two natures. Under Theodora's \ninfluence, Justinian called the council to condemn writings that \nsupported Nestorianism--the Three Chapters.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Three Chapters had already been dealt with in the important \nCouncil of Chalcedon. The writings were rebuked but the writers were \nnot condemned. Apparently, the monophysites hoped by re-opening the \nissue to win condemnation of the three writers. In so doing, they \nwould discredit the Council of Chalcedon by making its judgments \nappear incomplete or inadequate, creating an opening for further \nMonophysite advances.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council opened on this day, May 5, 553. In eight sessions, it \nupheld Chalcedon on the two natures of Christ, but condemned \"those \nwho say that there are two Sons and two Christs. For one is he who is \npreached by us and you, as we have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, \nonly begotten as man, according to the saying of the most learned \nPaul.\" They condemned the writings but spared the reputation of two \nof the three writers of the Three Chapters.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Vigilius swayed back and forth on the issues.

    "words": "Dr. Michael Heiser., LOGOS LIBRARY\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel Gabriel is one of the prominent characters in the Nativity \nnarrative. Hes remembered as the angel who told Mary she would give \nbirth to the Son of God. But what else can we know about him from the \nBible?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this video, one of our Logos Pros reveals facts about the angel \nGabriel discovered using Logos Bible Software.\u0014\nWhat does the Bible say about the angel Gabriel?\u0014\n\u0014\nA quick check in Logos Factbook tool makes it easy to discover more \nabout the angel Gabriel: I just have to look through the related \nverses and browse the Bible dictionaries the tool fetches for me.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Gabriel is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments.\u0014\nHes known for bearing good news of Jesus coming birth, but his \nfirst biblical appearance is in Daniel 8:16, when he is told to \nexplain a vision to the prophet.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Gabriel stands in the presence of God.\u0014\nThis is how he describes himself to Zacharias, the father of John the \nBaptist (Luke 1:19). The Greek word for stands is paristno, which \nmeans to wait before a superior. The Septuagint uses this word to \ndescribe how Joshua served Moses and how David assisted King Saul.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Gabriel is one of only two angels explicitly named in the \nProtestant Bible.\u0014\nThe other is Michael, a warrior archangel.\u0014\n \u0014\n4. The Bible doesnt call Gabriel the archangel.\u0014\nThe Book of Tobit (of Catholic and Orthodox canon) identifies the \nangels who stand in the presence of God as archangels, and so Gabriel \nhas been called an archangel by tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Gabriel looks like a man (but see #6).\u0014\nThe name Gabriel means man of God or strength of God. The second \ntime Daniel encounters Gabriel (Daniel 9:21), he describes Gabriel as \na man [. . .] seen in the vision previously. We dont get any more \ndetails on Gabriels looks. Perhaps thats because his messages are \nalways so important.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Gabriel scares people.\u0014\nWhen Daniel meets Gabriel, he is frightened and falls on his face. \nWhen Gabriel greets Zacharias, his first words are, Do not be \nafraid. Marys greeting is more celebratory, but Gabriel still \nfollows up by telling her not to fear.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Gabriel anticipates Jesus.\u0014\nGabriel relays a prophecy concerning Messiah the Prince to Daniel. \nHe tells Zacharias that John the Baptist will be a forerunner before \nthe Lord. And most famously, he tells Mary that her son will be \ncalled the Son of the Most High.\u0014\n\u0014\n***\u0014\nThe Bible has a lot more to say about angels than most people \nsuspect. \u0014\n\u0014\n Dr. Michael Heiser.\u0014",

Meanwhile, the number of those who \nclaim to be self-proclaimed believers has jumped by nearly 25 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe study also said there was a drop in basic biblical worldview \nand in belief in the accuracy of the Bible, salvation and Jesus being \nsinless, The Christian Post reports. That number in 2020 was 16 \npercent, compared to 47 percent in 2010.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, the percentage of Born Again Christians with a biblical \nworldview (of either type) has been cut in half over the last \ndecade, says the study, which compared the 1829 age group from 2010 \nwith the same age group 10 years later, now 3039. This result is a \nstartling degradation in worldview beliefs of Born Again Christians \nover just 10 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nKerby Anderson, president of Probe Ministries, said the survey \nresults mean even born-again Christians can have a false view of \nJesus Christ and embrace a pluralistic worldview. Pastors and church \nleaders just cant assume any longer that the members of their church \nor Christian organization have a biblical worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnderson said he worried that cultural trends are responsible for the \nchanging beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese disturbing trends are, yes, due to pastors not consistently \nteaching biblical theory. But they can also be attributed to young \nChristians who are not paying attention, who are focused  nearly \nexclusively, it seems  on their phones, social media and other \ncontent they deem more compelling, he said.\u0014",

    "words": "\"Good King\" Wenceslas Had a Greedy Brother\u0014\n\u0014\nThe choir sang with gusto because the carol had a cheerful tune and \nwas well loved.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Good King Wenceslas looked out\u0014\nOn the feast of Stephen,\u0014\nWhen the snow lay round about,\u0014\nDeep and crisp and even.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFew had heard the true story behind the song, however. Few knew that \nthere really was a 10th century Wenceslas, a Christian who ruled for \nabout seven years in Bohemia (which is now part of the Czech \nRepublic). Wenceslas was brought up by his Christian grandmother, \nLudmila. She taught him that faith has to be put into action or it is \na sham. Because of her teaching and example, Wenceslas learned true \nconcern for the poor and suffering. That is the spirit John Mason \nNeale captured when he wrote his carol. The prince goes out on a cold \nnight to feed a poor man who is gathering winter fuel. When a page \ncomplains of the cold and difficulty, Wenceslas urges him to follow \nin his tracks--a mirror of the way we follow in Christ's footsteps.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mark my footsteps, my good page,\u0014\nTread thou in them boldly:\u0014\nThou shalt find the winter's rage\u0014\nFreeze thy blood less coldly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas was just thirteen when his father died in 921. Ludmila \nacted as regent for the young man, but Wenceslas' mother, Drahomira, \nwanted the throne herself. She killed Ludmila and controlled the \ncountry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas did not wait to come of age, but seized the throne from his \nwicked mother. He banished her to a neighboring country. During his \nshort reign, Wenceslas encouraged German missionaries to preach in \nBohemia. He urged his people to convert to Christianity, even (we \nregret to say) punishing those who held out. At the same time, he \nreformed his country's judicial system and courted peace with \nneighboring nations, especially Germany. He was known for his charity \nto the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas had a younger brother, Boleslaw, who was made in the same \nmold as Drahomira. Some Bohemian nobles resented the fact that \nWenceslas submitted to neighboring Germany. They urged Boleslaw to \ntake action. Boleslaw plotted. When Wenceslas came to mass on this \nday, September 28, 929, his brother followed him to the church door. \nRecognizing that trouble was afoot, Wenceslaus said, \"Brother, you \nwere a good subject to me yesterday.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And now I intend to be a better one!\" shouted Boleslaw and struck \nhis brother in the head with his sword.\u0014\n\u0014\nWenceslas had strength enough to fling his brother to the ground, \nwhereupon one of Boleslaw's men stabbed Wenceslaus in the hand. \nWenceslaus sought refuge in the church but two other assassins struck \nhim down at the door. Bohemians look at Wenceslas as a martyr and \ntheir foremost saint. His picture long appeared on their coins and \nhis crown was a symbol of Czech independence. Although Pope Benedict \nXIV did not want the Bohemian ruler included in the Roman Missal, he \nwas. And an English hymn writer made an immortal carol about him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Good King Wenceslas.\" Deep Cove Crier. \nhttp://www3.telus.net/st_simons/cr9212.htm\u0014\nMershman, Francis. \"St. Wenceslaus.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

    "title": "2 REAONS WHY \"JEHOVAH\" SHOULD NOT BE IN ENGLISH BIBLES",
    "words": "2 Reasons Why Jehovah Should Not Appear in English Bibles \u0014\n03 Nov 2021 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this Word Nerd: Language and the Bible video on the word Jehovah \nin the Bible (full transcription below), Mark Ward (author of \nAuthorized: The Use and Misuse of the King James Bible) explores why \nGods name is not Jehovahand two excellent reasons why it should not \nappear in any English Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the more surprising truths of the Christian religion is that \nwe dont know for sure how to pronounce the name of our own God. Good \nevidence suggests it should be Yahweh, but good evidence is all God \nhas chosen to leave usnot certainty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one thing we do know, though: Gods name is not Jehovah. \nThat word is a colossal, unrepealable, European mistake.\u0014\nPeople can get really uptight about the way the name of God gets \ntranslated in English Bibles. The Jehovahs Witnesses, a \nnon-trinitarian religious group, have made it one of their leading \ndistinctives to insist that the best way to translate the Hebrew \nword  (YHWH) is with the English word Jehovah. Their custom-made \nBible, the New World Translation, uses it over 7,000 times. Even the \nvenerable King James Version uses it seven times.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there are at least two excellent reasons why Jehovah should not \nappear in any English Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Jehovah was created by a misunderstanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, Jehovah is the weirdest kind of portmanteau: its 1) the \nvowels of one Hebrew word (Adonai) inserted into 2) the consonants of \nanother (Yahweh), with the result then 3) transliterated into various \nEuropean languages. This is the colossal error I mentioned. Were not \nquite sure who did itthough a sixteenth-century friar named \nGalatinus is often blamedbut were pretty sure we know why. The \nJewish custom of avoiding saying the divine name meant that the four \nconsonants of Yahweh (Y-H-W-H) came to be spelled with the vowels of \nAdonai as a reminder to say the latter instead of the former. \nApparently someone (Galatinus?) didnt realize what was going on and \nthought the traditional pastiche was itself a word: Jehovah. This \ncustom spread and the word still exists today. But it all stems from \na misunderstanding.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. The New Testament translated Yahweh rather than transliterating it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament itself is the second reason we shouldnt use \nJehovah in Bible translations. The apostles could have transliterated \nYahweh into Greek, matching it letter for letter. Thats what we \nusually do with proper names when we put them in a new language \n(which is why John has a silent H in it to this day). But instead \nthey followed the example of the Septuagintthe pre-Christian Greek \ntranslation of the Hebrew Old Testament. They translated Yahweh using \nthe Greek word for Lord, Kurios.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis became the overwhelming practice of later Bible translations. \nInstead of transliterating, the Latin Vulgate in the fourth century \ntranslated Yahwehas Dominus, Lord. The Tyndale tradition and \nmultiple other Reformation-era Protestant Bibles followed suit 1,200 \nyears later. Luther used the German equivalent of Lord (Herr); \nother standard Bibles did the same, including Dutch (Heere), Spanish \n(Seor), Italian (Signore), and French (Seigneure).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jehovahs Witnesses official explanation for why they use \nJehovah is actually very careful and linguistically sophisticated. \nBut they still, ultimately, have to argue that there must be lost \noriginal manuscripts of the New Testament that used a form of Jehovah \ninstead of Lord (see Appendix 5 in the New World Translation). Thats \nan argument from deafening silence: we have precisely zero New \nTestament manuscripts that do this. And I prefer to stick with the \nBible I have rather than conjecturing a different one.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow: Ive just argued that Jehovah shouldnt appear in Bible \ntranslations. But I still happily sing hymns that include it (Guide \nMe, O Thou Great Jehovah)because one of the excellent points the \nJehovahs Witnesses make, actually, is that pronunciations of names \noften get mangled in their journey from one language to another. \nJesus sounds very little like the Hebrew name Mary would have \ncalled out when it was time for dinner (probably Yeshua). Even if its \norigins lie in a blunder, Jehovah has become a word in many \nlanguages, a word thats here to stay. I dont mind if people say it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I generally recommend that Bible translations avoid colossal, \nunrepealable, European mistakes.\u0014",

The pickup was heading northbound on US 59 and was driven by a \n79-year-old man. The 79-year-old mand survived and is in stable \ncondition.\u0014\n\u0014\nHunter and Lexi were reportedly pronounced dead on the scene. Their \nyoung son, Jett, survived, suffering only minor injuries, including a \nbruise on his leg.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview with KLTV, Eastside Baptist Church lead pastor \nRaymond Walker shared that Hunter had been serving as an associate \npastor and youth minister at the church for about a year and a half. \nHunter, who came from a long line of ministers, had decided to pursue \nministry after high school and was enrolled at Louisiana Missionary \nBaptist Institute & Seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalker told KLTV that he was not initially worried when the couple \ndid not show up for Sunday school, believing he may have forgotten \nthat they had taken the day off. But soon, he would learn of their \npassing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The older I get, the less I remember, so I wasn't sure if Hunter had \nmaybe told me they were going to be with his parents or something \nelse that day. And I thought, 'well, you know, I'll just go ahead and \nstay in the class,'\" Walker said. \"He taught the young people, so I \nwent in there and stayed with them for a while and taught a lesson. \nAnd so, after church, I was going to call and check on them. But we \nreceived the call first. It came right as we had dismissed the \nmorning service and found out they were involved in that accident.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReflecting on their lives, Walker noted that Hunter and Lexi were \ninfectiously optimistic people. He said, \"I've been in the ministry \nfor 31 years, and when I started out, you have a lot of zeal \nsometimes, and you cannot allow people and things to kind of hinder \nyour excitement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe continued, \"So whenever Hunter and Lexi came, they brought a lot \nof zeal. And it's helped me a lot to try to be more positive. \n[Hunter] said his parents are always positive, and I said, 'Well, I \nneed some of that.' And so, a lot of that has helped me through this \ntime. Because it's easy to get bitter in this world, but they've been \na blessing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Hunter's brother's Facebook page, a service for Hunter \nand Lexi will be livestreamed on YouTube at 10:30 am CST on Christmas \nEve. Due to an onslaught of requests, the family has also set up a \nplace for people to donate to a custodial fund for the late couple's \nson.\u0014",

    "words": "40 Men Died on Ice for Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Agricola of Armenia was confronted with \"mutiny.\" Forty \nRoman soldiers refused to offer the sacrifice ordered by Roman \nemperor Licinius. The forty who stood before him that wintry \nfourth-century day in Sevaste were fine specimens of manhood who \nradiated an aura of courage. He was determined to make them see \nreason.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the soldiers were adamant. They refused to sacrifice. To do so \nwas to betray their faith in Christ. \"But what about your comrades?\" \nasked Agricola. \"Consider--you alone of all Caesar's thousands of \ntroops defy him! Think of the disgrace you bring upon your legion!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To disgrace the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is more terrible \nstill,\" replied the men. Exasperated, the governor threatened to flog \nand torture them. The soldiers stood firm, although they knew he \nwould carry out his threat. In the fourth century, there were few \ncivil rights. Boldly the men answered, \"Nothing you can offer us \nwould replace what we would lose in the next world. As for your \nthreats-- we despise our bodies when the welfare of our souls is at \nstake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPairs of guards seized each man and dragged them out into the cold \nwhere they were stripped and tied to posts. Whips laid open their \nbacks and iron hooks tore their sides. Still the forty refused to \nsurrender. Agricola chained them in his dungeons. Finally, he \ncommanded that they be stripped naked and driven onto the ice of a \npond below Sevaste.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"rebels\" did not wait for the sentence to be imposed, but tearing \noff their own clothes, ran to the pond in the raw March air. \"We are \nsoldiers of the Lord and fear no hardship,\" they said. \"What is death \nfor us but an entrance into eternal life?\" On this day, March 9, 320, \nsinging hymns, they stood shivering on the pond as the sun sank.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaffled, Agricola ordered hot baths placed around the pond. Surely \nthe warm water would lure the men off the ice!

Ebel. There, the Israelites learn they will be \ncursed if they disobey God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tablet  which mentions God's name twice  was discovered at the \nsite of Mt. Ebel. More significantly, though, the lead tablet's text \nis \"centuries older than any known Hebrew inscription from ancient \nIsrael,\" Stripling's organization says.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lab in Prague scanned the tablet. The text reads, \"Cursed, cursed, \ncursed  cursed by the God YHW. You will die cursed. Cursed you will \nsurely die. Cursed by YHW  cursed, cursed, cursed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStripling said at a press conference of the discovery, \"On a scale of \none to 10, this is a 10. It doesn't get any bigger than this.  If \nthe [biblical] text were true, this is what you would anticipate \nfinding. And indeed, it is what we found.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStripling said the tablet dates to the late Bronze period, which ran \nfrom 3300 B.C. to 1200 B.C. That means it would be roughly 3,000 \nyears old.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecular critics of a traditional dating of the Old Testament often \nhave placed the time of the Exodus from Egypt and the conquest of \nCanaan at a much later date  and thus calling into question the \ntruthfulness of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese critics argue that the Pentateuch could not have been written \nby Moses  as claimed by the Bible  because the Hebrew alphabet did \nnot exist when he was alive. The tablet's text, though, would seem to \nsupport a Moses authorship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe discovery, Stripling said, affirms the biblical text.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One can no longer argue with a straight face that the biblical text \nwas not written\" until the Persian period (559 B.C.. to 331 B.C.) or \nthe Hellenistic period (323 B.C to 30 B.C. \"as many higher critics \nhave done when here we do clearly have the ability to write the \nentire text at a much, much earlier date. This tips the scale in \nfavor of an earlier date and does not help the arguments of those who \nfavor a later date.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA peer-reviewed paper on the tablet will be released in the coming \nmonths, Stripling said.\u0014\n\u0014\nGershon Galil of Haifa University said the discovery's significance \ncould not be overstated.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is a text you find only every 1,000 years,\" Galil told The \nTimes of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe newspaper said it \"may be one of the greatest archaeological \ndiscoveries ever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It would be the first attested use of the name of God in the Land of \nIsrael and would set the clock back on proven Israelite literacy by \nseveral centuries  showing that the Israelites were literate when \nthey entered the Holy Land, and therefore could have written the \nBible as some of the events it documents took place,\" the newspaper \nsaid.\u0014",

    "title": "2ND TEMPLE JUDAISM CHANGED THE RELIGION",
    "words": "Adjustment after 586 B.C.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the Babylonian victory of 586 B.C., the Hebrews faced loss of \nland, monarchy, the city of Jerusalem, and their temple. They lived \nunder the direct control of foreign rulers, without national \nidentity. Bereft of their own rulers, the Jews found their religious \nsystem without political support for protection, implementation, or \nfinancial backing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom this date onward, the majority of the Hebrews were scattered \nthroughout the world. This scatteringthe Diaspora, or \nDispersionpresented a continual threat to racial, ethnic, and \ncultural identity. The latter included problems related to their \ndistinctive religious outlook, including its ceremonial, dietary, and \nother practices pertaining to ritual purity. Wherever they lived \nimmediately after 586 B.C. the Hebrews faced a theological crisis. \nWhy had the Lord permitted his people to be conquered? Was he still \ngood, loving, caring, and able to protect them?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the mid-300s B.C., the Hebrews (many of them) had been back in \ntheir own land for two centuries. The second temple was functioning. \nBut then the arrival of Hellenism, with the coming of Alexander the \nGreat in 333 B.C. and the subsequent reign of his successors, \nintensified the crisis and introduced new threats.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe OT law, the Torah, had established twin foundational pillars for \nthe proper response to the Lord with whom the Hebrews were in \ncovenant relationship. These were (1) the temple-centered, ceremonial \npillar and (2) the pillar of observance of ethical and moral \ninstructions. Before the Babylonian exile in 586 B.C. Hebrew religion \nhad been largely temple-centered and ceremonial; it was denounced by \nthe OT prophets when not combined with a proper effect on life and \nbehavior. The prophets insisted on obedience to God and condemned \nfalse trust in the temple and abuses of external forms. Unless the \npeople showed the type of repentance that resulted in a godly life \nand a true relationship with God, the prophets warned that they would \nexperience Gods judgment, marked by the loss of their nation and \nland.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the captivity of Judah (586 B.C.) the prophets had been \nvindicated. The corporate life of the nation was gone, and the temple \nwas in rubble and ashes. Ceremonial worship was all but impossible. \nUnder similar circumstances, most other ancient religions simply \ndisappeared.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the return from captivity (538 B.C.) the temple was rebuilt \n(516) and the priest-led ceremonial worship was reestablished in \nJerusalem. But some Hebrews had decided that their religion could \nsurvive without it. At the moment, they most needed an inspired \nmessage from the Lord, yet the prophets were silent (1 Macc. 4:4446; \n9:27; 14:4142; Josephus, Against Apion 1.3842; Babylonian Talmud, \nSanhedrin 11a; Prayer of Azariah 15; Dead Sea Scrolls, Rule of the \nCommunity 11). Even so, the Hebrew religion had begun a remarkable \nadjustment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the Jewish people retained both the ceremonial pillar of their \nresponse to God and the moral-ethical pillar as well, the primary \nemphasis shifted away from the ceremonial to the moral-ethical. But \nto obey the law, one needed to know its content, which required \nstudy. As a result, the center of worship was no longer exclusively \nthe temple with its liturgy but also the place of learning, the \nassembly, the local synagogue. The major religious leader was no \nlonger only the priest but also the teacher-rabbi. Such adjustments \nrequired careful, detailed study. This resulted in new and different \nforms of interpretation and the birth of traditions, often additional \nlaws, which supposedly expanded and clarified the written Torah. \nDuring the NT period these additional laws were taught and passed on \nboth orally and in written form (note the frequent mention of \nscribes in the NT). Many people regarded these rabbinic traditions \nas having a divine origin, equal to the laws in the written \nScriptures, but Jesus pronounced them the tradition of men (Mark \n7:123, esp. v. 8).\u0014\n\u0014\nDivisions grew within the Judaism of the Second Temple era. Some Jews \nlived in their ancestral land, others did not; some adopted \nHellenistic culture, while others clung to the Hebraic one. (Such \nculturally oriented conflicts are behind the complaint of Acts 6:1.) \nThe new interpretative methods and the additional traditions \nincreasingly became the subject of disagreement. Groups competed for \nreligious prestige and authority, political power, recognition as \nbeing wise, wealth, the satisfaction that they were really in the \nright, etc. Thus arose numerous parties, denominations, or sects. \nThe best known are the Sadducees, Pharisees, Zealots, and Essenes. \n(See the article on Jewish Groups at the Time of the NT.) Most of \ntheir differences resulted from their distinctive traditions. One \nexample of such differences is seen in the tensions between the \nSadducees and Pharisees in Acts 23:69 and elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost people in the land of Israel belonged to none of these groups, \nbeing too busy earning a living and caring for their families. \nAccording to Josephus (Jewish Antiquities 18:1117), the Pharisees \nwere the most influential on the general public; the Sadducees came \nfrom aristocratic priestly families and were not generally popular. \nMost ordinary Jews were devoted to their nation and religion, and \nsome (it is hard to know how many) were genuinely devoted to God \n(such as Zechariah and Elizabeth, Joseph and Mary, Simeon, and Anna; \nsee Luke 12). From such as these came most of Jesus early \nfollowers. With contempt, the Jewish leaders regarded them as this \ncrowd that does not know the law (John 7:49)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCrossway Bibles. (2008). The ESV Study Bible (p. 1785).\u0014",

    "title": "1ST SALVATION ARMY SERMON PREACHED IN A TORN TENT",
    "words": "1st Salvation Army Sermon Preached in a Torn Tent\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tent was tattered. Patches sewn onto it merely ripped the rotted \ncanvas further. The ground on which it was pitched was an unused \nQuaker graveyard. But the man who preached on this day, July 2, 1865, \nwas confident in what he had to say. Using revival methods pioneered \nby Charles Finney, he pointed to sinners and called them specifically \nto repentance. When William Booth preached the first of nine sermons \nin that tattered tent, he did so under the name of the East London \nChristian Mission; Thirteen years later, it became the Salvation Army.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Salvation Army: every major city in the United States and Britain \nhas a post, and there are many in other countries. Near Christmas, \nSalvation Army bells tinkle for donations. Their work helps the poor \nand suffering wherever they are found.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his teenage years William had worked in missions to save souls. \nIn fact William had a running skirmish with his particular group of \nWesleyan Methodists because of his impatience to preach without \nproper credentials and his eagerness to bring people to church who \nleft lice on the church pews. These Methodists did all they could to \nkeep him from preaching, and at one point they took away his \nmembership (class ticket) because he was suspected of being a \n\"reformer\" (a group which called for evangelization of the poor and \noutcast).\u0014\n\u0014\nLater William joined the Reformed Methodists and preached around the \nEnglish countryside. At about the same time, he met his wife, \nCatherine Mumford, who was deeply moved by the first sermon she heard \nhim preach. She had to go home sick from the meeting, and he escorted \nher. That was the start of their courtship. They married in 1855 and \nseldom have a man and wife labored together to do so much good.\u0014\n\u0014\nStanding in his patched tent, the misery of London's millions struck \nhome to William. Himself a child of poverty and often at his wit's \nend how to feed his own family, he understood only too well the \ndesperate needs of the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam's wife, Catherine, understood the need of the poor, too. Of \nhigher social standing and better educated than her husband, she \nnonetheless sympathized with the urban poor and had begun a work \namong London's prostitutes. A strong advocate of female ministry, she \npreached as often as her husband and just as well, if not better. \nOften her speaking engagements were the main support for the pair's \ngrowing family. Thanks to her insistence on allowing women to preach, \nthe Salvation Army had a majority of women ministers from the start.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam and Catherine realized that they had to meet more than \nspiritual needs: the physical needs were just too great. And that is \nwhat they did. Their approach met furious opposition in its early \ndays, especially from tavern keepers who saw their trade drop off \nwhen clients were converted. Among the Army's implacable foes were \npastors who detested its brash methods. William Booth was repeatedly \nattacked with hurled objects. Some of his workers were killed. But \nthe Salvation Army became a force for good in England, America and \nmany other lands. Today it is a world-wide institution.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBooth-Tucker, F. de L.

    "words": "1st Performance of Samuel F. Smith's \"America\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and \nvery poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian!

    "words": "40 Men Died on Ice for Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Agricola of Armenia was confronted with \"mutiny.\" Forty \nsoldiers refused to offer the sacrifice ordered by emperor Licinius. \nThe forty who stood before him that wintry fourth-century day in \nSevaste were fine specimens of manhood who radiated an aura of \ncourage. He was determined to make them see reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the soldiers were adamant. They refused to sacrifice. To do so \nwas to betray their faith in Christ. \"But what about your comrades?\" \nasked Agricola. \"Consider--you alone of all Caesar's thousands of \ntroops defy him! Think of the disgrace you bring upon your legion!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To disgrace the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is more terrible \nstill,\" replied the men. Exasperated, the governor threatened to flog \nand torture them. The soldiers stood firm, although they knew he \nwould carry out his threat. In the fourth century, there were few \ncivil rights. Boldly the men answered, \"Nothing you can offer us \nwould replace what we would lose in the next world. As for your \nthreats-- we despise our bodies when the welfare of our souls is at \nstake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPairs of guards seized each man and dragged them out into the cold \nwhere they were stripped and tied to posts. Whips laid open their \nbacks and iron hooks tore their sides. Still the forty refused to \nsurrender. Agricola chained them in his dungeons. Finally, he \ncommanded that they be stripped naked and driven onto the ice of a \npond below Sevaste.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"rebels\" did not wait for the sentence to be imposed, but tearing \noff their own clothes, ran to the pond in the raw March air. \"We are \nsoldiers of the Lord and fear no hardship,\" they said. \"What is death \nfor us but an entrance into eternal life?\" On this day, March 9, 320, \nsinging hymns, they stood shivering on the pond as the sun sank.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaffled, Agricola ordered hot baths placed around the pond. Surely \nthe warm water would lure the men off the ice! But the crisp night \nair carried a prayer to all ears: \"Lord, there are forty of us \nengaged in this battle; grant that forty may be crowned and not one \nbe wanting from this sacred number.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the men did lose his nerve, however, and crawled off the ice \nto a bath. He died the instant he touched the hot water. This was too \nmuch for one of the guards. He shucked off his clothes, marched onto \nthe ice and took the place of the man who had failed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBasil, St. \"Homily on the Forty Martyrs.\"\u0014\n\"Bravest Soldiers in the Army: The Forty Martyrs of Sevaste.\" \nGlimpses #146.

    "words": "4 Points of Evidence for the Resurrection\u0014\nMarch 31, 2023 by: Neil Shenvi\u0014\n\u0014\nEvidence for the Resurrection\u0014\n\u0014\nFor two thousand years, Christians have insisted that Jesus rose \nphysically from the dead on the Sunday after his crucifixion. The \nhistoricity of the resurrection is central to Christian theology \nbecause Jesuss death and resurrection are both tied to our \nsalvation. While most religions teach that we are saved on the basis \nof the good things we do, Christianity teaches that we are saved on \nthe basis of what Jesus did for us. The Bible insists that while we \nwere still far from God, ignoring him, rejecting him, and rebelling \nagainst him, God drew near to us in Christ to bear our sin, to take \nour punishment, and to die on the cross in our place. The \nresurrection was Gods confirmation that Jesus was who he claimed to \nbe, and it is Gods assurance to Christians that they have been \nforgiven.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of its theological significance, many people assume that the \nresurrection is merely an article of religious faith, not an event \nfor which there could be any historical evidence. But that is not the \ncase. In fact, I would argue that even from a purely secular \nstandpoint, the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus is quite \nstrong. For instance, skeptic Jeffery Lowder, a cofounder of Internet \nInfidels, writes that strong historical arguments can be made for \nthe resurrection. Although he thinks that such arguments are \ninsufficient, he agrees that for theists [people who believe in \nGods existence] . . . the resurrection is a plausible explanation.1 \nSimilarly, renowned atheist-turned-deist philosopher Antony Flew \naffirms that the evidence for the resurrection is better than for \nclaimed miracles in any other religion. Its outstandingly different \nin quality and quantity.2 Jewish scholar Pinchas Lapide even states, \nI accept the resurrection of Easter Sunday not as an invention of \nthe community of disciples, but as a historical event.3\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat historical evidence was sufficient to convince these \nnon-Christians that the resurrection should be taken seriously and \nnot carelessly dismissed? Although there are other lines of evidence, \nIll sketch an argument for the historicity of the resurrection that \nrests on four main points: the death and burial of Jesus, the empty \ntomb, the belief of the apostles, and the conversion of Paul.4\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Jesuss Death and Burial\u0014\n\u0014\nContemporary historians are virtually unanimous in their acceptance \nof Jesuss death on the cross.5 His death by crucifixion is the \nsingle fact most mentioned in all the historical records of his life, \nboth Christian and non-Christian. It is recorded in numerous books of \nthe New Testament, including all four Gospels, Acts, Pauls letters, \nHebrews, 1 Peter, and Revelation. It is mentioned by non-Christians \nlike Josephus and Tacitus. It is discussed in apocryphal gospels such \nas the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of Truth. And it is referenced \nby numerous early Christian writings, including 1 Clement and the \nepistles of Barnabas and Polycarp. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely \nthat the early Christians would have invented the story that their \nSavior was an executed criminal. Agnostic Bart Ehrman writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard today to understand just how offensive the idea of a \ncrucified messiah would have been to most first-century Jews. . . . \nSince no one would have made up the idea of a crucified messiah, \nJesus must really have existed, must really have raised messianic \nexpectations, and must really have been crucified.6\u0014\n\u0014\nNew Testament scholar Gerd Ldemann captures the scholarly consensus \nwhen he writes, The fact of the death of Jesus as a consequence of \ncrucifixion is indisputable.7 Similarly, there is strong evidence \nfor the historicity of Jesuss burial. Most importantly, Jesuss \nburial is recorded in all four Gospels. The burial of Jesus is also \nexplicitly mentioned in Pauls first letter to the Corinthians, \nwritten in the late AD 50s, around thirty years after Jesuss death, \nand it probably reflects a much earlier creed.8 Given that multiple \nattestation is one of the major criteria by which New Testament \nscholars adjudicate the historicity of an event,9 the fact that \nseveral independent sources reference the same event strongly \nsuggests that it is historical. Second, the Gospels all claim that \nJesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin, \nthe Jewish religious court that condemned Jesus to death. It seems \nunlikely that early Christians would have invented this detail \ninvolving such a prominent figure, one who was a member of a group \nopposed to the early Christian movement.10\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we accept the position that Jesus did actually die on the cross \nand was actually buried, we must then ask, What happened to Jesus \nafter his death and burial?\u0014\n\u0014\n2. The Empty Tomb\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the New Testament Gospels claim that the tomb of Jesus was \nfound empty on the Sunday following his crucifixion. While this claim \nis not universally affirmed, a recent survey of three decades worth \nof academic literature shows that it was accepted by the majority of \nscholars who wrote on that subject.11 The strongest piece of evidence \nin favor of the historicity of the empty tomb is the report that it \nwas discovered by women. This detail may not strike us as odd, but it \nis surprising, given the low status of women in the first century. \nFor example, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus claimed that \nJewish law expressed the following sentiment regarding the \nreliability of women: Let not the testimony of women be admitted, on \naccount of the levity and boldness of their sex.12 If the early \nChristians were inventing narratives to support their own version of \nevents, why not ascribe the discovery of the tomb to witnesses who \nwould have been received as more credible?\u0014\n\u0014\nReflecting on this piece of evidence, Jewish New Testament scholar \nGeza Vermes concludes:\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, when every argument has been considered and weighed, the \nonly conclusion acceptable to the historian must be that the opinions \nof the orthodox, the liberal sympathizer and the critical agnostic \nalikeand even perhaps of the disciples themselvesare simply \ninterpretations of the one disconcerting fact: namely that the women \nwho set out to pay their last respects to Jesus found to their \nconsternation, not a body, but an empty tomb.13\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice that Vermes is not defending the resurrection; he suggests \nthat it may have been an interpretation of the disciples. \nNevertheless, he recognizes the strength of the womens testimony as \nevidence that the tomb was really found empty.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second factor supporting the historicity of the empty tomb is the \nfact that just seven weeks after Jesuss death, the apostles began \npreaching the resurrection in Jerusalem itself, the very city in \nwhich Jesus had been crucified. Had he been lying in a tomb even for \nthis length of time, his features such as hair, teeth, stature, and \nthe wounds of crucifixion would have still been identifiable.14 It is \ndifficult to see how the fledgling Christian movement could have \nsurvived despite the opposition of the ruling authorities if the \ncorpse of Jesus had been interred within walking distance of the \ntemple. Any skeptic who wanted to refute the claims of the apostles \ncould have silenced them by taking a short stroll to the burial place \nof Jesus. Yet we have no record of anyone claiming that the disciples \nlied about the empty tomb. How did Christianity grow so rapidly in \nthe very place where Jesus was buried if it could have been falsified \nso easily?15\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, at the end of his Gospel, Matthew provides what amounts to a \ndialogue between Christians and Jews regarding the body of Jesus.16 \nHe states that the Jewish leaders of his day insisted that Jesuss \nbody had been stolen by the disciples, a claim that apparently was \nstill circulating in the second century, since it is referenced in \nJustin Martyrs Dialogue with Trypho.17 But this accusation implies \nthat the Jewish leaders believed that the tomb was actually empty; \nobviously, they would not have accused the disciples of grave robbery \nif they believed that Jesuss body was still in the tomb. For these \nreasons, most skeptical responses to the resurrection do not simply \ndismiss the empty tomb as a legend, but try to provide some \nalternative explanation for it.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. The Belief of the Apostles\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, the followers of Jesus claimed to have seen him alive after he \nhad been executed. They did not claim to have seen him only once or \nfor a short time; they claimed to have seen him repeatedly over an \nextended period of several weeks. They also did not merely claim to \nhave had a vision of him but said that they touched him, talked to \nhim, and ate with him.18 These experiences were not limited to one or \ntwo individuals but included large groups of people, including five \nhundred at one time.19 What are we to make of these claims?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is nearly universally accepted by historians that the disciples \ngenuinely believed they had encountered the resurrected Jesus, even \nif they were mistaken in their belief. For instance, Gerd Ldemann, \nwho denies the historicity of the resurrection, nonetheless states, \nIt may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples \nhad experiences after Jesus death in which Jesus appeared to them as \nthe risen Christ.20 The reason for this consensus is the persecution \nendured by the apostles for their belief in the resurrection. The \napostles were repeatedly beaten and imprisoned. We have good \nhistorical evidence that James, Peter, and Paul were all executed for \ntheir faith, and church tradition maintains that as many as eleven of \nthe twelve apostles were eventually martyred.21 Given the suffering \nthat the apostles faced, it is difficult to maintain that they knew \nthe resurrection to be a hoax. What would their motivation have been \nif they knew for certain that they had invented the resurrection \nstories?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Documents/Evidence for the Resurrection\u0014",

    "title": "13-YEAR OLD AGNES DIED IN ROME FOR HER FAITH",
    "words": "Thirteen-Year-Old Agnes Died in Rome for Her Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN AGNES WAS A GIRL of twelve in fourth-century Rome, boys began \nvying for her hand in marriage. Thirteen was a common age for a girl \nto marry in those days, especially if her family were well-to-do. \nAgnes, it seems, was from a noble family. However, she was not \ninterested in marriage. Having become a Christian, she was devoted to \nChrist.\u0014\n \u0014\nAccording to a persistent legend, one of her suitors was named \nSymphronious, the son of a prefect (Roman magistrate). His desire for \nthe girl drove him to distraction. When the prefect learned of this, \nhe brought Agnes in and pleaded with her to marry his son. She \nrefused, revealing that she was a Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prefect ordered Agnes to sacrifice to Vesta, the virgin goddess \nof hearth and home. When she made the sign of the cross instead, he \nwas furious. Tradition says he tried to break her spirit by throwing \nher into a public whorehouse. At the very least, he humiliated her. \nBishop Ambrose of Milan (who lived later in the same century) said \nthe prefect had her stripped naked. Despite this effort to shame her, \nAgnes clung to her integrity and her faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nNext the prefect is supposed to have threatened to burn the girl \nalive, but the fire would not burn her. Whether fire was merely a \nthreat, or the wood slow to catch fire, we do not know. She died on \nthis day, 21 January 304,* when an executioner either stabbed her in \nthe throat or cut off her head. Accounts vary. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe execution shocked Rome. Romans asked what was so threatening \nabout a thirteen-year-old girl, especially since the law forbade \nexecution of virgins. That a young girl should be killed merely over \na refusal to marry outraged nobler-minded citizens. Agness fortitude \ndespite her sex and age made a deep impression on them. Possibly her \ndeath helped bring the persecution to an end. \u0014\n\u0014\nAgnes quickly became a favorite saint. The church added her to its \ncalendar of martyrs. Constantine erected a church at the site of her \ngrave. Pope Damasus wrote an epitaph for her. Prudentius composed a \nhymn in her honor. Legendary acts (stories of saints) appeared which \ntold about her. Ambrose spoke of her in his book De virginitate (On \nvirginity). John Keats, a Romantic poet, even wrote a poem called \nThe Eve of St. Agnes in 1819 about a girl who elopesan action \ncompletely contrary to the spirit of the martyred girl. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe memory of Agnes even affects the consecration of bishops in the \nRoman Catholic Church. Her symbol is a lamb because her name, which \nmeans pure in Greek, is similar to the Latin Agnus, which means \nlamb. When popes want to show that a bishop is legitimate, they send \nhim a cloth called a pallium, woven from the wool of lambs \nconsecrated on St. Agnes Day. \u0014\n\u0014\nAgness parents buried her in a tomb on the Via Nomentana. Her bones \nhave been examined by experts who say she really was just thirteen \nyears old.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\n* Some scholars think the evidence points to a third-century \nexecution.\u0014",

    "words": "1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. I wish I did not have to write this \nreflection, but I have promised to not skip over the hard \npassages.   Paul writes here his belief about the Day of the Lord. \nA trumpet sounds, Jesus descends with souls of saints from Paradise, \ntheir bodies rise (transformed spiritual bodies  (1 Cor. 15:44) to \nbe reunited, living Christians caught up (the rapture) and bodies \ntransformed, all united with God.  This is believed widely to be \nestablished factual information about how end times will begin.  I \nbelieve differently, so I must explain.  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe question is whether the spiritual realm of existence is real \nand whether we will need a body again after physical death.  I begin \nwith what I believe about God. IF God is Creator, and I believe \nwithout question that God is, then God was fully God before anything \nmaterial existed, so Gods nature must be pure Spirit.  We have no \nevidence that God ever had any material body except when God came \nto us in incarnation, and that was for our need and benefit.  I am \nconvinced that as human persons we are two-natured, having both \nbodies and souls, our bodies being mortal and our souls immortal.  \nThe common expression about death, going home to be with God, is \nwidely understood to mean going to a place called Paradise, but I \nbelieve God is everywhere always present so there is nowhere that God \nis more present than HERE.  \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, to use a personal example, there is nowhere Marguerite could \npossibly be more at home than here with God and me.   I have even \ndared to reason that the God I believe Jesus revealed would not have \ndesigned and established a system of personal relationships that \nwould cause physical death to separate soulmates just because one had \nphysically died.  Some of my colleagues tell me I am projecting \nwhen I come to these conclusions.  I agree, but Paul was also \nprojecting his beliefs about an event thar has not yet occurred. I \ndare to believe that Holy Spirit is still inspiring us when we seek \nto love God with our whole mind as well as our heart.  I know this is \nvery non-traditional, but it is what I believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nSherill Stevens\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: The applicationhere of Paradise in questionable.\u0014",

Smith's \n\"America\"                                 APR 28, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\n Samuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and \nvery poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how \nit came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some \nGerman verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he \nhanded Smith was a German patriotic hymn, \"God Bless Our Native \nLand.\" When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states \nalso needed a stirring national poem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within \nthirty minutes a poem he titled \"America.\" Mason published it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street \nCongregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school \ncelebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, \"My country, 'tis \nof thee, sweet land of liberty. . .\" It gained immediate popularity. \nOne leader commented that since it was \"strong in simplicity and deep \nin trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn \ntogether. Every crisis will hear it above the storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tune to \"America\" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or \nsemiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it \nhad been England's anthem, \"God Save the Queen (or King).\" As early \nas the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long \nhistory of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after \nSmith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four traditional verses of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" were all \npart of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because \nof its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly \nplants our freedoms in God. \"Our father's God, to thee, Author of \nliberty, to Thee we sing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of \nthe outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He \ncomposed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he \ncompiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited \nmany foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 \nlanguages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end \nof his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he \nbegan the study of Russian!

    "title": "6 PEOPLE ATTENDED THOMAS PAINE'S FUNERAL",
    "words": "Thomas Paine Wasnt Popular Until \nLong After His Lifetime\u0014\n\u0014\nWriter and political activist Thomas Paine played a unique role in \nAmericas road to independence. Instead of fighting with a sword and \nmusket (he didnt prove to be a very good soldier), Paine fought for \nhis fledgling country with his pen. One of his most important works \nis the political pamphlet Common Sense. Published on January 10, \n1776, it lays out the American colonies united cause against the \nBritish Empire and King George III, and was one of the bestselling \nworks in 18th-century America. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis follow-up pamphlet The American Crisis (published between 1776 \nand 1783) opened with the iconic line, These are the times that try \nmens souls, and gave much-needed encouragement to the struggling \nContinental Army. \u0014\n\u0014\nWithout Paines writing, which stirred up the revolutionary spirit \nthroughout the colonies and persuaded many Patriots to fight on, \nthere may not be an America, so its strange that at the time of his \ndeath (and for more than a century afterward), many Americans didnt \nthink very highly of him. When Paine died in 1809, only six people \nattended his funeral in New Yorks Greenwich Village  an obituary at \nthe time even wrote, He had lived long, done some good, and much \nharm. The harm referred to his radical anti-Christian views found \nthroughout his work The Age of Reason. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Paine was actually a deist and not an atheist, his reasoning \nwas too controversial for a deeply religious America, and many U.S. \nschools avoided teaching Paine because of his radical views. But \ntimes changed, and in 1937 an article in the Times of London referred \nto Paine as Americas Voltaire, a reference to the influential \n18th-century French writer who also questioned religious beliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nPaines legacy has been on the mend ever since with statues and \nmemorials dedicated to him throughout the U.S. Today his former \ncottage in New Rochelle, New York, is considered a U.S. National \nHistoric Landmark.\u0014",

    "title": "1968 - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Editorial Reviews\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven its broad and vibrant subject, it would be quite difficult for \na writer of any proficiency to pen a boring book on 1968, and Mark \nKurlansky has indeed pulled together an entertaining and enlightening \npopular history with 1968: The Year That Rocked the World. With the \nVietnam War and Soviet repression providing sparkplugs in the East \nand West, student movements heated up in Berkeley, Prague, Mexico \nCity, Paris, and dozens of other hotspots. With youth in ascendancy, \nmusic, film, and athletics became generational battlegrounds between \nopposition forces that couldn't be more appalled with one another. \nNot so fortuitously, the Summer Olympics in Mexico City and a \npresidential election in the United States conspired to elevate the \ntension higher as months passed. Kurlansky is skilled at concisely \ncapturing the personalities behind the conflicts, whether they be \nheartbroken Czech leader Alexander Dubcek as Eastern Bloc troops \nviolently suppress his nation's uprising or respected veteran newsman \nWalter Cronkite reluctantly editorializing against the war in \nVietnam. The author is more than willing to choose heroes (the doomed \nRobert Kennedy) and villains (victorious presidential candidate \nRichard Nixon), and clearly sides with the rebels in most cases. In \ngeneral, Kurlansky is more adept at covering the political front than \nhe is the equally revolutionary arts world, and it's apparent that \nany chapter in this book could be expanded into a book of its own. \nOne's expectation is that captivated readers will view 1968 as a \nportal into a deeper exploration of a fascinating time. --Steven \nStolder\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Publishers Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\nBy any measure, it was a remarkable year. Mentioning the Tet \noffensive, the My Lai massacre, the assassinations of Martin Luther \nKing Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the Democratic convention in Chicago, \nand the Prague Spring and its backlash gives only the merest \nimpression of how eventful and transformative the year must have felt \nat the time. As Kurlansky (Cod, Salt, etc.) has made the phrase \n\"changed the world\" a necessary component of subtitles for books \nabout mundane objects, his choice to focus on a year that so \"rocked\" \nthe world is appropriate. To read this book is to be transported to a \nvery specific past at once more naive and more mature than today; as \nKurlansky puts it, it was a time of \"shocking modernism\" and \"quaint \ninnocence,\" a combination less contradictory than it first appears. \nThe common genesis of demonstrations occurring in virtually every \nWestern nation was the war in Vietnam. Without shortchanging the \nroles of race and age, Kurlansky shrewdly emphasizes the rise of \ntelevision as a near-instantaneous (and less packaged than today) \nconduit of news as key to the year's unfolding. To his credit, \nKurlansky does not overdo Berkeley at the expense of Paris or Warsaw \nor Mexico City. The gains and costs of the new ethic of mass \ndemonstration are neatly illustrated by the U.S. presidential \ncampaign: the young leftists helped force the effective abdication of \nPresident Lyndon Johnson - and were rewarded with \"silent majority\" \nspokesman Richard Nixon. 1968 is a thorough and loving (perhaps a bit \ntoo loving of the boomer generation) tapestry - or time capsule.\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this monumental new book, award-winning author Mark Kurlansky has \nwritten his most ambitious work to date: a singular and ultimately \ndefinitive look at a pivotal moment in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith 1968, Mark Kurlansky brings to teeming life the cultural and \npolitical history of that world-changing year of social upheaval. \nPeople think of it as the year of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Yet \nit was also the year of the Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy \nassassinations; the riots at the Democratic National Convention in \nChicago; Prague Spring; the antiwar movement and the Tet Offensive; \nBlack Power; the generation gap, avant-garde theater, the birth of \nthe womens movement, and the beginning of the end for the Soviet \nUnion. From New York, Miami, Berkeley, and Chicago to Paris, Prague, \nRome, Berlin, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Mexico City, spontaneous uprisings \noccurred simultaneously around the globe.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything was disrupted. In the Middle East, Yasir Arafats guerilla \norganization rose to prominence . . . both the Cannes Film Festival \nand the Venice Biennale were forced to shut down by protesters . . . \nthe Kentucky Derby winner was stripped of the crown for drug use . . \n. the Olympics were a disaster, with the Mexican government having \nmassacred hundreds of students protesting police brutality there . . \n. and the Miss America pageant was stormed by feminists carrying \nbanners that introduced to the television-watching public the phrase \nwomens liberation.\u0014\nKurlansky shows how the coming of live television made 1968 the first \nglobal year. It was the year that an amazed world watched the first \nlive telecast from outer space, and that TV news expanded to half an \nhour. For the first time, Americans watched that days battlethe \nVietnam Wars Tet Offensiveon the evening news. Television also \nshocked the world with seventeen minutes of police clubbing \ndemonstrators at the Chicago convention, live film of unarmed \nstudents facing Soviet tanks in Czechoslovakia, and a war of \nstarvation in Biafra. The impact was huge, not only on the antiwar \nmovement, but also on the medium itself. The fact that one now needed \ntelevision to make things happen was a cultural revelation with \nenormous consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways, this momentous year led us to where we are today. \nWhether through youth and music, politics and war, economics and the \nmedia, Mark Kurlansky shows how, in 1968, twelve volatile months \ntransformed who we are as a people. But above all, he gives a new \nunderstanding to the underlying causes of the unique historical \nphenomenon that was the year 1968. Thoroughly researched and \nengagingly writtenfull of telling anecdotes, penetrating analysis, \nand the authors trademark incisive wit1968 is the most important \nbook yet of Kurlanskys noteworthy career.\u0014\nFrom The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us are still haunted by the events of 1968. Just two weeks \nago in Iowa, Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean recalled \nthe '60s: \"When I was 21 years old, it was the end of the civil \nrights era, and America had paid an enormous price. Martin Luther \nKing had been killed. Bobby Kennedy was dead. . . . But it was also a \ntime of great hope. Medicare had passed. Head Start had passed. The \nCivil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. We felt like we were all in \nit together.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Kurlansky echoes Dean when he writes: \"The thrilling thing about \nthe year 1968 was that it was a time when significant segments of \npopulation all over the globe refused to be silent about the many \nthings that were wrong with the world. . .. And this gave the world a \nsense of hope that it has rarely had, a sense that where there is \nwrong, there are always people who will expose it and try to change \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA well-organized anti-war movement attracted a large segment of the \npopulace, with mass demonstrations not just here but around the \nworld. To many of draft age, the movement against the war and the \nauthority figures who perpetrated it was a desperate struggle that \npushed young people to join the political process in a big way. For \nothers, it was an impetus to turn to radical politics or escape to \nthe nether world of hallucinogens and other drugs. Some must have \nfelt that President Johnson's decision not to run for re-election \nwas, in large part, a victory for the movement. This turned out to be \na mirage because the peace candidates could not unify (Bobby Kennedy \nwas assassinated after winning the California primary), and although \nRichard Nixon claimed to have a plan for peace, after his election \nthe war went on.\u0014\n\u0014\nKurlansky's book covers a broad spectrum of events -- not just what \nhappened in this country but in France, Poland, Mexico, \nCzechoslovakia and elsewhere. In Czechoslovakia, Alexander Dubcek and \nhis more liberal supporters opened the iron curtain to Prague Spring \n-- a loosening of communist authoritarianism that resulted in a \nflowering of arts and letters, such as the films of Milos Forman, the \nnovels of Milan Kundera and the younger generation's embrace of \nAmerican rock music. The curtain came down with a thud in August of \n1968, when the Soviets and their allies occupied the country. It \nwasn't until 21 years later that, with the Velvet Revolution and the \noverthrow of the communist regime, the country again experienced \nanything like the exhilaration of that magical spring. In Mexico, as \nthe country prepared for the Olympics, students organized a protest \nagainst the ruling PRI government. Over 200 protesters may have been \nkilled by gunfire (statistics fluctuate widely), and many more were \ninjured. What most of us remember from those Games, though, is the \nimage of two athletes wearing black gloves, their clenched fists \nthrust in a black power salute after they won medals for the United \nStates.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, Kurlansky's book brought back memories of Paris in May of \n'68. I observed the organizational skills of French students as they \nrecruited demonstrators: Some 50 students marched down one street on \nthe Left Bank chanting \"Join us, join us!\" and the group grew twofold \nand threefold while other groups were doing the same. Then they all \nconverged near the Sorbonne, at which point one of the student \nleaders, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, emerged to make a rousing speech. On the \nRight Bank, the demonstration I saw was even more spectacular: The \ntricolor flew all along the Champs Elyses as thousands marched \ntoward the Arc de Triomphe, led by the minister of culture, Andr \nMalraux. I saw chefs marching in their tall white toques while \nshopkeepers and office workers waved the French flag from their \nwindows as the marchers sang \"La Marseillaise.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the book provides a detailed chronicle of significant events \nin '68, Kurlansky does not attempt to draw a parallel with what is \nhappening today. He might have quoted more than just the one famous \nline of President Johnson's March 31 speech announcing his withdrawal \nfrom the presidential race. The run-up to LBJ's declaration that \"I \nshall not seek . . . the nomination of my party . . .\" makes for \nsobering reading today: \"This country's ultimate strength lies in the \nunity of our people. There is a division in the American house now. \nThere is a divisiveness among us all tonight. And holding the trust \nthat is mine, as President of all the people, I cannot disregard the \nperil to the progress of the American people and the hope and \nprospect of peace for all people. . . . With America's sons in the \nfields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at \nhome . . . I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of \nmy time to any personal partisan causes . . . .\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Kurlansky's previous books include Salt: A World History, Cod: A \nBiography of the Fish That Changed the World, and The Basque History \nof the World. For 1968, he has interviewed key opinion makers such as \nformer CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite and Students for a Democratic \nSociety leader Mark Rudd, and culled material from a variety of \nnewspapers and magazines, domestic and foreign. But in attempting to \ninclude every significant world event, he inevitably sacrifices many \nof that year's salient elements -- its soundtrack, for example.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us recollect our past largely by the tunes we listened to: It \nwas the year that began with the Beatles' \"Magical Mystery Tour\" and \nended with their \"White Album.\" In between there was unforgettable \nmusic by Otis Redding, Janis Joplin, the Mamas & the Papas, Jimi \nHendrix and Jim Morrison. I remember a spring day in Rome, walking to \nthe Spanish Steps and joining a group of young people milling around, \nsome with backpacks, one with a guitar. It didn't matter where we \nwere from -- I was a student from Japan -- because we were united in \nour familiarity with American music. Everyone could coo-coo-ca-choo \nto the tune of \"Mrs. Robinson.\" That was what brought us together, \nand everything else flowed with it, from political discussions to \nwhere the best youth hostels were located. Mark Kurlansky's book \nsucceeds in stirring up such memories.\u0014\n\u0014\nReviewed by Kunio Francis Tanabe\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.\u0014",

    "title": "'THE POPE IS IN HELL\" ONE BAPTIST CHURCH SAYS",
    "words": "Baptist \nChurch Consigns Pope to Hell\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n04-14-05\u0014\n\u0014\nA Baptist church in east Tennessee drew media attention for \ndisplaying a sign implying the late Pope John Paul II is in hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWATE-6 News in Knoxville on Monday reported on the marquee message \noutside Hilltop Baptist Church in Newport, Tenn. One side of the sign \nread: No truth. No hope following a hell-bound pope. The other side \nsaid, False hope in a fake pope.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe churchs assistant pastor reportedly refused to be interviewed \nbut said off camera that people were misunderstanding the sign. He \ninsisted the church wasnt trying to say the pope is in hell, but the \nsigns main message is that people shouldnt put hope in the pope \nalone.\u0014\n \u0014\nA Catholic clergyman responded that Catholics would say the same \nthing. We dont put our hope in the pope alone, Father Vann \nJohnston of the Knoxville Catholic Diocese told the station. The \npope has a specific office, a specific function within the Catholic \nChurch. But we only claim Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.\u0014\n \u0014\nHilltop Baptist Church isnt listed as a member of the East Tennessee \nBaptist Association, the Tennessee Baptist Convention or the Southern \nBaptist Convention.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe TV stations Web site quoted an unidentified convention spokesman \nas criticizing the sign, saying, Its highly presumptuous for any \nperson or church to assume they know for certain the eternal \ndestination of any person.\u0014\n \u0014\nDan Riley at the SBC-related Calvary Baptist Church in Knoxville told \nthe station: Thats pretty strong language. Its really not about \nwhether youre part of the Catholic Church or if youre a Baptist. I \nknow some Baptists who I think are probably not going to be in heaven \nand I know some Catholics who I think are. Thats not our decision. \nIts really all about Jesus and your relationship with him.\u0014\n \u0014\nDespite the media attention, the folks at Hilltop Baptist arent the \nonly biblical conservatives wondering if the pope ever had a \nsalvation experience.\u0014\n \u0014\nHow sad! How tragic! According to the Bible, Pope John Paul II went \nstraight to burn in hell-fire on April 2nd, 2005, lamented the Web \nsite Jesus-is-savior.com. \u0014\n \u0014\nFred Phelps Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., took its \ntypical in-your-face approach. Deal with it, you idolatrous morons: \nThe Pope is in Hell! proclaimed the controversial Web site \nGodHatesFags.com.\u0014\n \u0014\nLouisiana Baptist pastor Jerry Moser, editor of the RADEN Report, \npointed out that the pope was responsible for a world-wide religion \npromoting an unbiblical sacramental system of belief to over a \nbillion adherents.\u0014\n \u0014\nIt is not the good works of a man that earns him heaven, but faith \nin the once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus Christ, a faith that stands \ndistinctly apart from any human effort, Moser said. Throughout his \nlong life, this man never professed to step away from a faith in \nsacramental religious works and over into this distinct and solitary \nfaith in the finished work of Christ alone. The death of any such \nperson is indeed an eternal tragedy, for no one may stand justified \nbefore God who trusts in any other means but Christ Jesus ALONE.\u0014\n\u0014\n For his part, Pope John Paul II rejected the idea of a literal hell.\u0014\n\u0014\n Rather than a physical place, hell is the state of those who freely \nand definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life \nand joy, he said in 1999.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope defined damnation as definitive separation from God, freely \nchosen by the human person, and confirmed with death that seals his \nchoice for ever.\u0014\n\u0014\n The doctrine of hell should not create anxiety or despair, the \npontiff said, but is rather a reminder of the freedom found in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com\u0014",

Then, they said, knowing that Sierra was \nsuffering, he waited before calling 911.\u0014\nIt was the second time in two weeks that a birth parent was charged \nin the death of a child who had been placed in foster care by the \ncity and then returned to the home.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week, Tracina Vaughn was charged with reckless endangerment in \nBrooklyn because, prosecutors said, she had left her 16-month-old \nson, Dahquay Gillians, unsupervised in the bathtub, where he drowned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe back-to-back arrests come as the city has sought to emphasize its \npolicy of keeping children with their birth parents whenever possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sierra Helena Roberts's short life began, she tested positive \nfor cocaine at birth and was immediately placed in foster care.

The agency investigated the injuries but \naccepted the father's assertions that both had occurred as a result \nof accidental falls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way prosecutors say the girl sustained the fatal injuries was \ndetailed during Mr. Roberts's arraignment yesterday in State Supreme \nCourt in Queens on charges of second-degree murder, second-degree \nmanslaughter, first-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a \nchild.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He kneed Sierra several times in the abdomen, noticed the pain, did \nnothing about it,\" an assistant district attorney, Leigh Bishop, \nsaid. The father \"then beat her with a belt the night before she \ndied,\" Mr. Bishop said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSierra was neither conscious nor breathing when she was brought by \nambulance to Peninsula General Hospital in Far Rockaway. She was \ndeclared dead soon after.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis lawyer, Howard R. Teichner, said Mr. Roberts was pleading not \nguilty. According to a court document, Mr. Roberts told the police \nthat his daughter had been hurt while they were wrestling.\u0014\nThe Administration for Children's Services said yesterday that it had \nreceived no complaints about the Roberts family since 2003.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn B. Mattingly, the commissioner of the agency, said it would \nreview all of its current practices regarding reunification of \nchildren with their biological parents after children have been in \nfoster care. \u0014\n\"Sierra had not been in our care for the last four years,\" he said in \na written statement, \"but we take responsibility for finding out \nwhether Children's Services might have been able to do anything more \nto protect her during that time. We will make a full report to the \npublic on this tragedy as soon as our investigation is complete.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl, nicknamed C.C., attended first grade at P.S. 42. Several \nneighbors of the father and daughter on their quiet residential \nstreet in the Arverne section of the Rockaways said they had seen no \nsigns of potential abuse. The father did not appear to work, they \nsaid, but the child was always neat and he walked her to school every \nday and was always with her. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Catherine Harris, 31, who had an apartment in the same neat \ntownhouse complex, said she was troubled by the father-daughter \nrelationship. At one point this year, she said, she noticed that \nSierra had a bloodshot eye and asked the girl about it, but Sierra \ntold Ms. Harris she had run into a doorknob.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"His daughter was afraid of him, you could tell,\" Ms. Harris said.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said she had called Children's Services to complain but had heard \nnothing back.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren's Services said it first took custody of Sierra in January \n1998, right after she and her mother both tested positive for cocaine \nin the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlonzo Freeman, 62, the girl's foster father, described Sierra as a \nhappy child who lived easily with his other foster children, four \nboys.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She was such a sweet girl - he didn't deserve her,\" Mr. Freeman said \nof Mr. Roberts. \"She was a very, very smart child.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe baby's mother was out of her life, the agency said, but Mr. \nRoberts took classes on being a parent and drug treatment classes and \ncontinued to visit with Sierra each week.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2001, in part on the recommendation of a nonprofit agency, Miracle \nMakers, that had contracted with the city to provide services, Family \nCourt sent Sierra back to her father and required no further \nsupervision.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe city canceled its foster care contracts with Miracle Makers \nearlier this year because the agency consistently had the lowest \nrankings on annual evaluations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 2003 call to state authorities came after the doctor in Brooklyn \n- whose name the agency would not disclose - reported the broken leg \nand the earlier fractured spine, the child welfare agency said. The \nagency sent a team to investigate, and the team spoke to Mr. Roberts, \nthe doctor and the child's former foster mother, who remained in \ncontact with the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Roberts had told the doctor that Sierra fell and hurt her back, \nand that the later leg injury occurred when he slipped and fell while \ncarrying the child up some stairs. The child welfare agency accepted \nthe explanations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe agency's last visit to the child was in July 2003.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the girl's school yesterday, Alicea Flynn, secretary for the \nschool's parent advisory council, said there had been \"absolutely no \nsigns of abuse\" with Sierra.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was our only single-parent dad, and he was so close, so \nprotective of her,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Nov. 2, Sierra was laid out in white with a tiara on her head at a \nmemorial service at the Humbleway Church for God and Christ in Ozone \nPark.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She looked old, beat up and worn out,\" Ms. Harris, the neighbor, \nsaid. \"She looked 30 years old, like they put makeup on her and \nstuffed her in a box.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nColin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.\u0014",

    "title": "300 MILLIONTH AMERICAN TO BE BORN IN OCTOBER, 2006",
    "words": "January 13, 2006 \u0014\nCome October, Baby Will Make 300 Million or So \u0014\n\u0014\nBy SAM ROBERTS \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the experts are right, some time this month, perhaps somewhere in \nthe suburban South or West, a couple, most likely white Anglo-Saxon \nProtestants or Hispanic, will conceive a baby who, when born in \nOctober, will become the 300 millionth American. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs of yesterday, the Census Bureau officially pegged the resident \npopulation of the United States at closing in on 297,900,000. The \nbureau estimates that with a baby being born every 8 seconds, someone \ndying every 12 seconds and the nation gaining an immigrant every 31 \nseconds on average, the population is growing by one person every 14 \nseconds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that rate, the total is expected to top 300 million late this \nyear. But with those projections adjusted monthly and the number of \nbirths typically peaking during the summer, the benchmark is likely \nto be reached about nine months from now. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"You end up with a number in October,\" said Katrina Wengert, a \ndemographer and a keeper of the Census Bureau's official Population \nClock, getting about as specific as possible this far in advance in a \nfield subject to chronic fudging and revising. The clock is, itself, \na contrivance, of course, but no more so than other pretexts for a \nwintertime sexual encounter. Rest assured that hospital publicists, \ncanny obstetricians, entrepreneurial chambers of commerce, baby food \nmanufacturers, public officials and countless others pursuing some \npolitical social or personal agenda, abetted by the media, are \nalready guesstimating the growth rate to anoint any number of \nunsuspecting newborns as the mythical American who pushed the \nnation's population to 300 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1967, when the population reached 200 million, Life magazine \ndispatched 23 photographers to locate the baby and devoted a \nfive-page spread to its search. Instead of deciding on a \nstatistically valid symbol of the average American newborn, the \nmagazine chose the one born at precisely the appointed time. \u0014\n\u0014\nLife immortalized Robert Ken Woo Jr. of Atlanta, whose parents, a \ncomputer programmer and a chemical engineer, had immigrated seven \nyears earlier from China. Mr. Woo graduated magna cum laude from \nHarvard and is a litigator. Now 38, he still lives in Atlanta with \nhis wife, Angie, who is also a lawyer, and their three daughters.\u0014\nThe symbolic 300 millionth could be an immigrant, arriving by plane \nor crossing the border illegally, but most bets by those who study \nsuch things are on a native-born baby. About 11,000 are born each \nday. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The 300 millionth will be a Mexican Latino in Los Angeles County, \nwith parents who speak Spanish at home and with siblings who are \nbilingual,\" said William Frey, a demographer with the University of \nMichigan Population Studies Center.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is a far cry from the 200 millionth person who was born in the \nlate 60's - probably a white son to middle-class suburbanites in Los \nAngeles or New York City,\" said Dr. Frey, rejecting Life magazine's \ndetermination, \"and different from the 100 millionth person born in \nthe late 1910's, perhaps to a white ethnic city family in New York \nCity or rural family in upstate New York or Pennsylvania. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The new baby is symbolic of America's new multi-ethnic demography of \nthe 21st century, both urban and suburban, that will filter out from \ngateway cities like L.A., Dallas and New York, as white suburban \nboomers fade into the past,\" he said.\u0014",

    "title": "50TH ANNIVERSARY 0F \"THE SECRET SPEECH\" BY KHRUSHCHEV",
    "words": "How a Speech Won the Cold War \u0014\nby WILLIAM TAUBMAN \u0014\nPublished: February 25, 2006 \u0014\nAmherst, Mass.\u0014\n\u0014\nFIFTY years ago today, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave a \n\"secret speech\" at the 20th Communist Party Congress that changed \nboth his country and the world. By denouncing Stalin, whose God-like \nstatus had helped to legitimize Communism in the Soviet Bloc, \nKhrushchev began a process of unraveling it that culminated in 1991 \nwith the collapse of the Soviet Union. This great deed deserves to be \ncelebrated on its anniversary. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is also a good time to ponder this question: What are we to \nthink of a leader whose great deeds do not bring about the \nconsequences intended? It is a question worth consideration by all \nleaders  particularly Khrushchev's current heir, Vladimir Putin, who \nhas tried to bring his nation into the 21st century by wielding the \nautocratic hand of a 19th-century czar. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, Khrushchev sought to save Communism, not to destroy it. By \ncleansing it of the Stalinist stain, he wanted to re-legitimize it in \nthe eyes of people not just in the Soviet sphere but around the \nglobe. Yet within weeks after the secret speech, at Communist Party \nmeetings called to discuss it, criticism of Stalin rippled way beyond \nKhrushchev's, including indictments not just of Stalin himself but of \nthe Soviet system that spawned him. Others sprang to Stalin's \ndefense, especially in his native Georgia, where at least 20 \npro-Stalin demonstrators were killed in clashes with the police. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Eastern Europe, the unintended consequences of Khrushchev's speech \nwere even more shattering. A huge strike in the Polish city of Poznan \nin June was put down at a cost of at least 53 dead and hundreds \nwounded. Then, of course, the revolution in Hungary in October was \nsmashed by Soviet forces, leaving more than 20,000 Hungarians dead. \u0014\n\u0014\nKhrushchev also used the speech to try to buttress his position in \nthe Kremlin. By attacking Stalin he thought he would burnish his own \nreputation while blackening those of his rivals for power like \nVyacheslav Molotov, Georgi Malenkov and Lazar Kaganovich, who had \nbeen closer to Stalin than he had. But instead, he provoked a coup \nattempt that very nearly ousted him in June 1957. His \nde-Stalinization campaign was also a prime grievance among those who \nformed the conspiracy that succeeded in pushing him from power in \nOctober 1964. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, some unintended consequences are inevitable in politics as \nin what Russians call \"sama zhizn,\" or \"life itself.\" Moreover, the \n\"secret speech\" was part of a reform program that included many \nworthy achievements that Khrushchev did indeed intend. He released \nand rehabilitated millions of Stalin's victims. He allowed what \nbecame known as \"the thaw,\" with its partial rebirth of Russian \nculture. He revivified Soviet agriculture, which Stalin had ruined, \nand started a boom in housing construction that permitted hundreds of \nthousands to move out of overcrowded communal apartments.\u0014\nIn the midst of his ouster in 1964, Khrushchev said to his only \nremaining ally, Anastas Mikoyan: \"I've done the main thing. Could \nanyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore \nand suggesting he retire? Not even a wet spot would have remained \nwhere we had been standing. Now everything is different. The fear is \ngone and we can talk as equals. That's my contribution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKhrushchev was whistling past his own political graveyard. He hadn't \nexactly embarked on reform to ease this way for his own exit. But he \nhad meant to end the pattern of bloody purges as the only way to \ntransfer political power.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne should also say that both his drive for reform and its unintended \nconsequences cannot be understood without understanding the Communist \nsystem that shaped him. Soviet Communism had been built on a \nStalinist foundation that cried out for drastic change, and \nKhrushchev learned (or thought he had) from the Bolsheviks' \nwillingness to revolutionize Soviet society that such change was \npossible almost overnight.\u0014\n\u0014\nKhrushchev's speech didn't change his country as intended. But it did \nregister a remarkable change in himself. Unlike most of his comrades \nin Stalin's inner circle, Khrushchev somehow retained his humanity. \nHe never forgave Stalin for making him an accomplice in terrible \ncrimes. The secret speech was in part motivated by a sense of guilt \nat his own complicity. As early as 1940, when Khrushchev was Stalin's \nviceroy in Ukraine, he told a childhood friend who lamented Stalin's \npurges: \"Don't blame me for that. I'm not involved in that.\" He went \non, using a vulgar pun on Stalin's name, to say that he would someday \n\"settle\" with the dictator \"in full.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Khrushchev was involved in \"that.\" But that is the point. \nApart from anything else, the secret speech was an act of repentance. \nWhen asked in retirement what he most regretted, he answered: \"Most \nof all the blood. My arms are up to the elbows in blood. That is the \nmost terrible thing that lies in my soul.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his case, it wasn't the road to hell that was paved with good \nintentions, but the road from the Stalinist hell in which he had \nfaithfully served, and which he had the courage to try to transcend. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Taubman, a professor of political science at Amherst College, \nis the author of \"Khrushchev: The Man and His Era,\" which won the \n2004 Pulitzer Prize in biography.\u0014\nNext Article in Opinion (5 of 6) >\u0014",

One of the 10-year-olds then \nslammed a piece of the broken wall onto his face, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They were big kids for their age,\" D'Amico told the AP. \"The little \nkid was taunting me. The big kid came over and just slugged me. If \nthey just would have let me walk on, I would have walked on.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nD'Amico has had reconstructive surgery on his face since the attack. \nHe said he didn't think he was targeted simply for being homeless.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't look that homeless. I'm not really dirty, slobby homeless,\" \nhe said. \"I'm familiar in the neighborhood. I don't know these kids, \nnever seen them before.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice didn't return a phone message left Friday seeking comment, and \nno parents were in the courtroom during the boys' first appearance \nbefore a judge Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nA police report shows the parents were notified of the boys' arrests.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For a 10-year-old to pick up a cinder block and smash somebody's \nface with it, that defies logic,\" police Chief Michael Chitwood told \nThe Daytona Beach News-Journal on Thursday. He said the court system \nneeds to take a close look at the children's backgrounds and families.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrivate defense attorneys Tonya Cromartie and Jonathon Glugover, who \nrepresent the younger boys, had just been assigned to the case Friday \nand couldn't yet comment, assistants said.\u0014\n\u0014\nVolusia County Public Defender Jim Purdy, who represents the older \nboy, said he won't know until next week if his client will be charged \nas an adult.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case was the latest example of violence involving homeless people \nin Florida.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour teenagers got lengthy prison sentences for beating a homeless \nman to death in 2005 near Daytona Beach. Three other teenagers face \npossible life sentences if convicted of beating a homeless man to \ndeath with a baseball bat in Fort Lauderdale in a 2006 attack caught \non surveillance video.\u0014\n\u0014\n---\u0014\n\u0014\nAssociated Press reporter Tony Winton in Miami contributed to this \nreport.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2007 The Associated Press\u0014",

    "title": "7 HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE",
    "words": "Habit #1: Be Proactive \u0014\n\u0014\nBeing proactive is the foundation of the entire seven habits \nparadigm. In a sense, all the other habits are types of being \nproactive. This entails a realization that you are a person who can \ntake direct control of a situation and, even if you have no actions \nthat you are allowed to perform, you can still control your outlook. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #2: Begin with the End in Mind \u0014\n\u0014\nCovey begins this section with the description of the reader's \nfuneral as an illustration of how one end in view can change the \nprevious years' effort. The visualized step of seeing the end is the \nfirst part of any successful plan. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #3: Put First Things First \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second step of a successful plan, following the visualization, is \nthe managing step, that of physically performing the task. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #4: Think Win/Win \u0014\n\u0014\nOut of six possible scenarios, Win/Win is the highest form of \nagreement between parties that empowers all involved and does not \nsour the milk of future relations with resentment. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #5: Seek first to Understand, then to Be Understood \u0014\n\u0014\nCovey says that this is the most immediately applicable of all the \nseven habits. He is right. However, this is probably the most \ndifficult habit to practice since it requires a major paradigm shift \nin how one views communication. Communication is not a pipe to send \ninformation with a limited bandwidth. Rather, it is like a circuit \nthat requires lessening of resistance to allow the proper current \nthrough. The current is the message and the resistance is our \nwillingness to control our reaction and proactive empathic listening. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #6: Synergize \u0014\n\u0014\nSynergy is not \"'sin-energy' the energy of sinfulness\" as some \npunning Christian might say. Synergy is what happens when a group of \nindependent people coalesce their creative energies and the result is \nmore than the sum of their individual input. It is the culmination of \nthe other habits and it requires integrity to be most effective. \nSynergy is a high type of compromise in which all parties maintain a \nWin/Win situation. \u0014\n\u0014\nHabit #7: Sharpen the Saw \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Covey details sharpening the saw, he gives the reader one final \nabstraction of thought, a level above the others that entails keeping \nall the other skills sharpened by continued planning, practice, and \nrenewal. These are the dynamics of the saw: Physical, social, mental, \nand spiritual-coincidentally\u0014\nBy Stephen Covey\u0014",

Scripture \nreadings from the evangelists will depict Jesus as the Savior and \nDeliverer of God's chosen people. Yet Christmas also bears a tinge of \ndisappointment. For the most part, Christians do not share this \ncelebration with Jews. This division preoccupied the New Testament \nwriters, particularly the apostle Paul, who envisioned a time when \nmany Jews will join the Gentiles in praising the name of Christ the \nLord forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew, believed to be writing to a largely Jewish audience, opens \nhis gospel, \"The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of \nDavid, the son of Abraham\" (Matt. 1:1). Jesus' birth accorded with \nthe Immanuel prophecy of Isaiah 7:14. And when the wise men visited \nfrom the east, they asked Herod, \"Where is he who has been born king \nof the Jews?\" (Matt. 2:2). Despite a different readership, Luke's \ngospel likewise draws attention to Jesus as the long-awaited Jewish \nMessiah. The angel Gabriel told young Mary that her son would receive \nfrom the Lord God the \"throne of his father David\" and would \"reign \nover the house of Jacob forever\" (Luke 1:32-33). An angel of the Lord \ntold the shepherds the good news that \"unto you is born this day in \nthe city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:11). And \nwhen the devout man Simeon, who waited in Jerusalem for the \nconsolation of Israel, saw the baby Jesus, he knew he could depart \nthis world in peace. His eyes had seen God's salvation, \"a light for \nrevelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel\" \n(Luke 2:32).\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Gentiles did indeed see the light of revelation. Yet \ncomparatively few Israelites attributed glory to the crucified Jesus. \nThey chased all but the apostles from Jerusalem (Acts 8:1) and \npursued Paul in the Diaspora (Acts 17:13). As Simeon told Mary, \n\"Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in \nIsrael\" (Luke 2:34). This reversal led Gentiles in some churches, \nparticularly Rome, to boast in their faith. Paul rejected this racial \npride. But he also recognized an apologetic dilemma. Is God to blame \nthat so few Jews believe? Paul devoted Romans 9-11 to answering this \nquestion. \"It is not as though the word of God has failed,\" Paul \nresponded in Romans 9:6. The Jews have stumbled because they did not \npursue God's righteousness by faith but \"as if it were based on \nworks\" (Rom. 9:32).\u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, there is more to the story. God has not rejected his \npeople; after all, Paul himself was an Israelite (Rom. 11:1). Even \nbetter, God revealed to Paul a great mystery: Israel's hardening will \nlast only until the \"fullness of the Gentiles has come in\" (Rom. \n11:25). Then what? All Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:26). The exact \nmeaning of this phrase has been hotly debated throughout church \nhistory, and the disagreements continue today. But many interpreters \nnow believe that Paul anticipated a day when mass numbers of Jews \nwould believe in Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Precisely because the gospel stands athwart all ethnic claims, the \nchurch cannot erect a new racial boundary,\" N. T. Wright argues in \n\\The Climax of the Covenant against this so-called two-covenant \ntheology. \"The irony of this is that the late twentieth century, in \norder to avoid anti-Semitism, has advocated a position (the \nnon-evangelization of Jews) which Paul regards precisely as \nanti-Semitic.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral early church leaders and a number of other venerable teachers \nunderstand \"all Israel\" to refer to the elect, both Jews and \nGentiles. The phrase, Wright argues, is \"best taken as a polemical \nredefinition,\" much like how Paul redefined Jew and circumcision in \nRomans 2:29. Like John Calvin, Wright cross-references Romans 11:26 \nwith Paul's phrase \"Israel of God\" (Gal. 6:16), which refers to Jews \nand Gentiles joined together in God's family. In this view, no mass \nconversion of Jews should be expected.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe challenge to this view, Wright acknowledges, comes from Romans \n11:25, where Israel plainly refers to national Israel. In fact, Paul \ncontrasts Israel and the Gentiles throughout this section of Romans \n(11:11-32). And \"all Israel\" is a common Old Testament phrase that \nrefers to the nation of Israel without including every Israelite. To \nbe sure, no large numbers of Jews have yet turned to Jesus Christ in \nthe way Paul seemed to expect. But many Bible scholars believe there \nwill be a mass ingathering of Jews in the future. The English \nPuritans believed such a day would come. This expectation fueled \ntheir zeal for missions.\u0014\nNo matter how bleak things appear right now, we can hope that God \nwill one day call forth many Israelites. Then all will see how God \ncares for his \"first love,\" as James Dunn puts it. However, we may \nneed to wait for Christ's second advent (Matt. 10:23b). Even so, what \na celebration of Immanuel that will be, when all God's children \ntogether praise the \"Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David\" \n(Rev. 5:5).\u0014\n\u0014\nCollin Hansen is a CT editor at large and author of \\Young, Restless, \nReformed: A Journalist's Journey with the New Calvinists.\u0014\nCopyright  2009 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "\"PRECIOUS\", AN UNRELENTING FILM ABOUT ABUSE",
    "words": "\"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire\" \u0014\nMike Parnell         December 4, 2009 \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Precious\" is an unrelenting movie. Striking at the heart of any \ncompassionate person, it brings the viewer into a world that is not \ntoo far from any door in America. And it calls to us to see the life \nof one we would easily pass over and not give a moment's thought. \u0014\n\u0014\nClarissa Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is 16 and pregnant with her \nsecond child. Both of them were fathered by Precious' father. \nPrecious' mother (Mo'Nique) is a villain of a woman who makes \nPrecious' life a living hell. And to say a living hell is too bland \nof a description. Her mother is verbally, physically and \npsychologically abusive.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrecious is large and overweight. Self-described as nothing more than \na \"glob of grease,\" she lives in a world of pain and only escapes in \nher dreams. The dreams she holds are of being famous, being loved and \nadored and being more than just another person who fills out the \nlandscape of urban life. \u0014\nBecause she is pregnant again, her principal comes to tell her mother \nthat Precious is not going to be allowed back to school  and this is \ndone through the housing project intercom in Harlem. Mother is not \nupset about the dismissal. She assaults Precious for not going to the \nwelfare office to get more money for the coming of the new baby. She \nmakes it clear that Precious is nothing more than dumb and stupid. \u0014\n\u0014\nPrecious' world is one of secrets. She does not tell anyone what has \nbrought her to this state of living. Telling the secret would only \nincrease the abuse. Precious walks through the world with no hope, \nbeing nothing more than a slave to an abuser who gave birth to her. \nHuman life, in her world, is not worth anything. Failure to buy the \ndaily lottery ticket is grounds for violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Precious gets released from school, she is given an opportunity \nto attend an alternative school. There she meets Ms. Rain (Paula \nPatton), who begins to shine the light of hope into the darkness of \nPrecious' life. Ms. Rain learns that Precious is illiterate and \nstarts teaching her how to read and write. \u0014\nBut it's the social worker (Mariah Carey) who discovers the secrets. \nShe learns of the abuse that Precious lives in daily. It is her \nintervention that allows Precious to unburden herself and move \nforward in life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire\" is a modern retelling \nof Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple.\" When Steven Spielberg adapted \nit into a movie, it produced many of today's stars. Whoopi Goldberg \nand Oprah Winfrey came out of that film. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis movie is bringing two wonderful performers to the attention of \nthe movie-going public. Gabourey Sidibe plays Precious with all the \npain that was required for this demanding role, yet with pathos that \ngrabs the audience. Surely she will be nominated for best actress \ncome Oscar time. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Mo'Nique will be nominated for best supporting actress. There is \nno greater villain in film than her portrayal of the damaged, but so \nevil, mother to Precious. \u0014\n\u0014\nA final word is in order. This movie contains a scene of incest and \nrape. It has extremely graphic language and violence. Many of us \nwould be repelled by what it reveals. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut truth is a double-edged sword. It cuts the way of righteousness, \njustice and hope. And truth cuts also in the direction of pain and \nsorrow. Both of these cuts are made here. The truth is told, and we \nneed to see it if we have the will to witness it. \u0014\n\u0014\nMike Parnell is pastor of Beth Car Baptist Church in Halifax, Va.\u0014",

The \ngirl, who had been plagued by severe health problems since her birth \non April 30, 2006, weighed 18 pounds when she died, according to the \ncomplaint. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Brett-Pierce repeatedly struck the girl with a belt and a video \nbox at their home on Madison Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the \ncomplaint said, citing a witness account. The mother lashed the girl \nto a bed with twine and forced her to take blue sleeping pills, the \ncomplaint added. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls body was emaciated and covered with bruises on her head, \ntorso and limbs, and ligature marks were found on her feet, \napparently from where her mother affixed them to the beds footboard \nwith twine, the complaint said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn interviews with detectives, Ms. Brett-Pierce admitted tying the \ngirl down on Wednesday, because the child was wild, Tracey Downing, \nan assistant district attorney, said at Ms. Brett-Pierces \narraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother said she tied the child because the child got up at night \nand ate from the refrigerator and made a mess, Ms. Downing said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe abuse took place when, in the opinion of a physician for the \nmedical examiners office, the girls state of malnutrition put her \nat a grave risk of death, the complaint said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an arraignment that lasted about 10 minutes, Ms. Brett-Pierce \nstood silently, dressed in a hooded white sweat shirt, blue jeans and \nwhite sneakers. She clasped her hands behind her back. At one point, \nshe smiled and waved to her mother, Loretta, and to her brother, \nBrian Colas, who sat together in the courtroom. Her mother waved \nback. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe case is still under investigation by law enforcement and medical \nauthorities, as well as by the citys Administration for Childrens \nServices, which had been monitoring the family since at least \nNovember, officials said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Brett-Pierces lawyer, George Sheinberg, pointed out that his \nclient had not been charged with homicide and said she should be \nreleased on her own recognizance. But Judge Leonard P.

    "title": "1ST MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON",
    "words": "October 8, 451 \u0014\n1st Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" he \nreceived a multitude of answers. Some said he was John the Baptist, \nsome said he was Elijah or Jeremiah or another one of the prophets. \nThe disciple Peter came up with the correct answer when he said, \"You \nare the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" The early Christians \naccepted Peter's confession, but they had many different ideas of \nexactly what it meant for Jesus to be the Christ. What was Jesus' \nreal nature and person like? How was he related to God and to the \nFather? To what degree was he truly human? There were many debates \nover these issues in the fourth through the sixth centuries of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Constantine became emperor of the Roman Empire and made \nChristianity a legal religion, he believed unity of the Church was \nimportant to the political strength of the empire. So, in 325 he \ncalled a Council at Nicea to settle disputes over the nature of \nChrist. The council issued the Nicene Creed, agreeing that Christ was \nboth man and God and that as the Son of God he had the same divine \nnature as the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce it was accepted that Jesus was both fully God and fully man, \ndebates began to rage over how Christ's deity was related to his \nhumanity. One group, the Apollinarians, said the divine Word of \nChrist took the place of Jesus' human mind and will so that his \ndivine nature was always predominant. Others argued back that if \nJesus did not have a human mind and will he could not be fully human. \nYet another group argued that at the incarnation the divine and human \nwere so combined in the person of Christ as to produce a new, unique \nindividual. Others again thought that the divine and human natures of \nJesus were kept so separate that it was almost like he was two \npersons. Very often each conflicting group became associated with a \nparticular city - Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, Constantinople, so that \npolitical rivalry became entangled in theological debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 450, Emperor Theodosius died from a fall off his horse and \nhis brother-in-law Marcian ascended the imperial throne. Spurred by \nhis wife, the Empress Pulcheria, one of Marcian's first acts was to \ncall a church council to deal with some of these religious problems. \nHe hoped for religious unity as a support to the political unity of \nthe empire -- a political unity to face the growing military threat \nfrom the east. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, October 8, 451, the largest of all church councils \nopened at Chalcedon, near Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Five or \nsix hundred bishops were present representing the many conflicting \nviews found within the church. After much debate, on the 22nd of \nOctober, a Chalcedonian creed was adopted which re-affirmed the \ndivine and human natures of Christ recognized at Nicea and further \nstated that the two natures of Christ were \"without confusion, \nwithout conversion, without severance, and without division.\" Jesus \nwas affirmed as being both fully divine and human. His two natures \nwere combined in one person without his becoming less divine or less \nhuman. The work Christ did was the work of his whole person, not of \none nature or another. In that day Pope Leo stated the Chalcedonian \nposition that in Christ the \"lowliness of man and the majesty of God \nperfectly pervade one another...the two natures make only one person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Egyptian, Turkish and eastern Christians could not bring \nthemselves to accept the Chalcedon Creed, but it has been accepted by \nthe Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. \nThe Chalcedon Creed is an important basic statement on the nature and \nperson of Christ, but even this creed which has stood for centuries \ncannot fathom fully the wondrous depths and mystery of Christ's \nperson and nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

D. and Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen, on this day, March 17, 1737, the Charitable Irish Society of \nBoston held a St. Patrick's Day celebration, it seems to have been \nthe first in America. Since then, St. Patrick's Day celebrations \nacross the United States have been full of leprechauns, the wearing \nof the green, and the celebration of all things Irish. In all the fun \nand frolic, the true Patrick (who probably died between 455 and 493) \ncan easily be forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\nDates and details in Patrick's life are not known with certainty. He \nwas most likely born between 372 and 390, possibly near present day \nGlasgow, Scotland. His parents, Calpurniun and Conchessa, were \nleaders of the Christian community in the still unidentified village \nof Bannavem Taburniae. Patrick did not take the Christianity of his \nparents seriously and enjoyed having fun with his friends. One day, \nwhen he was sixteen, he was amusing himself near the sea when Irish \npirates captured him. They sold Patrick as a slave to an Irish \nchieftain named Milchu. His job? To care for the chief's sheep.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlone in the fields with the sheep, Patrick remembered the \nChristianity of his parents, and he accepted it as his own. He later \nwrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nI was sixteen years old and knew not the true God; but in that \nstrange land the Lord opened my unbelieving eyes, and although late I \ncalled my sins to mind, and was converted with my whole heart to the \nLord my God, who regarded my estate, had pity on my youth and \nignorance, and consoled me as a father consoles his children...The \nlove of God increased more and more in me with faith and the fear of \nHis name. The Spirit urged me to such a degree that I poured forth as \nmany as a hundred prayers in one day. And even during the night, in \nthe forests and on the mountains where I kept my flock, the rain, and \nsnow, and suffering which I endured, excited me to seek after God...\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years later, Patrick managed to escape and returned to his \nfamily. In a dream, he saw Irish children pleading with him to bring \nthe Gospel to them. \"O holy youth, come back to Erin, and walk once \nmore amongst us.\" His heart longed to return to his former captors \nand share with them the gospel of Jesus Christ. He trained for the \nministry and returned to Ireland where, despite fierce opposition, he \nspread the story of Jesus among the pagan tribes in the Irish \nlanguage he had learned while a slave.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the seventh through the ninth century, legends and myths \ngathered around Patrick's name. The best-known is that he drove the \nsnakes from Ireland. From the start, he was regarded as a saint and \nhas long been venerated as the patron saint of Ireland. His feast is \nheld on this day, March 17.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D. and from Glimpses #75.\u0014\nMoran, Patrick Francis Cardinal. \"Patrick, St.\" The Catholic \nEncyclopedia.

    "title": "\"FOR THE DOGS\" HAS A WHOLE NEW MEANING",
    "words": "By ANDREW MARTIN\u0014\nPublished: June 4, 2011 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans spent $55 billion on pets last year (2010).\u0014\n\u0014\nLISA CORNISH is rattling off todays menu: \u0014\n\u0014\nPan-seared duck with brown rice and blueberry compote. \u0014\n\u0014\nRoasted turkey with butternut squash and russet potatoes. \u0014\n\u0014\nSalmon with black-and-white quinoa. \u0014\n\u0014\nDelish. Just keep in mind that all of this, right down to those \nbanana and yogurt health bars, is dog food. Not mere Alpo, mind you  \nnot by a long shot. And to prove it, Ms. Cornish, who works for a \ncompany called Petcurean Pet Nutrition, will give you a taste. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf youre wondering why anyone would even consider noshing on dog \nchow, you havent been to the Global Pet Expo here, where the \nimpresarios of Americas thriving, multibillion-dollar pet economy \nprofitably ply their wares. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf there is a pet heaven, this could be it. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven as the economy for us humans bogs down again, the pet economy \nhas proved remarkably resilient to a weak housing market, high \nunemployment and those diminished 401(k)s. The industry has \ncontinued to grow through the recession, albeit at a slower pace, and \nlast year, Americans spent a record $55 billion on their pets, \naccording to the market research firm Packaged Facts, more than the \ngross domestic product of Belarus. \u0014\n\u0014\nWherever the stock market goes  and lately, it has been going down  \nthis nation seems to be in the thrall of a great bull market for \npets. And high-priced, human grade pet food is only the beginning. \u0014\n\u0014\nPet owners, or parents in industry parlance, are being sold on \nhuman-style luxuries and medical care. There are stylish rain \nslickers, organic foods and even antidepressants for todays pampered \ncats and dogs. If more evidence of this boom were needed, consider \nNeuticles, prosthetic testicles for neutered dogs and cats, at about \n$1,000 a pair, which, their designers say, help your pet to retain \nhis natural look, self esteem and aids in the trauma associated with \naltering. \u0014\n\u0014\nMake no mistake: this is big business, as a visit to the Pet Expo \nhere shows. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver at one booth, Debbie Bohlken, owner of Claudias Canine Cuisine, \nsits behind a table of brightly-decorated cookies and cakes that \nwouldnt look out of place in a bakery. All of these treats are for \ndogs. She sells her products under the slogan: Treat Her Like the \nBitch She Really Is. \u0014\n\u0014\nWill you try one? she asks. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer dog biscuits, it turns out, taste a bit like ginger snaps. \u0014\n\u0014\nElsewhere, manufacturers are marketing foods with ingredients worthy \nof a Michelin-starred restaurant: pheasant, freshwater trout, yaks \nmilk, organic pumpkin  the list goes on. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is much more to this than food. At the Petzlife booth, one of \nthe owners, Steve Tibbetts, explains that his oral spray is made from \nhuman-grade ingredients that keep a dogs teeth and gums healthy \nand fight dog breath. He says it works for cats, too. And apparently, \nfor people: Mr. Tibbetts sprays the stuff into his mouth. Twice. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are just ga-ga over their pets, Mr. Tibbetts says. Theyll \nspend money on their pets before they spend money on themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe growth in the pet market last year was driven in part by a 7 \npercent increase in veterinary services. Americas pet population, \nlike its human one, is living longer. Human medical technologies are \nincreasingly being used for pets. Dogs and cats owners  \nparticularly those without children at home  are taking better care \nof them, both medically and nutritionally, experts say. \u0014\n\u0014\nPet owners arent just looking to provide a home for their pets, \nsays Bob Vetere, president of the American Pet Products Association. \nThey are investing in their pets quality of life. Oftentimes they \ndo this at their own expense, cutting personal expenses, but not \nthose affecting their faithful companions.\u0014",

    "words": "June 21, 1675 \u0014\n\u0014\n1st Stone of St. Paul's, London\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly a few onlookers observed as Thomas Strong, a master mason, set \ninto place the first stone of St. Paul's that was lowered deep into \nthe earth on this day June 21, 1675. Several reasons have been \nsuggested for the lack of fanfare around one of the great Cathedrals \nof Christendom. The King may have feared for his safety. He had \nrecently implemented financial measures which were unpopular in the \ncity and had caused great distress. There was also ill-will between \nthe king and Archbishop Seldon. Furthermore, there had been \nconsiderable controversy over the plans for the Cathedral. Any of \nthese considerations may have been sufficient to account for the \nsilence with which the work be\u0014\n\u0014\nOld St. Paul's burned down in the great London fire of 1666. It had \nbeen in bad repair, and various sin taxes were applied to efforts at \nrestoration under architect Inigo Jones. In time the idea of \nrestoration gave way to replacement. King Charles II appointed \nChristopher Wren chief architect of a rebuilding project. Although he \nhad no formal training as an architect, Wren was a genius who \ncontributed to many sciences and built several public works. Wren's \nsimple and elegant proposals were fiercely contested by a committee \nwhich designed a monstrosity.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Wren, a practical man, agreed to the committee's \nplan--with the stipulation that he be allowed to make such \nmodifications as would prove necessary during the actual \nconstruction. He modified continuously with the result that the \nfinished work closely resembled his own original design! This miffed \nthe committee and eventually led to him being sacked.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn extraordinary coincidence occurred during the rebuilding. When \nWren began laying out the shape of his proposed dome, he called a \nworkman to bring him a bit of stone. The workman grabbed the first \npiece that came to hand. Inscribed on it in Latin was the word, \nResurgam. -- \"May I Rise Again.\" St. Paul's rose swiftly. Few \ncathedrals are built in a lifetime. Wren completed the project in \njust 35 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Wren, a staunch Protestant, the preaching of the gospel was the \nprimary function of a church; and he designed the interior so that \nthe pulpit would be the center of attention. He forbade his workmen \nto curse on the project, reminding them, on pain of dismissal, that \nthey were engaged in a holy work. After his death Christopher Wren \nwas entombed within the Cathedral. On his commemoration stone is \nwritten: Si monumentum requiris, circumspice. -- \"If you would see \nhis monument, look around.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an interesting historical sidelight, German efforts to destroy the \ncathedral by bombing in World War II never succeeded. It became a \nsymbol of faith for the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, John, \"Sir Christopher Wren,\" in One Hundred Great Lives.

    "title": "1ST OF MANY GEORGE WHITEFIELD SERMONS",
    "words": "June 27, 1736 \u0014\n\u0014\n1st of Many George Whitefield Sermons\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Whitefield made it his business to find salvation for his \nsoul. He joined a group of like-minded men, the Holy Club, to which \nJohn and Charles Wesley also belonged, and exceeded the other members \nin zeal and good works. He was a familiar visitor of prisoners. For \nlong hours he studied religious works. He fasted until his health \nbroke. He prayed on his knees under a hedge in the cold. For all his \nhard work his soul was unsatisfied.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would have despaired, except he felt the Lord had promised him he \nwould yet be saved. The Wesleys sailed to Georgia on a futile \nmission. They, too, would find peace only when their hearts were \nwarmed by the Holy Spirit. This did not come about until each \nrecognized that salvation was by grace, a free gift through Jesus \nChrist rather than by works. To live a life of faith was to be born \nagain; it was to be \"in\" Christ and have Christ in oneself. Once \nWhitefield grasped this, peace flooded his heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned to school, pouring out this truth to others. As his \nhealth recovered, he trained toward being ordained so that he could \nenter full-time ministry. His efforts at private evangelism \ncontinued. What before had been labor was now an act of joy. But as \nordination neared, he trembled. Despite having studied the scriptures \nline by line on his knees, he felt unprepared. As the day for \nordination approached, he found relief in prayer. In May he was \npublicly examined by men who desired to embarrass him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Benson believed Whitefield was the kind of man the church \nneeded. To quiet the young man's mind, he promised there would be no \npublic examination at his ordination. June 20, 1736 came. \"I \nattempted to behave with unaffected devotion, suitable to the \ngreatness of the office I was to undertake.\" He read over Paul's \nadvice to Timothy and determined to let no one to despise him for his \nyouth.\u0014\n\u0014\nA week later, on this day, June 27th, 1736, Whitefield preached his \nfirst sermon. He took as his topic the need for Christians to help \none another. At first he was awkward, for his mother, his brothers \nand sisters, and many who had known him as a youngster were in the \naudience. As he proceeded, the Spirit filled him. Those who came to \nlisten were so moved by the authority of his words that parishioners \ncomplained to the bishop that some had gone \"mad.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield himself wrote, \"Glory! Glory! Glory! be ascribed to an \nAlmighty Triune God.\" He went on to preach thousands more powerful \nsermons. He became a force in the Great Awakening which brought fresh \nlife to America's churches. His last sermon was preached in 1770. He \nwas then desperately ill but, mounting a barrel, urged his listeners \nto examine themselves whether they were in the faith. To be saved, \nthey must be born again, he urged. The following morning he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniels, W. H. Illustrated History of Methodism. New York: Hunt and \nEaston, 1890.

Saturninus ignored him and addressed \nthe other Christians. \"Don't share his folly!\" he urged them. But the \nothers (five were women) responded as firmly as Speratus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCittinus said, \"We have no other to fear, save only our Lord God, who \nis in heaven.\" Donata added, \"Honor Caesar as Caesar; but it is God \nwe fear.\" Vestia declared, \"I am a Christian.\" Secunda assured the \nproconsul, \"What I am, that I wish to be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSaturninus turned back to Speratus. \"Do you persist in being a \nChristian?\" he asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nSperatus never wavered. \"I am a Christian,\" he replied, and all the \nothers agreed with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaturninus offered them time to reconsider.

When he saw that they would not bend, he read his \ndecision from a tablet.

    "title": "127 HOURS - STORY OF ARON ALSTON",
    "words": "The film 127 Hours tells the true story of then 27-year-old Aron \nRalston. In 2003, while hiking in Blue John Canyon in Utah, Ralston \nwas trapped by a chockstone that pinned his right arm to one wall of \na crevice. After surviving for five days on 500 ml of water and \nexhausting all other options, he fashioned a homemade tourniquet and \nwith a blunt pocket tool cut off his arm and stumbled out of the \ncanyon to find help.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one level, this film sounds like just another gory action movie, \nbut more deeply, this film explores what it means to love. At the \nbeginning of the film, Aron barrels into the canyon, music blaring in \nhis headphones. He arrives there after ignoring phone calls from his \nmom and sister and brushing aside his boss' queries about where he \nwas headed. Ralston acts like a completely self-centered loner, \nincessantly snapping pictures of himself and flirting with girls he \nmeets on the trail. Clearly, Ralston doesn't need or want anyone else \nin his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut by the end of the film, he's motivated to fight for his life by a \nmemory of his ex-girlfriend looking at him with a mixture of pain and \npity and saying, \"You're going to be so lonely, Aron.\" At the time, \nhe wanted the loneliness, savoring freedom from entanglements. But \nremembering her love and thinking about the possibility of starting a \nfamily provides the motivation to pull out his pocket knife. He \nrealizes he's made a terrible mistake by isolating himself, and he \nwants another chance to live differently. So he cuts off his arm and \nescapes to freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of the film, when Aron has made it out of the canyon and \nis on the trail with his severed arm, he sees some other hikers a \nlittle way ahead. Barely audible at first he says, \"Help me.\" Then, \nbellowing hoarsely, he cries out, \"Please Help Me!\" The hikers hear \nhim, and turn around puzzled. Then, seeing what's happened, they come \nrunning.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's when Aron asks for help that the film reaches its climax. \n\"Please help me\" is itself a form of \"I love you.\" The two cries \nbelong together. Ralston's vulnerability, his plea for rescue, is \nwhat leads him back into the arms of his family, back into \nrelationships with people, back to love.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Wesley Hill, \"Love Is a Cry for Help,\" Critique \n(2011:2), pp. 14-15\u0014",

    "words": "10 THINGS I WISH CHURCH LEADERS KNEW ABOUT DIVORCE\u0014\nAugust 23, 2018\u0014\nBy Laura Petherbridge \u0014\n\u0014\nApril 7, 1984 was the worst day of my life. It was the day my \nmarriage died.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy husband was having an affair, and he no longer wanted to be \nmarried. No amount of crying, begging, promising, or counseling could \nchange his mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was a new Christian when we divorced, but I knew enough to ask God \nto use the trauma, shame, and agony to help others. Over the last 34 \nyears, thats exactly what He has done.\u0014\nDivorce is a difficult subject for the church. Im not called to be a \ntheologian, but Im certain we dont want to ignore Gods commands or \ngive the impression that marriage is temporary.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce also has severe, long-term consequences. No one comprehends \nthat better than I do.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are 10 aspects of divorce Id like to share with church leaders \nto help them love the brokenhearted while not condoning divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE IS A DEATH\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of the circumstances, divorce signifies the fatality of \nthe marriage vow. Its the death of the dream, the breaking of the \ncovenant, and the ending of what should have been.\u0014\nIt often feels as if death would have been easier because death is \nnatural and doesnt carry the shame.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE IS A SOUL-ENTRENCHED BETRAYAL\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a rejection like no other. The person you thought would be your \nlifetime partner, your soft place to fall when the rest of the world \nabandons you decides, I never loved you. You arent worth it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE HAS NO CLOSURE\u0014\n\u0014\nA divorced person experiences the loss and the humiliation over and \nover and over every time you check the single or divorced box on \na form or your child cries for the other parent.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE IS A GUT-LEVEL ACCUSER\u0014\n\u0014\nNight and day, the spousal rejection hauntingly whispers, You are a \nloser. You are unlovable. You are a failure. You deserve to be alone. \nLife is over. You will never be loved again.\u0014\nSatan loves divorce. Its a superb weapon of soul-deep destruction.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE BECOMES AN IDENTITY\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most humiliating tasks for me was being labeled divorced \nrather than married. Being labeled a single never bothered me. But \ndivorced tattooed an imaginary red D on my forehead, which can \nseem synonymous with failure, reject, or ugly.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took a long time, great friends, and a terrific church to help me \nrecognize that divorce was something I experienced. It was an \neventnot my identity. God still sees me as His precious daughter, \none purchased and healed by Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE TAKES ONLY ONE, WHEN MARRIAGE TAKES TWO\u0014\n\u0014\nJust because the sin of divorce has occurred, it doesnt mean both \nspouses have sinned in this way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere might be only one who is involved in addiction, adultery, \nabuse, pornography, anger issues, gambling, deception, drugs, \nhomosexuality, mental illness, outrageous spending, or unwillingness \nto work.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne spouse can destroy the marriage, no matter how hard the other is \ntrying.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE ISNT ALWAYS INITIATED BY THE GUILTY PARTY\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter 34 years in divorce recovery ministry, Ive found that the men \nand women who didnt want to be divorced are often the ones to \nlegally file. These are individuals married to someone who doesnt \nlove them, the kids, or God enough to do the hard work to keep the \nmarriage alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the culpable one doesnt want the guilt associated with divorce, \nso he or she will often withhold money, child support, visitation, \netc. to force the other spouse into taking legal action. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat way they can sayand manipulate others into believingI didnt \nfile for divorcemy ex did.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE CAUSES THOSE AFFECTED TO DREAD SUNDAYS\u0014\n\u0014\nWalking into church witnessing all the nice families and loving \ncouples was a stark reminder of just how abandoned I was. Sundays \nwere often dreaded days I just needed to survive.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo depressed to visit friends and exhausted from flashing my perfect \nIm fine smile, I collapsed at home.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would spend most of the day crying. I could barely pray, so I sat \nby my stereo and sang worship songs, begging God to heal my tormented \nheart.\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE CAN STRENGTHEN AND WEAKEN FAITH \u0014\n\u0014\nAs previously mentioned, I was a new Christian when my divorce \noccurred. On one hand, I knew Jesus was the only One who could carry \nme through the horror.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, the feelings of failure, humiliation, shame and \nloss enticed me to run back to my former life and anesthetize the \ntrauma with alcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\nI seriously contemplated suicide to stop the madness. My life was \nhanging by a thread. I teetered between running to Jesus and running \naway from Him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, my heavenly Father wooed me back into His loving \nembrace. He became the faithful Husband I had lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe declared, I will make you my wife forever, showing you \nrighteousness and justice, unfailing love and compassion. I will be \nfaithful to you and make you mine, and you will finally know me as \nthe Lord (Hosea 2:19-20 NLT).\u0014\n\u0014\nDIVORCE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHURCH TO REACH THE BROKEN \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause I was such a young Christian, and in a smaller church, I \ndidnt realize that not everyone has a pastor to run to for advice.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow that Ive spoken and taught in many denominations and churches, I \nrealize how uniquely blessed I was. My pastor provided sound biblical \nadvice. He didnt encourage me to divorce, but he also didnt ignore \nmy husbands ongoing sin.\u0014",

    "words": "US Missionary Killed by Worlds Most Isolated Tribe\u0014\n \u0014\nHe returned to the prohibited island even after being shot: It's \nworth it to declare Jesus to these people.\u0014\nKate Shellnutt November 21, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\n27-year-old American missionary was killed on a remote island off the \ncoast of India, where he attempted to share the gospel with the most \nisolated tribe in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Nations, a Christian missions agency based in the US, confirmed \nthat John Allen Chau traveled to North Sentinel Island after years of \nstudy and training to evangelize its small indigenous population, who \nremain almost entirely untouched by modern civilization.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to news reports based on Chaus journal entries, the Oral \nRoberts University graduate shouted, My name is John, and I love you \nand Jesus loves you, to Sentinelese tribesmen armed with bows and \narrows. He fled to a fishing boat when they shot at him during his \ninitial visit, with one arrow piercing his Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young missionary did not survive a follow-up trip on November 17.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou guys might think Im crazy in all this but I think its worth it \nto declare Jesus to these people, the native of Washington state \nwrote the day before in a letter to his parents obtained by the Daily \nMail. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndian police have not retrieved the young missionarys body and, \nsince contact with the indigenous tribes in the Andaman and Nicobar \narchipelago is prohibited, cannot prosecute his murderers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sentinelese were known to refuse outside contact and attack \nanyone who stepped on their island.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome have declared Chau a martyr and compared him to Jim Elliot, who \nwas famously killed at age 28 while attempting to evangelize an \nisolated indigenous group in Ecuador.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was a gracious and sensitive ambassador of Jesus Christ who \nwanted others to know of Gods great love for them, said Mary Ho, \ninternational executive leader of All Nations, which says it trains \nand supports 150 missionaries in 31 countries, including India.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we grieve for our friend, and pray for all those who mourn his \ndeath, we also know that he would want us to pray for those who may \nhave been responsible for his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was Chaus third visit to the Andaman and Nicobar island chain. \nIts police chief called his recent trip misplaced adventure, but \nhis family and friends insist that he knowingly violated protocol to \nenter the dangerous territory for the sake of sharing the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis alma mater, ORU, released the following statement on Wednesday: \nOral Roberts University alumni have gone to the uttermost bounds of \nthe earth for the last 50 years bringing hope and healing to \nmillions. We are not surprised that John would try to reach out to \nthese isolated people in order to share Gods love. We are deeply \nsaddened to hear of his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to All Nations, Chau joined their organization last year, \nafter serving on mission in Iraq, Kurdistan, and South Africa. The \nagency described him as a seasoned traveler who was well-versed in \ncross-cultural issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis family posted a tribute on Instagram, saying they forgive those \nresponsible for killing Chau and requesting that charges be dropped \nagainst the fishermen accused of endangering his life by helping \ntransport him to North Sentinel Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Joshua Project, a ministry dedicated to tracking unreached ethnic \ngroups, reports that little is known about the Sentinelese due to \ntheir isolation and hostility, but asks supporters to Pray that the \nIndian Government will allow Christians to earn the trust of the \nSentinelese people, and that they will be permitted to live among \nthem.\u0014",

Dubrovsky added that the baby managed to stay alive because \nhe was in a crib.\u0014\n\u0014\nRussian health ministry says the baby is in an \"extremely serious\" \ncondition.

    "title": "5 THINGS PROTESTANTS CAN LEARN FROM EASTERN ORTHODOXY",
    "words": "5 things Protestant churches in the U.S. can learn from Eastern \nOrthodoxy\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrey Shirin  |  April 25, 2019    Baptist Global News\u0014\n\u0014\nEaster has come, and the season of Eastertide has arrived.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Western Christianity, that is. Eastern Christianity, which \noperates on a different liturgical calendar, observes Holy Week this \nweek and celebrates Easter this Sunday, a week later than churches in \nWestern Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe difference in liturgical calendars at this season of the church \nyear provides an opportunity to consider some lessons for American \nProtestantism from the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christendom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeauty is viewed as essential to all dimensions of Christian \nspirituality, and this value is reflected in Orthodox places of \nworship.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of demographic trends, Orthodox churches in the U.S. share \nsimilarities with Protestant denominations, but also reflect \ninteresting contrasts. Orthodox membership is in a decline. Retention \nrates are low. Marriage rates are also falling. At the same time, the \nmost recent Americas Changing Religious Landscape study by Pew \nResearch Center found that Orthodox churches have the highest \npercentage of members ages 18 to 29 among all Christian groups. \nOrthodox Christianity is tied with Mormons for the highest percentage \nof adherents ages 30 to 59. On average, Orthodox are the most highly \neducated Christians. Interestingly, even though Eastern Orthodoxy is \nlargely the antithesis to the Prosperity Gospel, Americas Orthodox \nare the wealthiest Christians on a per capita basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are five things Baptists and other Protestants can learn from \nOrthodox Christianity:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Tailoring worship style to popular culture is overrated.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many American Protestant churches, it has become almost an \narticle of faith that worship style needs to match popular culture. \nThis is an effort to ensure that unchurched people can relate to \nChristian worship. That may be convincing for many church and \ndenominational leaders, but does experience corroborate this \nwidespread notion? While many Protestant congregations bend over \nbackwards to fit their worship to popular tastes and trends, many of \nthese churches are no longer growing. Orthodox churches do not even \nuse any musical instruments in worship, yet they still have the \nhighest percentage of adults under 30 among their adherents compared \nto other Christian groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Life is liturgical.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiturgy, the Eastern Orthodox term for worship, has Greek origins and \nliterally means work of the people. A major purpose is to form \nhabits that facilitate a life of faith that is meaningful and good. \nOne does not need to understand all the fine points of Orthodox \nliturgy to realize that our daily activities mold us. James Smith, a \nCalvinist theologian influenced by Eastern Orthodox thought, reminds \nus that even the most casual or ordinary activities, such as going to \na shopping mall, attending a sporting event or just hanging out with \nfriends, contribute to our character formation. A better awareness of \nthis contribution can make us more selective regarding the activities \nwe engage in and more intentional about shaping our character. This \nawareness can shape our spiritual formation, which, in turn, may make \nour churches more vital.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Images matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn its zeal to combat idolatry, much of Western Christianity removed \nimages, statuary and art from its churches. Eastern Orthodox \nChristians chose a different path. Icons reflect what the Christian \nlife is like, and one does not need to venerate them in order to \nrealize the importance of images for worship and spiritual formation. \nAmerican Christians are constantly bombarded by secular images of the \ngood life on television, in magazines and on social media, not to \nmention shopping centers. We need to be cognizant of the power of \nimages and look for ways to use art and other imagery in our worship \nand spiritual formation programs.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. So does beauty.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, Protestants do not have a \nmajor female figure to venerate. Although many Protestant churches in \nthe U.S. recognize the importance of art, aesthetics largely remains \nan acquired language. Often the importance of art is limited to its \npotential to evangelize, and that seems to lessen the value of \nChristian art in the eyes of the wider public. Not so in the Orthodox \ntradition. Beauty is viewed as essential to all dimensions of \nChristian spirituality, and this value is reflected in Orthodox \nplaces of worship. Orthodox Christianity understands that human \nnature yearns for the beautiful. An appreciation for beauty permeates \nEastern cultures as well as Eastern Christianity. Many Protestant \nchurches in the U.S. need to be more purposeful about making our \nspaces beautiful.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Its not Jesus and me; its Jesus and all of us, living and dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nMe and Jesus got our own thing going; me and Jesus got it all worked \nout, says a popular evangelical song. This individualistic mindset, \nwhich seems to reflect much of American Protestantism, relegates the \nchurch to secondary importance after individual salvation. If me and \nJesus, in this order, have it all worked out, it is not clear why we \nneed our brothers and sisters (or even our pastors and other \nministers). The link between this mentality and empty pews on Sunday \nmornings seems apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, this individualistic ethos is quite alien to Eastern \nOrthodox spirituality. According to Orthodox teaching, attending \nworship is essential for salvation, which has a robust communal \ndimension. In addition, liturgy is a place where not only the living \nare present, but the souls of the dead are also there, strengthening \nworshippers in their journey of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne does not need to share Orthodox dogma to realize that giving due \nrecognition to the communal dimension and other strengths of \nChristian faith and worship in Orthodox Christianity can have a \npositive influence on Protestant churches in America. Perhaps more \ndialogue between leaders of these two traditions could prove fruitful \nfor both.\u0014\nIn the meantime, it seems we Baptists and other Protestants can \naffirm again the joyous refrain of Christ is risen! with our \nOrthodox sisters and brothers as they celebrate the resurrection this \nSunday.\u0014",

    "title": "5 THINGS ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS CAN LEARN FROM PROTESTANTS",
    "words": "5 things Orthodox Christians can learn from Protestants in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nJOHN BISHAY  |  MAY 16, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days following Orthodox Christianitys celebration of Easter \non April 28, I read an interesting and honest commentary by Andrey \nShirin suggesting 5 things Protestant churches can learn from \nOrthodoxy. In the spirit of ecumenism, I was moved to respond with my \nequally honest list of 5 things Orthodox Christians can learn from \nProtestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it may seem like we are on opposite ends of the Christian \nspectrum, we are many times surprised by how much we have in common. \nIn this season of resurrection, it becomes easier to remember and \nfocus on what really makes a Christian a Christian. We are filled \nwith joy at the remembrance of Christs sacrifice and triumphant \nvictory over death.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrioritizing open dialogue and mutual respect in the future will help \nus realize Christs ultimate prayer for unity that they may be one \njust as we are one (John 17:22). With that hope in mind, heres my \nlist:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Keeping it simple\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Christian groups are susceptible to legalizing the Christian \nfaith or worship practices. As an Orthodox Christian, I deeply value \nthat our tradition has handed down thousands of years worth of \nsymbolic rituals intended to help us focus our attention on Christ \nand his saving sacrifice. Things like vestments, hymnology, incense, \ncandles, icons and prescribed prayers were handed down to constantly \nkeep our bodies and minds on the Holy Trinity. In the Old Testament, \nGod was very meticulous with how He wanted Israel to worship Him. \nFurther, we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and \nforever (Hebrews 13:8) and that God is not the author of disorder \nbut of peace, as in all the churches of the saints (1 Corinthians \n14:33).\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, having all of these beautiful symbols and reminders makes it \neasier for a very small minority to legalize Orthodox worship and \nsalvation. While Christ did give us a new set of commandments and \nguidelines for worship and attaining salvation, a small group of the \nOrthodox take a very Pharisaic approach to the law; this ends up \nturning off many of the rest of us while making religion hard and \nconfusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile deciding what traditions and forms of worship are necessary is \na difficult and often controversial discussion, Protestantism took a \nfresh approach that was able to refocus on what was really important. \nIf the Orthodox took a similar approach, it would be easier for those \nwho are struggling with the notion of salvation to have peace of mind \nand be able to focus on the basics that lead to salvation and unity \nwith God.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo clarify, I am not claiming that tradition is evil or irrelevant \njust because some have misused it. Christ told the Pharisees that \nthe Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath (Mark \n2:27), showing that there was a correct way and wrong way to practice \nthe Sabbath, tradition and the law. I am just pointing out that we \ncan learn from our Protestant brothers and sisters how to keep things \nsimple enough while focusing primarily on our relationship with God \nand others.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Commitment to the centrality of Scripture\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the first point, many Protestants will claim that the \nOrthodox and Catholic churches lack in reading and understanding the \nBible. This perception is not fully accurate. Many Orthodox churches \nhold weekly Bible studies, Scripture is read at every service, our \nChurch Fathers from the early centuries of Christianity wrote \nthousands of volumes of commentary on Scripture, and almost \neverything we do can be traced back to biblical passages.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it pains me to say that behind this stereotype is a sliver \nof truth. While most Orthodox memorize, highlight, and understand the \nBible in their everyday lives, some assume that they can replace the \nBible with liturgical worship and extra-biblical reading. This point \nis not fought for hard enough, and the emphasis on making sure these \nthings complement Bible reading instead of replacing it seems too \napparent at times to make.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Bible is not our only source, it is by far the primary and \nmain source of Gods word in our lives, and nothing can replace it. A \nmore Protestant-like dedication to studying and applying the Bible \nwhile using Orthodox resources would immensely benefit the Orthodox \nchurch and the lives of Orthodox Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Hospitality and approachability \u0014\n\u0014\nI hate to keep clarifying, but I want to reiterate how this point \ndoes not by any means apply to all Orthodox churches. Many Orthodox \nChristians view their spiritual lives as a constant and serious \nbattle (which it can be), but some of us sometimes forget that our \nmost powerful weapon in such a battle is love, because Love never \nfails (1 Corinthians 13:8). We can be so focused on our prayer rules \nand our personal relationships with God, that we forget that He \ncommanded us to love others precisely to grow closer to Him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe put on a stern face, close our eyes in services and scold anyone \nwho opens their mouth inside a church building. While the liturgy \ndemands a certain kind of reverence and respect, it should not be at \nthe expense of the primary commandment of love.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis sternness or strictness can lead many to feel unwelcome or \njudged, even without being spoken to. While things like the truth and \nchurch attendance should not be contingent on how people make you \nfeel inside a church building, and while a stern glance should not be \nenough to make you question your whole faith, expressing love towards \nothers, instead of containing it and only expressing it towards God, \nwould help make Orthodox churches not only physically beautiful, but \nalso even more spiritually beautiful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis sense of hospitality and approachability is found in most \nProtestant churches. If any one of us were to walk into one, we would \nimmediately feel welcomed and loved. Again, many Orthodox churches do \na fantastic job with this and the purpose of going to church is not \nto feel good while drawing attention away from the worship of God. \nHowever, being loving and approachable should be true for our lives \nat all times outside the church, while also maintaining our attention \nand reverence for what happens inside the church building.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Priority on evangelizing \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Orthodox churches are found in almost every culture around the \nworld, it is apparent that our spiritual ancestors were a lot more \nadept at preaching and evangelizing than we are. It is evident that \nwe have fallen short of this standard today as there is still a large \nportion of the population that has no idea what Orthodox Christianity \nis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of this can be attributed to societal circumstances. As a Coptic \nOrthodox Christian, it is easy for me to see why we have become \napathetic in reaching out to others. Our history involves things like \ngetting our tongues cut off if we spoke in our original Coptic \ndialect during initial Muslim occupation in Egypt. It would be hard, \ncoming from this type of situation, to immediately be open to \npreaching and reaching out to our local communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, some Orthodox churches have no excuse to remain constrained. \nOne of Christs last and most important commandments was to Go \ntherefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in \nthe name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit \n(Matthew 28:19). It is unacceptable to ignore this commandment on the \ngrounds that you may be hyper-concentrated on your own salvation. \nLoving God is not an excuse to neglect those around you and their \nsalvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, there are many Orthodox mission churches that are dedicated to \nevangelizing and spreading the work of salvation. But assigning this \njob to only a few parishes should not be how we fulfill this \ncommandment. Many of our Protestant neighbors make this a priority in \ntheir daily lives. They preach with their loving actions and invite \nfriends and family to services and Bible studies. More Orthodox \nChristians should make this a personal priority as well, not just the \ntask of a few parishes.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Spirit of community\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a small group of Orthodox believers who admirably make the \neffort to come to church every Sunday morning to take communion no \nmatter what they may be feeling towards their fellow congregants or \neven the priest. They understand that there is something special \navailable in being at church and participating in the Eucharist. \nHowever, some treat church like a drive-thru, where they can stop by \nfor a few minutes, take communion, get their Holy Spirit fix and \nimmediately head back home to catch up on sleep.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople may choose to do this in response to the lack of hospitality \nthey feel at church and they may insist on not staying around for \npost-church coffee or meals to prove a point. However, there doesnt \nseem to be enough people advocating to include those who are subject \nto such feelings. If everyone understood that before taking communion \nyou have to be in communion with each other, we would value a sense \nof community so much more.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, those who stick around are more likely to build a \nfamily-like relationship with the rest of the church. But wanting \nmore people to be involved in this family and in church and communal \nlife seems like something that, in general, Protestant churches are \nmore focused on. We know this is what Christ and his disciples \nstrived for. This lifestyle and the inclusion of all Christians is \nfound in the early church in Acts, where they, continuing daily with \none accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did \neat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart (Acts 2:4).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, most of these issues found among only a small percentage of \nOrthodox Christians and churches can be traced back to one of two \nprimary factors: abusing tradition or neglecting communal love. An \nincreased focus on these two areas of concern will allow for a closer \nrelationship not only between Orthodox believers, but between \nOrthodox and sister Protestant churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptist News Global\u0014",

Interestingly, even though Eastern Orthodoxy is \nlargely the antithesis to the Prosperity Gospel, Americas Orthodox \nare the wealthiest Christians on a per capita basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are five things Baptists and other Protestants can learn from \nOrthodox Christianity:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Tailoring worship style to popular culture is overrated.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many American Protestant churches, it has become almost an \narticle of faith that worship style needs to match popular culture. \nThis is an effort to ensure that unchurched people can relate to \nChristian worship. That may be convincing for many church and \ndenominational leaders, but does experience corroborate this \nwidespread notion? While many Protestant congregations bend over \nbackwards to fit their worship to popular tastes and trends, many of \nthese churches are no longer growing. Orthodox churches do not even \nuse any musical instruments in worship, yet they still have the \nhighest percentage of adults under 30 among their adherents compared \nto other Christian groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Life is liturgical.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiturgy, the Eastern Orthodox term for worship, has Greek origins and \nliterally means work of the people. A major purpose is to form \nhabits that facilitate a life of faith that is meaningful and good. \nOne does not need to understand all the fine points of Orthodox \nliturgy to realize that our daily activities mold us. James Smith, a \nCalvinist theologian influenced by Eastern Orthodox thought, reminds \nus that even the most casual or ordinary \u0014\nactivities, such as going to a shopping mall, attending a sporting \nevent or just hanging out with friends, contribute to our character \nformation. A better awareness of this contribution can make us more \nselective regarding the activities we engage in and more intentional \nabout shaping our character. This awareness can shape our spiritual \nformation, which, in turn, may make our churches more vital.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Images matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn its zeal to combat idolatry, much of Western Christianity removed \nimages, statuary and art from its churches. Eastern Orthodox \nChristians chose a different path. Icons reflect what the Christian \nlife is like, and one does not need to venerate them in order to \nrealize the importance of images for worship and spiritual formation. \nAmerican Christians are constantly bombarded by secular images of the \ngood life on television, in magazines and on social media, not to \nmention shopping centers. We need to be cognizant of the power of \nimages and look for ways to use art and other imagery in our worship \nand spiritual formation programs.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. So does beauty.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, Protestants do not have a \nmajor female figure to venerate. Although many Protestant churches in \nthe U.S. recognize the importance of art, aesthetics largely remains \nan acquired language. Often the importance of art is limited to its \npotential to evangelize, and that seems to lessen the value of \nChristian art in the eyes of the wider public. Not so in the Orthodox \ntradition. Beauty is viewed as essential to all dimensions of \nChristian spirituality, and this value is reflected in Orthodox \nplaces of worship. Orthodox Christianity understands that human \nnature yearns for the beautiful. An appreciation for beauty permeates \nEastern cultures as well as Eastern Christianity. Many Protestant \nchurches in the U.S. need to be more purposeful about making our \nspaces beautiful.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Its not Jesus and me; its Jesus and all of us, living and dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nMe and Jesus got our own thing going; me and Jesus got it all worked \nout, says a popular evangelical song. This individualistic mindset, \nwhich seems to reflect much of American Protestantism, relegates the \nchurch to secondary importance after individual salvation. If me and \nJesus, in this order, have it all worked out, it is not clear why we \nneed our brothers and sisters (or even our pastors and other \nministers). The link between this mentality and empty pews on Sunday \nmornings seems apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, this individualistic ethos is quite alien to Eastern \nOrthodox spirituality. According to Orthodox teaching, attending \nworship is essential for salvation, which has a robust communal \ndimension. In addition, liturgy is a place where not only the living \nare present, but the souls of the dead are also there, strengthening \nworshippers in their journey of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne does not need to share Orthodox dogma to realize that giving due \nrecognition to the communal dimension and other strengths of \nChristian faith and worship in Orthodox Christianity can have a \npositive influence on Protestant churches in America. Perhaps more \ndialogue between leaders of these two traditions could prove fruitful \nfor both.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, it seems we Baptists and other Protestants can \naffirm again the joyous refrain of Christ is risen! with our \nOrthodox sisters and brothers as they celebrate the resurrection this \nSunday.\u0014",

    "title": "1ST MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON",
    "words": "1st Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen Jesus asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" he \nreceived a multitude of answers. Some said he was John the Baptist, \nsome said he was Elijah or Jeremiah or another one of the prophets. \nThe disciple Peter came up with the correct answer when he said, \"You \nare the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" The early Christians \naccepted Peter's confession, but they had many different ideas of \nexactly what it meant for Jesus to be the Christ. What was Jesus' \nreal nature and person like? How was he related to God and to the \nFather? To what degree was he truly human? There were many debates \nover these issues in the fourth through the sixth centuries of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Constantine became emperor of the Roman Empire and made \nChristianity a legal religion, he believed unity of the Church was \nimportant to the political strength of the empire. So, in 325 he \ncalled a Council at Nicea to settle disputes over the nature of \nChrist. The council issued the Nicene Creed, agreeing that Christ was \nboth man and God and that as the Son of God he had the same divine \nnature as the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce it was accepted that Jesus was both fully God and fully man, \ndebates began to rage over how Christ's deity was related to his \nhumanity. One group, the Apollinarians, said the divine Word of \nChrist took the place of Jesus' human mind and will so that his \ndivine nature was always predominant. Others argued back that if \nJesus did not have a human mind and will he could not be fully human. \nYet another group argued that at the incarnation the divine and human \nwere so combined in the person of Christ as to produce a new, unique \nindividual. Others again thought that the divine and human natures of \nJesus were kept so separate that it was almost like he was two \npersons. Very often each conflicting group became associated with a \nparticular city - Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, Constantinople, so that \npolitical rivalry became entangled in theological debate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 450, Emperor Theodosius died from a fall off his horse and \nhis brother-in-law Marcian ascended the imperial throne. Spurred by \nhis wife, the Empress Pulcheria, one of Marcian's first acts was to \ncall a church council to deal with some of these religious problems. \nHe hoped for religious unity as a support to the political unity of \nthe empire -- a political unity to face the growing military threat \nfrom the east. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, October 8, 451, the largest of all church councils \nopened at Chalcedon, near Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Five or \nsix hundred bishops were present representing the many conflicting \nviews found within the church. After much debate, on the 22nd of \nOctober, a Chalcedonian creed was adopted which re-affirmed the \ndivine and human natures of Christ recognized at Nicea and further \nstated that the two natures of Christ were \"without confusion, \nwithout conversion, without severance, and without division.\" Jesus \nwas affirmed as being both fully divine and human. His two natures \nwere combined in one person without his becoming less divine or less \nhuman. The work Christ did was the work of his whole person, not of \none nature or another. In that day Pope Leo stated the Chalcedonian \nposition that in Christ the \"lowliness of man and the majesty of God \nperfectly pervade one another...the two natures make only one person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Egyptian, Turkish and eastern Christians could not bring \nthemselves to accept the Chalcedon Creed, but it has been accepted by \nthe Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. \nThe Chalcedon Creed is an important basic statement on the nature and \nperson of Christ, but even this creed which has stood for centuries \ncannot fathom fully the wondrous depths and mystery of Christ's \nperson and nature.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBellitto, Christopher M.

As the boat left the mainland and \ncrossed the strait, Tennyson heard a moaning sound caused by the \nfierce beating of the waves against a large sandbar.  He recognized \nthis as a prelude to a coming storm.  A few days later his health \nbegan to fail, and a nurse was hired to stay with him.  In conversing \nwith him she said quietly, \"Sir, you've composed a great many poems, \nbut few hymns.  I wish you'd write one now on your sickbed.  I'm sure \nit would help and comfort other poor sufferers.\"\u0014\n     The next morning Tennyson handed her a scrap of paper, saying, \n\"I followed your suggestion and wrote these few verses during the \nnight.\"  The poem proved to be a masterpiece filled with imagery \nabout the sea, the emotions related to dying which the \"moaning of \nthe bar\" brought to his mind, and the glorious hope of seeing Jesus \nat the end of life's voyage.  The selection reads in part:\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Sunset and evening star\u0014\n     and one clear call for me!\u0014\n   And may there be no moaning of the bar,\u0014\n     when I put out to sea.\u0014\n  Twilight and evening bell,\u0014\n     and after that the dark!\u0014\n  And may there be no sadness of farewell,\u0014\n     when I embark.\u0014\n  For though from out the bourne of time and place\u0014\n     the flood may bear me far,\u0014\n  I hope to see my Pilot face to face\u0014\n     when I have crossed the bar.\u0014",

    "words": "A Christian physician, whose testimony and grace radiated good cheer \nto his patients, was one day suddenly taken home to be with his \nLord.  His wife, who had always been frail and sickly, was \nheartbroken by this deep loss.  She seemed to depend on the sunshine \nof his warm and vigorous personality to sustain her along the road of \nlife. The death of her precious husband left her with a profound \nfeeling of emptiness.  But as she trusted God, she also found that \nHis comfort and strength filled her heart with peace.  To express her \nconfident faith, she displayed by the doorway of her living room the \ncard her husband always posted when he left his office for a short \ntime.  It read: \"GONE OUT--BACK SOON!\"  Her grief was eased by the \ncomforting hope of Christ's return.\u0014",

    "title": "\"IN THE SWEET BY-AND-BY\"",
    "words": "The gifted Christian musician Joseph T. Webster was often tormented \nby deep feelings of depression.  On one occasion, when he was in a \nmelancholy mood, he received a visit from his close acquaintance \nFillmore Bennett.  Knowing that one way to keep Webster from brooding \nover his problems was to interest him in writing a hymn tune, Bennett \ndecided he'd try to pen some lyrics that would direct his friend's \nthoughts heavenward.  The despondent man himself unwittingly supplied \nthe theme, for when he was asked, \"What's the matter now?\" he \nreplied, \"Oh, it will be all right by and by!\"  \"That's true,\" \nexclaimed Bennett, \"trials do generate great glory for us in the \nsweet by-and-by!\" Inspired by this thought, he immediately sat down \nand wrote several poetic verses on the subject.  When his friend read \nthem, a new look of hope came into his eyes, and his whole attitude \nchanged.  After jotting down some musical notes, Webster took up his \nviolin and played the melody he had composed to fit the words.  \nWithin half an hour the enduring hymn \"In the Sweet By-and-By\" was \nborn.  It helped the musician see his trials in the light of Heaven, \nfor the lyrics read in part:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"There's land that is fairer than day,\u0014\n      And by faith we can see it afar,\u0014\n    For the Father waits over the way\u0014\n      To prepare us a dwelling-place there.\u0014\n    We shall sing on that beautiful shore\u0014\n      The melodious songs of the blest;\u0014\n    And our spirits shall sorrow no more--\u0014\n      Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.\"\u0014",

    "words": "A preacher visited Portugal some years ago on an evangelistic tour.  \nHe was delighted to find many believers who were \"spiritual giants,\" \namong them a missionary from Great Britain named Eric Barker. He had \nspent over 50 years in Portugal preaching the gospel, often under \nadverse conditions. During World War II, the situation became so \ncritical that Barker was advised to send his wife and eight children \nto England for safety.  His sister and her three children were also \nevacuated on the same ship.  Although his beloved relatives were \nforced to leave, he remained behind to carry on the work.\u0014\n\u0014\n On the Lord's Day following their departure he stood before his \ncongregation and said, \"I've just received word that all my family \nhave arrived safely home!\"  He then proceeded with the service as \nusual.  Later, the full meaning of his words became known to his \npeople.  Just before the meeting, he learned that a submarine had \ntorpedoed the ship and everyone on board had drowned.  He knew that \nbecause all were believers they had reached a more \"desired haven\" \n(Ps. 107:30). Although overwhelmed with grief, he was able to rise \nabove the circumstances by the grace of God and keep on working for \nthe Lord.  The knowledge that his family was enjoying the bliss of \nHeaven comforted his heart.\u0014",

    "words": "A woman who honors God will be a good mother. This is true because \nher ultimate desire is to be the kind of parent He wants her to be.  \nInstead of bringing up a family solely to fulfill her own needs, she \nwants to raise children for the glory of the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\n     This approach to motherhood stands in striking contrast to \nwhat's happening in a lot of homes today.  Hans Sebald, a University \nof Arizona sociologist, has written a book entitled, Momism: The \nSilent Disease of America.  He points out that many mothers are \nraising overly dependent, neurotic sons and daughters.  This is most \ncommon among couples who are caught up in the rat race of \nmiddle-class values.  Dad sells his time and soul to the company to \nkeep up with the Joneses.  Mom in turn is left alone and must bear \nthe burden of caring for the family. Since she has so few outlets for \nfulfillment, she unconsciously uses her own youngsters to gain honor \nand influence in the neighborhood.  She strives to bring up model \nchildren solely for the purpose of gaining the reputation of being a \nmodel mother. Performance becomes all-important, so she gives or \nwithdraws her love, depending on the behavior of the child.\u0014",

Then, to \nthe utter surprise of the class, he suddenly took a brush and wrote \none word across the canvas.\u0014\n\u0014\n  That one word he splashed on the picture was \"amplius,\" meaning \n\"larger.\"  Michelangelo was not rejecting the work, for it exhibited \ngreat skill and was good as far as it went.  But the small size of \nthe canvas had made its design appear cramped. It needed to be \nexpanded.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The Lord may have to write the word \"amplius\" across many of our \nlives.  Our spiritual outlook becomes confined, and our vision of \nwhat God wants to do in and through us gets restricted by our small \nfaith and limited spiritual growth. Although He's aware of the \nprogress we've made, He encourages us to keep expanding our \nhorizons.  He wants to increase the dimensions of our spiritual \nlives, widen our outreach, and strengthen our witness.\u0014",
