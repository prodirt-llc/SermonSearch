    "title": "PULLING WEEDS FROM YOUR FIELD OF DREAMS",
    "words": "\"Hedonism works its way into the fabric of my visions like \nfoxtails into socks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Vision is an asset to any pastor.  It can become a liability, \nhowever, if it is not tended carefully, and good tending means being \nalert to toxic weeds.\u0014\n   The Dream Weed.  Healthy daydreaming that allows us to imagine the \npossible can turn destructive if it causes us to long for the \nimpossible--multiple Ph.D.'s, three secretaries to guard the pastor \nfrom the persnickety parishioner. Such dreams grow out of our \nfrustration, our anger, and our self-pity.\u0014\n   How do we pull up these dangerous dream weeds? Begin with \nconfession, calling your false vision what it is and telling God \nabout it.  Then repent by praying for the right things--for the \npeople in your congregation, for the fruit of the Spirit, etc.\u0014\n   Dream weeds cannot tolerate reality, so a good dose of reality is \nalso an effective antidote. Call that persnickety parishioner.  Sweep \nthe church sidewalk.  In such common ways we recommit ourselves to \ncaring for our church and its people.\u0014\n   The Greed Weed.  Desiring one's church to prosper and grow is a \ngood thing--until, coupled with that earnest prayer, is a vision of a \nnew car, a nicer flyrod, a bigger salary.\u0014\n   Greed is impatient, so the best weapon against it is patience.  \nGreed wants everything now.  By delaying gratification, we choke the \nweeds of greed and make room for the Spirit's fruit to grow.\u0014\n   The Hero Weed.  Too often, our own faces figure prominently in our \ndreams.  We see ourselves heroically restoring a dying church to \nprominence in the community, or saving a troubled marriage through \nbrilliant counseling.\u0014\n   Perhaps the best way to extract our ego from our vision is through \nprivate prayer.  Instead of making ourselves highly visible and \nvocal, we can retreat into the anonymity of private prayer.  We will \nstill see our dreams come true, but God will get the credit instead \nof our egos.\u0014\n   Pastors need a vision in order to persevere. So dream on--just \nremember to check for life-choking weeds now and then.\u0014\n @Z:E\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Pulling weeds from your field of dreams\" by David Hansen. \nLeadership, Sum 1994 (Vol 15, No 3).

They are a gathering of \nbeings, ideas, experiences, and memories. It is important to have \ngatherings of the family around a meal, whether it is your immediate \nfamily or the extended family of which you are a part. Family meals \nmake a difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nI love to sit around the table after a meal and hear one after \nanother of the family say, \"Do you remember. . .?\" and then tell \nsomething out of the past, out of their own ex-perience, or of some \nevent, some person, or some place. As one after the other begins to \nsay, \"Do you remember something else is triggered, and someone will \nsay, \"Yes, and do you remember . .?\" and it begins to move as the \nstories are told. Some of the stories bring tears, some bring \nlaughter because life and loving includes both of those, and being a \nfamily is about being loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Passover Feast is basically a family meal. Even today it is \nprimarily a family meal for those who are of the family of Israel. It \nis a time when they gather to recall memories. In particular they \nrecall memories of their God, and of the things the Lord has done to \nshow mercy and to deliver them. In par-ticular, it is a time for \nsaying, \"Do you remember. . .?\" Do you remember how our people were \nin slavery down in Egypt and the Angel of Death was coming? Do you \nremember how an Angel of the Lord said, \"Slay the most perfect lamb \nyou have?\u0014",

He had lambasted the lack of racial diversity in the \u0014\ntown, the high property taxes, the insensitivity of the merchants, \u0014\nand the lack of caring present in family relationships. This was \u0014\ntoo much, so an ad hoc committee was quickly assembled to meet with \u0014\nthe young man to \"set him straight.\" The gathering took place in \u0014\nthe church parlor right after worship. The chair began, \"Preacher, \u0014\nwe are a little worried about the effect your preaching is having \u0014\non the congregation. When you rail against materialism, the bankers \u0014\nand the merchants find that hard to take. And when you talk against \u0014\nthe television preachers pursuing religion for profit, a lot of our \u0014\nfolks send money to those people. And when you start talking about \u0014\nfamily values, why, a lot of our people are busy and commute to \u0014\nBoston and can't just communicate with their children like you \u0014\nenvision. And, heck, you make us feel bad about being white and \u0014\nwealthy. Can't you find something else to preach about?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTotally exasperated, the preacher asked: \"Well, what do you people \u0014\nsuggest I preach about?\" \u0014\nFrom the back of the room came a clear voice: \"Why don't you preach \u0014\nabout the communists?\" \u0014\n\"But we don't have any communists in our town, in Vermont,\" he \u0014\nanswered. \u0014\n\"Exactly. Preach about them!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHosea has avoided that easy transference. Not only is he speaking \u0014\nto his own people, but his oracles elaborate the theme of the \u0014\nrelations between Israel and Yahweh in terms of those between Hosea \u0014\nand his wandering spouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nHarold C.

    "title": "PROBLEMS WITH THE ETHICS OF \"ESTHER\"",
    "words": "The nationalistic and vengeful spirit of the Book of Esther caused \nmany problems among early Jewish and Christian readers (see \ndiscussion at Place in the Canon) and continues to do so. Some \nscholars have a low opinion of the leading characters because they do \nnot consistently exhibit noble qualities. Paton (Esther, p. 96) said, \n\"There is not one noble character in this book.\" Xerxes was a cruel, \nsensual, and capricious despot. Esther was willing to hide her \nidentity in order to become queen and did not appear to be reluctant \nto marry a Gentile. She showed no mercy when Haman pled for his life \nand even demanded that his sons be hanged. Not content with \ndeliverance of her people, she and Mordecai with the king's \npermission wrote a decree authorizing their people to slaughter and \nplunder their enemies. Mordecai advised Esther to conceal her \nidentity in order to become queen. He insolently refused to bow to \nHaman and joined Esther in bringing vengeance on their enemies. The \nauthor never explicitly condemns any of the moral shortcomings of \nEsther or Mordecai but seems to describe their triumph with approval. \nPerhaps only someone who has experienced severe persecution can \nunderstand, without approving, the unrestrained exultation evoked by \nvictory over one's persecutors that is reflected in this book.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Exegetes approach the moral problems of Esther in several ways: \n(1) defense of the actions of Esther and Mordecai (e.g., Keil), \nimplying that because they are in the Bible, they cannot be wrong; \n(2) an extremely critical and condemning attitude toward the book \nbecause of its morality (e.g., Paton); (3) neither blind defense nor \nblanket condemnation. The third attitude has the greatest merit.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Not all conservative scholars find it necessary to defend the \nactions of Esther and Mordecai. Speaking of the Jews in Persia, Young \n(Introduction, p. 349) said, \"-Their theocratic spirit ... was weak.\" \nBaldwin (p. 414) commented, \"Mordecai and Esther ... were positively \nblameworthy.\" Wright (p. 45) is more specific: \"The Christian \njudgment of the Book of Esther has been unnecessarily cramped through \nour feeling that because Mordecai is a Bible character, he must be a \ngood man. Yet, like Samson and Jehu, he may have been little more \nthan a time-server. The Bible makes no moral judgment on him, but it \nexpects us to use our Christian sense. He was raised up by God, but \nhe was not necessarily a godly man.\"\u0014\n                  \u0014\n \"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, \ncorrecting and training in righteousness\" (2 Tim 3:16), but \neverything found in the Bible is not to be emulated. Sometimes the \nbiblical narratives show us how we should not act. \"In all things God \nworks for the good of those who love him\" (Rom 8:28), but that does \nnot mean that all things that happen are in themselves good (e.g., a \nsmall child killed by a drunken driver). The disturbing ethical \npractices of Esther and Mordecai resulted in the deliverance of the \nJewish people from a terrible pogrom: but their success does not \nprove that the means used were good or pleasing to God.\u0014\n                                                       ---Expositor's \nDictionary of Theology\u0014",

However, there are other legal documents which \ncan be useful to us particularly if we are unable to make decisions \nFor ourselves. I discuss some of these in this article, but please \nmake sure to work with an estate planning attorney to prepare these \ndocuments.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe health care POA enables you to provide guidelines and \ninstructions about the extent of medical care and intervention you \nwould want under various circumstances. This POA will be effective if \nyour physical or mental condition makes it impossible for you to \nunderstand, make or communicate an informed decision about providing, \nwithholding or withdrawing treatment. In this POA, you can describe \nwhat quality of life is acceptable to you, thus relieving your family \nand friends of the burden of making these difficult decisions. A \nhealth care POA can authorize access to medical records and assign \nresponsibility for decisions regarding diagnostic procedures, \nspecific treatments, pain relief, the right to employ or discharge \nmedical providers and authorization for admission to or discharge \nfrom medical facilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday many hospitals require that you have a health POA prior to \nundergoing an operation. In some states the individual designated for \nthis responsibility must sign an affidavit stating that he/she will \nin no way financially benefit from your demise.\u0014\n\u0014\nPowers of Attorney\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us first discuss powers of attorney (POA). This document allows \nthe person you designate to act on your behalf in the went of \nillness, injury or extended travel. You retain the right o modify or \nrevoke the power at any time. A durable POA s one of the safest, \nsimplest and least expensive ways of protecting your assets against \nthe threat of incapacity. If you become unable to make financial or \nmedical decisions and have not given anyone your POA, a family member \nor friend may have to petition the court to appoint a guardian for \nyou.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe recommend you have two POAs, one to cover your financial affairs \nand one to handle your health care directives. You nay want the same \nperson to have both POAs or you may prefer two different people.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinancial Power of Attorney\u0014\n\u0014\nThe financial POA allows your agent to act on your behalf when \nhandling your financial affairs. However be sure to heck with your \nbanker, your stockbroker and investment adviser to make sure they \nwill accept the POA prepared by our lawyer. Often they will only \nhonor their own POA documents so it is best to check in advance.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth Power of Attorney\u0014\n\u0014\nSelecting the person to act on your behalf with a POA is an important \ndecision. Make sure it is someone you trust to make careful \ndecisions, someone who copes well in stressful situations and someone \nwho will not be intimidated by physicians and medical personnel. \n(Your spouse is not always the best choice.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe health POA is more flexible than the living will (see next \nsection) since it allows for advance directives for a range of \npersonal care decisions, not just decisions regarding life sustaining \nprocedures.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiving Wills\u0014\n\u0014\nThe living will is an advance directive to physicians and family \nmembers in the event of a terminal illness or injury which would \npreclude you from expressing your wishes regarding medical care. This \ndocument allows you to state in advance your wishes regarding the use \nof life-sustaining procedures, whether to withhold or withdraw \ntreatment if you are a candidate for life support and are considered \nterminal. The living will would serve both as a legal document and as \na supplement to discussion you might have had with family members to \nreassure them of your wishes if they should be faced with difficult \ndecisions regarding your care.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many provisions within a living will and it is very \nimportant that you express your wishes clearly. Although the rules \nregarding living wills differ from state to state, certain items \nshould be included. The document should define clearly:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tWhen the living will becomes effective (triggering events or \nconditions);\u0014\n2.\twho has the decision-making power; and\u0014\n3.\twhich treatments are or are not to be withheld.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more information about living wills, contact Choice in Dying at \n800/989-9455. Its Web site is at www.choices.org.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiving Trusts\u0014\n\u0014\nA living trust sounds similar to a living will but is different. Both \nare prepared and finalized while you are alive (thus they are called \nliving) and they are both legal documents. However, that is where \nthe similarity ends. A living trust is a will substitute for the \nassets it contains. The assets titled in the name of the living trust \nare distributed when you die according to the trust instructions.\u0014\n\u0014\nTypically you name yourself as the trustee of your own trust and \nsomeone else (relative, friend, lawyer or bank trust department) to \nbe the successor trustee. This successor trustee can distribute the \nassets held in the trust when you die but also can act on your behalf \nif you become ill and are unable to manage your own affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nA living trust is revocable or irrevocable. A revocable trust \nmeans the person who establishes it can change the terms of the trust \nat a later date if desired. An irrevocable trust once established \ncannot be changed. Setting up an irrevocable trust has tax \nadvantages but is less frequently used since most people don't like \ngiving up the flexibility of being able to change the terms of the \ntrust later.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdvantages of a Living Trust\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are six reasons why you would consider establishing a living \ntrust.\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tAssets in the trust will not have to go through the probate \nprocess which in some states can be expensive. Avoiding the probate \nprocess has the added advantage of expediting the asset distributions \nto your heirs.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tAssets held in a living trust are not a matter of public record \nwhen you die. With the will the amount of your estate and the terms \nof the will are a matter of public record.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tA trust is less likely than a will to be successfully challenged \nby unhappy relatives and friends.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.\tA trust is less likely to be questioned than a power of attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\n5.\tIn some states, transferring your property into a living trust may \nprotect it against your creditors.\u0014\n6.\tIf you own real estate in more than one state, if it is titled in \nthe name of the trust you can avoid your estate being probated in \nanother state.\u0014\n\u0014\nRetitling Assets in a Living Trust\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, far too often we see a client had signed a living \ntrust document but has not taken the next essential step of retitling \nthe assets in the trust name. If you do not take this step, the trust \nwill be ineffectual.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe procedure is fairly simple  your bank and broker open new \naccounts for you in your trust name and transfer your current \nholdings into it. You control the asset just as you did when they \nwere titled in your own name.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes you may have difficulty retitling your home, particularly \nif it is jointly held and has a mortgage on it. Some states treat the \nretitling of your home as a sale and charge a percentage of the value \nto retitle  so you may find it inconvenient to transfer your home to \nthe living trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelection of a Successor Trustee\u0014\n\u0014\nSelection of an appropriate successor trustee is very important and \nis similar to selecting a personal representative for your will. If \nyou are married, usually your successor trustee is your spouse. If \nyou are single, the choice is not as easy. You may choose to select a \nlawyer or bank trust department as your successor trustee, but you \nmay pick an individual instead. Whomever you select, designate \nsomeone you think is honest, financially knowledgeable, has your best \ninterests at heart and is younger than you are!\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nSome advisers recommend that everyone have a living trust instead of \na will. We think that the living trust can be a useful device, \nparticularly for an elderly single person with an uncomplicated \nfinancial situation, someone who is suffering from a debilitating \nillness or someone who travels extensively. However, just as no one \ninvestment is the panacea, neither is having a living trust to the \nexclusion of other legal documents. If you and your attorney decide a \nliving trust fits your circumstances, we think you still should have \na will to take care of other matters not covered in the trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also think that financial and health care powers of attorney are \nuseful tools as well as a living will. Having all these documents \ndrawn up and executed by an attorney in your state of residence \nshould adequately cover you should anything happen to you.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexandra Armstrong is a Certified Financial Planner practitioner, \nchairman of Armstrong, Welch & Maclntyre, Inc. in Washington, D.C., \nand coauthor, Second Edition: On Your Own:\u0014\nA Widow's Passage to Emotional & Financial Well-Being.

    "words": "LEAD STORIES   5/26/00\u0014\n*\tIn March, Milwaukee lawyer Robin Shellow agreed to settle the \nslander\u0014\nlawsuit filed by former client James Hermann, stemming from a \nstatement she\u0014\nmade on his behalf at his 1996 sentencing for armed robbery. To help \nexplain\u0014\nhis behavior to the judge, Shellow said Hermann was a heroin user, \nbut Hermann\u0014\nsaid he was merely a cocaine addict and that to hear himself \ndescribed as a\u0014\nheroin user gave him post-traumatic stress disorder resulting in \nlessened\u0014\n\"self-confidence, self-esteem and self-image.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n*\tIn April, the Orange County (Calif.) Register revealed that human \ntissue\u0014\nbanks, which are widely believed by the donating public to be either\u0014\ngovernment- or non-profit-operated, are highly profitable commercial \nconcerns,\u0014\nwith annual revenues of $500 million and rising. Today, a cadaver \n\"donated to\u0014\nscience\" actually brings up to $200,000 for tissue banks and their\u0014\ncontractors. The companies argue that if they paid for cadavers, the \ncosts\u0014\nwould rise to tissue recipients (who range from blind people \nreceiving corneas\u0014\nto makeup models who want fuller lips). \u0014\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nWho Cares? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe I Am Hurt Corp. lawyer-referral company filed a lawsuit in \nEdmonton,\u0014\nAlberta, in March against a competing lawyer who advertises his phone \nnumber,\u0014\n428-HURT. And in November, a New York grand jury indicted three \nprincipals in\u0014\na Maryland distributing company for fraudulently substituting common \nfish eggs\u0014\nfor caviar. And in March, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nfiled a\u0014\ncomplaint against four Georgetown University law students, accusing \nthem of\u0014\nrecommending an obscure stock on an Internet bulletin board and then\u0014\nexploiting people who bought that stock, even though the buyers put \ntheir\u0014\nmoney down apparently knowing nothing about the stock except that \nthese\u0014\nanonymous strangers recommended it. \u0014\n\u0014\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nThe Entrepreneurial Spirit \u0014\n\u0014\n*\tExciting New Products: the Vast-ity Belt, which contains a microchip\u0014\nthat flashes and beeps when the wearer has eaten too much at a meal \n(from\u0014\nPiero De Giacomo of Bari, Italy); The Gooser, a computer program that\u0014\nautomatically inflates lawyers' billed hours (according to a November \nfederal\u0014\nindictment against the developer, a Wayne, Pa, consultant); and \nsliced peanut\u0014\nbutter, packaged like single slices of cheese, from researchers at \nOklahoma\u0014\nState University. \u0014\n\u0014\n*\tLatest from the Restaurant Industry: A Nazi-themed restaurant called\u0014\nThe Third Reich (with Gestapo-clad waiters) has been open for about a \nyear in\u0014\ndowntown Seoul, to little criticism, perhaps because of South Korea's\u0014\nminuscule Jewish population. However, an unaffiliated eatery called \nJail (with\u0014\na prison motif) in Taipei, Taiwan, was forced to apologize in January \nfor\u0014\nincluding Holocaust prison scenes on its walls.

On the day he finished his \nmanuscript he gave his only copy to a colleague, John Stuart Mill, to \nread and critique. Then the unthinkable occurred. Mill's servant used \nCarlyle's manuscript as kindling to start a fire. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Mill reported the devastating news, Carlyle's face paled. Two \nyears of his life were lost. Thousands of long, lonely hours spent \nwriting had been wasted. He could not imagine writing the book again. \nHe lapsed into a deep depression. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen one day while walking the city streets, Carlyle noticed a stone \nwall under construction. He was transfixed. That tall sweeping wall \nwas being raised one brick at a time. It was a \"eureka\" for him. If \nhe wrote one page at a time, one day at a time, he could write the \nbook again. And that is exactly what he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian observes, \"When faced with seemingly impossible situations, \nwe often see the wall and not the individual bricksbut taken day by \nday, task by task, the load is more manageable. Christ prayed for \ndaily bread, daily sustenance. He didn't worry about tomorrow, next \nweek, or next year.

    "words": "Each week Kevin Tunell is required to mail a dollar to a family he'd \nrather forget. They sued him for $1.5 million but settled for $936, \nto be paid a dollar at a time. The family expects the payment each \nFriday so Tunell won't forget what happened on the first Friday of \n1982. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the day their daughter was killed. Tunell was convicted of \nmanslaughter and drunken driving. He was 17. She was 18. Tunell \nserved a court sentence. He also spent seven years campaigning \nagainst drunk driving, six years more than his sentence required. But \nhe keeps forgetting to send the dollar. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe weekly restitution is to last until the year 2000. Eighteen \nyears. Tunell makes the check out to the victim, mails it to her \nfamily, and then the money is deposited in a scholarship fund. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe family has taken him to court four times for failure to comply. \nAfter the most recent appearance, Tunell spent thirty days in jail. \nHe insists that he's not defying the order but rather is haunted by \nthe girl's death and tormented by the reminders. He offered the \nfamily two boxes of checks covering the payments until the year 2001, \none year more than required. They refused. It's not money they seek, \nbut penance. \u0014\n\u0014\nQuoting the mother, \"We want to receive the check every week on time. \nHe must understand we are going to pursue this until August of the \nyear 2000. We will go back to court every month if we have to.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFew would question the anger of the family. Only the nave would \nthink it fair to leave the guilty unpunished. But I do have one \nconcern. Is 936 payments enough? Not for Tunell to send, mind you, \nbut for the family to demand? When they receive the final payment, \nwill they be at peace? In August 2000, will the family be able to put \nthe matter to rest? Is 18 years' worth of restitution sufficient? \nWill 196 months' worth of remorse be adequate? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow much is enough? Were you in the family and were Tunell your \ntarget, how many payments would you require? Better stated, how many \npayments do you require? \u0014\nNo oneI repeat, no one makes it through life free of injury. \nSomeone somewhere has hurt you. Like the 18-year-old, you've been a \nvictim. She died because someone drank too much. Part of you has died \nbecause someone spoke too much, demanded too much, or neglected too \nmuch. \u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Max Lucado, In the Grip of Grace (Word, 1996)\u0014",

We knew her \nhusband wouldn't come to our house because he would be embarrassed, \nand under those conditions I wouldn't let her go anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Gloria and her husband, Tom, took her in, as they took in many \nhurting, hungry or homeless people during their 30-plus years in \nBangladesh. The next morning, Gloria asked two Bengali Christian \nwomen to take her home. The beatings stoppedperhaps because of the \nquiet intervention of a respected missionary, perhaps because of \ncommunity pressure.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Bengali womenChristian, Muslim and Hinducame to Gloria over \nthe years. Some had been abused by husbands or older sons, some had \nbeen denied food or other essentials. Some were just bone-weary of \nthe endless struggle against poverty, floods or despair. Gloria \ncouldn't help them all, but she listened.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've come in many times and a group of (women would) be sitting \nthere wiping the tears, Tom recalls. She (had) heard their plight, \nand they (left) refreshed,\u0014\nknowing that somebody understands.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne in three abused?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least one in every three women worldwide has been beaten, raped, \ncoerced into sex or otherwise abused in their lifetimeusually more \nthan onceaccording to a recent global survey conducted by the Johns \nHopkins University\u0014\n\u0014\nSchool of Public Health. Such staggering claims usually raise \nquestions about biased research and radical-feminist political \nagendas. Perhaps the reported number of abuse victims is highly \ninflated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen again, maybe it isn't large enough. Ask Korean Baptist WMU \npioneer Pang Ho Sun, who for decades has been rescuing women abused \nor lured into prostitution off the streets of Seoul. Ask Christians \nin many parts of Asia and Africa, who strive to_free poor women and \nchildren sold (sometimes by their own families) or kidnapped into \nslavery, forced labor and the multibillion~dollar sex industry. An \nestimated 50,000 a year are being smuggled into our own land of the \nfree to lie chained to beds in dark rooms.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsk the missionaries, like Gloria Thurman, who minister to numberless \nwomen being crushed under the wheels of age-old social and religious \ncustoms.\u0014\nMost women in this world don't seek some Western ideal of absolute \ngender equality. They'd be glad just to be treated like human beings. \nAnd millions lost in darkness would rejoice to be told how deeply \nthey are loved by Jesus Christ, the true Liberator.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy one estimate, nearly 80 percent of the inhabitants of the 10 / 40 \nWindowthe world's most unreached regions, stretching from North \nAfrica to Southeast Asia are women and children. They live behind \nveils, gates, walls and other barriers physical and psychological. \nYet in many cases women hold the key to evangelizing their families \nand communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most effective way to reach them:\u0014\nEquip women to share the gospel with other women and children, \ncontends a report from the Women's Summit on the Window, a conference \nheld in February to focus Christian attention on the challenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey can gain entrance into homes where outsiders would never be \nallowed, says the report. And once they know Jesus, they're willing \nto take extraordinary\u0014\nrisks to share the life-changing good news with other women in their \nculture.\u0014\n\u0014\nA heroic tradition\u0014\n\u0014\nTelling women and children about God's saving love was one of the \nfounding purposes of the great women's missionary societies launched \nin the 19th century. Many mission boards of the day refused to send \nsingle women missionaries, so visionary women banded together to send \ntheir own.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mission boards came around when members of the weaker sex \nproved to be just as tough, resilient and committed to the task as \ntheir male missionary colleaguesoften more so.\u0014\nA whole new dimension was thus added to mission strategy: the vast \nenterprise to reach women and children with the gospel, to educate \ngirls, and to bring adequate medical care to women, writes mission \nhistorian R. Pierce Beaver.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe heroines who emerged from the 19th-century movement include \nLottie Moon of China, the gutsy heavenly book visitor who left the \nsafety of mission compounds to carry the light to so many rural women \n(and men).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother is Amy Carmichael of India, who worked without a furlough for \n53 years and rescued many young girls from temple prostitution. She \ncontinued the tradition of William Carey, who battled many Indian \nsocial practices deadly to women and children, from abortion to the \nburning of Hindu widows on their husbands' funeral pyres.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral generations of great women missionaries followed in their \nfootsteps after the Great Depression and World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday God is calling forth an exciting new generation of women to \nlift His name among the nations.

This time, a regional pagan group is asking \nto use the facilities. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Appalachian Pagan Alliance sent letters to Reynolds principal \nTony Baldwin and Buncombe County Superintendent Cliff Dodson on \nFriday asking to hold a \"We Still Work Magic\" rally, citing that if \nReynolds had been used by one religious group, it should be made \navailable for all others.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"I thought it was an inappropriate place to have it at the public \nschool,\" said Ginger Strivelli, leader of the Alliance. \"I'm all for \nthem having their religious gathering, but it struck me as being a \npoor decision to have it at the school system.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nStrivelli said the idea for a pagan rally had come to her well before \nlast week's We Still Pray event, which attracted over 13,000 people \nwho were able to get inside the stadium and an approximately 24,000 \nwho tried but were turned away, congesting traffic for hours in \nAsheville. \"It was actually about a couple of weeks ago when I saw \nthe information about the We Still Pray rally on the public access \nchannel.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nThe group has asked for a September 22nd date to hold the rally, \nfalling on the autumnal equinox, one of the holidays of the pagan \nfaith. But Strivelli said that \"there's just not much of a plan yet. \nSeptember 22nd was our first option.\" If the 22nd were to be \nunavailable, Strivelli said her group would press on until they got \ntheir rally at Reynolds. \"We'll definitely be doing it there even if \nwe have to be doing it at spring equinox,\" Strivelli said.\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen asked about what would take place at the pagan rally if and when \nit is held at Reynolds, Strivelli likened it to how the pagans \nobserve Samhain, traditionally called Halloween. \"We'll be having the \nenergizing ritual. We plan to do a ritual to further the awareness \nand acceptance of the pagan religion by the community,\" Strivelli \nexplained, saying that her groups beliefs should be considered as \nvalidly as any other. \"We still pray as well, but it was a matter of \nbeing different,\" she said, also asking members of the Jewish, Hindu, \nMuslim, and any other faiths to join their planned gathering.\u0014\n \u0014\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Strivelli said her group had not received a \nresponse from Buncombe County Schools. \"The letter was hand delivered \nFriday morning and we have not heard from them. They are dragging \ntheir feet, and being very difficult, which we fully expect them to \nbe.\" \u0014\nStrivelli said that the Appalachian Pagan Alliance covered a wide \narea. \"We have a hundred members, stretched out from Knoxville to \nCharlotte.\" She said her group had received a great deal of feedback \nsince announcing their plans on Monday, and that she had been \ncontacted by numerous media outlets, and is hoping to gain support \nfor the pagan rally.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"It'll be at the same place where the other one was,\" Strivelli said. \n\"I don't think it's the right place to have a religious gathering. \nBut now they've done it, and they need to open up to respect the \ndiversity of the religious groups in this area.\" \u0014\n=========================================================== \u0014\nChristopher Knight is a reporter for The Asheville Tribune \n(www.ashevilletribune.com).

Lundy had the motive and the\u0014\nopportunity to have Alydar intentionally killed for $36\u0014\nmillion in insurance settlements, said U.S. District Court\u0014\nJudge Sim Lake. But, Lake added, he could not conclude from\u0014\nthe evidence that Lundy was in any way responsible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is some physical evidence and circumstances\u0014\nsurrounding the event are suspicious, but I cannot conclude\u0014\nhe is responsible,\" Lake said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe death of Calumet Farm's leading sire from the 1980s\u0014\nwound up in court as part of Lundy's sentencing hearing on\u0014\nfraud, conspiracy, and bribery convictions handed down in\u0014\nFebruary. Federal prosecutors argued that Lundy deserved a\u0014\nstiffer penalty for defrauding the First City National Bank\u0014\nof Houston out of $65 million in loans because he also was\u0014\nresponsible for destroying the asset securing the loans,\u0014\nwhich was Alydar.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Sims sentenced Lundy to four and half years in\u0014\njail and ordered him to pay restitution on more than $20.4\u0014\nmillion that First City lost when Calumet defaulted on its\u0014\nloans. Lundy does not have the money to repay that kind of\u0014\nrestitution, but he was ordered to make payments while\u0014\nworking in prison and, once released, to pay $200 per month.\u0014\nLundy will serve his jail sentence in a medium security\u0014\nprison in Coleman, Fla. Lake gave him three months before he\u0014\nis required to voluntarily surrender himself to prison\u0014\nbecause Lundy's mother is sick.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier in the day, Lake sentenced Gary Matthews to 21\u0014\nmonths in prison for his role in defrauding First City.\u0014\nMatthews was former chief financial officer of Calumet Farm\u0014\nduring Lundy's reign. Matthews also is responsible for\u0014\nrepaying the $20.4 million in restitution. Once he is\u0014\nreleased from prison, he must also pay $200 per month.\u0014\nMatthews was given six months to complete on-going estate\u0014\nwork he is performing before he must turn himself in to a\u0014\nmedium security prison in Manchester, Ky.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttorneys for both Lundy and Matthews said they will appeal\u0014\nthe convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\n============================================================\u0014",

    "words": "It is, however, most of all in the Pastoral Epistles that evidence \nhas been sought that Paul's two-year imprisonment in Rome ended in \nhis release. In them reference is made to a series of events in his \nlife for which a place cannot be found within the period of it \nrecorded in Acts. attempted a solution of this problem by maintaining \nthat Paul was set free from his first Roman imprisonment, the one \nrecorded in Acts 28:301, that he then engaged in a post-Acts \nministry, and that finally he suffered martyrdom after a second Roman \nimprisonment. In his Ecclesiastical History II.xxii.23, he writes : \n' But, as his [Felix's] successor, Nero sent Festus, in whose day \nPaul was brought in bonds to Rome, having first made his own defence. \nAristarchus was with him, whom also somewhere in  his epistles  he \nsuitably calls a fellow prisoner. And Luke, the same who delivered in \nwriting the Acts of the Apostles, brought his history to a close at \nthat point of time, after indicating that Paul sp&nt two whole years \nat Rome without restraint, and preached the word of God, none \nforbidding him. Having, therefore, made his defence at that time, it \nis recorded that the apostle again journeyed on the ministry of \npreaching, and, having set foot for the second time in the same city, \nwas perfected in his martyrdom. While still in bonds he composed his \nsecond epistle to Timothy, mentioning both his former defence and \nalso his imminent perfecting.'\u0014",

    "words": "Sketches of Church History\u0014\n                   Chapter 13: INNOCENT THE THIRD (AD 1198-1216) \u0014\n                   \u0014\nPART I \u0014\n                   The popes were continually increasing their power \nin many ways, although they were often\u0014\n                   unable to hold their ground in their own city, but \nwere driven out by the Romans, so that they\u0014\n                   were obliged to seek a refuge in France, or to fix \ntheir court for a time in some little Italian town.\u0014\n                   They claimed the right of setting up and plucking \ndown emperors and kings. Instead of asking\u0014\n                   the emperor to confirm their own election to the \npapacy, as in former times, they declared that\u0014\n                   no one could be emperor without their consent. \nThey said that they were the chief lords over\u0014\n                   kingdoms; they required the emperors to hold their \nstirrup as they mounted on horseback, and\u0014\n                   the rein of their bridle as they rode. And while \nsuch was their treatment of earthly princes, they\u0014\n                   also steadily tried to get into their own hands \nthe powers which properly belonged to bishops, so\u0014\n                   that the bishops should seem to have no rights of \ntheir own, but to hold their office and to do\u0014\n                   whatever they did only through the pope's leave \nand as his servants. They contrived that\u0014\n                   whenever any difference arose in the Church of any \ncountry, instead of being settled on the\u0014\n                   spot, it should be carried by an appeal to Rome, \nthat the pope might judge it. They declared\u0014\n                   themselves to be above any councils of bishops, \nand claimed the power of assembling general\u0014\n                   councils, although in earlier times this power had \nbelonged to the emperors, as was seen in the\u0014\n                   case of the first great council of Nicaea. They \ninterfered with the election of bishops, and with\u0014\n                   the appointment of clergy to offices, in every \ncountry; and they sent into every country their\u0014\n                   ambassadors, or \"legates\" (as they were called), \nwhom they charged people to respect and obey\u0014\n                   as they would respect and obey the pope himself. \nThese legates usually made themselves\u0014\n                   hated by their pride and greediness; for they set \nthemselves up far above the archbishops and\u0014\n                   bishops of any country that they might be sent \ninto, and they squeezed out from the clergy of\u0014\n                   each country which they visited the means of \nkeeping up their pomp and splendour. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The popes who followed Gregory VII all endeavoured \nto act in his spirit, and to push the claims\u0014\n                   of their see further and further. And of these \npopes, by far the strongest and most successful was\u0014\n                   Innocent III, who was only thirty-seven years old \nwhen he was elected in 1198. I have told you\u0014\n                   how Gregory said that the papacy was as much \ngreater than any earthly power as the sun is than\u0014\n                   the moon. And now Innocent carried out this \nfurther by saying that, as the lesser light (the moon)\u0014\n                   borrows of the greater light (the sun), so the \nroyal power is borrowed from the priestly power. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Innocent pretended to a right of judging between \nthe princes who claimed the empire and the\u0014\n                   kingdom of Germany, and of making an emperor by \nhis own choice. He forced the king of\u0014\n                   France, Philip Augustus, to do justice to a \nvirtuous Danish princess, whom he had married and\u0014\n                   had afterwards put away. And he forced John of \nEngland to accept Stephen Langton as\u0014\n                   archbishop of Canterbury, although Langton was \nappointed by the pope without any regard to\u0014\n                   the rights of the clergy or of the sovereign of \nEngland. Both in France and in England, Innocent\u0014\n                   made use of what was called an interdict to make \npeople submit to his will. By this sentence\u0014\n                   (which had first come into use about three hundred \nyears before), a whole country was punished\u0014\n                   at once, the bad and the good alike; all the \nchurches were closed, all the bells there silenced,\u0014\n                   all the outward signs of religion were taken away. \nThere was no blessing for marriage, there\u0014\n                   were no prayers at the burial of the dead; the \nbaptism of children and the office for the dying\u0014\n                   were the only services of the Church which were \nallowed while the interdict lasted. And it was\u0014\n                   commonly found, that, although a king might not \nhimself care for any spiritual threats or\u0014\n                   sentences which the pope might utter, he was \nunable to hold out against the general feeling of\u0014\n                   his people, who could not bear to be without the \nrites of religion, and cried out that the\u0014\n                   innocent thousands were punished for the sake of \none guilty person. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   John was completely subdued to the papacy, and \nagreed to give up his crown to the pope's\u0014\n                   commissioner, Pandulf; after which he received it \nagain from Pandulf's hands, and promised to\u0014\n                   hold the kingdoms of England and Ireland under the \ncondition of paying a yearly tribute as an\u0014\n                   acknowledgment that the pope was his lord. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Archbishop Langton, although he had been forced on \nthe English Church by the pope, yet\u0014\n                   afterwards took a different line from what might \nhave been expected. For when John, by his\u0014\n                   tyranny, provoked his barons to rise against him, \nthe archbishop was at the head of those who\u0014\n                   wrung from the king the Great Charter as a \nsecurity for English liberty; and, although the pope\u0014\n                   was violently angry, and threatened to punish the \narchbishop and the barons severely, Langton\u0014\n                   stood firmly by the cause which he had taken up. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   PART II \u0014\n\u0014\n                   While Innocent was thus carrying things with a \nhigh hand among the Christians of the West, he\u0014\n                   could not but feel distress about the state of \naffairs in the East. There, countries which had once\u0014\n                   been Christian, and among them the Holy Land, \nwhere the Saviour had lived and died, had\u0014\n                   fallen into the hands of unbelievers, and all the \nefforts which had been made to recover them\u0014\n                   had hitherto been vain. The pope's mind was set on \na new crusade, and in order to raise money\u0014\n                   for it he gave much out of his own purse, stinted \nhimself as to his manner of living, obliged the\u0014\n                   cardinals and others around him to do the like, \nand caused collections to be gathered\u0014\n                   throughout Western Christendom. Eloquent preachers \nwere sent about to stir people up to the\u0014\n                   great work, and the chief beginning was made at a \nplace called Ecry, in the north of France. It\u0014\n                   so happened that the most famous of the preachers, \nwhose name was Fulk, arrived there just as\u0014\n                   a number of nobles and knights were met for a \ntournament (which was the name given to the\u0014\n                   fights of knights on horseback, which were \nregarded as sport, but very often ended in sad\u0014\n                   earnest). Fulk, by the power of his speech, \npersuaded most of these gallant knights at Ecry to\u0014\n                   take the cross; and, as the number of Crusaders \ngrew, some of them were sent to Venice, to\u0014\n                   provide means for their being carried by sea to \nEgypt, which was the country in which it was\u0014\n                   thought that the Mahometans might be attacked with \nthe best hope of success. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   When these envoys reached Venice, which was then \nthe chief trading city of Europe, they found\u0014\n                   the Venetians very willing to supply what they \nwanted. It was agreed that for a certain sum of\u0014\n                   money the Venetians should prepare ships and \nprovisions for the number of Crusaders which\u0014\n                   was expected; and they did so accordingly. But \nwhen the Crusaders came, it was found that their\u0014\n                   numbers fell short of what had been reckoned on; \nfor many had chosen other ways of going to\u0014\n                   the East; and, as the Venetians would take nothing \nless than the sum which they had bargained\u0014\n                   for, the Crusaders, with their lessened numbers, \nfound themselves unable to pay. In this\u0014\n                   difficulty, the Venetians proposed that, instead \nof the money which could not be raised, the\u0014\n                   Crusaders should give them their help against the \ncity of Zara, in Dalmatia, with which Venice\u0014\n                   had a quarrel. The Crusaders were very unwilling \nto do this; because the pope, in giving his\u0014\n                   consent to their enterprise, had forbidden them to \nturn their arms against any Christians. But\u0014\n                   they contrived to persuade themselves that the \npope's words were not to be understood too\u0014\n                   exactly; and at a meeting in the great church of \nSt. Mark, Henry Dandolo, the doge or duke of\u0014\n                   Venice, took the cross, and declared to the vast \nmultitude of citizens and Crusaders who\u0014\n                   crowded the church that, although he was \nninety-four years of age, and almost or altogether\u0014\n                   blind, he himself would be the leader. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   A fleet of nearly five hundred vessels sailed from \nVenice accordingly (Oct. 1202), and Zara was\u0014\n                   taken after a siege of six days, although the \ninhabitants tried to soften the feelings of the\u0014\n                   besiegers by displaying crosses and sacred \npictures from the walls, as tokens of their brotherhood\u0014\n                   in Christ. After this success, the Crusaders were \nbound by their engagement to go on to Egypt or\u0014\n                   the Holy Land; but a young Greek prince, named \nAlexius, entreated them to restore his father,\u0014\n                   who had been dethroned by a usurper, to the empire \nof the East; and although the French were\u0014\n                   unwilling to undertake any work that might \ninterfere with the recovery of the Holy Land, the\u0014\n                   Venetians, who cared little for anything but their \nown gain, persuaded them to turn aside to\u0014\n                   Constantinople. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   When the Crusaders came in sight of the city, they \nwere so astonished at the beauty of its lofty\u0014\n                   walls and towers, of its palaces and its many \nchurches, that (as we are told) the hearts of the\u0014\n                   boldest among them beat with a feeling which could \nnot be kept down, and many of them even\u0014\n                   burst into tears. They found the harbour protected \nby a great chain which was drawn across the\u0014\n                   mouth of it; but this chain was broken by the \nforce of a ship which was driven against it with the\u0014\n                   sails swollen by a strong wind. The blind old \ndoge, Henry Dandolo, stood in the prow of the\u0014\n                   foremost ship, and was the first to land in the \nface of the Greeks who stood ready to defend the\u0014\n                   ground. Constantinople was soon won, and the \nemperor, who had been deposed and blinded\u0014\n                   by the usurper, was brought from his dungeon, and \nwas enthroned in the great church of St.\u0014\n                   Sophia, while his son Alexius was anointed and \ncrowned as a partner in the empire. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   But quarrels soon arose between the Greeks and the \nLatins. Alexius was murdered by a new\u0014\n                   usurper; his father died of grief: and the \nCrusaders found themselves drawn on to conquer the\u0014\n                   city afresh for themselves. This conquest was \ndisgraced by much cruelty and unchecked plunder;\u0014\n                   and the religion of the Greeks was outraged by the \nLatin victors as much as it could have been\u0014\n                   by heathen barbarians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The Crusaders set up an emperor and a patriarch of \ntheir own, and the Greek clergy were forced\u0014\n                   to give way to Latins. The pope, although he was \nmuch disappointed at finding that his plan for\u0014\n                   the recovery of the Holy Land had come to nothing, \nwas yet persuaded by the greatness of the\u0014\n                   conquest to give a kind of approval to it. But the \nLatin empire of the East was never strong; and\u0014\n                   after about seventy years it was overthrown by the \nGreeks, who drove out the Latins and restored\u0014\n                   their own form of Christian religion. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Innocent did not give up the notion of a crusade, \nand at a later time he sent about preachers to\u0014\n                   stir up the people of the West afresh; but nothing \nhad come of this when the pope died. I must,\u0014\n                   however, mention a strange thing which arose out \nof this attempt at a crusade. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   A shepherd boy, named Stephen, who lived near \nVendome, in the province of Orleans, gave\u0014\n                   out that he had seen a vision of the Saviour, and \nhad been charged by Him to preach the cross.\u0014\n                   By this tale Stephen gathered some children about \nhim, and they set off for the crusade,\u0014\n                   displaying crosses and banners, and chanting in \nevery town or village through which they\u0014\n                   passed, \"Lord, help us to recover Thy true and \nholy cross!\" When they reached Paris, there were\u0014\n                   no less than 15,000 of them, and as they went \nalong their numbers became greater and greater.\u0014\n                   If any parents tried to keep back their children \nfrom joining them, it was of no use; even if they\u0014\n                   shut them up, it was believed that the children \nwere able to break through bars and locks in\u0014\n                   order to follow Stephen and his companions. \nIgnorant people fancied that Stephen could work\u0014\n                   miracles, and treasured up threads of his dress as \nprecious relics. At length the company, whose\u0014\n                   numbers had reached 30,000, arrived at Marseilles, \nwhere Stephen entered the city in a\u0014\n                   triumphal car, surrounded on all sides by guards. \nSome shipowners undertook to convey the\u0014\n                   child-crusaders to Egypt and Africa for nothing; \nbut these were wretches who meant to sell them\u0014\n                   as slaves to the Mahometans; and this was the fate \nof such of the children as reached the\u0014\n                   African coast, after many of them had been lost by \nshipwreck on the way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Innocent, although he had nothing to do with this \ncrusade, or with one of the same kind which\u0014\n                   was got up in Germany, declared that the zeal of \nthe children put to shame the coldness of their\u0014\n                   elders, whom he was still labouring, with little \nsuccess, to enlist in the cause of the Holy Land. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   PART III \u0014\n\u0014\n                   A war of a different kind, but which was also \nstyled a crusade, was carried on in the south of\u0014\n                   France while Innocent was pope. In that country \nthere were great numbers of persons who did\u0014\n                   not agree with the Roman Church, and who are known \nby the names of Waldenses and\u0014\n                   Albigenses. The opinions of these two parties \ndiffered greatly from each other. The Waldenses,\u0014\n                   whose name was given to them from Peter Waldo of \nLyons, who founded the party about the\u0014\n                   year 1170, were a quiet set of people, something \nlike the Quakers of our own time. They\u0014\n                   dressed and lived plainly, they were mild in their \nmanners, and used some rather affected ways\u0014\n                   of speech; they thought all war and all oaths \nwrong, they did not acknowledge the claims of the\u0014\n                   clergy, and, although they attended the services \nof the Church, it is said that they secretly\u0014\n                   mocked at them. They were fond of reading the Holy \nScripture in their own language, while the\u0014\n                   Roman Church could only allow it to be read in \nLatin, which was understood by few except the\u0014\n                   clergy, and not by all of them. And so eager were \nthe Waldenses to bring people to their own\u0014\n                   way of thinking, that we are told of one of them, \na poor man, who, after his day's work, used to\u0014\n                   swim across a river on wintry nights, that he \nmight reach a person whom he wished to convert. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The Albigenses, on whom the persecution chiefly \nfell, held something like the doctrines of\u0014\n                   Manes, whom I mentioned a long way back (p 110), \nso that they could not properly be\u0014\n                   considered as Christians at all. But, although we \ncannot think well of their doctrines, the\u0014\n                   treatment of these people was so cruel and so \ntreacherous as to raise the strongest feelings of\u0014\n                   anger and horror in all who read the accounts of \nit. Tens of thousands were slain, and their rich\u0014\n                   and beautiful country was turned into a desert. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The chief leader of the crusade in the south of \nFrance was Simon de Montfort, father of that\u0014\n                   Earl Simon who is famous in the history of \nEngland. Innocent, although he seems to have been\u0014\n                   much deceived by those who reported matters to \nhim, was grievously to blame for having given\u0014\n                   too much countenance to the cruelties and \ninjustice which were practised against the unhappy\u0014\n                   Albigenses. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Among the clergy who accompanied the Crusaders \ninto southern France and tried to bring over\u0014\n                   the Albigenses and Waldenses to the Roman Church \nwas a Spaniard named Dominic, who\u0014\n                   afterwards became famous as the founder of an \norder of mendicant friars (that is to say,\u0014\n                   \"begging brothers\"). He also founded the \nInquisition, which was a body intended to search out\u0014\n                   and to put down all opinions differing from the \ndoctrines of the Catholic Church. But the cruelty,\u0014\n                   darkness, and treachery of its proceedings were so \nshocking, that, although Dominic was\u0014\n                   certainly its founder, we need not suppose that he \nwould have approved of all its doings. [NOTE\u0014\n                   by transcriber: Dominic opposed all coercion \nagainst heretics. He proposed to convert them by\u0014\n                   reasoned argument and example of life.] \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The Waldenses and Albigenses had been used to \nreproach the clergy of the Church for their\u0014\n                   habits of pomp and luxury; and Dominic had done \nwhat he could to meet these charges by the\u0014\n                   plainness and hardness of the life which he and \nhis companions led while labouring in the\u0014\n                   south of France. And when he resolved to found a \nnew order of monks, he carried the notion of\u0014\n                   poverty to an extreme. His followers were to be \nnot only poor, but beggars. They were to live on\u0014\n                   alms, and from day to day, refusing any gifts of \nmoney so large as to give the notion of a settled\u0014\n                   provision for their needs. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   PART IV \u0014\n\u0014\n                   About the same time another great begging order \nwas founded by Francis, who was born in\u0014\n                   1182 at Assisi, a town in the Italian duchy of \nSpoleto. The stories as to his early days are very\u0014\n                   strange; indeed, it would seem that, when he was \nstruck with a religious idea, he could not carry\u0014\n                   it out without such oddities of behaviour as in \nmost people would look like signs of a mind not\u0014\n                   altogether right. When Francis heard in church our \nLord's charge to His apostles, that they\u0014\n                   should go forth without money in their purses, or \na staff or scrip, or shoes, or changes of raiment\u0014\n                   (St. Matt. x. 9f), he went before the bishop of \nAssisi, and, stripping off all his other clothes, he set\u0014\n                   forth to preach repentance without having anything \non him but a rough grey woollen frock, with\u0014\n                   a rope tied round his waist. He fancied that he \nwas called by a vision to repair a certain church;\u0014\n                   and he set about gathering the money for this \npurpose by singing and begging in the streets. He\u0014\n                   felt an especial charity for lepers, who, on \naccount of their loathsome disease, were shut out\u0014\n                   from the company of men, and were subject to \nmiseries of many kinds; and, although many\u0014\n                   hospitals had already been founded in various \ncountries for these unfortunate people, the\u0014\n                   kindness which Francis showed to them had a great \neffect in lightening their lot, so far as human\u0014\n                   fellow-feeling could do so. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Francis wished his followers to study humility in \nall ways. They were to seek to be despised, and\u0014\n                   were told to be uneasy if they met with usage of \nany other kind. They were not to let themselves\u0014\n                   be called \"brethren\" but \"little brethren\"; they \nmust try to be reckoned as less than any other\u0014\n                   persons. They were especially to be on their guard \nagainst the pride of learning; and, in order to\u0014\n                   preserve them from the danger of this, Francis \nwould hardly allow them even a book of the\u0014\n                   Psalms. But, in truth, all these things might \nreally be turned the opposite way, and in making\u0014\n                   such studied shows of humility it was quite \npossible that the Franciscans might fall under the\u0014\n                   temptations of pride. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Francis was very fond of animals, which he treated \nas reasonable creatures, speaking to them by\u0014\n                   the names of brothers and sisters. He used to call \nhis own body Brother Ass, on account of the\u0014\n                   heavy burdens and the hard usage which it had to \nbear. He kept a sheep in church, and it is said\u0014\n                   that the creature, without any training, used to \ntake part in the services by kneeling and bleating\u0014\n                   at proper times. He preached to flocks of birds on \nthe duty of thanking their Maker for His\u0014\n                   goodness to them; nay, he preached to fishes, to \nworms, and even to flowers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Perhaps the oddest story of this kind is one about \nhis dealing with a wolf which infested the\u0014\n                   neighbourhood of Gubbio. Finding that every one in \nthe place was overcome by fear of this\u0014\n                   fierce beast, Francis went out boldly to the \nforest where the wolf lived, and, meeting him, began\u0014\n                   to talk to him about the wickedness of killing, \nnot only brute animals, but men; and he promised\u0014\n                   that, if the wolf would give up such evil ways, \nthe citizens of Gubbio should maintain him. He\u0014\n                   then held out his right hand; whereupon the wolf \nput his paw into it as a sign of agreement, and\u0014\n                   allowed the saint to lead him into the town. The \npeople of Gubbio were only too glad to fulfil\u0014\n                   the promise which Francis had made for them; and \nthey kept the wolf handsomely, giving him\u0014\n                   his meals by turns, until he died of old age, and \nin such general respect that he was lamented\u0014\n                   by all Gubbio. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   There is a strange story that Francis, towards the \nend of his life, received in his body what are\u0014\n                   called the \"stigmata\" (that is to say, the marks \nof the wounds which were made in our Lord's\u0014\n                   body at the crucifixion). And a great number of \nother superstitious tales became connected with\u0014\n                   his name; but with such things we need not here \ntrouble ourselves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   When Dominic and Francis each applied to Pope \nInnocent for his approval of their designs to\u0014\n                   found new orders, he was not forward to give it; \nbut, on thinking the matter over, he granted\u0014\n                   them what they asked. Each of them soon gathered \nfollowers, who spread into all lands. The\u0014\n                   Franciscans, especially, made converts from \nheathenism by missions; and these orders, by their\u0014\n                   rough and plain habits of life, made their way to \nthe hearts of the poorest classes in a degree\u0014\n                   which had never been known before. And the \ninfluence which they thus gained was all used for\u0014\n                   the papacy, which found them the most active and \nuseful of all its servants. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   In the year 1215, Innocent held a great council at \nRome, what is known as the fourth Lateran\u0014\n                   Council, and is to be remembered for two of its \ncanons; by one of which the doctrine of the\u0014\n                   Roman Church as to the sacrament of the Lord's \nSupper (what they call \"transubstantiation\")\u0014\n                   was, for the first time, established; and by the \nother, it was made the duty of every one in the\u0014\n                   Roman Church to confess to the priest of his \nparish at least once a year.\u0014",

    "words": "Sketches of Church History\u0014\n                   POLYCARP (AD 166) \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the same time with Justin the Martyr, St. Polycarp, bishop of \nSmyrna, was put to death. He was a very old man; for it was almost \nninety years since he had been converted from heathenism. He had \nknown St. John, and is supposed to have been made bishop of Smyrna by \nthat Apostle himself, and he had been a friend of St. Ignatius, who, \nas we have seen, suffered martyrdom fifty years before. From all \nthese things, and from his wise and holy character, he was looked up \nto as a father by all the churches, and his mild advice had sometimes \nput all end to differences of opinion which but for him might have \nturned into lasting quarrels. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the persecution reached Smyrna, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, \na number of Christians suffered with great constancy, and the heathen \nmultitude, being provoked at their refusal to give up their faith, \ncried out for the death of Polycarp. The aged bishop, although he was \nready to die for his Saviour, remembered that it was not right to \nthrow himself in the way of danger; so he left the city, and went \nfirst to one village in the neighbourhood and then to another. But he \nwas discovered in his hiding-place, and when he saw the soldiers who \nwere come to seize him, he calmly said, \"God's will be done!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe desired that some food should be given to them, and while they \nwere eating, he spent the time in prayer. He was then set on an ass, \nand led towards Smyrna; and, when he was near the town, one of the \nheathen magistrates came by in his chariot, and took him up into it. \nThe magistrate tried to persuade Polycarp to sacrifice to the gods; \nbut finding that he could make nothing of him, he pushed him out of \nthe chariot so roughly that the old man fell and broke his leg. But \nPolycarp bore the pain without showing how much he was hurt, and the \nsoldiers led him into the amphitheatre, where great numbers of people \nwere gathered together. When all these saw him, they set up loud \ncries of rage and savage delight; but Polycarp thought, as he entered \nthe place, that he heard a voice saying to him, \"Be strong and play \nthe man!\" and he did not heed all the shouting of the crowd. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe governor desired him to deny Christ, and said that, if he would, \nhis life should be spared. But the faithful bishop answered \n\"Fourscore and six years have I served Christ, and He hath never done \nme wrong; how then can I now blaspheme my King and Saviour?\" The \ngovernor again and again urged him, as if in a friendly way, to \nsacrifice; but Polycarp stedfastly refused. He next threatened to let \nwild beasts loose on him, and as Polycarp still showed no fear, he \nsaid that he would burn him alive. \"You threaten me,\" said the \nbishop, \"with a fire which lasts but a short time; but you know not \nof that eternal fire which is prepared for the wicked.\" A stake was \nthen set up, and a pile of wood was collected around it. Polycarp \nwalked to the place with a calm and cheerful look, and, as the \nexecutioners were going to fasten him to the stake with iron cramps, \nhe begged them to spare themselves the trouble. \"He who gives me the \nstrength to bear the flames,\" he said. \"will enable me to remain \nsteady.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was therefore only tied to the stake with cords, and as he stood \nthus bound, he uttered a thanksgiving for being allowed to suffer \nafter the pattern of his Lord and Saviour. When his prayer was ended, \nthe wood was set on fire, but we\u0014\nare told that the flames swept round him, looking like the sail of a \nship swollen by the wind,\u0014\nwhile he remained unhurt in the midst of them. One of the \nexecutioners, seeing this, plunged a sword into the martyr's breast, \nand the blood rushed forth in such a stream that it put out the fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the persecutors, who were resolved that the Christians should not \nhave their bishop's body, lighted the wood again, and burnt the \ncorpse, so that only a few of the bones remained; and these the \nChristians gathered out, and gave them an honourable burial. It was \non Easter eve that St. Polycarp suffered, in the year of our Lord 166.\u0014",

With a few clicks of the mouse, a \nlabyrinth  will fill the computer screen.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The labyrinth, which was used in the Middle Ages \nin Europe as a symbolic pilgrimage to the Holy Land, can be walked \nwith your finger on the screen and provide people nurturing moments \nat any time of the day,\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Anderson said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The cyberworld is full of church Web sites \nsimilar to St. Paul's. A recent report by the Pew Internet and \nAmerican Life Project  found that churches and religious leaders use \nthe Internet in the same ways as everyone else: to post information, \nrecruit new members and to communicate with colleagues around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The group surveyed 1,309 congregations in 49 \nstates that responded to an online questionnaire. Eighty-three \npercent of the respondents said the Internet has helped \ncongregational life. The 471 rabbis and ministers who responded said \nthey use the Internet like a library to get information for sermons \nand educational programs. E-mail, especially, has helped church \nmembers and clergy to stay more in touch with one another, the survey \nfound.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The survey also found that most church Web sites \nwere made by volunteers from the congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Lisa McMahon, senior Web administrator/developer \nfor the Richmond-based International Mission Board of the Southern \nBaptist Convention, said what goes on a Web site should depend on the \ntarget audience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     If the Web site is aimed at church members, the \nsite should include the church newsletter, a schedule of events and \nupdates on  what various groups are doing, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"If I'm not a member, I would want to know about \nthe church's ministries. If I have children, I would want to know \nabout children's programs. If I'm single, I would be interested in \nevents for singles,\" McMahon said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"If you are trying to reach the unchurched, \ndon't use churchey language,\" she said. \"The site should portray the \nstyle of the church. A contemporary church should have a contemporary \nWeb site. If the church is traditional, it should have a traditional \nsite.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     A common mistake is to put lots of bells and \nwhistles on the site, McMahon said. \"Most people don't have access to \ncomputers  with all that. When trying to download a page, if it takes \nmore than two minutes, you are going to scare people away.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     St. Luke Lutheran Church in South Richmond took \nmore than a year to develop its Web site. One of the things the \nchurch  wanted to do was attract new members, said Judy Maier, the \npastor's wife, who is in charge of the site.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"We felt we weren't getting the word out that we \nare here,\" she said. \"We want people to know we are here for them. \nThere are a  lot of community groups that use our building. We are a \ncommunity church that cares about the community,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Going cyber has been worthwhile, Maier said. \nSome new members, especially those younger than 40, have said they \nfound the church online.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The Web site for First Unitarian Church at 1000 \nBlanton Ave. began as part of Tim Stanton's personal Web site. Now \nthe church  has its own site and Stanton is the church's volunteer \nWeb master.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The site includes pictures, church news, a \ncalendar of events, a map to the church and links to other sites.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Technology offers tremendous potential, Anderson \nadded.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     She recalled visiting a woman with a brilliant \nmind who can't get out of her nursing home bed. \"If she had a \ncomputer and could use it, she could stay linked to the community or \ngo to her church's Web page. It could give wonderful options to \nexpand her life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Contact Alberta Lindsey at (804) 649-6754 or \nalindsey@timesdispatch.com\u0014",

    "words": "Preaching Hell in a Tolerant Age\u0014\n                      Brimstone for the broad-minded. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      by Tim Keller \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The young man in my office was impeccably \ndressed and articulate. He was an Ivy\u0014\n                      League MBA, successful in the financial world, \nand had lived in three countries before age\u0014\n                      30. Raised in a family with only the loosest \nconnections to a mainline church, he had\u0014\n                      little understanding of Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I was therefore gratified to learn of his \nintense spiritual interest, recently piqued as he\u0014\n                      attended our church. He said he was ready to \nembrace the gospel. But there was a final\u0014\n                      obstacle. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"You've said that if we do not believe in \nChrist,\" he said, \"we are lost and condemned. I'm\u0014\n                      sorry, I just cannot buy that. I work with some \nfine people who are Muslim, Jewish, or\u0014\n                      agnostic. I cannot believe they are going to \nhell just because they don't believe in Jesus.\u0014\n                      In fact, I cannot reconcile the very idea of \nhell with a loving Godeven if he is holy too.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This young man expressed what may be the main \nobjection contemporary secular people\u0014\n                      make to the Christian message. (A close second, \nin my experience, is the problem of\u0014\n                      suffering and evil.) Moderns reject the idea of \nfinal judgment and hell. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thus, it's tempting to avoid such topics in our \npreaching. But neglecting the unpleasant\u0014\n                      doctrines of the historic faith will bring \nabout counter-intuitive consequences. There is an\u0014\n                      ecological balance to scriptural truth that \nmust not be disturbed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If an area is rid of its predatory or \nundesirable animals, the balance of that environment\u0014\n                      may be so upset that the desirable plants and \nanimals are lostthrough overbreeding\u0014\n                      with a limited food supply. The nasty predator \nthat was eliminated actually kept in\u0014\n                      balance the number of other animals and plants \nnecessary to that particular ecosystem.\u0014\n                      In the same way, if we play down \"bad\" or harsh \ndoctrines within the historic Christian\u0014\n                      faith, we will find, to our shock, that we have \ngutted all our pleasant and comfortable\u0014\n                      beliefs, too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The loss of the doctrine of hell and judgment \nand the holiness of God does irreparable\u0014\n                      damage to our deepest comfortsour \nunderstanding of God's grace and love and of our\u0014\n                      human dignity and value to him. To preach the \ngood news, we must preach the bad. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But in this age of tolerance, how? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How to preach hell to traditionalists\u0014\n                      Before preaching on the subject of hell, I must \nrecognize that today, a congregation is\u0014\n                      made up of two groups: traditionalists and \npostmoderns. The two hear the message of\u0014\n                      hell completely differently. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      People from traditional cultures and mindsets \ntend to have (a) a belief in God, and (b) a\u0014\n                      strong sense of moral absolutes and the \nobligation to be good. These people tend to be\u0014\n                      older, from strong Catholic or religious Jewish \nbackgrounds, from conservative\u0014\n                      evangelical/Pentecostal Protestant backgrounds, \nfrom the southern U.\u0010S., and\u0014\n                      first-generation \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nfrom non-European countries. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The way to show traditional persons their need \nfor the gospel is by saying, \"Your sin\u0014\n                      separates you from God! You can't be righteous \nenough for him.\" Imperfection is the\u0014\n                      duty-worshiper's horror. Traditionalists are \nmotivated toward God by the idea of\u0014\n                      punishment in hell. They sense the seriousness \nof sin. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But traditionalists may respond to the gospel \nonly out of fear of hell, unless I show them\u0014\n                      Jesus experienced not only pain in general on \nthe cross but hell in particular. This must\u0014\n                      be held up until they are attracted to Christ \nfor the beauty of the costly love of what he\u0014\n                      did. To the traditional person, hell must be \npreached as the only way to know how much\u0014\n                      Christ loved you. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    If we play down harsh doctrines, \u0014\n                                       we will gut our pleasant and \u0014\n                                         comfortable beliefs too. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Here is one way I have preached this: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Unless we come to grips with this terrible \ndoctrine, we will never even begin to\u0014\n                      understand the depths of what Jesus did for us \non the cross. His body was being\u0014\n                      destroyed in the worst possible way, but that \nwas a flea bite compared to what was\u0014\n                      happening to his soul. When he cried out that \nhis God had forsaken him, he was\u0014\n                      experiencing hell itself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"If a mild acquaintance denounces you and \nrejects youthat hurts. If a good friend does\u0014\n                      the samethe hurt's far worse. However, if your \nspouse walks out on you, saying, 'I never\u0014\n                      want to see you again,' that is far more \ndevastating still. The longer, deeper, and more\u0014\n                      intimate the relationship, the more torturous \nis any separation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"But the Son's relationship with the Father was \nbeginning-less and infinitely greater than\u0014\n                      the most intimate and passionate human \nrelationship. When Jesus was cut off from God,\u0014\n                      he went into the deepest pit and most powerful \nfurnace, beyond all imagining. And he did\u0014\n                      it voluntarily, for us.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How to preach hell to postmoderns\u0014\n                      In contrast to the traditionalist, the \npostmodern person is hostile to the very idea of hell.\u0014\n                      People with more secular and postmodern \nmindsets tend to have (a) only a vague belief in\u0014\n                      the divine, if at all, and (b) little sense of \nmoral absolutes, but rather a sense they need to\u0014\n                      be true to their dreams. They tend to be \nyounger, from nominal Catholic or non-religious\u0014\n                      Jewish backgrounds, from liberal mainline \nProtestant backgrounds, from the western and\u0014\n                      northeastern U. S., and Europeans. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When preaching hell to people of this mindset, \nI've found I must make four arguments. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1. Sin is slavery. I do not define sin as just \nbreaking the rules, but also as \"making\u0014\n                      something besides God our ultimate value and \nworth.\" These good things, which become\u0014\n                      gods, will drive us relentlessly, enslaving us \nmentally and spiritually, even to hell forever if\u0014\n                      we let them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I say, \"You are actually being religious, \nthough you don't know ityou are trying to find\u0014\n                      salvation through worshiping things that end up \ncontrolling you in a destructive way.\"\u0014\n                      Slavery is the choice-worshiper's horror. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      C. S. Lewis's depictions of hell are important \nfor postmodern people. In The Great\u0014\n                      Divorce, Lewis describes a busload of people \nfrom hell who come to the outskirts of\u0014\n                      heaven. There they are urged to leave behind \nthe sins that have trapped them in hell. The\u0014\n                      descriptions Lewis makes of people in hell are \nso striking because we recognize the\u0014\n                      denial and self-delusion of substance \naddictions. When addicted to alcohol, we are\u0014\n                      miserable, but we blame others and pity \nourselves; we do not take responsibility for our\u0014\n                      behavior nor see the roots of our problem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis writes, \"Hell  begins with a grumbling \nmood, and yourself still distinct from it:\u0014\n                      perhaps even criticizing it. You can repent \nand come out of it again. But there may\u0014\n                      come a day when you can do that no longer. Then \nthere will be no you left to criticize the\u0014\n                      mood or even enjoy it, but just the grumble \nitself going on forever like a machine.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Modern people struggle with the idea of God \nthinking up punishments to inflict on\u0014\n                      disobedient people. When sin is seen as \nslavery, and hell as the freely chosen, eternal\u0014\n                      skid row of the universe, hell becomes much \nmore comprehensible. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Here is an example from a recent sermon of how \nI try to explain this: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"First, sin separates us from the presence of \nGod (Isa. 59:2), which is the source of all\u0014\n                      joy (Ps. 16:11), love, wisdom, or good thing of \nany sort (James 1:17). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Second, to understand hell we must understand \nsin as slavery. Romans 1:21-25 tells us\u0014\n                      that we were built to live for God supremely, \nbut instead we live for love, work,\u0014\n                      achievement, or morality to give us meaning and \nworth. Thus every person, religious or\u0014\n                      not, is worshiping somethingidols, \npseudo-saviorsto get their worth. But these things\u0014\n                      enslave us with guilt (if we fail to attain \nthem) or anger (if someone blocks them from us)\u0014\n                      or fear (if they are threatened) or drivenness \n(since we must have them). Guilt, anger, and\u0014\n                      fear are like fire that destroys us. Sin is \nworshiping anything but Jesusand the wages of\u0014\n                      sin is slavery.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps the greatest paradox of all is that the \npeople on Lewis's bus from hell are\u0014\n                      enslaved because they freely choose to be. They \nwould rather have their freedom (as they\u0014\n                      define it) than salvation. Their relentless \ndelusion is that if they glorified God, they would\u0014\n                      lose their human greatness (Gen. 3:4-5), but \ntheir choice has really ruined their human\u0014\n                      greatness. Hell is, as Lewis says, \"the \ngreatest monument to human freedom.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. Hell is less exclusive than so-called \ntolerance. Nothing is more characteristic of the\u0014\n                      modern mindset than the statement: \"I think \nChrist is fine, but I believe a devout Muslim\u0014\n                      or Buddhist or even a good atheist will \ncertainly find God.\" A slightly different version is: \"I\u0014\n                      don't think God would send a person who lives a \ngood life to hell just for holding the wrong\u0014\n                      belief.\" This approach is seen as more \ninclusive. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In preaching about hell, then, I need to \ncounter this argument: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The universal religion of humankind is: We \ndevelop a good record and give it to God, and\u0014\n                      then he owes us. The gospel is: God develops a \ngood record and gives it to us, then we\u0014\n                      owe him (Rom. 1:17). In short, to say a good \nperson, not just Christians, can find God is\u0014\n                      to say good works are enough to find God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"You can believe that faith in Christ is not \nnecessary or you can believe that we are saved\u0014\n                      by grace, but you cannot believe in both at \nonce. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"So the apparently inclusive approach is really \nquite exclusive. It says, 'The good people\u0014\n                      can find God, and the bad people do not.' \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"But what about us moral failures? We are \nexcluded. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The gospel says, 'The people who know they \naren't good can find God, and the people\u0014\n                      who think they are good do not.' \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Then what about non-Christians, all of whom \nmust, by definition, believe their moral\u0014\n                      efforts help them reach God? They are excluded. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"So both approaches are exclusive, but the \ngospel's is the more inclusive exclusivity. It\u0014\n                      says joyfully, 'It doesn't matter who you are \nor what you've done. It doesn't matter if you've\u0014\n                      been at the gates of hell. You can be welcomed \nand embraced fully and instantly through\u0014\n                      Christ.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      3. Christianity's view of hell is more personal \nthan the alternative view. Fairly often, I\u0014\n                      meet people who say, \"I have a personal \nrelationship with a loving God, and yet I don't\u0014\n                      believe in Jesus Christ at all.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Why?\" I ask. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      They reply, \"My God is too loving to pour out \ninfinite suffering on anyone for sin.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But then a question remains: \"What did it cost \nthis kind of God to love us and embrace\u0014\n                      us? What did he endure in order to receive us? \nWhere did this God agonize, cry out?\u0014\n                      Where were his nails and thorns?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The only answer is: \"I don't think that was \nnecessary.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How ironic. In our effort to make God more \nloving, we have made God less loving. His\u0014\n                      love, in the end, needed to take no action. It \nwas sentimentality, not love at all. The\u0014\n                      worship of a God like this will be impersonal, \ncognitive, ethical. There will be no joyful\u0014\n                      self-abandonment, no humble boldness, no \nconstant sense of wonder. We would not sing\u0014\n                      to such a being, \"Love so amazing, so divine, \ndemands my soul, my life, my all.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The postmodern \"sensitive\" approach to the \nsubject of hell is actually quite impersonal. It\u0014\n                      says, \"It doesn't matter if you believe in the \nperson of Christ, as long as you follow his\u0014\n                      example.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But to say that is to say the essence of \nreligion is intellectual and ethical, not personal. If\u0014\n                      any good person can find God, then the \nessential core of religion is understanding and\u0014\n                      following the rules. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When preaching about hell, I try to show how \nimpersonal this view is: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"To say that any good person can find God is to \ncreate a religion without tears, without\u0014\n                      experience, without contact. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                              Hell is the freely\u0014\n                                           chosen, eternal skid \u0014\n                                           row of the universe. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The gospel certainly is not less than the \nunderstanding of truths and principles, but it is\u0014\n                      infinitely more. The essence of salvation is \nknowing a Person (John 17:3). As with\u0014\n                      knowing any person, there is repenting and \nweeping and rejoicing and encountering. The\u0014\n                      gospel calls us to a wildly passionate, \nintimate love relationship with Jesus Christ, and\u0014\n                      calls that 'the core of true salvation.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      4. There is no love without wrath. What rankles \npeople is the idea of judgment and the\u0014\n                      wrath of God: \"I can't believe in a God who \nsends people to suffer eternally. What kind of\u0014\n                      loving God is filled with wrath?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So in preaching about hell, we must explain \nthat a wrathless God cannot be a loving God.\u0014\n                      Here's how I tried to do that in one sermon: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"People ask, 'What kind of loving God is filled \nwith wrath?' But any loving person is often\u0014\n                      filled with wrath. In Hope Has Its Reasons, \nBecky Pippert writes, 'Think how we feel when\u0014\n                      we see someone we love ravaged by unwise \nactions or relationships. Do we respond with\u0014\n                      benign tolerance as we might toward strangers? \nFar from it. Anger isn't the opposite of\u0014\n                      love. Hate is, and the final form of hate is \nindifference.' \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Pippert then quotes E. H. Gifford, 'Human love \nhere offers a true analogy: the more a\u0014\n                      father loves his son, the more he hates in him \nthe drunkard, the liar, the traitor.' \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"She concludes: 'If I, a flawed narcissistic \nsinful woman, can feel this much pain and\u0014\n                      anger over someone's condition, how much more a \nmorally perfect God who made them?\u0014\n                      God's wrath is not a cranky explosion, but his \nsettled opposition to the cancer of sin\u0014\n                      which is eating out the insides of the human \nrace he loves with his whole being.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A God like this\u0014\n                      Following a recent sermon on the Parable of \nLazarus and the Rich Man, the post-service\u0014\n                      question-and-answer session was packed with \nmore than the usual number of attenders.\u0014\n                      The questions and comments focused on the \nsubject of eternal judgment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      My heart sank when a young college student \nsaid, \"I've gone to church all my life, but I\u0014\n                      don't think I can believe in a God like this.\" \nHer tone was more sad than defiant, but her\u0014\n                      willingness to stay and talk showed that her \nmind was open. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Usually all the questions are pitched to me, \nand I respond as best I can. But on this\u0014\n                      occasion people began answering one another. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      An older businesswoman said, \"Well, I'm not \nmuch of a churchgoer, and I'm in some\u0014\n                      shock now. I always disliked the very idea of \nhell, but I never thought about it as a\u0014\n                      measure of what God was willing to endure in \norder to love me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then a mature Christian made a connection with \na sermon a month ago on Jesus at\u0014\n                      Lazarus' tomb in John 11. \"The text tells us \nthat Jesus wept,\" he said, \"yet he was also\u0014\n                      extremely angry at evil. That's helped me. He \nis not just an angry God or a weeping,\u0014\n                      loving Godhe's both. He doesn't only judge \nevil, but he also takes the hell and judgment\u0014\n                      himself for us on the cross.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The second woman nodded, \"Yes. I always thought \nhell told me about how angry God\u0014\n                      was with us, but I didn't know it also told me \nabout how much he was willing to suffer and\u0014\n                      weep for us. I never knew how much hell told me \nabout Jesus' love. It's very moving.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is only because of the doctrine of judgment \nand hell that Jesus' proclamation of grace\u0014\n                      and love are so brilliant and astounding. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tim Keller is pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian \nChurch in New York City. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1997 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/Leadership\u0014\n                      Journal.

    "words": "Preaching Hell in a Tolerant Age\u0014\n      Brimstone for the broad-minded.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      by Tim Keller\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The young man in my office was impeccably \ndressed\u0014\nand articulate. He was an Ivy\u0014\n                      League MBA, successful in the financial world, \nand\u0014\nhad lived in three countries before age\u0014\n                      30. Raised in a family with only the loosest\u0014\nconnections to a mainline church, he had\u0014\n                      little understanding of Christianity.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      I was therefore gratified to learn of his \nintense\u0014\nspiritual interest, recently piqued as he\u0014\n                      attended our church. He said he was ready to\u0014\nembrace the gospel. But there was a final\u0014\n                      obstacle.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"You've said that if we do not believe in \nChrist,\"\u0014\nhe said, \"we are lost and condemned. I'm\u0014\n                      sorry, I just cannot buy that. I work with some\u0014\nfine people who are Muslim, Jewish, or\u0014\n                      agnostic. I cannot believe they are going to \nhell\u0014\njust because they don't believe in Jesus.\u0014\n                      In fact, I cannot reconcile the very idea of \nhell\u0014\nwith a loving Godeven if he is holy too.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      This young man expressed what may be the main\u0014\nobjection contemporary secular people\u0014\n                      make to the Christian message. (A close second, \nin\u0014\nmy experience, is the problem of\u0014\n                      suffering and evil.) Moderns reject the idea of\u0014\nfinal judgment and hell.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Thus, it's tempting to avoid such topics in our\u0014\npreaching. But neglecting the unpleasant\u0014\n                      doctrines of the historic faith will bring about\u0014\ncounter-intuitive consequences. There is an\u0014\n                      ecological balance to scriptural truth that must\u0014\nnot be disturbed.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      If an area is rid of its predatory or \nundesirable\u0014\nanimals, the balance of that environment\u0014\n                      may be so upset that the desirable plants and\u0014\nanimals are lostthrough overbreeding\u0014\n                      with a limited food supply. The nasty predator\u0014\nthat was eliminated actually kept in\u0014\n                      balance the number of other animals and plants\u0014\nnecessary to that particular ecosystem.\u0014\n                      In the same way, if we play down \"bad\" or harsh\u0014\ndoctrines within the historic Christian\u0014\n                      faith, we will find, to our shock, that we have\u0014\ngutted all our pleasant and comfortable\u0014\n                      beliefs, too.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The loss of the doctrine of hell and judgment \nand\u0014\nthe holiness of God does irreparable\u0014\n                      damage to our deepest comfortsour understanding\u0014\nof God's grace and love and of our\u0014\n                      human dignity and value to him. To preach the \ngood\u0014\nnews, we must preach the bad.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      But in this age of tolerance, how?\u0014\n \u0014\n                      How to preach hell to traditionalists\u0014\n                      Before preaching on the subject of hell, I must\u0014\nrecognize that today, a congregation is\u0014\n                      made up of two groups: traditionalists and\u0014\npostmoderns. The two hear the message of\u0014\n                      hell completely differently.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      People from traditional cultures and mindsets \ntend\u0014\nto have (a) a belief in God, and (b) a\u0014\n                      strong sense of moral absolutes and the \nobligation\u0014\nto be good. These people tend to be\u0014\n                      older, from strong Catholic or religious Jewish\u0014\nbackgrounds, from conservative\u0014\n                      evangelical/Pentecostal Protestant backgrounds,\u0014\nfrom the southern U.S., and first-generation immigrants from \nnon-European\u0014\ncountries.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The way to show traditional persons their need \nfor\u0014\nthe gospel is by saying, \"Your sin\u0014\n                      separates you from God! You can't be righteous\u0014\nenough for him.\" Imperfection is the\u0014\n                      duty-worshiper's horror. Traditionalists are\u0014\nmotivated toward God by the idea of\u0014\n                      punishment in hell. They sense the seriousness \nof\u0014\nsin.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      But traditionalists may respond to the gospel \nonly\u0014\nout of fear of hell, unless I show them\u0014\n                      Jesus experienced not only pain in general on \nthe\u0014\ncross but hell in particular. This must\u0014\n                      be held up until they are attracted to Christ \nfor\u0014\nthe beauty of the costly love of what he\u0014\n                      did. To the traditional person, hell must be\u0014\npreached as the only way to know how much\u0014\n                      Christ loved you.\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n                                    If we play down harsh doctrines,\u0014\n                                       we will gut our pleasant and\u0014\n                                         comfortable beliefs too.\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n                      Here is one way I have preached this:\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"Unless we come to grips with this terrible\u0014\ndoctrine, we will never even begin to\u0014\n                      understand the depths of what Jesus did for us \non\u0014\nthe cross. His body was being\u0014\n                      destroyed in the worst possible way, but that \nwas\u0014\na flea bite compared to what was\u0014\n                      happening to his soul. When he cried out that \nhis\u0014\nGod had forsaken him, he was\u0014\n                      experiencing hell itself.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"If a mild acquaintance denounces you and \nrejects\u0014\nyouthat hurts. If a good friend does\u0014\n                      the samethe hurt's far worse. However, if your\u0014\nspouse walks out on you, saying, 'I never\u0014\n                      want to see you again,' that is far more\u0014\ndevastating still. The longer, deeper, and more\u0014\n                      intimate the relationship, the more torturous is\u0014\nany separation.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"But the Son's relationship with the Father was\u0014\nbeginning-less and infinitely greater than\u0014\n                      the most intimate and passionate human\u0014\nrelationship. When Jesus was cut off from God,\u0014\n                      he went into the deepest pit and most powerful\u0014\nfurnace, beyond all imagining. And he did\u0014\n                      it voluntarily, for us.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      How to preach hell to postmoderns\u0014\n                      In contrast to the traditionalist, the \npostmodern\u0014\nperson is hostile to the very idea of hell.\u0014\n                      People with more secular and postmodern mindsets\u0014\ntend to have (a) only a vague belief in\u0014\n                      the divine, if at all, and (b) little sense of\u0014\nmoral absolutes, but rather a sense they need to\u0014\n                      be true to their dreams. They tend to be \nyounger,\u0014\nfrom nominal Catholic or non-religious\u0014\n                      Jewish backgrounds, from liberal mainline\u0014\nProtestant backgrounds, from the western and\u0014\n                      northeastern U. S., and Europeans.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      When preaching hell to people of this mindset,\u0014\nI've found I must make four arguments.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      1. Sin is slavery. I do not define sin as just\u0014\nbreaking the rules, but also as \"making\u0014\n                      something besides God our ultimate value and\u0014\nworth.\" These good things, which become\u0014\n                      gods, will drive us relentlessly, enslaving us\u0014\nmentally and spiritually, even to hell forever if\u0014\n                      we let them.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      I say, \"You are actually being religious, though\u0014\nyou don't know ityou are trying to find\u0014\n                      salvation through worshiping things that end up\u0014\ncontrolling you in a destructive way.\"\u0014\n                      Slavery is the choice-worshiper's horror.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      C. S. Lewis's depictions of hell are important \nfor\u0014\npostmodern people. In The Great\u0014\n                      Divorce, Lewis describes a busload of people \nfrom\u0014\nhell who come to the outskirts of\u0014\n                      heaven. There they are urged to leave behind the\u0014\nsins that have trapped them in hell. The\u0014\n                      descriptions Lewis makes of people in hell are \nso\u0014\nstriking because we recognize the\u0014\n                      denial and self-delusion of substance \naddictions.\u0014\nWhen addicted to alcohol, we are\u0014\n                      miserable, but we blame others and pity \nourselves;\u0014\nwe do not take responsibility for our\u0014\n                      behavior nor see the roots of our problem.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Lewis writes, \"Hell  begins with a grumbling\u0014\nmood, and yourself still distinct from it:\u0014\n                      perhaps even criticizing it. You can repent and\u0014\ncome out of it again. But there may\u0014\n                      come a day when you can do that no longer. Then\u0014\nthere will be no you left to criticize the\u0014\n                      mood or even enjoy it, but just the grumble \nitself\u0014\ngoing on forever like a machine.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Modern people struggle with the idea of God\u0014\nthinking up punishments to inflict on\u0014\n                      disobedient people. When sin is seen as slavery,\u0014\nand hell as the freely chosen, eternal\u0014\n                      skid row of the universe, hell becomes much more\u0014\ncomprehensible.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Here is an example from a recent sermon of how I\u0014\ntry to explain this:\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"First, sin separates us from the presence of \nGod\u0014\n(Isa. 59:2), which is the source of all\u0014\n                      joy (Ps. 16:11), love, wisdom, or good thing of\u0014\nany sort (James 1:17).\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"Second, to understand hell we must understand \nsin\u0014\nas slavery. Romans 1:21-25 tells us\u0014\n                      that we were built to live for God supremely, \nbut\u0014\ninstead we live for love, work,\u0014\n                      achievement, or morality to give us meaning and\u0014\nworth. Thus every person, religious or\u0014\n                      not, is worshiping somethingidols,\u0014\npseudo-saviorsto get their worth. But these things\u0014\n                      enslave us with guilt (if we fail to attain \nthem)\u0014\nor anger (if someone blocks them from us)\u0014\n                      or fear (if they are threatened) or drivenness\u0014\n(since we must have them). Guilt, anger, and\u0014\n                      fear are like fire that destroys us. Sin is\u0014\nworshiping anything but Jesusand the wages of\u0014\n                      sin is slavery.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Perhaps the greatest paradox of all is that the\u0014\npeople on Lewis's bus from hell are\u0014\n                      enslaved because they freely choose to be. They\u0014\nwould rather have their freedom (as they\u0014\n                      define it) than salvation. Their relentless\u0014\ndelusion is that if they glorified God, they would\u0014\n                      lose their human greatness (Gen. 3:4-5), but \ntheir\u0014\nchoice has really ruined their human\u0014\n                      greatness. Hell is, as Lewis says, \"the greatest\u0014\nmonument to human freedom.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      2. Hell is less exclusive than so-called\u0014\ntolerance. Nothing is more characteristic of the\u0014\n                      modern mindset than the statement: \"I think \nChrist\u0014\nis fine, but I believe a devout Muslim\u0014\n                      or Buddhist or even a good atheist will \ncertainly\u0014\nfind God.\" A slightly different version is: \"I\u0014\n                      don't think God would send a person who lives a\u0014\ngood life to hell just for holding the wrong\u0014\n                      belief.\" This approach is seen as more \ninclusive.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      In preaching about hell, then, I need to counter\u0014\nthis argument:\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"The universal religion of humankind is: We\u0014\ndevelop a good record and give it to God, and\u0014\n                      then he owes us. The gospel is: God develops a\u0014\ngood record and gives it to us, then we\u0014\n                      owe him (Rom. 1:17). In short, to say a good\u0014\nperson, not just Christians, can find God is\u0014\n                      to say good works are enough to find God.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"You can believe that faith in Christ is not\u0014\nnecessary or you can believe that we are saved\u0014\n                      by grace, but you cannot believe in both at \nonce.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"So the apparently inclusive approach is really\u0014\nquite exclusive. It says, 'The good people\u0014\n                      can find God, and the bad people do not.'\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"But what about us moral failures? We are\u0014\nexcluded.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"The gospel says, 'The people who know they \naren't\u0014\ngood can find God, and the people\u0014\n                      who think they are good do not.'\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"Then what about non-Christians, all of whom \nmust,\u0014\nby definition, believe their moral\u0014\n                      efforts help them reach God? They are excluded.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"So both approaches are exclusive, but the\u0014\ngospel's is the more inclusive exclusivity. It\u0014\n                      says joyfully, 'It doesn't matter who you are or\u0014\nwhat you've done. It doesn't matter if you've\u0014\n                      been at the gates of hell. You can be welcomed \nand\u0014\nembraced fully and instantly through\u0014\n                      Christ.' \"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      3. Christianity's view of hell is more personal\u0014\nthan the alternative view. Fairly often, I\u0014\n                      meet people who say, \"I have a personal\u0014\nrelationship with a loving God, and yet I don't\u0014\n                      believe in Jesus Christ at all.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"Why?\" I ask.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      They reply, \"My God is too loving to pour out\u0014\ninfinite suffering on anyone for sin.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      But then a question remains: \"What did it cost\u0014\nthis kind of God to love us and embrace\u0014\n                      us? What did he endure in order to receive us?\u0014\nWhere did this God agonize, cry out?\u0014\n                      Where were his nails and thorns?\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The only answer is: \"I don't think that was\u0014\nnecessary.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      How ironic. In our effort to make God more \nloving,\u0014\nwe have made God less loving. His\u0014\n                      love, in the end, needed to take no action. It \nwas\u0014\nsentimentality, not love at all. The\u0014\n                      worship of a God like this will be impersonal,\u0014\ncognitive, ethical. There will be no joyful\u0014\n                      self-abandonment, no humble boldness, no \nconstant\u0014\nsense of wonder. We would not sing\u0014\n                      to such a being, \"Love so amazing, so divine,\u0014\ndemands my soul, my life, my all.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The postmodern \"sensitive\" approach to the \nsubject\u0014\nof hell is actually quite impersonal. It\u0014\n                      says, \"It doesn't matter if you believe in the\u0014\nperson of Christ, as long as you follow his\u0014\n                      example.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      But to say that is to say the essence of \nreligion\u0014\nis intellectual and ethical, not personal. If\u0014\n                      any good person can find God, then the essential\u0014\ncore of religion is understanding and\u0014\n                      following the rules.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      When preaching about hell, I try to show how\u0014\nimpersonal this view is:\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"To say that any good person can find God is to\u0014\ncreate a religion without tears, without\u0014\n                      experience, without contact.\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n                                              Hell is the freely\u0014\n                                           chosen, eternal skid\u0014\n                                           row of the universe.\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"The gospel certainly is not less than the\u0014\nunderstanding of truths and principles, but it is\u0014\n                      infinitely more. The essence of salvation is\u0014\nknowing a Person (John 17:3). As with\u0014\n                      knowing any person, there is repenting and \nweeping\u0014\nand rejoicing and encountering. The\u0014\n                      gospel calls us to a wildly passionate, intimate\u0014\nlove relationship with Jesus Christ, and\u0014\n                      calls that 'the core of true salvation.' \"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      4. There is no love without wrath. What rankles\u0014\npeople is the idea of judgment and the\u0014\n                      wrath of God: \"I can't believe in a God who \nsends\u0014\npeople to suffer eternally. What kind of\u0014\n                      loving God is filled with wrath?\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      So in preaching about hell, we must explain \nthat a\u0014\nwrathless God cannot be a loving God.\u0014\n                      Here's how I tried to do that in one sermon:\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"People ask, 'What kind of loving God is filled\u0014\nwith wrath?' But any loving person is often\u0014\n                      filled with wrath. In Hope Has Its Reasons, \nBecky\u0014\nPippert writes, 'Think how we feel when\u0014\n                      we see someone we love ravaged by unwise actions\u0014\nor relationships. Do we respond with\u0014\n                      benign tolerance as we might toward strangers? \nFar\u0014\nfrom it. Anger isn't the opposite of\u0014\n                      love. Hate is, and the final form of hate is\u0014\nindifference.'\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"Pippert then quotes E. H. Gifford, 'Human love\u0014\nhere offers a true analogy: the more a\u0014\n                      father loves his son, the more he hates in him \nthe\u0014\ndrunkard, the liar, the traitor.'\u0014\n \u0014\n                      \"She concludes: 'If I, a flawed narcissistic\u0014\nsinful woman, can feel this much pain and\u0014\n                      anger over someone's condition, how much more a\u0014\nmorally perfect God who made them?\u0014\n                      God's wrath is not a cranky explosion, but his\u0014\nsettled opposition to the cancer of sin\u0014\n                      which is eating out the insides of the human \nrace\u0014\nhe loves with his whole being.' \"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      A God like this\u0014\n                      Following a recent sermon on the Parable of\u0014\nLazarus and the Rich Man, the post-service\u0014\n                      question-and-answer session was packed with more\u0014\nthan the usual number of attenders.\u0014\n                      The questions and comments focused on the \nsubject\u0014\nof eternal judgment.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      My heart sank when a young college student said,\u0014\n\"I've gone to church all my life, but I\u0014\n                      don't think I can believe in a God like this.\" \nHer\u0014\ntone was more sad than defiant, but her\u0014\n                      willingness to stay and talk showed that her \nmind\u0014\nwas open.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Usually all the questions are pitched to me, \nand I\u0014\nrespond as best I can. But on this\u0014\n                      occasion people began answering one another.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      An older businesswoman said, \"Well, I'm not much\u0014\nof a churchgoer, and I'm in some\u0014\n                      shock now. I always disliked the very idea of\u0014\nhell, but I never thought about it as a\u0014\n                      measure of what God was willing to endure in \norder\u0014\nto love me.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Then a mature Christian made a connection with a\u0014\nsermon a month ago on Jesus at\u0014\n                      Lazarus' tomb in John 11. \"The text tells us \nthat\u0014\nJesus wept,\" he said, \"yet he was also\u0014\n                      extremely angry at evil. That's helped me. He is\u0014\nnot just an angry God or a weeping,\u0014\n                      loving Godhe's both. He doesn't only judge \nevil,\u0014\nbut he also takes the hell and judgment\u0014\n                      himself for us on the cross.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      The second woman nodded, \"Yes. I always thought\u0014\nhell told me about how angry God\u0014\n                      was with us, but I didn't know it also told me\u0014\nabout how much he was willing to suffer and\u0014\n                      weep for us. I never knew how much hell told me\u0014\nabout Jesus' love. It's very moving.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n                      It is only because of the doctrine of judgment \nand\u0014\nhell that Jesus' proclamation of grace\u0014\n                      and love are so brilliant and astounding.\u0014\n \u0014\n                      Tim Keller is pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian\u0014\nChurch in New York City.\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n                      Copyright  1997 by the author or Christianity\u0014\nToday International/Leadership\u0014\n                      Journal.\u0014",

    "title": "PRIEST CONFESSES BEING AN INFORMER",
    "words": "The Associated Press, Mon 26 Mar 2001\u0014\n\u0014\n              BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  A Romanian Orthodox priest \nand scholar  \u0014\n              confessed to being an informer for Romania's \ncommunist-era secret police on \u0014\n              Monday and urged other clerics to follow his example \nfor ``national  \u0014\n               reconciliation.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n              Eugen Jurca, a professor at the Orthodox Theology \nFaculty in the western city of\u0014\n              Timisoara, made the confession in a letter published in \ntwo newspapers. He said\u0014\n              he had supplied information about religious books that \nentered the country but\u0014\n              gave no other details. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Jurca is the first cleric to confess in such a public \nmanner. Like other public\u0014\n              figures, many priests and monks were coerced into being \ncollaborators with\u0014\n              Romania's former communist regime. \u0014\n\u0014\n              ``The truth must be known, however painful and shameful \nit may be,'' Jurca wrote.\u0014\n              ``I think this process of freedom and personal dignity \n... should start with the\u0014\n              church.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n              More than 11 years have passed since communist rule \nended, yet there has \u0014\n              been more unwillingness in Romania than in some other \nformer Soviet Bloc \u0014\n              countries to disclose what happened during the \ncommunist years. This is partly \u0014\n              because former officers and collaborators of the secret \npolice, known as the \u0014\n              Securitate, are believed to hold key positions in mass \nmedia, politics and \u0014\n              business. \u0014\n\u0014\n              ``National reconciliation is not possible without us \nexorcizing this moral  \u0014\n              ambiguity in which we have been vegetating for over a \ndecade,'' Jurca's letter \u0014\n              said. The letter comes after a newspaper published the \nSecuritate file of the head               of the Romanian Orthodox \nChurch. The file alleged he had taken part in a    \u0014\n              rampage on a synagogue in 1941 and had been a \nhomosexual. The church \u0014\n              called the claims  libelous. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Under a law passed in 1999, Romania's estimated 125 \nmillion secret police files\u0014\n              are slowly being opened. However, so far no major \nfigures have been exposed as\u0014\n              former collaborators, and many doubt the process will \nbe fair. Ordinary\u0014\n              Romanians have yet to see their files despite a law \nallowing them to do so. \u0014\n\u0014\n              President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian \nNastase, leaders of the left-wing\u0014\n              administration, have criticized the publication of the \nfiles, suggesting the past is\u0014\n              no longer relevant. The council that releases the files \nhas not produced any\u0014\n              documentation referring to Iliescu or Nastase. \u0014\n\u0014\n              The Securitate relied on as many as 700,000 informers \nto keep tabs on\u0014\n              Romania's population of 22 million. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Jurca said he had signed a contract with the secret \npolice in 1980 out of ``fear,\u0014\n              cowardliness, ignorance, and despair.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n              Under the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, religious \nactivity was limited. In the\u0014\n              last decade of communism, 17 churches were demolished. \u0014\n\u0014\n              Copyright 2001 Associated Press.

The latter\u0014\n                      case, though hardly drawing the same attention, \nmay\u0014\n                      nonetheless have even graver implications for \nour nation's\u0014\n                      future. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The controversy over Cash arises from a \ngruesome case last\u0014\n                      year in which a California teenager, Jeremy \nStrohmeyer,\u0014\n                      sexually molested and murdered a seven-year-old \ngirl in a Las\u0014\n                      Vegas casino. Cash witnessed what his friend \nwas doing but\u0014\n                      did not stop him and later agreed to keep \nquiet. Just weeks\u0014\n                      ago Strohmeyer pled guilty to sexual assault \nand murder. But\u0014\n                      failing to prevent a crime is not itself a \ncrime, so Cash blithely\u0014\n                      finished high school and went on to Berkeley. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today he remains defiantly unrepentant. \"Were \nyou appalled\u0014\n                      that a friend said he had killed a little \ngirl?\" the Los Angeles\u0014\n                      Times asked him. Cash answered: \"I'm not going \nto get upset\u0014\n                      over someone else's life. I just worry about \nmyself first.\"\u0014\n                      Seventy-five outraged citizens gathered outside \nCash's\u0014\n                      dormitory with bullhorns, shouting, \"Expel \nhim!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What most people overlook, however, is that \nCash's attitude\u0014\n                      accords precisely with the postmodernist \nphilosophy\u0014\n                      propagated by places like Berkeley. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The core of postmodernism is a rejection of \nuniversal truth\u0014\n                      claims and moral principles. And if there are \nno universal\u0014\n                      ideals linking us together, then logically all \nthat's left are\u0014\n                      \"tribes\": identity groups based on race, \nethnicity, gender, or\u0014\n                      whatever. That's why virtually every state \nuniversity today has\u0014\n                      separate dorms for students who are black, \nAsian, Hispanic,\u0014\n                      homosexual, or any other group demanding a \nseparate\u0014\n                      identity. No one is permitted to judge another \ngroup's actions\u0014\n                      or beliefs, because there is no recognition of \nultimate truths\u0014\n                      binding on everyone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      These ideas percolate down from academia to \nshape our\u0014\n                      moral attitudes. On a radio talk show, Cash \nsaid, \"It's a tragic\u0014\n                      event, okay. But the simple fact remains that I \ndo not know\u0014\n                      this girl. The only person I knew in this event \nwas Jeremy\u0014\n                      Strohmeyer.\" In other words, the victim was not \na member of\u0014\n                      his \"tribe,\" his identity group. Strohmeyer \nwas. His only\u0014\n                      obligation, he concluded, was to his buddy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Expel him from Berkeley? No: Make him its \nposter boy.\u0014\n                      Cash's moral indifference is the inevitable \nresult of today's\u0014\n                      trendy campus ideology; his actions are \npostmodernist logic\u0014\n                      carried to its grotesque conclusion. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This murder is one more bone-chilling example \nof teens\u0014\n                      slaying in cold blood, without remorse or \nconscience. Over\u0014\n                      recent months, several children have walked \ninto schoolyards\u0014\n                      across the country and fired on their \nclassmatesin\u0014\n                      Arkansas, Oregon, Kentucky, Mississippi, and \nPennsylvania.\u0014\n                      The press and other pundits have cast about for \nexplanations.\u0014\n                      President Clinton announced that we need \nstricter gun\u0014\n                      controls; but in almost every case, the guns \nwere registered.\u0014\n                      Other explanations offered for crime are \npoverty or race; but\u0014\n                      these kids were middle class and white. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What is frightening is precisely how normal \nmost of them\u0014\n                      seem. In New Jersey, Amy Grossburg and her \nboyfriend\u0014\n                      checked into a hotel room, gave birth, and \nkilled the baby.\u0014\n                      Another teen, the \"Prom Mom,\" gave birth in a \nrestroom,\u0014\n                      dumped the baby in the trash, and returned to \nfinish the\u0014\n                      dance. These were normal, ordinary teensexcept \nthat they\u0014\n                      murdered their babies, violating the most \nprimal human\u0014\n                      instinct. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Reporters have raised all the conventional \nexplanations\u0014\n                      except one. They could not bring themselves to \nuse the\u0014\n                      dreaded \"m-word\": morality. The truth is that \nAmericans are\u0014\n                      losing their moral recognition of the universal \ndignity of human\u0014\n                      life. Like Cash, they dehumanize their victims. \nIn the\u0014\n                      sentencing of Amy Grossburg, the judge said he \nwas troubled\u0014\n                      by \"an egocentricity that blinded you tothe \nintrinsic value of\u0014\n                      the life of the child.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Where are the adults who are supposed to teach \nthese kids\u0014\n                      \"the intrinsic value of human life? Adults who \nonce gave firm\u0014\n                      moral directionparents, pastors, teacherstoo \noften buy\u0014\n                      the myth that they should refrain from teaching \nkids right from\u0014\n                      wrong but rather let them discover their own \nvalues. Other\u0014\n                      adults are busy producing and selling \nentertainment that\u0014\n                      glorifies violence, teaching kids exactly the \nwrong things.\u0014\n                      Strohmeyer told police he strangled the little \ngirl by twisting\u0014\n                      her neck the way he had seen in movies. We are \nraising a\u0014\n                      generation of children conditioned to kill. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's enough to make one despair of American \ncivilization itself.\u0014\n                      But as Christians, we should resist that \ntemptation and\u0014\n                      instead turn social breakdown into an \nopportunity to make a\u0014\n                      compelling case for biblical morality. One \nstrategy for\u0014\n                      evangelism, Francis Schaeffer taught, is to \npress people to\u0014\n                      the logical conclusions of their basic \npresuppositions: to\u0014\n                      show people that their assumptions, if lived \nout consistently,\u0014\n                      would lead to destructive and inhumane \nconsequences.\u0014\n                      Today people are beginning to recognize the \nsoul-destroying\u0014\n                      consequences of postmodernism, and now is the \ntime to\u0014\n                      press them to see the wisdom of biblical truth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When kids kill kids, people can no longer \ntolerate the chaos\u0014\n                      created by moral autonomy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The bill on postmodernism is coming due. Either \nwe will pay\u0014\n                      its bloody price, or find our way back to the \ntruths that make\u0014\n                      civilization possible. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1998 by the author or Christianity \nToday\u0014\n                      International/Christianity Today magazine.

    "words": "Preventing teen suicide: It starts with \nstraight\u0014\n                       talk \u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. News and World Report, 12/20/99\u0014\n\u0014\n                       By Anna Mulrine \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Jessica Bedard remembers the first time she \nmade a plan\u0014\n                       to kill herself: She was 9 years old and away \nat camp. \"I just\u0014\n                       felt so sad, and frustrated because I didn't \nknow why.\" When\u0014\n                       she recovered from her first suicide attempt, \nat age 13, she\u0014\n                       told her gymnastics coach. He said she was \nlooking for\u0014\n                       attention. \"I walked away feeling stupid, like \nI couldn't tell\u0014\n                       anybody about it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                       And she didn'tuntil just before her high \nschool graduation,\u0014\n                       when she swallowed enough pills to land her in \na coma for\u0014\n                       three days. It was only after she awoke that \nBedard, the\u0014\n                       class salutatorian, spoke with a counselor for \nthe first time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       MTV ads. Bedard's story is the mental health \ncommunity's\u0014\n                       recurring nightmare. While teens are taking \nfewer drugs\u0014\n                       than they have in years, suicide remains a \nproblem so\u0014\n                       entrenched that it is prompting the medical \ncommunity to\u0014\n                       re-evaluate how it identifies and treats \nsuicidal adolescents.\u0014\n                       The result has been a flurry of prevention \ninitiatives,\u0014\n                       including an MTV ad campaign set to launch \nnext year that\u0014\n                       aims to destigmatize therapy for depressed \nteens. And\u0014\n                       more than 500 schools are expected to offer \n\"depression\u0014\n                       screenings\" next year. Experts say the efforts \nare long\u0014\n                       overdue: According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and\u0014\n                       Prevention, 8 percent of students in grades 9 \nthrough 12\u0014\n                       attempted suicide in the past year. And in the \npast two\u0014\n                       decades, the suicide rate among children ages \n10 to 14\u0014\n                       has doubled.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       At the same time, mental health professionals \nare in\u0014\n                       widespread agreement that many school-based \nprograms,\u0014\n                       which could be a valuable gateway to diagnosis \nand\u0014\n                       treatment, simply aren't working. A study \nreleased last week\u0014\n                       found that barely one third of school \ncounselors thought they\u0014\n                       could recognize the warning signs of a \nsuicidal student.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Much of the problem, says James Mazza, a \npsychologist at\u0014\n                       the University of Washington, is rooted in \nschools' tendency\u0014\n                       to sidestep discussions of psychological \nillnesses, which\u0014\n                       affect up to 90 percent of suicidal teens. \nInstead, some\u0014\n                       discuss suicide as a random, impulsive actan \napproach\u0014\n                       that has proved to be flawed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Kelsey Bartel, 16, says that her community in \nPierre, S.D.,\u0014\n                       avoided talking about depression and suicide \nfor\u0014\n                       yearsalthough nine kids committed suicide at \nher school.\u0014\n                       One was her brother. It was just a year after \nhe died that\u0014\n                       Bartel tried to end her own life as well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       It is these sorts of tragedies that depression \nscreenings,\u0014\n                       already used in at least 30 schools, hope to \nprevent.\u0014\n                       Students answer questions such as: Has there \never been a\u0014\n                       time when nothing was fun for you? Have you \never been so\u0014\n                       restless you just had to keep walking around? \nStudents can\u0014\n                       meet with a counselor, who might address \nromantic\u0014\n                       breakups and other transitions that can \ntrigger suicidal\u0014\n                       thoughts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Teenage depression can be hard to spot. \n\"There's this myth\u0014\n                       of the adolescent mood swing,\" says Kay \nJamison, author\u0014\n                       of Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide. \n\"But even in the\u0014\n                       teen years, your child shouldn't seem like a \ndifferent\u0014\n                       person.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Jamison urges parents to \"Ask your child \ndirectly if he's ever\u0014\n                       thought of killing himself.\" And, she says, \nbroach the subject\u0014\n                       by telling kids depression affects one fifth \nof women and\u0014\n                       one tenth of men at some point and may run in \nfamilies, as\u0014\n                       it did in Bartel's. Then add, \"Chances are, \nyou won't get\u0014\n                       depressed. But if you do, you don't need to \nlive with it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Community awareness, says Jamison, may help \nprevent\u0014\n                       conversations like the one Jessica Bedard, now \n24 and\u0014\n                       married with two children, had with her \ngymnastics coach.\u0014\n                       \"Suicide attempts aren't stunts,\" says Douglas \nJacobs,\u0014\n                       associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard \nUniversity.\u0014\n                       \"When you're suicidal, you can feel equally \nstrongly about\u0014\n                       two completely opposing forcesthe desire to \ndie and the\u0014\n                       desire to live.\" And that, he says, is both \nsuicide's specter\u0014\n                       and its beacon of hope. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       What to ask \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Is it \"normal?\" Teens and adults with \ndepression may\u0014\n                       behave differently. Adults might be sad; teens \nmay be\u0014\n                       agitated or restless.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Are sleep patterns changing? Insomnia is not \nnormal for\u0014\n                       teens; neither is staying in bed 14 to 18 \nhours a day.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Is he withdrawing? Teens are less likely to \npull back from\u0014\n                       friends than from family. If you're worried, \nask your child's\u0014\n                       friends.\u0014",

    "title": "PASS BY ON THE OTHER SIDE",
    "words": "Pass By on the Other Side\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the February 1994 issue of Reader's Digest there is a story of how \nGod's\u0014\nSpirit helped one man fight the impulse to pass by on the other side. \nOn\u0014\nSeptember 26, 1944, Ray Hamley, an RAF flying officer, and his crew \nflying\u0014\nan American-built B-25, dropped bombs on the town of Kleve just \noutside\u0014\nGermany's border with Holland. Ray was 21 years old, and his bombs \nthat day\u0014\nhit the railroad station, a number of Nazi factories, and the town \nchurch.\u0014\nHe had an inkling that day that one of his bombs hit the church, but \nwar was\u0014\nwar. That day in 1944 a young woman in Kleve mourned not only the \nloss of\u0014\nher church, but the loss of her parents who happened to live in a \nhouse next\u0014\nto the church. For the town of Kleve, 647 civilians and 879 military\u0014\npersonnel would die before the Second World War was over.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Ray Hamley went home to England after the war, married his\u0014\nchildhood sweetheart, and became the head of a primary school. But \nthen in\u0014\n1983, someone handed Ray a newspaper clipping that showed how the \npeople of\u0014\na little town in Holland named Kleve were rebuilding the Church of \nSt. Mary\u0014\nthat had been bombed during the war. Something triggered in Ray's \nmemory. He\u0014\nfound his old logbook in the attic, and suddenly realized that it had \nbeen\u0014\nhis bomb that had destroyed the church back in 1944.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn impulse was born in his heart as he thought about that tiny town, \nand how\u0014\nthe loss of their church must have touched those people. But then \ncame the\u0014\ntemptation to pass by on the other side. He says he thought to \nhimself,\u0014\n\"Come on, Ray, after all, the Nazis bombed innocent children in \nLondon and\u0014\nWarsaw; it was wartime; it was years ago; forget it, Ray, and get on \nwith\u0014\nyour life; it's not your concern.\" But thank God, Ray Hamley did not \nlet\u0014\nthose second thoughts win out. He wrote to the Mayor of Kleve, asking \nfor\u0014\nthe forgiveness of the townspeople, and requesting that his letter be \nread\u0014\nby the priest at the dedication of the new church building. In 1984, \nRay got\u0014\na reply from the people of Kleve, requesting that he and his family \ncome and\u0014\nsee the new church building. But again, those second thoughts \nattacked Ray,\u0014\nand he could not even answer the letter.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce more the parish priest in Kleve wrote to Ray, this time with a \nletter\u0014\nsigned by 500 parishioners offering their forgiveness in the name of \nJesus\u0014\nChrist! Ray Hamley went to Kleve. His visit not only healed old \nwounds in\u0014\nhis life, but has brought about an incredible reconciliation between \nRay's\u0014\nhometown in England and the people of Kleve in Holland. And it all \nhappened\u0014\nbecause by the power of God, Ray Hamley was able to conquer his second\u0014\nthoughts, and not pass by on the other side! For Ray Hamley, this was \na\u0014\nturning point in his life.\u0014",

    "title": "PRAYING FOR HOPE",
    "words": "Praying for Hope\u0014\n                      What a dying infant taught her mother about \nGod's ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Nancy Guthrie | posted 7/21/00\u0014\n                      This is my fault. I didn't pray enough for a \nhealthy baby. That\u0014\n                      was my thought in the hours after we received \nour daughter\u0014\n                      Hope's diagnosis. She was in her second day of \nlife and\u0014\n                      numerous \"small\" problems pointed to a larger \nproblem. The\u0014\n                      geneticist told us Hope had a rare metabolic \ndisorder called\u0014\n                      Zellweger syndrome. He explained that because \nshe was\u0014\n                      missing a subcellular particle called \nperoxisomes, her systems\u0014\n                      would slowly become toxic and shut down. \"Most \nchildren with\u0014\n                      this disorder live less than six months,\" he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      My first reaction was to conclude this \"curse\" \nwas the result of\u0014\n                      my prayerlessness while Hope was in the womb. I \nhad some\u0014\n                      prayer guides for praying for my forming child, \nbut I didn't use\u0014\n                      them much. When we learned of her condition, I \nbegan to think\u0014\n                      I was paying the price.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That night, after my husband David and I were \nleft alone with\u0014\n                      the pain of the news, we lay in bed and, out of \nour fear and\u0014\n                      despair, cried out to God. I'm not sure of all \nthat we said. Eyes\u0014\n                      open and looking up, I know we said, \"We need \nyou. We need\u0014\n                      courage. We need wisdom. We trust you.\" I think \nwe expressed\u0014\n                      trust more out of a desire to trust than a \nconfession of the\u0014\n                      reality in our souls.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the days and weeks that followed, we found \nourselves\u0014\n                      praying together often in bed in the dark. We \nwere profoundly\u0014\n                      aware of our utter dependence upon God. We were \npowerless\u0014\n                      to change our situation and desperate to see \nGod work. We\u0014\n                      also found, as time wore on, that we prayed \nless often. We felt\u0014\n                      guilty that so many people were praying for us \nso diligently\u0014\n                      when we were so prayerless. Yet it was \ndifficult to know how to\u0014\n                      pray. How do you pray for a child who is going \nto die?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Submitting to Disappointment\u0014\n                      The secretary from church called and told me \nthat we were on\u0014\n                      the church's prayer list and that they were \nasking people to\u0014\n                      pray for God to work a miracle and heal Hope. I \ntold her, \"That\u0014\n                      is not how we feel led to pray.\" We did not ask \nGod for that.\u0014\n                      Maybe we were afraid to pray that, or to expect \nit, when the\u0014\n                      diagnosis seemed so sure and grim.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In those early weeks, God seemed to speak to me \nclearly. I\u0014\n                      never heard an audible voice. He spoke to me \nthe way he\u0014\n                      always doesthrough Scripture. A few weeks \nafter Hope was\u0014\n                      born, my Bible-study group looked at the story \nof Hagar, who\u0014\n                      had run away from Abram and Sarah because of \nSarah's harsh\u0014\n                      treatment. Hagar wanted to escape her difficult \nsituation, but\u0014\n                      God spoke to her in the desert and told her, \n\"Return and\u0014\n                      submit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The lecturer asked us the question, \"What is \nGod calling you to\u0014\n                      submit to?\" I knew God was calling me to submit \nto the journey\u0014\n                      we faced with Hopenot to fight it or cry out \nasking him to\u0014\n                      change it, but to submit to his plan and his \npurposes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Shortly after that, we were looking at the \nstory of the angel who\u0014\n                      came to Mary and told her she would give birth \nto a son. How\u0014\n                      did this \"favored\" one respond? \"I am the \nLord's servant. May it\u0014\n                      be to me as you have said.\" She submitted, \nthough what God\u0014\n                      brought to her life, from her perspective, must \nhave looked like\u0014\n                      a disaster.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Again I sensed God calling me to submit to the \nplan he laid out\u0014\n                      before usto walk through it, trusting him in \nthe midst of\u0014\n                      sorrow and difficulty and disappointment. On \nChristmas day we\u0014\n                      took Hope back to the hospital and visited with \nher doctor and\u0014\n                      nurses. Our nurse, Ginny, told us about another \nrecent birth at\u0014\n                      the hospital. The mother was a nurse there, and \nthe other\u0014\n                      nurses had been amazed by the joy and peace \nwith which she\u0014\n                      accepted her severely disabled baby. Ginny told \nus how the\u0014\n                      couple had planned on someday adopting a \nspecial-needs\u0014\n                      child.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What struck me most was her description of how \nthese parents\u0014\n                      prayed. Early in the pregnancy, instead of \npraying, \"God, give\u0014\n                      us a healthy baby,\" they began to pray, \"God, \ngive us the child\u0014\n                      you want us to have.\" Their submission to God \namazed me,\u0014\n                      and their prayer pierced my heart. Surely that \nis the kind of\u0014\n                      prayer our Father desires to hearnot \"Give me \nwhat I want,\"\u0014\n                      but \"Give me what you want me to have.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It reminded me of the Psalm that says, \"Delight \nyourself in the\u0014\n                      Lord, and he will give you the desires of your \nheart\" (37:4). I've\u0014\n                      always found it somewhat humorous the way some \npeople\u0014\n                      interpret this verse: just get close to God, \nand he will give you\u0014\n                      what you want. But I think this verse says when \nyou truly find\u0014\n                      your delight in the Lord, God molds and shapes \nthe desires of\u0014\n                      your heart so that you truly want what he wants \nfor you.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Written Into Every Cell\u0014\n                      Hope's life captivated so many. Children, \nespecially, prayed for\u0014\n                      Hope. But, like us, they didn't really know how \nto pray for her.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One day, after Hope's diagnosis had been public \nfor a week or\u0014\n                      so, our 9-year-old son Matt hopped in the car \nafter school and\u0014\n                      immediately asked me, \"Mom, is there any chance \nthat Hope\u0014\n                      might live?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I knew why he was asking. The class prays at \nthe end of each\u0014\n                      day, and I'm sure that many of the children \nwere asking God to\u0014\n                      heal Hope. It left Matt confused. Should he be \nexpecting God to\u0014\n                      do that or not? I told him God can do anything, \nbut he might\u0014\n                      choose to heal her by making her perfect in \nheaven. And\u0014\n                      whether she was here with us or in heaven with \nhim, she was in\u0014\n                      God's hands.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I was taken aback a few times by those who \ninsisted on praying\u0014\n                      for Hope's healing. I appreciated their sincere \ncompassion and\u0014\n                      belief that God can heal, but I saw it as a \nmisunderstanding of\u0014\n                      her true condition. Her syndrome was so rare, I \nfelt they didn't\u0014\n                      understand how pervasive it was. I wanted to \nsay, \"Would you\u0014\n                      pray for God to 'heal' a child with Down \nsyndrome?\" I expect\u0014\n                      that most people, no matter how much they \nbelieve in God's\u0014\n                      healing power, would not pray that. That's \nbecause they\u0014\n                      understand that Down syndrome is written into \nevery cell of a\u0014\n                      person's body. It is the same with Zellweger. \nThis was not a\u0014\n                      disease that invaded Hope's otherwise healthy \nbody. Every cell\u0014\n                      of Hope's body was marked by Zellweger, which \nbegan its\u0014\n                      destructive work even while she was being \"knit \ntogether in her\u0014\n                      mother's womb\" (Ps. 139:13).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I began to see some people's insistence on her \nhealing as,\u0014\n                      perhaps, a lack of faith. Or maybe it was \nshortsightedness. If\u0014\n                      she had been healed of Zellweger syndrome, she \nwould still die\u0014\n                      someday. Instead, God chose to give her a new \nbody, and he\u0014\n                      spared her from further painnot just the \nphysical pain of her\u0014\n                      condition but also the pain that is a part of \nevery person's\u0014\n                      existence in our fallen world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      From God's perspective, it was not a tragedy \nfor her to die. It\u0014\n                      feels like a tragedy to me, but I find God's \nperspective reflected\u0014\n                      in Isaiah 57:12:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The righteous pass away; the godly often die \nbefore their time.\u0014\n                      And no one seems to care or wonder why. No one \nseems to\u0014\n                      understand that God is protecting them from the \nevil to come.\u0014\n                      For the godly who die will rest in peace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Last week there was a prayer service for \nTaylor, a boy in our\u0014\n                      church who is fighting cancer. How I would love \nto see God\u0014\n                      work a miracle and rid his body of the cancer \nthat is slowly\u0014\n                      robbing him of life! I love his parents, and \nbecause I know\u0014\n                      firsthand how awful and painful it is to watch \nyour child die, I\u0014\n                      don't want them to have to endure it. But I \nalso know God says,\u0014\n                      \"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are \nyour ways my\u0014\n                      ways\" (Is. 55:8).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Surely we can ask God for what we want. We can \nfreely tell him\u0014\n                      that what we want is for those we love to be \nhealed. We know\u0014\n                      he's our Heavenly Father and desires to give us \ngood gifts.\u0014\n                      The problem is, I don't always know what to ask \nfor. I want to\u0014\n                      give my son good things. But that is not always \nwhat he asks\u0014\n                      for. He wants Cocoa Pebbles and I give him \nshredded wheat. I\u0014\n                      know better than he what he needs. I have his \nbest interest in\u0014\n                      mind, so I don't always give him what he asks \nfor. Sometimes\u0014\n                      God's \"good gifts\" don't appear that way to me. \nHe gives me\u0014\n                      broccoli when I want ice cream. Sometimes he \nallows suffering\u0014\n                      when we want healing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not Trying to Change God\u0014\n                      A friend came and asked me how I am praying for \nTaylor in\u0014\n                      light of what I've been through with Hope. I \ntold her that I found\u0014\n                      myself praying, \"God, give us your perspective \non sickness, on\u0014\n                      loss, on death, on healing.\" I don't want to \nchange God's mind.\u0014\n                      His thoughts are perfect; I want to think his \nthoughts. I don't\u0014\n                      want to change God's timing. His timing is \nperfect; I want the\u0014\n                      grace to accept his timing. I don't want to \nchange God's plan.\u0014\n                      His plan is perfect; I want to embrace his plan \nand see him\u0014\n                      glorified through it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hope spent 199 days with us and then God gave \nher Ultimate\u0014\n                      Healing. I can't say my experience with Hope \nhas taught me\u0014\n                      everything I need to know about prayer. I still \nfeel like a failure\u0014\n                      when it comes to prayer because I am often so \nprayerless. But I\u0014\n                      think I've come to a fuller understanding of \nwhat it means to\u0014\n                      pray, \"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in \nheaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Without even saying a word, Hope taught me to \npray that way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nancy Guthrie works in Christian publishing and \nlives in Nashville,\u0014\n                      Tennessee, with her husband, David, and their \nson, Matt.\u0014",

    "words": "Prayer Power\u0014\n\u0014\n                      WHEN my husband, Les, and I discovered I was \npregnant with our son, John, we were\u0014\n                      delighted! But 13 weeks into my pregnancy, \ncomplications started and never stopped. I\u0014\n                      went to the doctor, who ordered an ultrasound. \nShe uncovered a uterine condition that\u0014\n                      put me at high risk for a second trimester \nmiscarriage. Subsequent ultrasounds showed\u0014\n                      a one-in-a-million problem with the placenta \nthat limited John's growth. Every time we\u0014\n                      went to the doctor, the news was worse. We \ndreaded each visit. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By week 18, I developed pregnancy-induced \nhypertension and was put on complete\u0014\n                      bedrest. I was given steroids to help John's \nlungs develop; the doctors knew that with his\u0014\n                      tiny size, if John couldn't make it to week 28, \nhe wouldn't survive. I felt miserable all over,\u0014\n                      and the medications made it worse. I was even \ntoo sick for visitors. That's why the\u0014\n                      prayers of others were so important to me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Every time the doctors expressed a concern \nabout John's lack of growth, friends and\u0014\n                      family started praying. There were times we \nhadn't even had an opportunity to mention\u0014\n                      we were going to the doctor, and someone would \ncall to say, \"I was up praying for you all\u0014\n                      last night. Just wanted you to know.\" People \nwho didn't even know us prayed faithfully for\u0014\n                      us! I've never known that kind of support \nbefore. \u0014\n\u0014\n                        Help for Hard Times\u0014\n                        1 Need some inspiration?

He weighed one \npound, eight\u0014\n                                                ounces. He \nimmediately dropped to\u0014\n                                                one pound because of \na problem\u0014\n                                                with his intestines. \nJohn had to have\u0014\n                                                major surgery, then \nwas on total life\u0014\n                                                support and a \nventilator. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                We were tender \nemotionally. I was\u0014\n                                                recovering from \nsurgery, and John\u0014\n                                                was so tiny, Les's \nwedding band fit\u0014\n                                                all the way up to his \nlittle shoulders.\u0014\n                                                But the prayer \nsupport of people\u0014\n                                                who gathered around \nus kept us\u0014\n                                                going. I felt a \nstrength, a peace\u0014\n                                                beyond myself that \nenabled me to\u0014\n                                                get through \neverything we faced. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                After three months, \nJohn came\u0014\n                                                home. He was still on \noxygen and\u0014\n                                                weighed three \npoundsthe smallest\u0014\n                                                baby the hospital has \never released.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today, John's such a little go-getter. By his \nfirst birthday, he weighed 14 pounds, 5\u0014\n                      ounces. When you have a preemie, there's no \nguarantee about his physical or\u0014\n                      developmental well-being. That's helped me \nfocus on what's really important: John's\u0014\n                      knowledge of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Our experience has changed my view of prayer. \nThe best gifts we were given were those\u0014\n                      prayers for baby John; no other gift has meant \nso much. I now know with new certainty\u0014\n                      it's the most powerful way I can join others in \ntheir struggles, too. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                 as \ntold to Jane Johnson Struck\u0014",

Before they entered she had certain instructions for the \nlittle\u0014\ntike: \"Now youre not going to get any chocolate chip cookies, so \ndont even\u0014\nask.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe put him in the child's seat and off they went up and down the \naisles. He\u0014\nwas doing just fine until they came to the cookie section. Seeing the\u0014\nchocolate chip cookies he said, Mom, can I have some chocolate chip\u0014\ncookies? She said, I told you not even to ask. Youre not going to \nget any\u0014\nat all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey continued down the aisles, but in their search for certain items \nshe\u0014\nhad to back track and they ended up in the cookie aisle again. Mom, \ncan I\u0014\nplease have some chocolate chip cookies? She said, I told you that \nyou can\u0014\nt have any. Now sit down and be quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, they arrived at the checkout. The little boy sensed that the \nend\u0014\nwas in sight, that this might be his last chance. He stood up on the \nseat\u0014\nand shouted in his loudest voice, In the name of Jesus, may I have \nsome\u0014\nchocolate chip cookies? Everyone in the checkout lanes laughed and\u0014\napplauded.

Irenaeus, \nJustin Martyr, and\u0014\n                      Tertullian described dispossession in the \nsecond century, and Origen\u0014\n                      wrote in the third century that \"the name of \nJesus can still remove\u0014\n                      distractions from the minds of men and expel \ndemons and also take\u0014\n                      away diseases and produce a complete change of \ncharacter.\" Even\u0014\n                      John Foxe, known for his Book of Martyrs, freed \na law student from\u0014\n                      \"no less a demon than Satan himself\" in 1574, \nwrites Kathleen\u0014\n                      Sands in the February 2001 History Today. \nChurch historian Richard\u0014\n                      F. Lovelace told Christianity Today that the \nDevil seemed to have\u0014\n                      taken a plunge after the 1692 witch trials, \nshyly reemerging in North\u0014\n                      America in the 20th century when Jessie \nPenn-Lewis wrote War on\u0014\n                      the Saints. With the expansion of overseas \nmissions, Americans\u0014\n                      also began hearing about demon confrontation \nfrom missionaries to\u0014\n                      non-Western nations. But a true demonic revival \ndidn't arrive in the\u0014\n                      United States until the late 1960s and early \n1970s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Exorcism prior to the late 1960s was virtually \ndead and gone in the\u0014\n                      United States, a fading ghost long past its \nprime,\" says Michael W.\u0014\n                      Cuneo, author of the recently released American \nExorcism: Expelling\u0014\n                      Demons in the Land of Plenty (Doubleday). \"And \nthen in the early to\u0014\n                      mid-'70s, untold numbers of Americans, many of \nthem staunchly\u0014\n                      middle class, the kind of people you might chat \nwith at the\u0014\n                      supermarket checkout counter or bump into at a \nlocal mall, became\u0014\n                      convinced that they or their loved ones were \nsuffering from demonic\u0014\n                      affliction.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Supply followed demand, and 600 evangelical \ndeliverance\u0014\n                      ministries\"quite possibly two or three times \nthis many\"have\u0014\n                      sprouted by this year, Cuneo told Christianity \nToday. The Fordham\u0014\n                      University sociology and anthropology professor \nspent two years\u0014\n                      investigating the demonic revival and witnessed \nover 50 mass and\u0014\n                      individual exorcisms, dismissals, or \ndeliverances. Catholic,\u0014\n                      Protestant, and Orthodox experts in demon \nexpulsion have admitted\u0014\n                      in conversations with Christianity Today that \nthey too have noticed an\u0014\n                      upsurge of the demonicor at least perceptions \nof suchin U.S.\u0014\n                      churches in the last two or three decades. The \nnumber of official\u0014\n                      Roman Catholic exorcists climbed from one or \ntwo in 1995 to 15 to\u0014\n                      20 now, and the number is expected to rise, \nCuneo says. Plus, it's\u0014\n                      easy to find \"maverick\" exorcists who will fill \nin for the desperate who\u0014\n                      cannot get the official exorcists' services, he \nsays.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"People are more willing to entertain the \npossibility of the spiritual,\"\u0014\n                      says theologian Robert Barron, a spokesman on \nexorcisms for the\u0014\n                      Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. The tendency \nto explain everything\u0014\n                      through reason has been eclipsed by \nexplanations that go beyond\u0014\n                      what reason can grasp, he adds.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Clinton E. Arnold, professor of New Testament \nat Talbot School of\u0014\n                      Theology in La Mirada, California, has also \nnoticed that a naturalistic\u0014\n                      worldview no longer seems as compelling as it \nused to. \"There is a\u0014\n                      broader yearning for spiritual experience,\" he \nsays. \"There seems to\u0014\n                      be a correlation between this yearning and some \nof the rise in\u0014\n                      deliverance ministry in the church.\" Thus the \npopularity of books by\u0014\n                      Neil T.

In the \npsychedelic '60s, Americans\u0014\n                      began to believe in anything. Consistent with \nChesterton's words,\u0014\n                      this relativism encouraged unorthodox spiritual \nsearches. Man's first\u0014\n                      steps on the moon, flower power, sexual \nfreedom, peace marches,\u0014\n                      Woodstock, the Beatles, and the Vietnam War, as \nwell as women's\u0014\n                      and gays' liberation movements, were the \ncontext in which American\u0014\n                      society opened up to exploring unconventional \nspiritual answers.\u0014\n                      Doctrinally indecisive at the time, many \nProtestant churches didn't\u0014\n                      steer people away from modern superstitions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Quiet Dismissals and Paper Towels\u0014\n                      The dawning of the Age of Aquarius ushered in \nthe demonic\u0014\n                      malignitynot just among charismatics but also \nin conservative\u0014\n                      evangelical circles, where most discussions of \nthis topic began and\u0014\n                      ended with the assertion that \"Christians \ncannot be\u0014\n                      demon-possessed.\" Many straight-laced \nfundamentalists accepted\u0014\n                      the teachings of such noncharismatic \npropagators of demon\u0014\n                      confrontation as Kurt Koch, Merrill F.

Fred Dickason. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dickason told Christianity Today he got \ninvolved in spiritual warfare\u0014\n                      ministry \"rather reluctantly.\" In the late \n'60s, when he was teaching\u0014\n                      at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, the school \nbegan to receive calls\u0014\n                      from \"people with occult or demonic backgrounds \nwho sensed they\u0014\n                      were being oppressed.\" The calls were forwarded \nto Dickason\u0014\n                      because he was teaching a course on angelology, \nand soon after\u0014\n                      that he became chairman of the department of \ntheology. So he \"had\u0014\n                      to learn in a hurry\" how to deal with fallen \nangels. Since that time,\u0014\n                      Dickason and his wife, Jean, have counseled \nmore than 600\u0014\n                      Christians with demonic problems and say they \nhave \"seen the Lord\u0014\n                      dismiss many demons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Spiritual warfare confrontation and dismissal \nof evil spirits are done\u0014\n                      by the Lord Jesus,\" Dickason says. \"We're only \nfacilitators to the\u0014\n                      situation. And since we're counseling the \nentire person, we're not\u0014\n                      there primarily to confront the spirits; we are \ntrying to clear up some\u0014\n                      problems in people's lives by getting them to \nrecognize truth and\u0014\n                      apply it to their lives.\" Simply dressed and \nconservative in both\u0014\n                      manner and theology, Dickason clearly isn't \nafter money. His\u0014\n                      counselees hear about him by word of mouth and \nget help free of\u0014\n                      charge.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There's \"nothing spectacular\" about his \nministry, he says with the\u0014\n                      polite resignation of someone who couldn't care \nless about fame.\u0014\n                      Sometimes, he says, there is no need for \nconfronting demons.\u0014\n                      Things can be cleared up easily by getting \nsomeone to recognize\u0014\n                      and apply God's truth, which he believes \nremoves the occasion by\u0014\n                      which spirits hold on to the person. Such was \nthe case with a man\u0014\n                      whom Dickason advised to forgive his father \nbefore looking into the\u0014\n                      possibility of demonic oppression in his life. \nOften, however, \"The\u0014\n                      stubborn, wicked spirits do not give up just \nbecause someone is\u0014\n                      aligned with the truth,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In that event, Dickason changes into a human \npolygraph. He asks\u0014\n                      the counselees some straightforward questions, \nsuch as \"What do\u0014\n                      you think of the Bible?\" \"What do you think of \nChrist?\" and \"What do\u0014\n                      you think of me?\" Then he asks the person who \nalleges harassment\u0014\n                      to sign a release permitting him to address a \nwicked spirit, if one\u0014\n                      seems to be present. Dickason asks the same \nquestions of evil\u0014\n                      spirits, whoif presentuse the oppressed \nhuman's vocal cords to\u0014\n                      communicate \"very different answers.\" Out of \nthe mouths of\u0014\n                      Christians who had told Dickason they love \nJesus have come\u0014\n                      loathing for God, his Word, and Dickason \nhimself. \"The reason I ask\u0014\n                      these questions is for the person to \ndifferentiate between their\u0014\n                      thoughts and the enemy's thoughts,\" Dickason \nsays. \"Otherwise,\u0014\n                      people think they're going out of their heads.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the demonic presence is confirmed, \nDickason asks Jesus to\u0014\n                      dismiss the spirits. Dickason always requests \nthat God send his\u0014\n                      angels to escort the evil spirits. Very seldom, \n\"some physical\u0014\n                      restraint\" is required when the demons make the \nharassed persons\u0014\n                      want to get up and leave, he says, but \"I'm not \nthere to wrestle with\u0014\n                      demons. Angels wrestle with angels. And I \ncommand the spirits to\u0014\n                      leave quietly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But if there is no observable manifestation, \nhow can one be sure the\u0014\n                      demons have gone? Michael Thierer, pastor of \nHegewisch Baptist\u0014\n                      Church in Highland, Indiana, believes lack of \nstruggle proves that the\u0014\n                      demons may have tricked the deliverance \nminister and never really\u0014\n                      left the oppressed. At his 60-member church, \nprayer partners may\u0014\n                      take 25 minutes of silent prayer before nabbing \nthe spirits, at which\u0014\n                      point the latter start screeching, cackling, \nconvulsing, howling,\u0014\n                      swearing, and coming out through their victims' \nair passages (as\u0014\n                      vomit, for example). Each prayer partner is \nequipped with a roll of\u0014\n                      paper towels. When demons come out, the \nabsorbent sheets prevent\u0014\n                      them from staining the carpet. One wonders how \nthe prayer partners\u0014\n                      can predict the way in which demons will act, \nbut they never fail to\u0014\n                      manifest themselves in ways expected of them: \nThey proceed out of\u0014\n                      the mouths and noses of about 30 people per \nweek and up to 250\u0014\n                      people from all over the country who attend \neach of the three\u0014\n                      deliverance workshops per year, Thierer told \nChristianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The demon-tamers at Hegewisch are \"rude, crude, \nand unorthodox,\"\u0014\n                      says Thierer, who often wrestles the demonized \nto the floor. \"We\u0014\n                      sweat, we wrestle, we get spit onand we'd like \nto find a better\u0014\n                      way.\" He lifts his brows and shakes his head \nslowly as if to imply\u0014\n                      that there is no better way. \"The demons \nmanifest.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dickason disagrees. \"If you expect wild \nmanifestations, the demons\u0014\n                      will be glad to do that, but you give the enemy \ngreat opportunity for\u0014\n                      deception.\" Manifestation is no proof that the \nevil beings have left, he\u0014\n                      addsnor that demons were present to begin \nwith, other critics point\u0014\n                      out.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Everybody's Doing It\u0014\n                      Another factor in the renewed popularity of \ndeliverance ministries is\u0014\n                      the power of suggestion. Sociologists and \npsychologists have long\u0014\n                      proclaimed the power of peer pressure. We tend \nto do what is\u0014\n                      expected of us. There is no reason why the \n\"everybody's doing it\"\u0014\n                      mechanism would not extend to the terrain of \ndeliveranceespecially\u0014\n                      if those demanding or hoping for certain \nbehaviors from us are in\u0014\n                      positions of authority. It is not wise to make \nlight of the ways Satan\u0014\n                      harasses believers. But it is equally unwise to \nunderestimate the\u0014\n                      power of peer pressure, ministers with \ncharismatic personalities, and\u0014\n                      our perception of the will of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Let's say Nancy from Case Three has heard a \nsermon in which the\u0014\n                      pastor said that a desire to kill someone is \nnot of God but of the\u0014\n                      devil. Say Nancy shares her dark thoughts with \na friend who has just\u0014\n                      read in a popular book that hearing hateful \nvoices inside one's head\u0014\n                      is demonic. Nancy's friend encourages her to \nattend a Bob Larson\u0014\n                      mass deliverance rally. At the rally, Nancy \nhears Larson announce\u0014\n                      that he senses strong demonic oppression in the \ncrowd. As is his\u0014\n                      habit, Larson walks up to people in the crowd \nand begins to address\u0014\n                      demons in them. Some people start to scream or \nweep loudly. In\u0014\n                      some cases, blood rushes to their faces and \nthey start speaking in\u0014\n                      guttural voices, identifying themselves as \ndemons and barking their\u0014\n                      answers at Larson's command. Eventually the \ndemons appear to\u0014\n                      leave and the formerly oppressed hug Larson and \npraise God with a\u0014\n                      noticeable relief.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While Larson works the crowd, Nancy gets \nbutterflies in her stomach\u0014\n                      and starts to believe that God has brought her \nto the rally to set her\u0014\n                      free. If Larson were to approach her to search \nout the demons,\u0014\n                      perhaps hitting her with his Bible, as he \nsometimes does to those he\u0014\n                      suspects are demonized, wouldn't Nancy be \ninclined to respond just\u0014\n                      as Larson and the crowd were expecting her to? \nQuite probably the\u0014\n                      cues Larson provides will evoke an apparently \ndemonic response.\u0014\n                      Larson is a controversial figure whose \ndeliverance methods include\u0014\n                      mass exorcism and deliverance over the radio. \nThe secular media\u0014\n                      adore his showmanship and many emotionally \nunstable,\u0014\n                      impressionable people flock to his rallies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In January, CT attended a Larson rally in \nSchaumburg, Illinois.\u0014\n                      Larson never prayed aloud during the session of \nmore than two\u0014\n                      hours. In a later telephone interview, he \nexplained that he had prayed\u0014\n                      before the session, and \"It depends what you \nmean by prayer. I\u0014\n                      rebuke demons,\" which \"necessitates calling on \nthe name of Jesus\u0014\n                      and invoking his power, and that's prayer.\" \nNevertheless, those\u0014\n                      prayers couldn't be heard as Larson alternately \naddressed demons\u0014\n                      and busied himself with asking for money and \nmarketing his books\u0014\n                      and videotapes that his audience needed, as \nLarson informed them,\u0014\n                      to get better. When Larson asked for an \noffering of $22,000, almost\u0014\n                      all of the 150 people present obediently \ndropped their cash and\u0014\n                      checks into big white buckets. Those who did \ngot a perk: they got to\u0014\n                      confront the demons in Frank, a young man \nstanding on the stage\u0014\n                      behind the donation buckets, on whom Larson was \nworking for the\u0014\n                      greater part of the evening.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even though Larson's deliverance methods may \nseem manipulative,\u0014\n                      one cannot discount the possibility that God \nhas used him to free\u0014\n                      some people from evil spirits.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the mind welcomes the suggestion of \ndemonization, it falls into\u0014\n                      the open arms of another suitor: the desire for \nexoneration. Many\u0014\n                      Christians would rather be known as objects of \ndemonic harassment\u0014\n                      than struggling sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Think how vindicating it would be for Bob from \nCase Two to realize\u0014\n                      that his addiction to pornography was not \nprimarily a sin he\u0014\n                      committed but a result of demonic infestation. \nAnd how affirming it\u0014\n                      would be for Nancy to know that she's not an \nangry person but\u0014\n                      merely a victim of a demon of anger. We all \nwant to be on God's\u0014\n                      side, and demons, conveniently, reinstate us to \nthe army of the Lord\u0014\n                      with honors. Before exorcism, an addict is just \na sinner. An addict\u0014\n                      whose addiction turns out to be demonic is a \nmartyr for Christ. Even\u0014\n                      people genuinely attacked by demons may have a \ntendency to\u0014\n                      ignore their responsibility for their \ndestructive behavior. As Cuneo\u0014\n                      tells CT, exorcism lets us off the moral hook.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      John E. Kelley, a clinical psychologist and \ndirector of Biola\u0014\n                      Counseling Center in La Mirada, California, \ncites another influence\u0014\n                      that he believes has increased the number of \ndeliverances in recent\u0014\n                      years: the philosophical position that we each \nhave separate selves.\u0014\n                      The essence of the phenomenon, he says, is the \nfragmentation of\u0014\n                      the postmodern person. It's okay these days to \nenact different egos\u0014\n                      in different situations and to apply different \nstandards of morality\u0014\n                      depending on the situation. The epitome of \nthat, Kelley says, is Bill\u0014\n                      Clinton, an unfaithful husband and a great \npolitician in one. Fragile\u0014\n                      and broken, American selves have lost the \ndefenses that a unified\u0014\n                      moral character provides, opening themselves to \nboth demons and\u0014\n                      their imitations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Demonization by Osmosis\u0014\n                      At least one more widespread factor seems to \nhave loosed demons\u0014\n                      into American households, says Cuneo: the \nentertainment culture's\u0014\n                      fascination with the demonic. Peculiarly, \ndemons began multiplying\u0014\n                      when \"demonic grotesquerie\" started taunting us \nfrom the big screen\u0014\n                      and the pages of best-selling books, Cuneo \nobserves. American\u0014\n                      psyches were first mass-conditioned for \nexorcism through their\u0014\n                      exposure to the 1973 movie The Exorcist by \nWilliam Peter Blatty and\u0014\n                      William Friedkin, as well as Malachi Martin's \n1976 book Hostage to\u0014\n                      the Devil, he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Other fuel that fed our collective imagination \nwith portrayals of evil\u0014\n                      were films such as Devil Times Five (1974), The \nPossessed (1977),\u0014\n                      Good Against Evil (1977), Exorcist II: The \nHeretic (1977), The Entity\u0014\n                      (1982), My Demon Lover (1987), and more \nrecently The Devil's\u0014\n                      Advocate (1997), The Blair Witch Project \n(1999), Book of Shadows:\u0014\n                      Blair Witch 2 (2000), a re-release of The \nExorcist (2000), Bedazzled\u0014\n                      (2000), and The Little Vampire (2000). Evil \nspirits gained entry into\u0014\n                      the kitchens, bedrooms, and family rooms of \nAmerica through the\u0014\n                      small screen as well. Supernatural evil was \ndepicted in the television\u0014\n                      movie The Haunted (1991), and the series The \nX-Files, Buffy the\u0014\n                      Vampire Slayer, Angel, Charmed, and Touched by \nan Angel. Even\u0014\n                      Judge Amy Madison Gray on Judging Amy had to \nrule in a January\u0014\n                      episode on whether a 13-year-old girl would be \nhelped by an\u0014\n                      exorcism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But what came firstpop culture's portrayals of \nthe demonic, or the\u0014\n                      demons themselves? Did the media merely mirror \nreality? Or did\u0014\n                      they create reality? Perhaps both.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pictures hold a lot of power over our minds. \nAsk advertising gurus,\u0014\n                      the glossy magazine editors, or pornography \naddicts. If seeing is\u0014\n                      believing and true faith manifests itself in \naction, then what we see,\u0014\n                      especially for the more suggestible of us, \ninfluences our behavior.\u0014\n                      Could it be that the Devil has been helped a \nlittle by pop culture's\u0014\n                      hypnotic, sometimes scary and sometimes \nseductive, depictions of\u0014\n                      his malice? (To be fair, one has to wonder how \nmuch entertainment\u0014\n                      has been inspired by the Devilbut that's \nanother article.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Cuneo believes that the entertainment industry \ndirectly stimulated\u0014\n                      the market for exorcism. \"We tend to \nunderestimate the influence of\u0014\n                      images we get from television, cinema, \ntabloids, and now the\u0014\n                      Internet, but they are our common cultural \nlanguage,\" he says. \"Most\u0014\n                      of us are exposed to these images on a daily \nbasis.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others do not give pop culture so much credit. \nWhile films have\u0014\n                      generally increased awareness of the demonic, \ndramatic portrayals\u0014\n                      such as The Exorcist were \"more a symptom than \na cause,\" says\u0014\n                      Dickason. The media simply reflected the \nspiritual difficulties that\u0014\n                      people were experiencing because they opened \nthemselves up to\u0014\n                      real demonic influences when they became \ninvolved with the occult in\u0014\n                      the New Age movement, he believes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, it's hard to see the media as a litmus \ntest for American\u0014\n                      spirituality. Goethe's Faust and Marlowe's Dr. \nFaustus warned\u0014\n                      against bargaining with the Devil. Most of \ntoday's entertainment has\u0014\n                      no such qualms; rather, the mass media love the \ndemonic because it\u0014\n                      makes for lavish special effects and attracts \nthe thrill-seeking\u0014\n                      American audience. Demons generate a sizzle \nequaled only by the\u0014\n                      Jerry Springer Show's boxing matches, Hugh \nHefner's girlfriends, and\u0014\n                      people eating bugs on \"reality\" TV shows.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Exorcism Works\u0014\n                      Healthy though skepticism about the demonic may \nbe, it must be\u0014\n                      reconciled with the biblical depictions of \ndemonization. And,\u0014\n                      undeniably, some people have been helped by \nexorcism and\u0014\n                      deliverance. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Take Michael Easton, a 54-year-old businessman. \nHis conversion in\u0014\n                      1979 did not stop him from multipartner \nhomosexuality, alcoholism,\u0014\n                      and a drug habit. In the days when he was \n\"drinking to get drunk\" in\u0014\n                      1987, Easton attended a deliverance meeting in \nMontana led by\u0014\n                      visiting pastor Win Worley, a controversial \nexorcist, author of Battling\u0014\n                      the Hosts of Hell: Diary of an Exorcist (1976), \nand then-leader of\u0014\n                      Hegewisch Baptist Church in Indiana. During the \n30 minutes Worley\u0014\n                      prayed for Easton, evil sprits oozed out of him \nthrough \"deep, heavy\u0014\n                      coughing, lots of tears, things coming out of \nmy nose, a substance\u0014\n                      that came out of my stomachit's just as if a \nfaucet was turned on,\"\u0014\n                      Easton recalls. Since that day 14 years ago, \nEaston hasn't engaged\u0014\n                      in any homosexual acts, he has stopped smoking \npot, and the\u0014\n                      self-described \"fallen-down drunk\" hasn't \ntouched alcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Worley also exorcised Thierer's demons. Thierer \nwas a narcotics\u0014\n                      addict and dealer in 1979 when he spent 8 to 10 \nmonths \"on the\u0014\n                      floor,\" he recalled in an interview with \nChristianity Today. Once\u0014\n                      Thierer got rid of his rock music collection, \nwhich he believes was\u0014\n                      blocking his deliverance, Worley wrestled \"all \nkinds of drug spirits\"\u0014\n                      out of the man who would eventually marry his \ndaughter and take\u0014\n                      over Hegewisch Baptist's leadership after \nWorley's death in 1994.\u0014\n                      Since his deliverance in 1979, Thierer's drug \naddiction has been\u0014\n                      gone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Arnold also tells a story of a successful demon \nexpulsion. A college\u0014\n                      student had episodes in which her pulse would \nsometimes shoot up\u0014\n                      to 150 or more beats per minute; she would \nblack out and often end\u0014\n                      up in the emergency room. Cardiologists were \nstumped by her\u0014\n                      condition. Wearing a monitor to track her heart \nrate, the young\u0014\n                      woman stopped by Arnold's office one day to \ntell him that the heart\u0014\n                      condition originated when a demon startled her \nout of sleep. Knowing\u0014\n                      that she was under the care of a cardiologist, \nArnold decided to\u0014\n                      investigate if there was a spiritual root to \nher condition. He made sure\u0014\n                      that she knew Jesus as her Savior, and talked \nwith her about the\u0014\n                      possibility of unconfessed sins and her \nbackground.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Having eliminated these as causes of the \nwoman's condition, Arnold\u0014\n                      had her ask Jesus for strength and told her to \naddress any afflicting\u0014\n                      spirit by saying, \"I command you in the name of \nthe Lord Jesus\u0014\n                      Christ to leave. I am a child of God and his \nproperty, and I don't want\u0014\n                      you.\" He then joined the student in commanding \nany spirit that was\u0014\n                      present to leave. A \"shuddering sensation\" went \nthrough her body as\u0014\n                      Arnold, the woman and her roommate prayed for \ndeliverance, the\u0014\n                      woman later told Arnold. At the end of this \n\"power encounter,\" the\u0014\n                      woman recommitted herself to Christ and \nannounced her allegiance\u0014\n                      to him, and \"that was the end of her heart \nproblem,\" Arnold says. He\u0014\n                      admits that he still has questions why this \ntook place, but \"there was\u0014\n                      no doubt that something seemed to me to be a \nclear example of the\u0014\n                      reality of the demonic. Demons attack \nChristians, but we have the\u0014\n                      resources in Christ to command them to go\u0014",

Irenaeus, \nJustin Martyr, and\u0014\n                      Tertullian described dispossession in the \nsecond century, and Origen\u0014\n                      wrote in the third century that \"the name of \nJesus can still remove\u0014\n                      distractions from the minds of men and expel \ndemons and also take\u0014\n                      away diseases and produce a complete change of \ncharacter.\" Even\u0014\n                      John Foxe, known for his Book of Martyrs, freed \na law student from\u0014\n                      \"no less a demon than Satan himself\" in 1574, \nwrites Kathleen\u0014\n                      Sands in the February 2001 History Today. \nChurch historian Richard\u0014\n                      F. Lovelace told Christianity Today that the \nDevil seemed to have\u0014\n                      taken a plunge after the 1692 witch trials, \nshyly reemerging in North\u0014\n                      America in the 20th century when Jessie \nPenn-Lewis wrote War on\u0014\n                      the Saints. With the expansion of overseas \nmissions, Americans\u0014\n                      also began hearing about demon confrontation \nfrom missionaries to\u0014\n                      non-Western nations. But a true demonic revival \ndidn't arrive in the\u0014\n                      United States until the late 1960s and early \n1970s. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Exorcism prior to the late 1960s was virtually \ndead and gone in the\u0014\n                      United States, a fading ghost long past its \nprime,\" says Michael W.\u0014\n                      Cuneo, author of the recently released American \nExorcism: Expelling\u0014\n                      Demons in the Land of Plenty (Doubleday). \"And \nthen in the early to\u0014\n                      mid-'70s, untold numbers of Americans, many of \nthem staunchly\u0014\n                      middle class, the kind of people you might chat \nwith at the\u0014\n                      supermarket checkout counter or bump into at a \nlocal mall, became\u0014\n                      convinced that they or their loved ones were \nsuffering from demonic\u0014\n                      affliction.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Supply followed demand, and 600 evangelical \ndeliverance\u0014\n                      ministries\"quite possibly two or three times \nthis many\"have\u0014\n                      sprouted by this year, Cuneo told Christianity \nToday. The Fordham\u0014\n                      University sociology and anthropology professor \nspent two years\u0014\n                      investigating the demonic revival and witnessed \nover 50 mass and\u0014\n                      individual exorcisms, dismissals, or \ndeliverances. Catholic,\u0014\n                      Protestant, and Orthodox experts in demon \nexpulsion have admitted\u0014\n                      in conversations with Christianity Today that \nthey too have noticed an\u0014\n                      upsurge of the demonicor at least perceptions \nof suchin U.S.\u0014\n                      churches in the last two or three decades. The \nnumber of official\u0014\n                      Roman Catholic exorcists climbed from one or \ntwo in 1995 to 15 to\u0014\n                      20 now, and the number is expected to rise, \nCuneo says. Plus, it's\u0014\n                      easy to find \"maverick\" exorcists who will fill \nin for the desperate who\u0014\n                      cannot get the official exorcists' services, he \nsays.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"People are more willing to entertain the \npossibility of the spiritual,\"\u0014\n                      says theologian Robert Barron, a spokesman on \nexorcisms for the\u0014\n                      Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. The tendency \nto explain everything\u0014\n                      through reason has been eclipsed by \nexplanations that go beyond\u0014\n                      what reason can grasp, he adds.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Clinton E. Arnold, professor of New Testament \nat Talbot School of\u0014\n                      Theology in La Mirada, California, has also \nnoticed that a naturalistic\u0014\n                      worldview no longer seems as compelling as it \nused to. \"There is a\u0014\n                      broader yearning for spiritual experience,\" he \nsays. \"There seems to\u0014\n                      be a correlation between this yearning and some \nof the rise in\u0014\n                      deliverance ministry in the church.\" Thus the \npopularity of books by\u0014\n                      Neil T. Anderson, C. Peter Wagner, Mark I. \nBubeck, Frank E.\u0014\n                      Peretti, C. Fred Dickason, and Arnold.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps G.K. Chesterton was right in saying \nthat when people cease\u0014\n                      to believe in God, they don't begin to believe \nin nothinginstead,\u0014\n                      they will believe in anything. In the \npsychedelic '60s, Americans\u0014\n                      began to believe in anything. Consistent with \nChesterton's words,\u0014\n                      this relativism encouraged unorthodox spiritual \nsearches. Man's first\u0014\n                      steps on the moon, flower power, sexual \nfreedom, peace marches,\u0014\n                      Woodstock, the Beatles, and the Vietnam War, as \nwell as women's\u0014\n                      and gays' liberation movements, were the \ncontext in which American\u0014\n                      society opened up to exploring unconventional \nspiritual answers.\u0014\n                      Doctrinally indecisive at the time, many \nProtestant churches didn't\u0014\n                      steer people away from modern superstitions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Quiet Dismissals and Paper Towels\u0014\n                      The dawning of the Age of Aquarius ushered in \nthe demonic\u0014\n                      malignitynot just among charismatics but also \nin conservative\u0014\n                      evangelical circles, where most discussions of \nthis topic began and\u0014\n                      ended with the assertion that \"Christians \ncannot be\u0014\n                      demon-possessed.\" Many straight-laced \nfundamentalists accepted\u0014\n                      the teachings of such noncharismatic \npropagators of demon\u0014\n                      confrontation as Kurt Koch, Merrill F. Unger, \nand Mark I. Bubeck.\u0014\n                      Among them was C. Fred Dickason. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dickason told Christianity Today he got \ninvolved in spiritual warfare\u0014\n                      ministry \"rather reluctantly.\" In the late \n'60s, when he was teaching\u0014\n                      at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, the school \nbegan to receive calls\u0014\n                      from \"people with occult or demonic backgrounds \nwho sensed they\u0014\n                      were being oppressed.\" The calls were forwarded \nto Dickason\u0014\n                      because he was teaching a course on angelology, \nand soon after\u0014\n                      that he became chairman of the department of \ntheology. So he \"had\u0014\n                      to learn in a hurry\" how to deal with fallen \nangels. Since that time,\u0014\n                      Dickason and his wife, Jean, have counseled \nmore than 600\u0014\n                      Christians with demonic problems and say they \nhave \"seen the Lord\u0014\n                      dismiss many demons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Spiritual warfare confrontation and dismissal \nof evil spirits are done\u0014\n                      by the Lord Jesus,\" Dickason says. \"We're only \nfacilitators to the\u0014\n                      situation. And since we're counseling the \nentire person, we're not\u0014\n                      there primarily to confront the spirits; we are \ntrying to clear up some\u0014\n                      problems in people's lives by getting them to \nrecognize truth and\u0014\n                      apply it to their lives.\" Simply dressed and \nconservative in both\u0014\n                      manner and theology, Dickason clearly isn't \nafter money. His\u0014\n                      counselees hear about him by word of mouth and \nget help free of\u0014\n                      charge.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There's \"nothing spectacular\" about his \nministry, he says with the\u0014\n                      polite resignation of someone who couldn't care \nless about fame.\u0014\n                      Sometimes, he says, there is no need for \nconfronting demons.\u0014\n                      Things can be cleared up easily by getting \nsomeone to recognize\u0014\n                      and apply God's truth, which he believes \nremoves the occasion by\u0014\n                      which spirits hold on to the person. Such was \nthe case with a man\u0014\n                      whom Dickason advised to forgive his father \nbefore looking into the\u0014\n                      possibility of demonic oppression in his life. \nOften, however, \"The\u0014\n                      stubborn, wicked spirits do not give up just \nbecause someone is\u0014\n                      aligned with the truth,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In that event, Dickason changes into a human \npolygraph. He asks\u0014\n                      the counselees some straightforward questions, \nsuch as \"What do\u0014\n                      you think of the Bible?\" \"What do you think of \nChrist?\" and \"What do\u0014\n                      you think of me?\" Then he asks the person who \nalleges harassment\u0014\n                      to sign a release permitting him to address a \nwicked spirit, if one\u0014\n                      seems to be present. Dickason asks the same \nquestions of evil\u0014\n                      spirits, whoif presentuse the oppressed \nhuman's vocal cords to\u0014\n                      communicate \"very different answers.\" Out of \nthe mouths of\u0014\n                      Christians who had told Dickason they love \nJesus have come\u0014\n                      loathing for God, his Word, and Dickason \nhimself. \"The reason I ask\u0014\n                      these questions is for the person to \ndifferentiate between their\u0014\n                      thoughts and the enemy's thoughts,\" Dickason \nsays. \"Otherwise,\u0014\n                      people think they're going out of their heads.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the demonic presence is confirmed, \nDickason asks Jesus to\u0014\n                      dismiss the spirits. Dickason always requests \nthat God send his\u0014\n                      angels to escort the evil spirits. Very seldom, \n\"some physical\u0014\n                      restraint\" is required when the demons make the \nharassed persons\u0014\n                      want to get up and leave, he says, but \"I'm not \nthere to wrestle with\u0014\n                      demons. Angels wrestle with angels. And I \ncommand the spirits to\u0014\n                      leave quietly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But if there is no observable manifestation, \nhow can one be sure the\u0014\n                      demons have gone? Michael Thierer, pastor of \nHegewisch Baptist\u0014\n                      Church in Highland, Indiana, believes lack of \nstruggle proves that the\u0014\n                      demons may have tricked the deliverance \nminister and never really\u0014\n                      left the oppressed. At his 60-member church, \nprayer partners may\u0014\n                      take 25 minutes of silent prayer before nabbing \nthe spirits, at which\u0014\n                      point the latter start screeching, cackling, \nconvulsing, howling,\u0014\n                      swearing, and coming out through their victims' \nair passages (as\u0014\n                      vomit, for example). Each prayer partner is \nequipped with a roll of\u0014\n                      paper towels. When demons come out, the \nabsorbent sheets prevent\u0014\n                      them from staining the carpet. One wonders how \nthe prayer partners\u0014\n                      can predict the way in which demons will act, \nbut they never fail to\u0014\n                      manifest themselves in ways expected of them: \nThey proceed out of\u0014\n                      the mouths and noses of about 30 people per \nweek and up to 250\u0014\n                      people from all over the country who attend \neach of the three\u0014\n                      deliverance workshops per year, Thierer told \nChristianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The demon-tamers at Hegewisch are \"rude, crude, \nand unorthodox,\"\u0014\n                      says Thierer, who often wrestles the demonized \nto the floor. \"We\u0014\n                      sweat, we wrestle, we get spit onand we'd like \nto find a better\u0014\n                      way.\" He lifts his brows and shakes his head \nslowly as if to imply\u0014\n                      that there is no better way. \"The demons \nmanifest.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dickason disagrees. \"If you expect wild \nmanifestations, the demons\u0014\n                      will be glad to do that, but you give the enemy \ngreat opportunity for\u0014\n                      deception.\" Manifestation is no proof that the \nevil beings have left, he\u0014\n                      addsnor that demons were present to begin \nwith, other critics point\u0014\n                      out.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Everybody's Doing It\u0014\n                      Another factor in the renewed popularity of \ndeliverance ministries is\u0014\n                      the power of suggestion. Sociologists and \npsychologists have long\u0014\n                      proclaimed the power of peer pressure. We tend \nto do what is\u0014\n                      expected of us. There is no reason why the \n\"everybody's doing it\"\u0014\n                      mechanism would not extend to the terrain of \ndeliveranceespecially\u0014\n                      if those demanding or hoping for certain \nbehaviors from us are in\u0014\n                      positions of authority. It is not wise to make \nlight of the ways Satan\u0014\n                      harasses believers. But it is equally unwise to \nunderestimate the\u0014\n                      power of peer pressure, ministers with \ncharismatic personalities, and\u0014\n                      our perception of the will of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Let's say Nancy from Case Three has heard a \nsermon in which the\u0014\n                      pastor said that a desire to kill someone is \nnot of God but of the\u0014\n                      devil. Say Nancy shares her dark thoughts with \na friend who has just\u0014\n                      read in a popular book that hearing hateful \nvoices inside one's head\u0014\n                      is demonic. Nancy's friend encourages her to \nattend a Bob Larson\u0014\n                      mass deliverance rally. At the rally, Nancy \nhears Larson announce\u0014\n                      that he senses strong demonic oppression in the \ncrowd. As is his\u0014\n                      habit, Larson walks up to people in the crowd \nand begins to address\u0014\n                      demons in them. Some people start to scream or \nweep loudly. In\u0014\n                      some cases, blood rushes to their faces and \nthey start speaking in\u0014\n                      guttural voices, identifying themselves as \ndemons and barking their\u0014\n                      answers at Larson's command. Eventually the \ndemons appear to\u0014\n                      leave and the formerly oppressed hug Larson and \npraise God with a\u0014\n                      noticeable relief.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While Larson works the crowd, Nancy gets \nbutterflies in her stomach\u0014\n                      and starts to believe that God has brought her \nto the rally to set her\u0014\n                      free. If Larson were to approach her to search \nout the demons,\u0014\n                      perhaps hitting her with his Bible, as he \nsometimes does to those he\u0014\n                      suspects are demonized, wouldn't Nancy be \ninclined to respond just\u0014\n                      as Larson and the crowd were expecting her to? \nQuite probably the\u0014\n                      cues Larson provides will evoke an apparently \ndemonic response.\u0014\n                      Larson is a controversial figure whose \ndeliverance methods include\u0014\n                      mass exorcism and deliverance over the radio. \nThe secular media\u0014\n                      adore his showmanship and many emotionally \nunstable,\u0014\n                      impressionable people flock to his rallies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In January, CT attended a Larson rally in \nSchaumburg, Illinois.\u0014\n                      Larson never prayed aloud during the session of \nmore than two\u0014\n                      hours. In a later telephone interview, he \nexplained that he had prayed\u0014\n                      before the session, and \"It depends what you \nmean by prayer. I\u0014\n                      rebuke demons,\" which \"necessitates calling on \nthe name of Jesus\u0014\n                      and invoking his power, and that's prayer.\" \nNevertheless, those\u0014\n                      prayers couldn't be heard as Larson alternately \naddressed demons\u0014\n                      and busied himself with asking for money and \nmarketing his books\u0014\n                      and videotapes that his audience needed, as \nLarson informed them,\u0014\n                      to get better. When Larson asked for an \noffering of $22,000, almost\u0014\n                      all of the 150 people present obediently \ndropped their cash and\u0014\n                      checks into big white buckets. Those who did \ngot a perk: they got to\u0014\n                      confront the demons in Frank, a young man \nstanding on the stage\u0014\n                      behind the donation buckets, on whom Larson was \nworking for the\u0014\n                      greater part of the evening.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even though Larson's deliverance methods may \nseem manipulative,\u0014\n                      one cannot discount the possibility that God \nhas used him to free\u0014\n                      some people from evil spirits.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the mind welcomes the suggestion of \ndemonization, it falls into\u0014\n                      the open arms of another suitor: the desire for \nexoneration. Many\u0014\n                      Christians would rather be known as objects of \ndemonic harassment\u0014\n                      than struggling sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Think how vindicating it would be for Bob from \nCase Two to realize\u0014\n                      that his addiction to pornography was not \nprimarily a sin he\u0014\n                      committed but a result of demonic infestation. \nAnd how affirming it\u0014\n                      would be for Nancy to know that she's not an \nangry person but\u0014\n                      merely a victim of a demon of anger. We all \nwant to be on God's\u0014\n                      side, and demons, conveniently, reinstate us to \nthe army of the Lord\u0014\n                      with honors. Before exorcism, an addict is just \na sinner. An addict\u0014\n                      whose addiction turns out to be demonic is a \nmartyr for Christ. Even\u0014\n                      people genuinely attacked by demons may have a \ntendency to\u0014\n                      ignore their responsibility for their \ndestructive behavior. As Cuneo\u0014\n                      tells CT, exorcism lets us off the moral hook.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      John E. Kelley, a clinical psychologist and \ndirector of Biola\u0014\n                      Counseling Center in La Mirada, California, \ncites another influence\u0014\n                      that he believes has increased the number of \ndeliverances in recent\u0014\n                      years: the philosophical position that we each \nhave separate selves.\u0014\n                      The essence of the phenomenon, he says, is the \nfragmentation of\u0014\n                      the postmodern person. It's okay these days to \nenact different egos\u0014\n                      in different situations and to apply different \nstandards of morality\u0014\n                      depending on the situation. The epitome of \nthat, Kelley says, is Bill\u0014\n                      Clinton, an unfaithful husband and a great \npolitician in one. Fragile\u0014\n                      and broken, American selves have lost the \ndefenses that a unified\u0014\n                      moral character provides, opening themselves to \nboth demons and\u0014\n                      their imitations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Demonization by Osmosis\u0014\n                      At least one more widespread factor seems to \nhave loosed demons\u0014\n                      into American households, says Cuneo: the \nentertainment culture's\u0014\n                      fascination with the demonic. Peculiarly, \ndemons began multiplying\u0014\n                      when \"demonic grotesquerie\" started taunting us \nfrom the big screen\u0014\n                      and the pages of best-selling books, Cuneo \nobserves. American\u0014\n                      psyches were first mass-conditioned for \nexorcism through their\u0014\n                      exposure to the 1973 movie The Exorcist by \nWilliam Peter Blatty and\u0014\n                      William Friedkin, as well as Malachi Martin's \n1976 book Hostage to\u0014\n                      the Devil, he says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Other fuel that fed our collective imagination \nwith portrayals of evil\u0014\n                      were films such as Devil Times Five (1974), The \nPossessed (1977),\u0014\n                      Good Against Evil (1977), Exorcist II: The \nHeretic (1977), The Entity\u0014\n                      (1982), My Demon Lover (1987), and more \nrecently The Devil's\u0014\n                      Advocate (1997), The Blair Witch Project \n(1999), Book of Shadows:\u0014\n                      Blair Witch 2 (2000), a re-release of The \nExorcist (2000), Bedazzled\u0014\n                      (2000), and The Little Vampire (2000). Evil \nspirits gained entry into\u0014\n                      the kitchens, bedrooms, and family rooms of \nAmerica through the\u0014\n                      small screen as well. Supernatural evil was \ndepicted in the television\u0014\n                      movie The Haunted (1991), and the series The \nX-Files, Buffy the\u0014\n                      Vampire Slayer, Angel, Charmed, and Touched by \nan Angel. Even\u0014\n                      Judge Amy Madison Gray on Judging Amy had to \nrule in a January\u0014\n                      episode on whether a 13-year-old girl would be \nhelped by an\u0014\n                      exorcism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But what came firstpop culture's portrayals of \nthe demonic, or the\u0014\n                      demons themselves? Did the media merely mirror \nreality? Or did\u0014\n                      they create reality? Perhaps both.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pictures hold a lot of power over our minds. \nAsk advertising gurus,\u0014\n                      the glossy magazine editors, or pornography \naddicts. If seeing is\u0014\n                      believing and true faith manifests itself in \naction, then what we see,\u0014\n                      especially for the more suggestible of us, \ninfluences our behavior.\u0014\n                      Could it be that the Devil has been helped a \nlittle by pop culture's\u0014\n                      hypnotic, sometimes scary and sometimes \nseductive, depictions of\u0014\n                      his malice? (To be fair, one has to wonder how \nmuch entertainment\u0014\n                      has been inspired by the Devilbut that's \nanother article.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Cuneo believes that the entertainment industry \ndirectly stimulated\u0014\n                      the market for exorcism. \"We tend to \nunderestimate the influence of\u0014\n                      images we get from television, cinema, \ntabloids, and now the\u0014\n                      Internet, but they are our common cultural \nlanguage,\" he says. \"Most\u0014\n                      of us are exposed to these images on a daily \nbasis.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others do not give pop culture so much credit. \nWhile films have\u0014\n                      generally increased awareness of the demonic, \ndramatic portrayals\u0014\n                      such as The Exorcist were \"more a symptom than \na cause,\" says\u0014\n                      Dickason. The media simply reflected the \nspiritual difficulties that\u0014\n                      people were experiencing because they opened \nthemselves up to\u0014\n                      real demonic influences when they became \ninvolved with the occult in\u0014\n                      the New Age movement, he believes.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, it's hard to see the media as a litmus \ntest for American\u0014\n                      spirituality. Goethe's Faust and Marlowe's Dr. \nFaustus warned\u0014\n                      against bargaining with the Devil. Most of \ntoday's entertainment has\u0014\n                      no such qualms; rather, the mass media love the \ndemonic because it\u0014\n                      makes for lavish special effects and attracts \nthe thrill-seeking\u0014\n                      American audience. Demons generate a sizzle \nequaled only by the\u0014\n                      Jerry Springer Show's boxing matches, Hugh \nHefner's girlfriends, and\u0014\n                      people eating bugs on \"reality\" TV shows.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Exorcism Works\u0014\n                      Healthy though skepticism about the demonic may \nbe, it must be\u0014\n                      reconciled with the biblical depictions of \ndemonization. And,\u0014\n                      undeniably, some people have been helped by \nexorcism and\u0014\n                      deliverance. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Take Michael Easton, a 54-year-old businessman. \nHis conversion in\u0014\n                      1979 did not stop him from multipartner \nhomosexuality, alcoholism,\u0014\n                      and a drug habit. In the days when he was \n\"drinking to get drunk\" in\u0014\n                      1987, Easton attended a deliverance meeting in \nMontana led by\u0014\n                      visiting pastor Win Worley, a controversial \nexorcist, author of Battling\u0014\n                      the Hosts of Hell: Diary of an Exorcist (1976), \nand then-leader of\u0014\n                      Hegewisch Baptist Church in Indiana. During the \n30 minutes Worley\u0014\n                      prayed for Easton, evil sprits oozed out of him \nthrough \"deep, heavy\u0014\n                      coughing, lots of tears, things coming out of \nmy nose, a substance\u0014\n                      that came out of my stomachit's just as if a \nfaucet was turned on,\"\u0014\n                      Easton recalls. Since that day 14 years ago, \nEaston hasn't engaged\u0014\n                      in any homosexual acts, he has stopped smoking \npot, and the\u0014\n                      self-described \"fallen-down drunk\" hasn't \ntouched alcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Worley also exorcised Thierer's demons. Thierer \nwas a narcotics\u0014\n                      addict and dealer in 1979 when he spent 8 to 10 \nmonths \"on the\u0014\n                      floor,\" he recalled in an interview with \nChristianity Today. Once\u0014\n                      Thierer got rid of his rock music collection, \nwhich he believes was\u0014\n                      blocking his deliverance, Worley wrestled \"all \nkinds of drug spirits\"\u0014\n                      out of the man who would eventually marry his \ndaughter and take\u0014\n                      over Hegewisch Baptist's leadership after \nWorley's death in 1994.\u0014\n                      Since his deliverance in 1979, Thierer's drug \naddiction has been\u0014\n                      gone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Arnold also tells a story of a successful demon \nexpulsion. A college\u0014\n                      student had episodes in which her pulse would \nsometimes shoot up\u0014\n                      to 150 or more beats per minute; she would \nblack out and often end\u0014\n                      up in the emergency room. Cardiologists were \nstumped by her\u0014\n                      condition. Wearing a monitor to track her heart \nrate, the young\u0014\n                      woman stopped by Arnold's office one day to \ntell him that the heart\u0014\n                      condition originated when a demon startled her \nout of sleep. Knowing\u0014\n                      that she was under the care of a cardiologist, \nArnold decided to\u0014\n                      investigate if there was a spiritual root to \nher condition. He made sure\u0014\n                      that she knew Jesus as her Savior, and talked \nwith her about the\u0014\n                      possibility of unconfessed sins and her \nbackground.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Having eliminated these as causes of the \nwoman's condition, Arnold\u0014\n                      had her ask Jesus for strength and told her to \naddress any afflicting\u0014\n                      spirit by saying, \"I command you in the name of \nthe Lord Jesus\u0014\n                      Christ to leave. I am a child of God and his \nproperty, and I don't want\u0014\n                      you.\" He then joined the student in commanding \nany spirit that was\u0014\n                      present to leave. A \"shuddering sensation\" went \nthrough her body as\u0014\n                      Arnold, the woman and her roommate prayed for \ndeliverance, the\u0014\n                      woman later told Arnold. At the end of this \n\"power encounter,\" the\u0014\n                      woman recommitted herself to Christ and \nannounced her allegiance\u0014\n                      to him, and \"that was the end of her heart \nproblem,\" Arnold says. He\u0014\n                      admits that he still has questions why this \ntook place, but \"there was\u0014\n                      no doubt that something seemed to me to be a \nclear example of the\u0014\n                      reality of the demonic. Demons attack \nChristians, but we have the\u0014\n                      resources in Christ to command them to go.\"\u0014",

    "words": "THE PRESIDENT: Good evening. Today, our fellow citizens, our way of \nlife,\u0014\nour very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and \ndeadly\u0014\nterrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes, or in their offices;\u0014\nsecretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers; \nmoms and\u0014\ndads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended \nby evil,\u0014\ndespicable acts of terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge\u0014\nstructures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible \nsadness, and\u0014\na quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to\u0014\nfrighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed; our\u0014\ncountry is strong.\u0014\n\u0014\nA great people has been moved to defend a great nation.

Today, our fellow citizens, our way of \nlife,\u0014\nour very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and \ndeadly\u0014\nterrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes, or in their offices;\u0014\nsecretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers; \nmoms and\u0014\ndads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended \nby evil,\u0014\ndespicable acts of terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge\u0014\nstructures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible \nsadness, and\u0014\na quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to\u0014\nfrighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed; our\u0014\ncountry is strong.\u0014\n\u0014\nA great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist \nattacks\u0014\ncan shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot \ntouch\u0014\nthe foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they \ncannot dent\u0014\nthe steel of American resolve.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for\u0014\nfreedom and opportunity in the world.

    "words": "In his book \"Alive\", Rick Christian recounts a low point in Thomas \nCarlyle's life. The noted historian had just spent two years writing \na book on the French Revolution. On the day he finished his \nmanuscript he gave his only copy to a colleague, John Stuart Mill, to \nread and critique. Then the unthinkable occurred. Mill's servant used \nCarlyle's manuscript as kindling to start a fire. \u0014\n\u0014\n     As Mill reported the devastating news, Carlyle's face paled. Two \nyears of his life were lost. Thousands of long, lonely hours spent \nwriting had been wasted. He could not imagine writing the book again. \nHe lapsed into a deep depression. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Then one day while walking the city streets, Carlyle noticed a \nstone wall under construction. He was transfixed. That tall sweeping \nwall was being raised one brick at a time. It was a \"eureka\" for him. \nIf he wrote one page at a time, one day at a time, he could write the \nbook again. And that is exactly what he did.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Christian observes, \"When faced with seemingly impossible \nsituations, we often see the wall and not the individual bricksbut \ntaken day by day, task by task, the load is more manageable. Christ \nprayed for daily bread, daily sustenance. He didn't worry about \ntomorrow, next week, or next year. God's help comes day by day.\"\u0014",

    "words": "The 2000 movie, \"The Patriot\" starred Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin, \na reluctant Revolutionary War hero. Martin has an 18-year-old son \nnamed Gabriel who is eager to join the conflict. Gabriel's sentiments \nfor his country are revealed by one pastime: throughout the first \nhalf of the movie, Gabriel diligently repairs an  American flag he \nfound in the dirt.\u0014\n\u0014\n     Tragically, Gabriel becomes a casualty of the war, and, \nsuffering deep loss, his father Benjamin Martin appears ready to quit \nthe cause. While Martin is grieving at the side of his dead son, \nColonel Harry Burwell, a Continental officer, attempts to persuade \nMartin not to quit. He recognizes Martin has great influence with the \nsoldiers and his departure would demoralize the troops. \u0014\n\u0014\n     As the scene opens, the colonel says, \"Stay the course, Martin. \nStay the course.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     Grief-stricken, Martin responds, \"I've run the course.\" Resigned \nto the outcome, the colonel informs the troops and they ride on, \nleaving Martin behind. \u0014\n\u0014\n     As Martin loads his son's personal effects on his horse, though, \nhe finds the American flag Gabriel had successfully restored. \u0014\n\u0014\n     As the dejected soldiers ride away, certain they have seen the \nlast of Benjamin Martin, Martin appears in the distance, carrying the \nflag. With determination in his posture, he rides upright in his \nsaddle, face like flint, the Stars and Stripes whipping in the wind. \nMartin has been a symbol of perseverance for the men, and there is a \ntriumphant shout of both relief and excitement from the once-weary \ntroops as they see the patriot crest the hill. \u0014\n\u0014\n     Whether leaders at home, school, work or church, we must never \nunderestimate the power of our influence to demoralize or to rally \nothers.

But the damage had already been done.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Israeli commentators say global attitudes against \nPalestinian suicide bombings are likely to harden after\u0014\n          the attacks on the United States, and that Israel is \nexpected to have a freer hand to hit back.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"For Israel the immediate short-term consequence will \ncertainly be greater understanding of what we have\u0014\n          been facing and perhaps toleration of a serious effort to \nenter Palestinian Authority territory to confiscate\u0014\n          Palestinian weapons,\" Israeli commentator Jonathan \nRosenblum wrote in the Jerusalem Post.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Ehud Sprinzak, an Israeli expert on terrorism, wrote in the \nMaariv newspaper: \"The terrible disaster in the\u0014\n          United States is a dark and gloomy day for Arafat.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"From the perspective of Jews, it is the most important \npublic relations act ever committed in our favor,\" he\u0014\n          said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Palestinians accuse Israel of taking advantage of the \nsituation by launching military offensives while\u0014\n          the eyes of the world are turned away from the violence \nthat has raged since a Palestinian uprising began\u0014\n          against occupation nearly a year ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Israeli troops shot and killed 13 Palestinians in less than \n48 hours during their latest incursion in the\u0014\n          Jenin area of the northern West Bank.

Cars\u0014\n          honked their horns and gunmen fired into the air from \nassault rifles in celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But many other Palestinians have criticized the attacks and \nexpressed sympathy with Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"The general picture was completely different,\" said \nGhassan al-Khatib, a former Palestinian peace\u0014\n          negotiator.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Palestinian children stood in silence in schools to \nremember the victims.

    "words": "PRESIDENT NIXON: ALONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE  - a \nbook review\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Who was Richard Nixon? The most amazing thing \nabout the man was not what he did as\u0014\n                     president, but that he became president. In \n'President Nixon,' Richard Reeves has used\u0014\n                     thousands of new interviews and recently \ndiscovered or declassified documents and\u0014\n                     tapes -- including Nixon's tortured memos to \nhimself and unpublished sections of H. R.\u0014\n                     Haldeman's diaries -- to offer a nuanced and \nsurprising portrait of the brilliant and\u0014\n                     contradictory man alone in the White House. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     President Nixon is a startling narrative of a \ndesperately introverted man who dreamed\u0014\n                     of becoming the architect of his times. Late at \nnight, he sat upstairs in the White House\u0014\n                     writing notes to himself on his yellow pads, \nstruggling to define himself and his goals:\u0014\n                     \"Compassionate, Bold, New, Courageous...Zest for \nthe job (not lonely but awesome).\u0014\n                     Goals -- reorganized govt...Each day a chance to \ndo something memorable for\u0014\n                     someone. Need to be good to do good...Need for \njoy, serenity, confidence, inspiration.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     But downstairs he was building a house of \ndeception. He could trust no one because in\u0014\n                     his isolation he thought other people were like \nhim. He governed by secret orders and\u0014\n                     false records, memorizing scripts for public \nappearances and even for one-on-one\u0014\n                     meetings with his own staff and cabinet. His \nprincipal assistants, Haldeman and Henry\u0014\n                     Kissinger, spied on him as he spied on them, \nwhile cabinet members, generals, and\u0014\n                     admirals spied on all of them -- rifling \nbriefcases and desks, tapping each other's\u0014\n                     phones in a house where no one knew what was \ntrue anymore. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Nixon's first aim was to restore order in an \nAmerica at war with itself over Vietnam. But in\u0014\n                     fact he prolonged the fighting there, lying \nsystematically about what was happening\u0014\n                     both in the field and in the peace negotiations. \nHe startled the world by going to\u0014\n                     communist China and seeking dtente with the \nSoviet Union -- and then secretly\u0014\n                     persuaded Mao and Brezhnev to lie for him to \nprotect petty White House secrets. Still,\u0014\n                     he was a man of vision, imagining a new world \norder, trying to stall the deadly race war\u0014\n                     he believed was inevitable between the West, \nincluding Russia, and Asia, led by China\u0014\n                     and Japan. At home, he promised welfare reform, \nrevenue sharing, drug programs, and\u0014\n                     environmental protection, and he presided, \nreluctantly, over the desegregation of public\u0014\n                     schools -- all the while declaring that domestic \ngovernance was just building outhouses\u0014\n                     in Peoria. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Reeves shows a presidency doomed from the start. \nIt begins with Nixon and Kissinger\u0014\n                     using the CIA to cover up a 1969 murder by \nAmerican soldiers in Vietnam that led to the\u0014\n                     theft and publication of the Pentagon Papers, \nthen to secret counterintelligence units in\u0014\n                     the White House and finally to the burglaries \nand cover-up that came to be known as\u0014\n                     Watergate. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Richard Reeves's \"President Nixon\" will stand as \nthe authoritative account of Nixon in the\u0014\n                     White House. It is an astonishing story.\u0014\n------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n*Starred Review* Syndicated columnist Reeves plunges into the \nmountains of written\u0014\n                     material and tapes generated by \"a presidency . \n. . documented with a compulsion that\u0014\n                     will probably never be repeated,\" adds \ninterviews and oral histories, and emerges with a\u0014\n                     nuanced, immensely sad portrait of Richard Nixon \nat 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Nixon believed his allies\u0014\n                     and adversaries on the national and \ninternational scene operated as he did: trusting no\u0014\n                     one, seeking always to manipulate. It was this \napproach, Reeves suggests, that\u0014\n                     produced \"a chaos of lies\" at the White House. \nReeves' narrative is chronological, from\u0014\n                     Nixon's inauguration in January 1969 to April \n1973, when he realized that he had lost\u0014\n                     control over the Watergate scandals.

All \nrights reserved\u0014\n\u0014\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nFrom Publishers Weekly \u0014\n                     Syndicated columnist and biographer Reeves\u0014\n                     (President Kennedy: Profile of Power) presents an\u0014\n                     authoritative worm's-eye view of Nixon's insular\u0014\n                     presidency, wherein even secretaries of state \nand defense were out of the loop on\u0014\n                     foreign policy, and Nixon himself couldn't be \nbothered with domestic policy except as a\u0014\n                     chess match for power. A tightly chronological \nabundance of details reveals how\u0014\n                     secrets, lies and isolation pervaded Nixon's \nadministration. He lied even about things as\u0014\n                     trivial as his work habits; wrote memos to his \nfamily instructing them on how to portray\u0014\n                     him as a warm family man; preferred dealing only \nwith Haldeman, Ehrlichman and\u0014\n                     Kissinger, while hiding from and distrusting \nmost of his staff long before Watergate; and\u0014\n                     extended his enmity for \"the establishment\" to \ninclude business leaders, congressional\u0014\n                     Republicans and the Pentagon, even accusing the \nlatter of conspiring against his\u0014\n                     desire to crush North Vietnam. Reeves \nimpressively demonstrates that Watergate grew\u0014\n                     directly and naturally out of the fundamental \ncharacteristics of Nixon's administration.\u0014\n                     Unfortunately, dogged adherence to his avowed \naim \"to reconstruct the Nixon\u0014\n                     presidency as it looked from the center\" \nobliterates much-needed context and\u0014\n                     reflection. For example, Reeves never critically \nquestions Nixon's evidently cynical\u0014\n                     exploitations of racism, often recast in neutral \nterms, nor considers the subsequent\u0014\n                     historical consequences. He alludes to Nixon's \nfascination with Disraeli, but never\u0014\n                     explores how this affected his outlook. This \nrichly detailed miniature, crabbed and\u0014\n                     claustrophobic, leaves undone the task of \nplacing its subject in perspective. (Oct.\u0014\n                     1)Forecast: Reeves is highly respected, as \nevidenced by the sale of first serial rights to\u0014\n                     Newsweek (on sale Aug. 27) and a booking on the \nToday Show (Sept. 24). He will do an\u0014\n                     eight-city tour. Despite its flaws, this inside \nlook at Nixon will fascinate many and, with a\u0014\n                     first printing of 65,000, should do very well \nsales-wise. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     From Booklist \u0014\n                     *Starred Review* Syndicated columnist Reeves \nplunges into the mountains of written\u0014\n                     material and tapes generated by \"a presidency . \n. . documented with a compulsion that\u0014\n                     will probably never be repeated,\" adds \ninterviews and oral histories, and emerges with a\u0014\n                     nuanced, immensely sad portrait of Richard Nixon \nat 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

A survey by the Pew\u0014\n                 Research Center found that 69 percent of American \nadults say they have been praying more\u0014\n                 since the terrorist attacks. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But what if you don't know how to pray? If you have \nno adult practice or childhood training to\u0014\n                 draw on? If you feel moved by recent events to pray \nbut you aren't sure how prayer works? \u0014\n\u0014\n                 First of all, don't worry about how it works, says \nMarcus Braybrooke, patron of the International\u0014\n                 Interfaith Centre in Oxford, England, and author of \n''Learn to Pray'' (Chronicle Books). He\u0014\n                 compares praying with plugging in an electrical \nappliance or logging on to the Internet. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 ''It's a way of connecting,'' he says in telephone \ninterview from his home near Oxford. ''We may\u0014\n                 not understand how electricity or the World Wide Web \nwork, but we still benefit from using them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 ''Likewise, when we pray we may not at first \nunderstand to whom we are praying, nor how we\u0014\n                 might be answered, but by daring to make the \nconnection we can access a reservoir of energy\u0014\n                 and understanding that is buried within us.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Braybrooke, a 35-year veteran of worldwide \ninterfaith movements, sees prayer in broad,\u0014\n                 inclusive terms, believing that the urge to pray may \ncome before belief or faith in a traditional\u0014\n                 view of God. ''I start with the assumption that \npeople are by nature religious, even if they are not\u0014\n                 observant in any particular faith community,'' he \nsays. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Whatever it is that calls us to prayer, prayer \nitself calls us to be honest, says Mark Galli,\u0014\n                 managing editor of Christianity Today and co-author \nof ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Prayer''\u0014\n                 (Alpha Books). \u0014\n\u0014\n                 ''The place to start is simply to address God in a \nway that's extremely honest about where\u0014\n                 you're at,'' Galli says in a telephone interview \nfrom Chicago. '' 'God, I haven't prayed before. I\u0014\n                 don't know what to say. I don't know if I believe or \nnot.' \u0014\n\u0014\n                 ''Prayer is about having some sort of relationship \nwith God,'' says Galli, an ordained Presbyterian\u0014\n                 minister. ''If that relationship is one of \nconfusion, doubt, anxiety or wonder, then that's what it is.''\u0014\n\u0014\n                 In his own prayer life, Galli draws often on the \nEpiscopal Book of Common Prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Although he has been praying daily for years, he \nstill finds that these tried-and-true prayers\u0014\n                 often say what he's feeling better than his own \nwords would. ''These are prayers that articulate\u0014\n                 some of the basic truths of who God is, what comfort \nhe offers. Some of them have been\u0014\n                 honed over thousands of years,'' he says. When he \nprays one, he knows he is joining in a long\u0014\n                 line of believers that stretches back into history \nand forward into the future. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Galli finds himself going back to the prayer book \nagain and again, finding new shades of\u0014\n                 meaning in prayers he's read before. When the \nterrorists struck Sept. 11, he turned to a prayer\u0014\n                 for the nation in the Book of Common Prayer. The \nwords he'd read many times before so moved\u0014\n                 him that he couldn't recite them aloud at his family \ndinner table. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 ''It can take awhile for a pre-composed prayer to \nsink into a soul,'' Galli says. ''A classic example\u0014\n                 is the Lord's Prayer. It's one of the simplest \nprayers I know, and I could pray it a thousand times\u0014\n                 and every time realize something new about God, \nabout myself. The same is true of the 23rd\u0014\n                 Psalm. ('The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. \n. . .') That's why people turn to these prayers\u0014\n                 over and over again.'' \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Familiar words may be comforting in situations that \notherwise seem all out of joint. Some adult\u0014\n                 Catholics who may not have prayed for years turn to \nthe rosary in times of crisis, says Maria\u0014\n                 Tattu Bowen, a theology professor who teaches \nspirituality courses in Oregon at the University\u0014\n                 of Portland. The rosary is a series of prayers and \nmeditations centered on the lives of Jesus and\u0014\n                 Mary. A strand of beads helps the person praying \nkeep his or her place and stay focused. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Formal prayers, like the rosary or the prayer of St. \nFrancis (''Make me an instrument of your\u0014\n                 peace. . . .'') may be the first options that come \nto mind in a crisis, but there are other\u0014\n                 ''tried-and-true'' ways of praying, Bowen says.\u0014",

A few even carried axes and swords.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Their mission, they said: to enter Afghanistan's Kunar \nprovince and help the country's ruling Taliban defend against any \nground incursions by American troops.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I am an old man. I consider myself lucky to go - and to \nface the death of a martyr,'' said Shah Wazir, 70, a retired \nPakistani army officer. In his hands Saturday morning, he carried a \nFrench rifle from about 1920.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Organizers said similar-sized groups were massing in other \ntowns across North West Frontier Province, an enclave of ethnic \nPashtuns with ties to - and deep feelings for - neighboring \nAfghanistan.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Volunteers gathered in scores of groups of 20, sitting on \nthe ground to be briefed on the ways of jihad - Islamic holy war - by \nmilitary commanders wearing black turbans and full beards similar to \nthe Taliban militia. One key rule: obedience to leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``It is a difficult time for Islam and Muslims. We are in a \ntest. Everybody should be ready to pass the test - and to sacrifice \nour lives,'' said Mohammad Khaled, one brigade leader. Would-be \nwarriors embraced and chanted anti-American slogans.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Hussain Khan, 19, a carpenter from the area, carried a \nKalashnikov and stood with his friend. He said he was leaving behind \na fiancee and joining a just cause.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``Whether I come back alive or I am dead, I'll be fortunate \nbecause I am fighting in the service of Islam,''  Khan said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The call for holy war came this week from Sufi Mohammad, an \noutspoken Muslim cleric who runs a madrassa, or religious school, in \nnearby Madyan. He exhorted ``true Muslims'' to mass and prepare to go \nto Afghanistan - to repel any U.S. ground incursions.\u0014\n\u0014\n          How they will get there, and what they will do upon \narrival, is uncertain. Their way station before entering  Afghanistan \nis Bajur, a borderland tribal village where volunteers from different \narea will come together this weekend.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In this region of Pakistan, Mohammad's organization, Tehrik \nNifaz Shariat Mohammadi Malakand, or Movement for the Enforcement of \nIslamic Laws, has been embraced.\u0014\n\u0014\n          And the cleric's message - that, despite its insistence to \nthe contrary, the United States is waging war on Islam itself - hits \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``This is a strange occasion of world history,'' Mohammad \nsaid Friday. ``For the first time, all the\u0014\nanti-Islamic forces are united against Islam.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          It was impossible to verify how many supporters were \nactually en route to join him. In recent weeks, many  militants have \nclaimed far more backing than rallies eventually produce.\u0014\n\u0014\n          However, the numbers in Temergarah on Saturday morning - \nand the people jammed into trucks and on bus rooftops - suggested \nsupport was heavy. Mohammad's backers say the number to enter \nAfghanistan  will reach 100,000.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``We are not worried about death,'' said Khaled, the \nbrigade leader. ``If we die in jihad, it is something much more \ngreater than to be alive. And we will be taken into paradise.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          The night before, men had massed by the thousands in \nTemergarah and other wind-whipped mountain villages in northeastern \nPakistan's mountains.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Out-of-towners, their conversation crackling with \nanticipation, roamed Temergarah's streets. Pickup trucks patrolled \ntown with loudspeakers attached, calling people to assemble with a \nchant: ``Afghanistan will be a graveyard for Americans.'' Men huddled \naround radios, listening for news about the conflict; most tuned in \nto the BBC.\u0014\n\u0014\n          People camped on porches, beneficiaries of local \nhospitality. Others slept on floors of public buildings.  Mosques \nlodged as many as they could, and supplied food and blankets.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I cannot tolerate the bombing and the cruelty of \nAmericans. I must go,'' said Mamoor Shah, a medicine salesman who, at \n18, already has a wife and child. ``Muslims cannot keep silent.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          For many young men, this is no mere rite of passage. It is \nreligion - and it is blood, heritage and family. ``I'm going. My \nmother sent me to fight for our faith,'' said Farooq Shah, 21, a \nstudent from Buner, 50 miles away. When she told him to go, he had no \nKalashnikov. So she went out, sold her jewelry and bought him one.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Another young man, Zabih Ullah, listed the people to defend \nin his jihad, or holy war - Osama bin Laden, his Arab friends, and \nAfghanistan itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n          And, Ullah said as he prepared for a war, no one will be \npermitted to get in the way.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``If anybody stops us, according to Islamic law we are \nallowed to fight jihad against him also,'' he said. ``We will not put \nour arms down until the end of the American aggression.''\u0014",

I wouldn't dare quote it or \nmake assertions about\u0014\n                      what it said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We are surrounded by people whose awareness of \nthe Bible is\u0014\n                      similarly vague. They heard Bible stories as \nyoung children,\u0014\n                      perhaps had a picture Bible when a little \nolder, and can dimly recall\u0014\n                      declaiming the Second Shepherd's lines in the \nChristmas play. As\u0014\n                      they got older they found Sunday school boring. \nBy high-school\u0014\n                      graduation, if not before, they had stopped \nattending church. Their\u0014\n                      biblical education ground to a halt when they \nlost interest at about\u0014\n                      age 8 or 10.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But that has no effect on their confidence. In \nan essay for the glossy\u0014\n                      highbrow, Harper's, a writer asserted that the \nBible ranks hope\u0014\n                      along with faith and love (good so far) in \nPsalm 23 (uh oh). It's a\u0014\n                      dumb mistake, but it wasn't hers alone; \neditors, proofreaders, even\u0014\n                      fact-checkers comb every word in a magazine of \nthis stature. No\u0014\n                      doubt everyone had a dim memory of something \nlike this being in\u0014\n                      the Bible, and so it was rubber-stamped into \nprint.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      My clipping file includes an urging from the \nWashington Post to\u0014\n                      make Christmas special by \"reading Mark or \nLuke's narrative at\u0014\n                      home.\" (Mark has a birth narrative? Gee, I \ncan't find one.)\u0014\n                      Newsweek describes Jesse Jackson holding hands \nwith the Clintons\u0014\n                      and reciting \"the fifty-first Psalm, David's \nprayer for mercy after he\u0014\n                      had been seduced by Bathsheba.\" (Oh, so that's \nhow it happened!)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      My favorite is a line from that 1980s anthem, \n\"We Are the World\":\u0014\n                      \"As our God has shown us by turning stones to \nbread.\" I picture the\u0014\n                      songwriters Lionel Ritchie and Michael Jackson \nthinking, Hey, we're\u0014\n                      singing to raise money for hunger relief and \nthere's something in the\u0014\n                      Bible about bread and stonesCool!

The book contains only two \ndates. \"[T]wo out of\u0014\n                      the four Dates originally included were \neliminated at the last\u0014\n                      moment, a research done at the Eton and Harrow \nmatch having\u0014\n                      revealed that they are not memorable.\" Sellar \nand Yeatman\u0014\n                      conclude the preface with a salute to their \ncountrymen, \"whose\u0014\n                      historical intuitions and opinions this work \nenshrines.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      English, and even American, readers enjoyed \n1066 and All That\u0014\n                      because they knew their memory was faulty and \nthey could laugh at\u0014\n                      themselves. Such humility is less likely among \ncontemporary\u0014\n                      unchurched people. Conversation about faith or \nmorals is often\u0014\n                      blocked by the other's misunderstanding of what \nthe Bible says or\u0014\n                      what the Christian faith teaches. (Secular \nAmerica is nearly\u0014\n                      unanimous in agreeing that what Christians \nworry about most are\u0014\n                      sexual sins because the only way to get to \nheaven is by doing good\u0014\n                      deeds.) In no other field of study would people \nlean so much on\u0014\n                      impressions they had not updated since \nchildhood. But here\u0014\n                      unwarranted confidence abounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It doesn't occur to people that when they were \nchildren they were\u0014\n                      indeed taught as a childspoonfed the oatmeal \nversion. The true\u0014\n                      depth of faith is likely to be something \nthey've never encountered.\u0014\n                      When, as adults, they encounter the great world \nreligions, they\u0014\n                      perceive depth and complexity and treat them \nwith respect. Yet they\u0014\n                      reflexively think about Christianity like \nchildren, because they\u0014\n                      haven't had a fresh thought about it since \nchildhood.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Otherwise mature people can reject Christianity \nfor silly reasons\u0014\n                      (\"God can't be all-powerful because he didn't \nmake Fluffy get better\u0014\n                      when she was hit by a car\"). These unexamined \nconclusions act as\u0014\n                      an inoculation against further thought. Truly \neducated people would\u0014\n                      be embarrassed to misquote Shakespeare or \nProust as they do the\u0014\n                      Bible. Perhaps when they were children they put \naway childish\u0014\n                      things. Now that they're grownups, they should \ngo back and read\u0014\n                      the adult version.\u0014",

    "words": "Public Access Prayers\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Your pastoral prayer, for some, may be their \nonly connection to the power of the\u0014\n                      Almighty.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dave Wiersbe\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One Sunday after worship, a first-time guest \nsaid to me, \"I appreciated\u0014\n                      the pastoral prayer.\" I forget my response. I \nwas stunned to learn that\u0014\n                      someone cared about that part of the service. \nSomeone besides God.\u0014\n                      Since then I've learned how important the \npastoral prayer is.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A few years ago, Leadership printed a cartoon \nwith a pastor greeting\u0014\n                      people after the church service. He spies the \nman next in line to shake\u0014\n                      his hand. The cartoonist takes us into the \npastor's thoughts: \"Oh, no!\u0014\n                      There's Bob. I told him last week I'd be \npraying for him and I forgot!\u0014\n                      Dear Lord, bless Bob. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then the pastor says, \"Hi, Bob! How are you? \nBeen prayin' for you!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As I look across the faces in the congregation, \nI wonder how many\u0014\n                      Bobs are out there. How many people long to be \nprayed for, but don't\u0014\n                      know the comfort of hearing another believer \nspeak their need to the\u0014\n                      Lord?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I want our people to know they are prayed for. \nAnd I want them to\u0014\n                      experience the peace of resting under the \nprayers of a pastor who\u0014\n                      takes seriously the charge to carry them before \nGod's throne. One of\u0014\n                      the best ways is through the pastoral prayer on \nSunday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I mean it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I discovered early in my ministry that my \n\"spontaneous\" pastoral\u0014\n                      prayer began sounding repetitious. Even the \noffertory prayer grew\u0014\n                      redundant: \"Bless these gifts and use them to \nyour glory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If the congregation was to know the depths of \nmy heart in praying for\u0014\n                      them, then I needed to replace the routine of \nad lib prayers with a\u0014\n                      fresher approach. So I sought out resources.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The prayers in Scripture offer a rich source of \nproven ways to approach\u0014\n                      God. Psalm 66:20 grabbed my attention during \ndevotions, and I traced\u0014\n                      the phrase \"Blessed be God\" through the other \npsalms.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The next Sunday I began the first six \nstatements of the pastoral prayer\u0014\n                      with, \"Blessed be God,\" followed by a reason \nfor blessing him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After worship a woman came up and grabbed my \nhand. She said that\u0014\n                      she had prayed on the way to church for that \nmorning's service to be\u0014\n                      different. \"When you began the prayer with, \n'Blessed be God,' my\u0014\n                      heart soared. I knew God heard my prayer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the first Easter we scheduled two worship \nservices, I did not have\u0014\n                      lots of time for a rambling extemporaneous \nprayer. Every word had to\u0014\n                      count. How could I make the prayer communicate \nthe joy, power, and\u0014\n                      wonder of the Resurrection?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A pastor friend had loaned me The Book of \nCommon Worship so I'd\u0014\n                      know the liturgy for the community Good Friday \nservice. I lifted some\u0014\n                      ideas for my Easter prayer. Our invocation that \nmorning began,\u0014\n                      \"Rejoice, heavenly powers! Sing, choirs of \nangels! Exult, all creation\u0014\n                      around God's throne! Jesus Christ our King is \nrisen!\" In the pastoral\u0014\n                      prayer I adapted words from the ancient Prayer \nof Adoration: \"Glory to\u0014\n                      you, O God; you have defeated death, raising \nJesus from the grave,\u0014\n                      and giving us eternal life. Glory to you, Risen \nLord; for us and for our\u0014\n                      salvation you overcame death and opened the \ngate to everlasting life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those words had never been used in our church, \nand the response\u0014\n                      was electric. People listened. People \nresponded. Most were glad for\u0014\n                      the vitality of carefully chosen words.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So I plan it\u0014\n\u0014\n                      From those experiences I began to plan my \npastoral prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Usually I complete my sermon preparation on \nSaturday evening. Then\u0014\n                      I work on the prayer. I refer to our Thursday \nnight prayer list to remind\u0014\n                      me of those persons with specific needs. I also \nlist the situations\u0014\n                      different families find themselves in: our \nfarmers need rain; families are\u0014\n                      grieving the death of a loved one; marriages \nare strained; one family is\u0014\n                      about to adopt a baby, while another family has \nsuffered miscarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I do not mention anyone by name unless I have \ntheir permission.\u0014\n                      Some situations are too sensitive to identify, \nso I pray for \"persons\u0014\n                      facing\" specific issues (those in need of work, \nthose who feel the\u0014\n                      absence of a loved one, those who struggle with \ndepression).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Almost every pastoral prayer also includes \nintercession for our\u0014\n                      national, state, or local leaders, for at least \none of our missionary\u0014\n                      families, and for one of the other churches in \ntown. Mentioning another\u0014\n                      church and pastor by name heightens awareness \nof the breadth of\u0014\n                      God's work in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the intercessions have taken shape, I \nshape the bookends of the\u0014\n                      prayer. Beginning with the address, I search \nPsalms and Epistles for\u0014\n                      unique names for God. The language of address \ninforms the words of\u0014\n                      praise and adoration that follow.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If I begin with \"God the Father, Son, and Holy \nSpirit,\" I direct an\u0014\n                      ascription of praise to each person.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If the address is to \"Our Lord Jesus,\" I may \nrefer to his authority as\u0014\n                      Head of the Church, then invoke him as Good \nShepherd when praying\u0014\n                      for those who grieve.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Here is a favorite expression of adoration: \"O \nGod, let us rise to the\u0014\n                      edges of time and open our lives to eternity. \nLet us run to the edges of\u0014\n                      space and gaze into your immensity. Let us \nclimb past the barriers of\u0014\n                      sound and enter your silence; and then, in \nstillness and silence, let us\u0014\n                      adore You, who are Light, Life, Love, without \nbeginning, and without\u0014\n                      end\" (from The Oxford Book of Prayer).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Before moving into the intercessory prayers, I \nreserve a moment to\u0014\n                      address spiritual issues. If the church family \nis facing a test of faith, I\u0014\n                      may adapt the words of St. Anselm: \"We desire \nto understand a little\u0014\n                      of your truth which our hearts already believe \nand love. We do not\u0014\n                      seek to understand so that we can believe, but \nwe believe so that we\u0014\n                      may understand.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally I work on the closing, often drawing on \nthe season. In Advent I\u0014\n                      might say, \"We pray in the name of him whose \ncoming is certain,\u0014\n                      whose day draws near. As the saints long have \nprayed, so we now\u0014\n                      pray: Come quickly, Lord Jesus.\" At Easter, \"in \nthe name of our risen\u0014\n                      Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Book of Common Worship has several prayers \nfor each Sunday\u0014\n                      of the year, based on the lectionary passages. \nEspecially for Advent,\u0014\n                      Lent, and Easter, these prayers offer both \nvariety and a unifying theme\u0014\n                      for the service.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If there is any part of the prayer that I still \nrepeat often, it's the Amen. I\u0014\n                      like to end my public prayers with the phrase \nfrom Psalm 106:48, \"and\u0014\n                      all of God's people said,\" to which \ncongregations never fail to respond,\u0014\n                      \"Amen.\" It allows the congregation to \nparticipate and verbally affirm\u0014\n                      what's been prayed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The final form of the pastoral prayer may last \nfour to seven minutes,\u0014\n                      and I do not write out every word. The address \nand adoration are\u0014\n                      mainly phrases, the petitions simply listed, \nand the closing is as full\u0014\n                      as I need. On most Sunday mornings I learn of \nother requests and jot\u0014\n                      them on my prayer guide.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Every Sunday, I want the whole flock to know \ntheir pastor is taking\u0014\n                      seriously his charge to lift them before the \nGreat Shepherd.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dave Wiersbe pastors the Clear Lake Evangelical \nFree Church in Clear Lake,\u0014\n                      Iowa clefree@juno.com,              LEADERSHIP \nMAGAZINE\u0014",

    "words": "the statistics compiled\u0014\n   by Associate Press writer John Jurgensen this past week. They\u0014\n   certainly help define reality and where we are as people on\u0014\n   Planet Earth in 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Population of the world: 6.1 billion.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Life expectancy at birth: 64.6 (male), 68.6 (female)\u0014\n\u0014\n   Adult literacy rate: 75.7 percent\u0014\n\u0014\n   Estimated total living languages: 6,809\u0014\n\u0014\n   Most widely spoken language: Mandarin, 1.1 billion people\u0014\n\u0014\n   Rank of English among languages spoken by the most people:\u0014\n   4th, 514 million speakers\u0014\n\u0014\n   Number of people who live on less than $1 a day: 1.2 billion,\u0014\n   or one fifth.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Number of volcanoes considered active, having erupted in the\u0014\n   last 10,000 years: 1,511\u0014\n\u0014\n   Earthquakes of a magnitude of 7.0 or greater in 2001: 15\u0014\n\u0014\n   Deaths caused by earthquakes in 2001: 21,436\u0014\n\u0014\n   Number of countries that endured war or other serious conflict\u0014\n   in 2001: 59\u0014\n\u0014\n   Number of people living with HIV/AIDS: 40 million\u0014\n\u0014\n   Number of new HIV infections each day in 2001: 14,000\u0014\n\u0014\n   These numbers give us a glimpse of our world. Amid these grim\u0014\n   statistics, it's easy to be fearful and anxious, but they also\u0014\n   bring to mind the words of Jesus: \"When you hear of wars and\u0014\n   rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen,\u0014\n   but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation,\u0014\n   and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in\u0014\n   various places and famines. These are the beginning of birth\u0014\n   pains. You must be on your guard... All men will hate you\u0014\n   because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be\u0014\n   saved\" (Mark 13: 7-13).\u0014\n\u0014\n   Two other statistics also caught my eye in the AP list:\u0014\n\u0014\n   Estimated number of distinct religions: 10,000\u0014\n\u0014\n   Denominations within Christianity alone: 33,830.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Many people look at those numbers and are tempted to say, \"All\u0014\n   religions are the same. It doesn't matter what you believe.\u0014\n   I'm a spiritual person, but I'm not going to practice any\u0014\n   specific religion.\" Amid that muddy thinking, George\u0014\n   Santayana's clear-eyed observation provides an antidote: \"To\u0014\n   attempt to be religious without practicing a specific religion\u0014\n   is as possible as attempting to speak without a specific\u0014\n   language.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Whichever way you're facing-past or future-may God grant you\u0014\n   wisdom and power in leading people to Jesus in 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\n   --Marshall Shelley is editor of Leadership.

    "title": "PLAYING AGAINST TYPE",
    "words": "RICHARD NIXON\u0014\n\n                                                                                      \nPlaying against type \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Richard Nixon called it \"the week that changed \nthe world.\" Thirty years ago, on Feb.\u0014\n                      21, 1972, Air Force One flew into Beijing \nairport. Nixon stepped off the plane alone and\u0014\n                      reached for the hand of China's premier, Zhou \nEnlai. The handshake, captured live on\u0014\n                      prime-time American television, dramatized an \nend to decades of U.S.-Chinese\u0014\n                      hostilityand to the isolation of the world's \nmost populous nation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It also dramatized something else: a \npresident's power to change the course of\u0014\n                      history by playing against type. An ardent \nanti-Communist, Nixon  had mastered the\u0014\n                      bruising art of bashing Reds and liberals \npurported to be soft on communism. Nixon\u0014\n                      understood perfectly how his past made room to \nmaneuver. He confided to Mao\u0014\n                      Zedong, China's frail paramount leader, that  \n\"those on the right can do what those on the \u0014\n                      left can only talk about.\" Mao's view: \"I like \nrightists.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The term \"Nixon goes to China\" became a \npolitical clichbut also a model for action:\u0014\n                      By spending hard-won political capital, a \nleader could turn the world upside down. Of\u0014\n                      course, the original was hard to top; when a \npro-labor Bill Clinton campaigned for a\u0014\n                      free-trade pact with Mexico, the sideline \nstrategists explained that he'd pulled a \"Nixon\u0014\n                      goes to China.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps. But Nixon wasn't lying when he boasted \nabout changing the world. Just\u0014\n                      before taking office, he told Henry Kissinger, \nsoon to be national security adviser, that\u0014\n                      he wanted to rethink a China policy frozen by \nthe Cold War. The president and\u0014\n                      Kissinger, practitioners of an unsentimental \nrealpolitik, felt closer ties with Beijing could\u0014\n                      tip the global balance of power in America's \nfavor. By building a bridge to China, Nixon\u0014\n                      believed, America would win leverage over \nMoscow and perhaps even break China's\u0014\n                      \"angry isolation.\" What Nixon foresaw all came \nto pass. Moscow, alarmed by the\u0014\n                      opening to China, chose to pursue its own \ndtente with Nixon. American and Chinese\u0014\n                      diplomats hashed out the Shanghai Communiqu, a \nblueprint for full normalization of\u0014\n                      ties. It so successfully finessed the delicate \nissue of Taiwan that it remains policy to\u0014\n                      this day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nixon's penchant for secrecy pervaded the \nlead-up to the summit. The initial diplomatic\u0014\n                      probings were conducted clandestinelyand \nlargely excluded the State Department,\u0014\n                      which Nixon suspected would leak to the press \nand resist change. Secret channels of\u0014\n                      communication to Beijing were opened through \nthe Pakistani and Romanian\u0014\n                      governments. Although Nixon mused publicly \nabout his desire to visit China someday\u0014\n                      and even eased trade and travel restrictions \nwith the mainland, China-watchers\u0014\n                      missed what was coming. By the summer of 1971, \nthe secret contacts had landed an\u0014\n                      invitation for Kissinger to visit the Chinese \ncapital. On a visit to Pakistan, he faked a\u0014\n                      stomach ailment and dropped out of sight of \nreporters, then flew to China on a\u0014\n                      Pakistani jet. Kissinger sent Nixon a \nprearranged one-word message to signal\u0014\n                      success: \"Eureka.\" Four days later, on July 15, \nNixon stunned Americans by\u0014\n                      announcing that he would go to China.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nixon devoted himself to making the trip a \ntelevision extravaganza. His advance team\u0014\n                      ensured that journalists would be fed a full \nmenu of striking images of the Nixons at\u0014\n                      the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the \nextravagant banquetsbut not the details of\u0014\n                      the negotiations. A burly staffer blocked \nadvisers (including Kissinger) from exiting Air\u0014\n                      Force One so that only Nixon would be \nimmortalized in pictures of the first handshake\u0014\n                      with Chou. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most of the careful scripting worked, but \nmoments of unintended humor crept in\u0014\n                      anyway. There were the Nixons uneasily soaking \nup a revolutionary operaThe Red\u0014\n                      Detachment of Womenstaged by the fanatical \nwife of Mao, Chiang Ching. When\u0014\n                      asked his opinion of the Great Wall, Nixon \nanswered, earnestly: \"This is a great wall.\"\u0014\n                      At the farewell banquet in Shanghai, the leader \nof the Western world seemed to get\u0014\n                      tipsy from mao-tai, China's sorghum firewater. \nAfter many toasts, an unusually gushy\u0014\n                      Nixon seemed to offer a U.S. guarantee to \nprotect China from attack. He didn't mean to.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, as Nixon flew home in triumph, the mood \non Air Force One was oddly subdued.\u0014\n                      He brooded over the expected media criticisms \nand conservative backlash. Back in the\u0014\n                      Oval Office, Nixon felt compelled to embellish \nthe breakthrough. Kissinger sensed \"a\u0014\n                      lack of assurance even during his greatest \naccomplishments\"one of the character\u0014\n                      flaws that would sink Nixon's presidency. \"It \nwas,\" Kissinger wrote in his memoirs,\u0014\n                      \"the psychological essence of the Watergate \ndebacle.\" -Thomas Omestad\u0014\n                      U.S. News and World Report\u0014",

WALSH\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Gerald Ford | Jimmy Carter | Ronald Reagan | \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush | Bill Clinton \u0014\n\u0014\n                     It was one of the most humiliating images of the \npast 30 years: Thousands of\u0014\n                     Vietnamese civilians, including frail old men \nand weeping mothers with terrified infants,\u0014\n                     clawed their way to the tops of buildings and \nclimbed fences to reach the U.S.\u0014\n                     Embassy in Saigon. They were making a final, \ndesperate bid for their lives, hoping for\u0014\n                     evacuation by helicopter as Communist forces \nmarched into the besieged capital of\u0014\n                     South Vietnam. The date: April 29, 1975. The \npictures brought home some painful\u0014\n                     realities: The war in Vietnam was lost, \nAmerica's sense of invincibility shattered. The\u0014\n                     nation's confidence lay trampled in the steaming \nrice paddies of Southeast Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     If the fall of Saigon represented an America in \ndecline, a more recent imageof\u0014\n                     the three rescue workers raising Old Glory amid \nthe rubble of the World Trade\u0014\n                     Centershows a nation resolved, a people sure of \ntheir triumph over the terrorists \u0014\n                     President Bush calls \"the evildoers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Those two images  bracket the past three \ndecades. Much of the\u0014\n                     credit or blame for the history of that era can \nbe attributed to the six presidents who\u0014\n                     have led the country since the mid-1970sGerald \nFord, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan,\u0014\n                     George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and, \ntoday, George W. Bush. Only twice\u0014\n                     before have there been as many as five living \nex-presidentsonce at the start of\u0014\n                     Abraham Lincoln's administration and again at \nthe start of Bill Clinton's first term.\u0014\n                     Scholars will be assessing their performance for \nyears to come, but the former\u0014\n                     presidents have their own ideas about what it \ntakes to be an effective leader in times\u0014\n                     of crisis. For the first time, four of the five \nliving ex-presidents, Ford, Carter, Bush, and\u0014\n                     Clinton, granted separate interviews to a news \norganizationU.S. Newsto discuss\u0014\n                     presidential leadership over the past three \ndecades. President Reagan, afflicted with\u0014\n                     Alzheimer's disease, was unable to participate, \nbut Nancy Reagan and several of his\u0014\n                     former senior aides, including Michael Deaver \nand Ken Duberstein, spoke on his\u0014\n                     behalf.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Three of the six presidents led wars during \ntheir time in office: Ford in Vietnam,\u0014\n                     George H. W. Bush in the Persian Gulf, and, now, \nGeorge W. Bush in Afghanistan.\u0014\n                     The other three ordered a number of military \noperations during their tenures. In April\u0014\n                     1980, Carter approved a controversial mission to \nrescue American hostages in\u0014\n                     Tehran, Iran, that ended in disaster. Ronald \nReagan ordered a successful invasion of\u0014\n                     Grenada and rid the tiny Caribbean island of the \nradical Marxists who took over in\u0014\n                     October 1983. Reagan hadn't been as lucky when \nhe sent marines into Lebanon to\u0014\n                     show American resolve through military forcea \ncenterpiece of his foreign policy; the\u0014\n                     Marine compound at Beirut International Airport \nwas bombed on Oct. 23, 1983; 241\u0014\n                     Americans were killed. In 1993, Clinton \nbroadened America's intervention in Somalia,\u0014\n                     which he inherited from Bush, resulting in the \ndeaths of several American soldiers;\u0014\n                     one of their corpses was dragged through the \nstreets of Mogadishu. Clinton also\u0014\n                     ordered various if limited bombing campaigns in \nthe former Yugoslavia and launched\u0014\n                     strikes against terrorists more than once, never \nwith overwhelmingly successful\u0014\n                     results.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     What makes an effective commander in chief? \n\"First and foremost, he needs to come\u0014\n                     up with an effective strategy for winning the \nwar,\" says presidential historian Robert\u0014\n                     Dallek. \"Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt \nwere examples of presidents who\u0014\n                     succeeded on that count. Harry Truman and Lyndon \nJohnson, on the other hand, had\u0014\n                     stumbling and failed war strategies. Second, you \nneed to have a long-term vision of\u0014\n                     what to do with your victory . . . of how to win \nthe peace. Here, Wilson was the\u0014\n                     greatest visionary in the history of the \ncountry,\" even though his notion of a League of\u0014\n                     Nations was too far ahead of its time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Unfortunately, Dallek says, none of the past \nfive presidents or the current commander\u0014\n                     in chief measures up very well as a visionary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Yet all the former presidents interviewed give a \nmore complex definition than Dallek's\u0014\n                     or most other historians' of what makes an \neffective commander in chief. Most\u0014\n                     decisions made under life-and-death \ncircumstances can't be so neatly dissected, they\u0014\n                     say. All mention the ability to set a clear \nmission, to establish the rightness of\u0014\n                     America's cause, to demonstrate resolve, and to \npersuade America and key allies to\u0014\n                     support administration policies. And there was \ngeneral agreement that leadership in a\u0014\n                     foreign-policy crisis can be easier, or at least \nless complicated, than leadership in\u0014\n                     peacetime or on domestic affairs because a \npresident can act unilaterally in an\u0014\n                     international crisis. \"The domestic situation is \ninfinitely more difficult,\" Carter says,\u0014\n                     \"because when a president launches a war, \njustified or not, he immediately becomes\u0014\n                     the commander in chief and the leader of young \nmen and women overseas whose\u0014\n                     lives are in danger and who are sacrificing to \naccomplish a national goal. Whereas\u0014\n                     when you are immersed in the details of \nadministration . . . that's when you lose the\u0014\n                     image of a decisive commander in chief and you \nbecome, in effect, more like a prime\u0014\n                     minister. . . . So there is quite a lot of \ndifference there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Vice President Dick Cheney, who has seen his \nshare of international crises over the\u0014\n                     years as an adviser to three presidents, also \nsees a significant difference between\u0014\n                     presidential leadership during peacetime and \nwar. \"It centers on the role of commander\u0014\n                     in chief,\" Cheney says. \"A lot of what a \npresident does is to exercise shared\u0014\n                     responsibilitymost of the time, with Congress, \nwhether it's getting a budget approved\u0014\n                     or a major piece of legislation authorized. When \nyou get into the military arena and\u0014\n                     you've deployed forces and you're having to make \ncommand decisions, in effect, as\u0014\n                     commander in chief, that's not a shared \nresponsibility.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"You've got to bring the Congress along,\" adds \nCheney, former defense secretary\u0014\n                     under George H. W. Bush and White House chief of \nstaff for Ford. \". . . But it's much\u0014\n                     more that everybody understands you look to the \npresident to make those basic,\u0014\n                     fundamental, key decisionswhen to deploy, how \nto deploy, and to approve your\u0014\n                     overall strategy on when to decide to use \nmilitary forceand to get the mix right\u0014\n                     between military force and diplomacy and \nintelligence activities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Bill Clinton says leadership in a foreign crisis \nis challenging in a special way. \"For one\u0014\n                     thing,\" he observes, \"the people you're dealing \nwith are different and the options for\u0014\n                     compromise may be much more limited, and so the \nconsequences of a mistake may be\u0014\n                     far greater. The job largely consists of, it \nseems to me, No. 1, having a vision of where\u0014\n                     we are, a clear understanding of where we are, \nand a good vision of where you think\u0014\n                     America ought to go. Coming up with a strategy \nto get there and then implementing it.\u0014\n                     And you know, doing what you ran for office to \ndo.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The presidents agree that a commander in chief \nis frequently defined by unexpected\u0014\n                     events. Presidents who lead in times of peace \nand prosperity, like Clinton, rarely have\u0014\n                     the chance to demonstrate their leadership \ncapabilities to the fullest. And even those\u0014\n                     who provide effective wartime leadership, like \nGeorge H. W. Bush, don't automatically\u0014\n                     get re-elected. If they fail to connect with \nvoters over domestic issues, especially\u0014\n                     during an economic downturn, they run into \ntrouble.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Yet former President Bush says domestic politics \nhad nothing to do with his decision\u0014\n                     to stand and fight. Not only did the Persian \nGulf War drive Iraq out of Kuwait, he\u0014\n                     argues, but it also helped make the case for \nU.S. military engagement around the\u0014\n                     world. \"It did restore faith in our military \nafter Vietnam,\" Bush says. \". . . People saw\u0014\n                     that the smart bombs were smart, and there were \nfar less casualties than some\u0014\n                     predicted . . . and we were fighting for the \nright reasons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In the future, the challenges will only get more \ncomplicated, Carter says: \"The United\u0014\n                     States has now become, for the first time since \nthe Roman Empire, maybe even before\u0014\n                     then, the dominant military and political \nfactor, maybe economic factor, on Earth . . . .\u0014\n                     How we handle that new enormous power in a \nresponsible and benevolent way is a\u0014\n                     challenge that we have not faced. . . . I think \nit would be a mistake for us to become\u0014\n                     arrogant, or rely too easily on our own military \npower, or to ignore the legitimate needs\u0014\n                     of people around the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Gerald Ford (1974-77). In many ways, Ford was \ndealt the most difficult hand of any\u0014\n                     president in the past three decades. As a \nRepublican congressman from Grand\u0014\n                     Rapids, Mich., he never sought the presidency; \nRichard Nixon named him vice\u0014\n                     president after his original running mate, Spiro \nAgnew, resigned amid a corruption\u0014\n                     scandal. Ford succeeded to the presidency in \nAugust 1974, after Nixon resigned\u0014\n                     during the Watergate investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Ford inherited the Vietnam War, approaching its \nmessy conclusion. He had to cope\u0014\n                     with massive disaffection at home, not only \nagainst the war but against politics,\u0014\n                     government, capitalism, and traditional \nmorality. Children seemed to be turning against\u0014\n                     their parents, blacks against whites, women \nagainst men, region against region,\u0014\n                     liberals against conservatives. America appeared \nto be approaching a nervous\u0014\n                     breakdown, and the pundits wondered if the \npresidency was too big a job for one\u0014\n                     individual.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     At first, Ford seemed ill-prepared for the White \nHouse. Saturday Night Live mocked him\u0014\n                     as a klutz barely able to walk and talk at the \nsame time. But the caricature bore little\u0014\n                     resemblance to the man, a Yale Law School \ngraduate, a leader in Congress, and a\u0014\n                     lifelong athlete. It was on an issue of \npolitical morality that Ford ran into his deepest\u0014\n                     trouble. Believing the nation was becoming \nunhinged by the endless recriminations\u0014\n                     over Nixon's behavior, he decided the best \ncourse was to pardon his predecessor of\u0014\n                     all crimes and hope the nation would move on. \nFord was castigated at the time, and\u0014\n                     the Nixon pardon was a big reason he lost his \nbid for election to Jimmy Carter in 1976.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Today, however, Ford is serene about the \ndecision. He speaks emotionally of his deep\u0014\n                     gratitude to Sen. Ted Kennedy and other members \nof the Kennedy family for awarding\u0014\n                     him a \"profile in courage\" award last year for \ngranting the pardon under such difficult\u0014\n                     conditions. \"It was a great big thrill,\" Ford \nsays. \"You have no idea. The criticism was\u0014\n                     so sharp when I did it, and to have these \ndistinguished people publicly indicating how\u0014\n                     they felt, it was a wonderful vindication.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Looking back on the past 30 years, Ford told \nU.S. News: \"I do feel that absolute\u0014\n                     integrity is a cornerstone of a successful \npresidency. Integrity, character . . . . In\u0014\n                     addition, I think there is a great benefit for a \npresident to have . . . experience,\u0014\n                     exposure to the issues, domestic and \ninternational. I'm a little prejudiced. I think it's\u0014\n                     understood. I think that Congress is the great \ntraining ground for a president, at least it\u0014\n                     certainly was in my case.''\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Jimmy Carter (1977-81). Campaigning as a simple \npeanut farmer who promised\u0014\n                     never to tell a lie, Carter narrowly defeated \nFord in 1976. The former Democratic\u0014\n                     governor of Georgia went on to endure his own \ntrials and tribulations before being\u0014\n                     ousted by Ronald Reagan in 1980. \"We had some \nvery dangerous times when I was\u0014\n                     president,\" Carter says. \"We tried to bring \npeace to other people as much as we\u0014\n                     possibly could, and human rights was a basic \nfoundation of our entire foreign policy.\u0014\n                     We never found a need to drop a bomb or launch a \nmissile . . . . I have to say, as\u0014\n                     commander I chief, I would have done so if I \nthought the security of my country was\u0014\n                     involved. But I think the restraint on ourselves \nand our tremendous power is the\u0014\n                     biggest challenge of the future.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Carter was surprised by the Soviet Union's \ninvasion of Afghanistan in 1979. When\u0014\n                     Iranian revolutionaries seized more than 50 \nAmericans on Nov. 4, 1979, and held them\u0014\n                     hostage for more than a year, he seemed weak and \nineffective. But most important to\u0014\n                     voters was his failure to reduce the sense of \ndisaffection and decline that had\u0014\n                     plagued Ford for his 21/2 years in the White \nHouse. The economy tanked; inflation hit\u0014\n                     double digits. Long gas lines left many \nAmericans feeling life was spinning out of\u0014\n                     control.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Ronald Reagan (1981-89). Reagan arguably \nestablished the clearest and most\u0014\n                     successful style of leadership in the past 30 \nyears. The oldest man ever to serve as\u0014\n                     president (he turned 70 about two weeks after he \nwas sworn in), he set a handful of\u0014\n                     big objectivesrolling back communism, cutting \ntaxes, curbing government growthand\u0014\n                     won over the country with his sunny optimism. He \nalso scared lots of people with his\u0014\n                     hard-line rhetoric, including his denunciation \nof the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire\"\u0014\n                     bent on dominating the world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The former GOP governor of California showed \nconsiderable grace under pressure\u0014\n                     two months after his inauguration, when he was \nshot by John Hinckley Jr. on March\u0014\n                     30, 1981. Near death, he insisted on walking \ninto the hospital from his limousine, only\u0014\n                     to sink to one knee after he stepped through the \ndoor. \"He believed it was part of the\u0014\n                     role of the president of the United States to \nshow strength and confidence to the\u0014\n                     American people,\" recalls Michael Deaver. \"You \nnever saw weakness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     From then on, Reagan saw himself as a man of \ndestiny. He believed he was spared\u0014\n                     for a reasonto pursue his conservative agenda. \nBut he had mixed results. His\u0014\n                     enormous tax cuts and his huge defense buildup \nhelped swell the budget deficit, but\u0014\n                     the economy boomed and communism unraveled. He \ngot into trouble with the\u0014\n                     Iran-contra affair, an overzealous attempt to \naid anti-Marxist rebels in Nicaragua by\u0014\n                     sending them the profits from arms sales to \nIran. But he made unexpected progress in\u0014\n                     improving East-West relations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In fact, his relationship with Soviet leader \nMikhail Gorbachev was historic in ending the\u0014\n                     tensions between Washington and Moscow. Both \narrived on the scene at precisely\u0014\n                     the right moment, with solid political support \nat home and enough energy and political\u0014\n                     will to move the East-West relationship to a \nnew, cooperative phase.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Former advisers like Deaver and Duberstein say \nit was Reagan's clarity of purpose\u0014\n                     that was his biggest strength. His wife, who \nknows him best, agrees. \"Obviously,\"\u0014\n                     she told U.S. News, \"Ronnie had tremendous \ncommunication skills, but I've always\u0014\n                     believed that his clear sense of himself and his \nsteadfastness to a set of principles\u0014\n                     were his greatest asset.\" That made all the \ndifference.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     George Herbert Walker Bush (1989-93). Bush was \nelected as Reagan's heir,\u0014\n                     although he pledged a \"kinder, gentler\" \nadministration to soften some of Reagan's\u0014\n                     hard-edged policies. His brand of Republican \nconservatism was stymied by a\u0014\n                     Democratic-controlled Congress, but he faced his \nbiggest challenge in 1990 when Iraq\u0014\n                     invaded Kuwait, threatening to destabilize the \nMideast and disrupt the West's oil\u0014\n                     supplies. The resulting Persian Gulf War was a \nhuge success for the United States\u0014\n                     and its allies. The Iraqis were pushed out of \nKuwait in a 100-hour ground assault, and\u0014\n                     Americans were overjoyed. But dictator Saddam \nHussein remained in powerand is\u0014\n                     still reigning today to plague Bush's son.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Still, the elder Bush was an effective wartime \nleader. Unlike on domestic issues,\u0014\n                     where he seemed adrift and sometimes \nuninterested, he was fully engaged in the\u0014\n                     war. Bush was able to rally a divided country \nand Congressa vital part of wartime\u0014\n                     leadership. He defined a clear mission and \nemphasized the justice of the American\u0014\n                     effortmuch as George W. Bush is doing today in \nfighting the terrorist threat. Despite\u0014\n                     his vast experience in foreign affairs as \nReagan's vice president and, before that,\u0014\n                     director of central intelligence and U.S. \nambassador to the United Nations, the elder\u0014\n                     Bush delegated large amounts of authority to \ntalented subordinates, including then\u0014\n                     Gen. Colin Powell and then Defense Secretary \nDick Cheney. It was, in some ways, a\u0014\n                     textbook war.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Bush told U.S. News his role as commander in \nchief was one of the most rewarding\u0014\n                     parts of being president. \"There's the awful \nfeeling of being responsible for someone's\u0014\n                     life,\" he says, but he adds that the cause was \njust and the outcome was successful,\u0014\n                     with minimal U.S. casualties.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Bill Clinton (1993-2001). He swept into the \nWhite House as one of the youngest\u0014\n                     presidents in U.S. history, with seemingly \nunlimited promise. Clinton had been a quick\u0014\n                     study as the Democratic governor of Arkansas, \nand he showed during his campaign\u0014\n                     that he was one of the smartest and most nimble \npoliticians ever to run for the White\u0014\n                     House.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But his record was, to put it mildly, mixed. His \nbiggest slide began in January 1998\u0014\n                     when the Monica Lewinsky story broke. Despite \nhis impeachment by the House, he\u0014\n                     presided over a huge economic boom, and his \ncentrist domestic policies were widely\u0014\n                     popular. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Clinton never faced a sustained foreign-policy \ncrisis or a war, but he did deal several\u0014\n                     times with tense international situations. He \nordered bombing missions in Iraq, and in\u0014\n                     the spring of 1999 he ordered U.S. forces to \nlead a largely successful, 11-week\u0014\n                     NATO bombing campaign in the former Yugoslavia \nto deter repression of ethnic\u0014\n                     Albanians in Kosovo. Clinton always used \nmilitary force, he said, as a last resortand\u0014\n                     made that clear to the troops before he sent \nthem into combat: \"When you ask them to\u0014\n                     do that, [you want them to know] that you have \nexhausted other reasonable\u0014\n                     alternatives and that you have done everything \nyou can to make sure that this is the\u0014\n                     only available course and that the price of not \ndoing it is far greater than the price of\u0014\n                     proceeding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     President Bush's challenge today, Clinton says, \nis to cope with an era of new\u0014\n                     complexities. \"We live in a very different world \nthan we lived in when President Ford\u0014\n                     took office,\" he says. \"While we are more \ndominant than we were 30 years ago, we\u0014\n                     also in some ways are more vulnerable, as we \nhave seen.'' That, of course, is the sad\u0014\n                     lesson that George W. Bush learned, in the most \ntraumatic way, on September 11.\u0014\n                     U.S. News and World Report\u0014",

He told friends he had never \nearned much as a public servant and\u0014\n                      wanted to take care of his family properly. He \nsucceeded, and today he and his wife,\u0014\n                      Betty, live comfortably in posh Rancho Mirage, \nCalif. Ford is probably the most serene\u0014\n                      of the living ex-presidents. At 88, he is in \nremarkably good health and enjoys his\u0014\n                      mostly apolitical life, rarely commenting on \npolicy or granting interviews. One\u0014\n                      exception: his behind-the-scenes effort to find \na compromise that would have avoided\u0014\n                      the impeachment of President Clinton. Calling \nfor censure instead, he hoped to avoid a\u0014\n                      partisan brawl; the effort failed. Over the \nyears, he has forged a close friendship with\u0014\n                      Jimmy Carter, even helping his former adversary \nmonitor elections around the world.\u0014\n                      -K.T.W.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jimmy Carter always sought to promote peace as \npresident, which led critics to call him\u0014\n                      naive. Now he has found peace of mind as a \nprivate citizen by devoting himself to\u0014\n                      good works around the world. Nearly everyone \nagrees that Carter, 77, has become a \u0014\n                      fabulous ex-president. He is the author of \nseveral successful books,  including his latest\u0014\n                      account, An Hour  Before Daylight: Memories of \na Rural Boyhood. He told U.S. News that \u0014\n                      book writing is his main source of income, \nsince he refuses to serve on corporate boards.                       \nBut his passion is the Carter Center in Atlanta, which raises funds \nfor charitable causes \u0014\n                      and seeks solutions to problems of war, \nhuman-rights abuses, and poverty. He and his\u0014\n                      wife, Rosalynn, have also monitored elections \nin emerging democracies and tried to\u0014\n                      mediate a number of international disputes. \n-K.T.W.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ronald Reagan, who turned 91 on February 6, has \nbecome the oldest living\u0014\n                      ex-president in history. But his advanced \nAlzheimer's makes the story of his twilight\u0014\n                      years a sad one. Before his condition worsened, \nhe was content to watch the\u0014\n                      passing parade, confident of his place in \nhistory as the president who helped restore\u0014\n                      America's confidence and contributed to the end \nof the \"evil empire\" of communism.\u0014\n                      Today, he recognizes almost no one and lives in \nseclusion with his wife, Nancy, but\u0014\n                      their love story is as compelling as ever. A \nfriend recently asked Mrs. Reagan if she\u0014\n                      still sleeps in the same bed as her husband. \nYes, she said. Wouldn't you get more\u0014\n                      rest, the friend asked, if you used a rollaway? \nThe former first lady wouldn't hear of it.\u0014\n                      Her husband, she said, might become upset if he \n\"rolled over at night and I'm not\u0014\n                      there.\" -K.T.W.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      George Herbert Walker Bush grins as he gazes at \nthe ceiling of his Houston office.\u0014\n                      There dangles a tiny parachutist under a \nbillowing chute, a reminder of the former\u0014\n                      president's adventures a few years back when he \njumped from a plane to\u0014\n                      commemorate the moment when he safely bailed \nout of a crippled torpedo bomber in\u0014\n                      World War II. Bush, 77, always loved the active \nlife, but he walks stiffly now because\u0014\n                      of hip surgery and feels no need to repeat such \nacts of derring-do. In some ways, he\u0014\n                      is living vicariously through the current \noccupant of the White House. He visits his son\u0014\n                      there periodically and talks to him regularly \nby phone. But he doesn't give direct advice,\u0014\n                      just checks in. He travels, raises money for \ncancer research, but almost never makes\u0014\n                      news. \"I don't need to complicate the life of \nthe president,\" he says. -K.T.W.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The phone rang around midnight at a reporter's \nhome. It was Bill Clinton, responding\u0014\n                      to a U.S. News request for an interview. (He \nwas calling from the West Coast, where\u0014\n                      it was only 9 p.m., but who's complaining?) He \nwas as chatty as ever, rattling off a list\u0014\n                      of projects he's working on. They include \nwriting his memoirs, helping with earthquake\u0014\n                      relief in India, setting up his presidential \nlibrary, and raising money to help the families\u0014\n                      of those killed September 11. Clinton, 55, \nbelieves former presidents have much to\u0014\n                      contribute: \"There's no question [they] can be \nof some help to the country and, if they\u0014\n                      choose, to the world. . . . But it's a delicate \nthing. You have to find a way to bring your\u0014\n                      knowledge and experience to bear that is \nappropriate . . . and doesn't, you know,\u0014\n                      unduly complicate the work of your successor.\" \n-K.T.W.\u0014",

But the dream soon became a nightmare.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The day after he signed his contract with Notre \nDame, O'Leary's\u0014\n                      rsum was sent to the pressa rsum that \nincluded\u0014\n                      \"inaccuracies\" about his education and college \nfootball letters. A few\u0014\n                      days later, O'Leary resigned in disgrace, the \nvictim of his own\u0014\n                      long-ago lies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's the latest example of what's become an \nepidemic of lying.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In recent years, politicians and pundits, \nprofessors and even Pulitzer\u0014\n                      Prizewinners have been caught dealing in \ndeceit. One of the nation's\u0014\n                      most respected historians, Stephen Ambrose, \nplagiarized portions of\u0014\n                      other historians' works andnotwithstanding his \npublic\u0014\n                      apologyseemed hardly disturbed by the \nresulting controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Historian Joseph Ellis, who won the Pulitzer \nPrize for his book,\u0014\n                      Founding Brothers, was caught inventing a \nVietnam War record for\u0014\n                      himself. So was Tim Johnson, manager of the \nToronto Blue Jays.\u0014\n                      Ex-conservative writer David Brock admitted \nhe'd made up sordid\u0014\n                      details about Anita Hill. Gloria Steinem's \nclaim about the number of\u0014\n                      women who die of eating disorderssupposedly \n150,000 a\u0014\n                      yearturned out to be a huge feminist hoax. \nJames Patterson and\u0014\n                      Peter Kim, authors of The Day America Told the \nTruth, estimate that\u0014\n                      91 percent of us regularly embroider the truth. \n\"We lie and don't even\u0014\n                      think about it,\" Patterson and Kim write.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Why has lying become so much more prevalent? \nSome scholars\u0014\n                      believe the problem arose out of the gradual \nadoption of a utilitarian\u0014\n                      ethicone that began eroding the traditional \nChristian ethic in the\u0014\n                      West in the middle to late 19th century. This \nethic says the (good)\u0014\n                      end justifies the meansthat if a lie helps \nmore than harms, then we\u0014\n                      should feel free to employ one.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the late 20th century, the rise of \npostmodern deconstructionism on\u0014\n                      college campuses exacerbated this problem. \nPostmodernists teach\u0014\n                      that the truth is not merely irrelevant; they \nbelieve it simply doesn't\u0014\n                      exist.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Lynne Cheney observes in her book, Telling \nthe Truth, academics\u0014\n                      \"leaped beyond the commonsense observation that \npeople's\u0014\n                      descriptions of reality differ to the \nconclusion that there is no\u0014\n                      independent reality and thus no basis for \nmaking judgments about\u0014\n                      truthor falsity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For these academics, truth claims are \"the \nconstructs of dominant\u0014\n                      groupsthe creations of the powerful,\" Cheney \nwrites. \"Might makes\u0014\n                      right, in other words; and so intimidation was \na perfectly natural way\u0014\n                      to try to gain assent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The assault on truth has spread beyond academia \nto infect the arts,\u0014\n                      law, journalism, and psychotherapyand Cheney \npoints out the grim\u0014\n                      results. For instance, when it turned out that \nNew York teenager\u0014\n                      Tawana Brawley had lied about being sexually \nassaulted by white\u0014\n                      men, The Nation claimed that \"it doesn't matter \nwhether the crime\u0014\n                      occurred or not\" because it symbolizes \"what \nactually happens to too\u0014\n                      many black women.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those who maintain that truth exists, and that \ntelling falsehoods is\u0014\n                      wrong, are increasingly under assault. \"Fact \nfetishists\" is how New\u0014\n                      York University professor Thomas Bender \ncharacterizes people who\u0014\n                      insist on accuracy.

    "title": "POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER",
    "words": "POST TRAUMATIC \nSTRESS DISORDER\u0014\n\u0014\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric diagnosis for \npeople who have endured a highly stressful and frightening experience \nand who are experiencing distress caused by memories of that \nexperience. It is as if a person is \"possessed\" by memories of an \nexperience and just cannot let go. Because anxiety is the major sign \nof PTSD, it is classified as an anxiety disorder. Other anxiety \ndisorders are phobias, panic disorders, and generalized anxiety .\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news is that it is highly treatable when diagnosed early. \nThe bad news is that it is often missed by examining physicians and \nmental health professionals, or it is misdiagnosed as some other \ncondition that is more neurobiochemical in nature. But there is no \ndrug cure for PTSD.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat causes PTSD?\u0014\n\u0014\nCatastrophe/traumatic events are the cause of PTSD. These events are \nsudden, overwhelming, and often dangerous, either to one's self or \nsignificant others(s), such as a car wreck, natural disaster, \ndangerous accident, war combat, robbery at gunpoint, or a near \ndrowning; the person affected felt intense fear, helplessness, or \nhorror either at the time or immediately afterwards. Close friends, \nfamily members, and professionals helping those who survive such \ncatastrophes can also be affected by trauma. These helpers, because \nof their empathy and compassion for the person in harm's way, can be \ntraumatized in the course of providing help.\u0014\n\u0014\nA catastrophe or traumatic event is a source or cause of stress that \nmost people experience. The stress experienced during or immediately \nafter the traumatic event or catastrophe is traumatic stress. \nSimilarly, the stress that is associated with the traumatic \nevent/catastrophe and that is experienced well afterwards is post- \ntraumatic stress. It is defined as a set of conscious and unconscious \nbehaviors and emotions associated with dealing with the memories of \nthe stressors of the catastrophe.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you tell if it's PTSD?\u0014\n\u0014\nMost people who have been exposed to a catastrophe experience both \ntraumatic and post-traumatic stress reactions. Most are able to \nsurvive and cope well; only a small percentage of people develop PTSD.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities recognize four features that all those with PTSD tend to \nexhibit at some time during their illness: the person (a) has been \nexposed to a traumatic event; (b) re-experiences the most traumatic \naspects of the event; ( c ) makes efforts to cope with these symptoms \nby avoiding exposure to reminders; and ( d) is on edge, unable to \nrelax, and unable to think about the event without being obsessed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it possible that there can be a delayed reaction to the traumatic \nevent?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes. There are three types of PTSD: acute, delayed, and chronic. \nAcute PTSD is when the above symptoms last between one and 3 months \nafter the trauma. Chronic PTSD is when the symptoms last for at least \n3 months following the trauma. Delayed PTSD is when symptoms do not \nshow up for at least 6 months after the trauma. This is often found \nwith adult survivors of childhood traumas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are other effects of trauma?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen PTSD is detected, other symptoms and characteristics are found \ntoo. This is why PTSD is so often misdiagnosed. Among the major sets \nof symptoms are phobia and general anxiety (especially among former \npaws and hostages and natural disaster survivors), substance abuse, \ndepression, psychosomatic complaints, an altered sense of time \n(especially among children), grief reactions and obsessions with \ndeath (especially among those who survived a trauma in which someone \ncould have died), feeling guilty , and increased interpersonal \nconflicts. For some who have PTSD, these other features go away once \nthe PTSD symptoms are eliminated through treatment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of help is there for PTSD?  \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth drugs and psychotherapy can be helpful. The most effective \ntreatment approaches are called \"cognitive- behavioral\" because they \nfocus both on the way traumatized persons view the trauma and on \ntheir resulting behavior. Exposure therapy includes systematic \ndesensitization (training to relax in the face of frightening \nreminders of the trauma) and imaginable, in-vivo techniques such as \nflooding or the process of putting the client back into the trauma \npsychologically. The most effective treatment for PTSD includes a \nvariety of anxiety management training strategies. Some of these \ninclude Rational Emotive Therapy, various kinds of relaxation \ntraining, stress innoculation training, cognitive restructuring, \nbreathing retraining, biofeedback, social skills training, and \ndistraction techniques. Innovative therapists are successful in \ncombining various techniques to fit the trauma and the patient's \nunique requirements. \u0014\n\u0014\nFamilies are the best setting to help those who suffer from this \nstress disorder. Families know when a member is acting differently \nthan before the traumatic event. A therapist may work with you or \nyour family member with PTSD to remember the trauma and reprocess the \ninformation and mourn losses. This also means that you will learn \nself-soothing techniques and ways to limit the distress during and \nbetween sessions. Your therapist will help you disconnect from the \ntrauma so that reminders do not arouse distress. In doing so, the \ntherapist will help you reconnect to life now and in the future \nwithout being haunted by the trauma. Sometimes this transition to \nlife without the trauma is harder than expected.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reconnecting is especially important: once you are desensitized \nfrom the burdens caused by the traumatic event, family therapy \nenables you to turn your attention to the future. You will attempt to \nlearn from the traumatic events and make needed changes in your \npersonal life and relationships, especially love relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat types of drugs might be used in treatment?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor some clients, drug treatment is a useful supplement to effective \npsychotherapy approaches. Drugs such as imipramine, amitriptyline, \nphenelzine, fluoxetine, and propranolol may provide temporary symptom \nrelief for general anxiety , depression, insomnia, and related \nproblems.\u0014\nSo there is hope for me and my family?\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily therapy offers an extraordinary and useful resource for \nhelping families survive a major traumatic event. Social scientists \nhave documented the remarkable and consistent patterns of emotional \nrecovery from a wide variety of traumatizing events. There is a large \nnumber of treatment approaches available today. It is impossible to \nprevent traumatic events but family therapy can help promote recovery \nmore quickly, and enable family members to get back to what they do \nbest: love each other .\u0014\n\u0014\n---The text for this brochure was written by Charles R.

What\u0014\nhappens to the victims? Everything you always wanted to know about \none of\u0014\nsociety's worst taboos [EM] but were too angry to ask \u0014\n\u0014\nBY JOHN CLOUD \u0014\n\u0014\nPe-do-phil-ia\u0014\nn. recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or \nbehaviors\u0014\ninvolving sexual activity with a prepubescent child \u0014\n--American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's easier not to ask too many questions about pedophilia. The \nquestions make\u0014\nyou blush; some of the answers make your skin crawl. But it seems \nthat almost\u0014\ndaily we see another grown man tell his story and weep, suddenly \nbecoming\u0014\nthe terrified kid he once was. All the revelations, all spilling out \nat once, have\u0014\ncreated a fog: Why are there so many people who want to molest \nchildren?\u0014\nHow can we stop them? Are we overreacting?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe flood of reports could almost make you think that everyone who \nsexually\u0014\nabuses a child is a Roman Catholic priest. In fact, the perpetrators \nare a\u0014\ndisturbingly diverse lot. There's the Chicago-area nurse who molested \nup to 18\u0014\npatients, including a 9-year-old girl who had suffered a brain \naneurysm and\u0014\nlater died. There's the 33-year-old Nevada day-care worker who \ncommitted\u0014\nhundreds of sexual acts on at least nine children, mostly ages 2 and \n3--and\u0014\nvideotaped them. Some of the most heartbreaking allegations involve \nthe\u0014\nAmerican Boychoir School, a top choral program in Princeton, N.J. \nMore than a\u0014\ndozen alumni from the 1960s to the '80s now say they were sexually \nabused by\u0014\nat least 11 former staff members. Says John Hardwicke Jr., 44, who \nclaims he\u0014\nwas raped repeatedly at the boarding school: \"What we all seemed to \nshare\u0014\nwas this sense of darkness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is possible to cast light on this difficult subject. Though \nresearchers have\u0014\nmany unanswered questions about child sexual abusers, a serious, if \nsmall,\u0014\nacademic field is devoted to understanding and preventing their \nbehavior--and\u0014\nto comprehending its effects on their victims. Such work can require \ncold-eyed\u0014\nquestions that poke around the edges of our darkest taboos. At the \noutset, it's\u0014\nimportant to note that news accounts often conflate two phenomena: \npedophilia\u0014\nand child sexual abuse. According to Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins\u0014\nUniversity professor who founded the National Institute for the Study,\u0014\nPrevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma in Baltimore, Md., \npedophilia is a\u0014\ndistinct sexual orientation marked by persistent, sometimes \nexclusive, attraction\u0014\nto prepubescent children. Dr. John Bradford, a University of Ottawa \npsychiatrist\u0014\nwho has spent 23 years studying pedophilia--which is listed as an \nillness in the\u0014\nmanual psychiatrists use to make diagnoses--estimates its prevalence \nat\u0014\nmaybe 4% of the population. (Those attracted to teenagers are \nsometimes said\u0014\nto suffer \"ephebophilia,\" but perhaps because so many youth-obsessed\u0014\nAmericans would qualify, psychiatrists don't classify ephebophilia as \nan illness.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA psychiatric diagnosis of pedophilia merely indicates one's desires; \nnot all\u0014\npedophiles act on their urges and actually commit child sexual abuse. \nPlenty of\u0014\nsexual abuse of kids is committed by ordinary people not generally \nattracted to\u0014\nchildren. That's one reason the incidence of child sexual abuse is so\u0014\nmaddeningly high. A Department of Health and Human Services study\u0014\nestimates that victimizers sexually abused 93,000 U.S. children in \n1999 (the\u0014\nlatest year for which data are available). But there is some good \nnews. Last\u0014\nyear the Department of Justice reported that the number of \nsubstantiated\u0014\ncases of child sexual abuse has been decreasing, from a peak of nearly\u0014\n150,000 in 1992 to about 104,000 in 1998--a drop of almost one-third. \nThe\u0014\nauthors say vigorous incarceration of offenders over the past few \nyears may be\u0014\npartly responsible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if we have punished our way out of the problem somewhat, we still \ndon't\u0014\nhave a long-term solution. Many people assume that not only priests \nbut also\u0014\nteachers, Boy Scout leaders and other adults who work with kids are\u0014\nresponsible for most child sexual abuse, but that's a misconception. \nHalf of\u0014\nchild sexual abusers are the parents of the victims; other relatives \ncommit 18%\u0014\nof the offenses. And the sad truth is that preventing incest is \nnearly impossible.\u0014\nLess than one-third of perpetrators know their victims from outside \nthe home.\u0014\nBut non-family abusers may be easier to pick out--many are adults who \nshower\u0014\nuncommon attention on children--and thus easier to stop.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough news reports focus on horrific serial offenders, experts say \nit's\u0014\npossible, with treatment, to prevent pedophiles from abusing kids. \nStates have\u0014\nincarcerated many child sexual abusers, but most eventually get out \n(average\u0014\nsentence: 11 years). Active pedophiles who find their way into the few\u0014\ntreatment programs around the country turn out to be less of a risk \nthan those\u0014\nwho are locked up for a while and released.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin runs one of the largest such programs in the nation. Since 1991\u0014\nhundreds of pedophiles have gone to the creaky Victorian building \nthat houses\u0014\nhis clinic. Berlin sees their condition as similar to \nalcoholism--incurable but\u0014\ntreatable--and some of his methods sound similar to those of \nAlcoholics\u0014\nAnonymous. The pedophiles must admit their urges and confront them in \ngroup\u0014\ntherapy. Counselors help them restructure their lives so that they \ndon't come\u0014\ninto contact with children. Berlin prescribes medication to reduce \nsex drives for\u0014\nthe 30% of his patients who don't respond to nondrug therapy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing new or scientifically subtle about these drugs: they \nsquash\u0014\ntestosterone levels and therefore suppress sexual hunger. (High, \nlong-term\u0014\ndoses of the drugs are known as \"chemical castration,\" a misnomer \nbecause\u0014\nsex drive returns if the injections stop.) But together, drugs and \ncounseling can\u0014\nbe effective. Contrary to popular perception, a raft of studies has \nshown that\u0014\nonce in treatment, few pedophiles relapse. In 1991 the American \nJournal of\u0014\nForensic Psychiatry published a study of 400 of Berlin's patients; \nonly 1.2% of\u0014\nthose who had complied with his 2 1/2-year treatment were known to \nhave\u0014\nmolested kids again three years after finishing the course. \nSurprisingly, only\u0014\n5.6% of those who were discharged for noncompliance offended in that \nperiod.\u0014\nSimilarly, a 2002 study by St. Luke Institute, a psychiatric hospital \noutside\u0014\nWashington, followed 121 priests for one to five years and found that \nafter\u0014\ntreatment only three had relapsed, according to the Rev. Stephen \nRossetti,\u0014\nwho runs St. Luke. \"People don't grow up and say, 'I want to be a \npedophile,'\"\u0014\nsays Rossetti. \"All the people I've ever talked to hate it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOther studies that look back over longer periods--five to 10 \nyears--find higher\u0014\npercentages of pedophiles who strike again, as high as 58% for those \nwho\u0014\nrefuse treatment. Such disparities highlight how uncertain the study \nof\u0014\npedophilia is, but even the higher figure belies the popular notion \nthat if a\u0014\npedophile is allowed to go free, he will almost always molest again. \n\"It's very\u0014\neasy to say, 'Throw away the key,'\" says Berlin. \"But many of these \npeople are\u0014\ntortured by these temptations, and they are relieved that we can do \nsomething\u0014\nfor them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFew pedophiles get this help, as Berlin is one of only a dozen or so \ndoctors\u0014\nwho run such clinics in North America. \"We don't have Betty Ford \ncenters for\u0014\npeople with sexual disorders,\" he says. Instead, a 1996 federal law \nrequires sex\u0014\noffenders to register with state authorities. When an offender is \nreleased from\u0014\nprison, the state can (and often does) notify neighbors. It's unclear \nwhether the\u0014\nlegislation is preventing abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOne difficulty in treating pedophiles is that we know little about \ntheir condition.\u0014\nCould people become pedophiles because they were sexually victimized \nas\u0014\nkids? That theory makes common sense, but only one-third of \npedophiles say\u0014\nthey were abused. Could pedophilia be a brain disease? Bradford of the\u0014\nUniversity of Ottawa says studies of pedophiles' brains have shown \ndifferences\u0014\nin the way they react to changes in hormone levels, but he says the \nresearch is\u0014\nin its earliest stages. Other scientists have posited several risk \nfactors that can\u0014\nlead to pedophilia, including chromosomal abnormalities, psychological\u0014\nproblems during puberty and even being brothers: The Journal of \nPsychology\u0014\nin 2000 reported that \"a gap of several years between brothers might \ndeprive\u0014\nthe pedophile of companionship in formative years of sexual behavior\u0014\ndevelopment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut such ideas are still guesswork. \"If we really want to understand \nthese\u0014\npeople and develop good ways to prevent pedophilia, we need a national\u0014\ndemographic survey,\" says Berlin. \"The funding is minuscule, so the \nresearch\u0014\nis incomplete.\" And politically fraught. Everyone who works in the \nfield\u0014\nconstantly negotiates America's discomfort with children and sex. Yet\u0014\nunderstanding child sexual abuse means not only exploring its \nprevalence,\u0014\ncauses and treatments--issues that focus on the abuser--but finding \nthe best\u0014\nway to help victims cope as well. And that research is positively \nradioactive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the most basic question of such inquiry: What constitutes a \nvictim of\u0014\nchild sexual abuse? By definition, pedophiles prey on the \nprepubescent. No\u0014\none would seriously argue that a 6- or even 10-year-old can \nmeaningfully\u0014\nconsent to sex. But what about those 12 and older, who make up nearly \nhalf of\u0014\nall juvenile sex-abuse victims? The states define the age of consent \nfor sex\u0014\ndifferently. Most say it is 16, but some say 18. In Hawaii, it's 14. \nSo are\u0014\nteenagers from the onset of puberty (usually about 13) to the age of \nsexual\u0014\nmajority (usually 16) always victims when they have sex with someone \nolder?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLegally speaking, as the differences in legal adulthood indicate, the \nyounger\u0014\npartners are not always treated as victims. Even in states where the \nage of\u0014\nconsent is 18, prosecutors rarely go after, say, a 23-year-old for \nsleeping with\u0014\na 17-year-old. Given that up to half of teens say they have had sex \nwhile a\u0014\nminor, \"millions of statutory-rape cases occur every day,\" says \nMichelle\u0014\nOberman, a DePaul University rape-law specialist. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDifferent cultures have different views on whether adult-adolescent \nsex is\u0014\nalways wrong. In the Netherlands, the law allows children ages 12 to \n16 to make\u0014\ntheir own decision about sex, though if Mom and Dad feel a \nrelationship is\u0014\nexploitative, they can ask the authorities to investigate. Most \nAmericans would\u0014\nfind such a law abhorrent. Recently, the University of Minnesota \ninitiated an\u0014\nunusual review of its university press after it published a book that \ncalls the\u0014\nDutch law \"a good model.\" Judith Levine's Harmful to Minors: The \nPerils of\u0014\nProtecting Children from Sex, scheduled to arrive in bookstores this \nmonth,\u0014\nasserts that \"teens often seek out sex with older people ... For some \nteens, a\u0014\nromance with an older person can feel more like salvation than \nvictimization.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSome have attacked Levine's book as trivializing the pain that \nsexual-abuse\u0014\nvictims can feel. The idea that a 12-year-old could consent to sex is \n\"just\u0014\ndangerous in every way,\" child psychologist Joy Silberg said last \nweek on Good\u0014\nMorning America. Silberg pointed out that many children who have sex \nwith an\u0014\nadult are \"severely sexually traumatized.\" Some kids tried to bury \ntheir trauma,\u0014\nand as we have seen recently with priests' victims, the agony from \nsexual\u0014\nabuse can emerge much later.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLevine wrote her book to promote teens' sexual health--not abuse--but \nshe\u0014\ncould have predicted the storm that is greeting her. In July 1998, \nPsychological\u0014\nBulletin, a journal of the American Psychological Association, \npublished a\u0014\ndense, jargony paper by three academics led by Bruce Rind of Temple\u0014\nUniversity. The Rind paper examined 59 studies of 35,000 college \nstudents\u0014\nwho had been sexually abused as minors. The 59 studies had looked at \nhow\u0014\nthe victims were faring in terms of anxiety, depression and 16 other\u0014\nmental-health measures. The authors drew an important distinction \nbetween a\u0014\n15-year-old who has sex willingly and a 5-year-old whose father rapes \nher. But\u0014\nthe authors concluded that for most victims the effects of the abuse \n\"were\u0014\nneither pervasive nor typically intense\" and that \"men reacted much \nless\u0014\nnegatively than women.\" In fact, 42% of the men who were asked (vs. \n16% of\u0014\nthe women) looked back on their sexual experience with an adult as \npositive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRadio host Laura Schlessinger discovered the Rind review and called \nit \"junk\u0014\nscience.\" House majority whip Tom DeLay of Texas expressed \"outrage \nand\u0014\ndisgust\" at the psychological association for printing \"a study that \nadvocates\u0014\nnormalizing pedophilia,\" and the House voted unanimously to condemn \nthe\u0014\npaper. Critics whispered that one of the review's co-authors, \npsychologist\u0014\nRobert Bauserman, had written for a Dutch publication that spoke \nadmiringly of\u0014\n\"man-boy\" relationships. Now an aids official with the state of \nMaryland,\u0014\nBauserman said in an e-mail that \"it would have been better to find a \ndifferent\u0014\noutlet\" for his writing than the Dutch journal. But he also pointed \nout that the\u0014\nRind study had withstood fierce academic scrutiny without being \nrefuted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin the field of child psychology, the Rind study was \ncontroversial but not\u0014\ndismissed. Other authors had reached similar conclusions. Critics \nfailed to note\u0014\nthat Rind and his colleagues stipulated that \"lack of harmfulness \ndoes not imply\u0014\nlack of wrongfulness\" and said their findings warranted no changes in \nU.S.\u0014\nlaws.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMost americans are savvy when it comes to making distinctions between \na kid\u0014\nbeing abused and one coming of age in a healthy way. Lots of viewers \nlaughed\u0014\nfive years ago when Friends explored the relationship between Phoebe's\u0014\nhigh-school-age brother and his teacher. (\"If that doesn't keep kids \nin school,\u0014\nwhat will?\" Chandler wondered.) On Six Feet Under last season, \nClaire, a\u0014\nsexually active character in high school, made out with an older \nphotographer,\u0014\nand viewers hardly seemed to notice the age difference. Americans buy \nplenty\u0014\nof garments from Calvin Klein and Abercrombie & Fitch, which showcase\u0014\nall-but-hairless flesh--often that of teen models--in their arty ads.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, Friends and Six Feet Under stay on the air because the \nteen-sex\u0014\nstory lines find the right side of a standard that makes sense to \nmost people: if\u0014\nan individual is harmed, then it's abuse. Last week the U.S. Supreme \nCourt\u0014\nadopted that standard in a 6-to-3 decision on child pornography. The \ncourt\u0014\nrejected a 1996 congressional ban on \"virtual\" child porn--pictures \nthat use\u0014\nyoung-looking adults or computer-generated images to simulate \nchildren.\u0014\n\"These images do not involve, let alone harm, any children in the \nproduction\u0014\nprocess,\" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the church scandal still roiling, it wasn't a propitious moment \nto strike a\u0014\nblow in favor of kiddie porn, and many lashed out at the court. But \nthose who\u0014\nhave studied pedophilia say society never seems quite ready to \nexplore the\u0014\ndelicate issues surrounding sex and kids. \"People want to see a \nmonster when\u0014\nthey say 'pedophile,'\" says Berlin. \"But the best public-safety \napproach on\u0014\npedophilia is to provide these people with treatment. That will \nprevent future\u0014\nvictimization.\" In other words, asking questions about pedophilia may \nmake us\u0014\nsquirm, but it may also be the first step toward ending it. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWith reporting by Amanda Bower, Sora Song and Deirdre van Dyk/New York\u0014",

    "title": "PEDOPHILIA ESSAY STIRS OUTRAGE",
    "words": "New York Times, 5/2/02\u0014\n\u0014\nKANSAS CITY, Mo., April 29  Prof. Harris Mirkin could not have \ndevised a better test for his controversial theory of sexual politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1999, Dr. Mirkin published an article in an obscure academic \njournal likening the \"moral panic\" surrounding pedophilia to the \noutrage of previous generations over feminism and homosexuality. Now, \nDr. Mirkin, the chairman of the political science department at the \nUniversity of Missouri's Kansas City campus, finds the panic swirling \naround him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the expanding sexual abuse scandal engulfs the Roman Catholic \nChurch, Dr. Mirkin has become an object of outrage. Last week, the \nMissouri Legislature voted to cut $100,000 from the university's \nbudget, saying taxpayers did not want to finance such perversity.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, in his office, Dr. Mirkin, 65, said through a sly smile: \"The \narticle is meant to be subversive; the article is meant to make \npeople think. Because they have tried to stifle discussion, there has \nbeen a discussion, which is one of the healthy things about the \nUnited States.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as he is denounced on talk radio, whispered about in his quiet \nneighborhood and attacked in multiple languages on the Internet, Dr. \nMirkin is being celebrated as a hero for academic freedom. \u0014\nThe chancellor here, Martha W. Gilliland, issued a strong statement \nsupporting \"the right to hold unpopular views,\" as did the president \nof the four-campus University of Missouri system. The faculty senate \npassed a resolution on his behalf, as did the American Association of \nUniversity Professors.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The appropriate place to debate the legitimacy of a professor's \nthought is in the marketplace of ideas,\" said Sheldon E. Steinbach, \ngeneral counsel of the American Council on Education, a Washington \ngroup that represents 1,800 colleges and universities. \"Today's \nheresy often becomes tomorrow's orthodoxy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the record, Dr. Mirkin, who has grandchildren 2 and 7, said he \nhad never had sexual contact with a child. Incest and rape, he said, \nare always wrong. He agreed that priests and teachers who touched \nchildren sexually were abusing their authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he questioned whether some people accusing priests these days \nwere making up stories in search of a payday, and he said he believed \nthat much of what was called molestation was really harmless touching.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said he resented that teachers were leery of hugging children for \nfear they might be accused of abuse. He imagines, he said, most \nadolescent males have fantasies similar to his, as a 12-year-old \ndelivery boy, of being seduced by a female customer, and he wondered \nwhether it would have been so bad had it come true.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the article, an 18-page essay with 38 footnotes published in the \nJournal of Homosexuality, Dr. Mirkin argued that the notion of the \ninnocent child was a social construct, that all intergenerational sex \nshould not be lumped into one ugly pile and that the panic over \npedophilia fit a pattern of public response to female sexuality and \nhomosexuality, both of which were once considered deviant.\u0014\n\"Though Americans consider intergenerational sex to be evil, it has \nbeen permissible or obligatory in many cultures and periods of \nhistory,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this month, the State House of Representatives voted 102 to \n29 to cut $100,000 from the Kansas City campus's $78 million \nappropriation. Last week, the State Senate did the same, 19 to 12. \nThe office of Gov. Bob Holden said he had not yet taken a position on \nthe cut.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The goal is that the taxpayers not subsidize this guy's attempt to \nlegitimize a despicable behavior and a dangerous behavior,\" said \nState Senator John Loudon, a Republican from the St. Louis suburbs. \n\"We all respect academic freedom. Legitimizing molestation doesn't \nfall under academic freedom.\"\u0014\nIn the legislative debate, Representative Don Lograsso, a Republican, \nsaid Dr. Mirkin should be reprimanded or fired. \"Sex between adults \nand children is not acceptable.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nChancellor Gilliland said she would find a way to absorb the cut  \npart of an $8 million reduction  in the university's $215 million \nannual budget without affecting Dr. Mirkin or the political science \ndepartment, but, she added, the Legislature's meddling in university \nbudgeting is a dangerous precedent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This particular issue is distasteful. I don't even like to think \nabout it,\" said Ms. Gilliland, an engineer, who added that she had \nread the article but would not discuss it. \"We got out of the Dark \nAges when we said we can challenge belief, we can investigate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Mirkin, who grew up on the West Side of Manhattan and earned his \nPh.D. at Princeton, has taught here since 1966.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't think it's something where we should just clamp our heads in \nhorror,\" he said of pedophilia. \"In 1900, everybody assumed that \nmasturbation had grave physical consequences; that didn't make it \ntrue.\" \"These things that you're sure of,\" he added, \"you really \nought to check out and test.\"\u0014",

It fascinated him that once-famous\u0014\n                      empires, like those in Persia, Greece, and \nRome, had risen and fallen, but the Chinese\u0014\n                      Empire remained-the world's greatest monument \nto ancient times. In the early months of\u0014\n                      1832, he knelt beside his 24-year-old wife, \nAmelia, in the parlor at the back of his busy\u0014\n                      chemist shop in Barnsley, Yorkshire, England. \n\"Dear God,\" he prayed, \"if you should give\u0014\n                      us a son, grant that he may work for you in \nChina.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When their child was born on May 21, 1832, \nJames and Amelia called him James Hudson\u0014\n                      Taylor-Hudson was his mother's maiden name. \nImmersed in a Methodist family fascinated\u0014\n                      with China, the young Hudson sometimes blurted \nout, \"When I am a man, I mean to be a\u0014\n                      missionary and go to China\"-though his parents \nwere not to tell him of their prayer for\u0014\n                      some years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet his faith and life calling were not always \nclear to him. By age 17, he was in the\u0014\n                      spiritual doldrums, experiencing, as one \nbiographer put it, \"teenage restlessness and\u0014\n                      rebellion\" against his impatient father. He \nbecame the anxious prayer concern of his\u0014\n                      sister and mother, among others, which led to a \nstory that has become a legend in\u0014\n                      missions circles. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      According to Taylor, in June 1849, when he was \n17, his mother locked herself in a room\u0014\n                      50 miles from home. She was visiting her sister \nat the time, and she had felt moved not\u0014\n                      only to pray that Taylor would become a \nChristian but to stay in the room until she was\u0014\n                      sure her prayers had been answered. That same \nafternoon, Taylor later recalled, he\u0014\n                      picked up a gospel tract about the finished \nwork of Christ and accepted \"this Savior and\u0014\n                      this salvation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such \"coincidences\" were to attend the rest of \nTaylor's life-a single-minded, even\u0014\n                      strong-headed life completely dedicated to one \nthing: bringing the gospel to the interior\u0014\n                      of China. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Chinese dressing\u0014\n                      Within a few months of this \"new birth,\" as he \ncalled it, Taylor's call to China was\u0014\n                      confirmed during a night of intense prayer when \nTaylor lay stretched \"before Him with\u0014\n                      unspeakable awe and unspeakable joy.\" He spent \nthe next few years in frantic\u0014\n                      preparation, medical and language studies, and \na deeper immersion into the Bible and\u0014\n                      prayer. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Finally, on Monday, September 19, 1853, the \nlittle three-masted clipper Dumfries,\u0014\n                      weighing less than 500 tons, slipped quietly \nout of Liverpool harbor with Taylor aboard\u0014\n                      headed for China. Just 21 years old, he said an \nemotional good-bye to his mother. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For Taylor life had become an adventure of \nfaith, of learning to trust God in impossible\u0014\n                      circumstances. The first leg of this journey \nonly reinforced the pattern. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Off the Welsh coast, the ship ran into a severe \nstorm that lasted for hours. The captain\u0014\n                      described the sea as the \"wildest he had ever \nseen.\" Taylor alternated between dread\u0014\n                      and trust in God's care. When the captain, a \ndevout Methodist himself, grew convinced\u0014\n                      that they weren't going to survive a half-hour \nlonger, he turned to Taylor and asked,\u0014\n                      \"What of your call to labor for the Lord in \nChina?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor said that he wouldn't wish to be in any \nother position and that he still expected to\u0014\n                      reach China. But if not, \"The Master would say \nit was well that I was found seeking to\u0014\n                      obey his command.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In fact they did survive the storm, and in \nMarch 1854, the ship arrived in Shanghai, one of\u0014\n                      the five \"treaty ports.\" The 1842 Treaty of \nNanking (Nanjing), ending the first Opium War\u0014\n                      between England and China, had opened these \ntrading links with the West, giving\u0014\n                      foreigners the right to live only in these \ncities. Taylor quickly settled in and began his\u0014\n                      work as an agent of the Chinese Evangelization \nSociety, a fledgling independent\u0014\n                      missionary organization started under the \ninspiration of pioneer missionary Karl Gtzlaff.\u0014\n                      A local teacher taught Taylor the Mandarin \ndialect, variations of which were used all over\u0014\n                      China. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That same year he made a radical decision for \nwhich he received both derision and\u0014\n                      praise: he decided to dress in Chinese clothes \nand grow a pigtail. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His decision was rooted in his deep respect for \nChinese culture and his view of the\u0014\n                      missionary's role. When incredulous fellow \nProtestant missionaries, who all wore western\u0014\n                      dress, criticized him for this unbecoming \nbehavior, he pointed out that those who knew\u0014\n                      the Chinese best came to appreciate their \ncustoms. Many Chinese objected to\u0014\n                      Christianity, he argued, because it seemed to \nbe a foreign religion that tended to mold\u0014\n                      converts in the ways of Western nations. \nTaylor, like the Roman Catholic missionaries\u0014\n                      who for decades had adopted Chinese dress, was \nahead of his time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      First steps inland \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The early years presented surprises to the \nyoung Taylor. Many Europeans lived in luxury\u0014\n                      in Shanghai, and Taylor thought some \nmissionaries were \"worldly.\" Yet they were in great\u0014\n                      demand with government officials as \ninterpreters. The general atmosphere of hearty\u0014\n                      sociability came as something of a shock to the \nchild of a strict Methodist. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Furthermore, money quickly became a sore point. \nWhereas Church Missionary Society\u0014\n                      single men received the equivalent of $700 a \nyear, not including rent, he was given a\u0014\n                      salary of only $80 a year, which was also \nsupposed to cover rent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Still, Taylor pressed on to get the gospel to \nthe Chinese in the interior who had never\u0014\n                      heard it. China was composed of 18 provinces, \nof which only seven had missionaries,\u0014\n                      and even then, they tended to work in only a \nfew coastal cities. Taylor carped about\u0014\n                      missionaries who confined themselves to the \nrelative comfort of urban life. He worried\u0014\n                      about the countless unreached souls of inland \nChina and immediately set about trying to\u0014\n                      reach them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In December 1854, within nine months of his \narrival, Taylor and Joseph Edkins hoisted\u0014\n                      sail, and with bags of Chinese Bibles and \ntracts over their shoulders, visited hamlets\u0014\n                      along the banks of the Huangpu River. At \nSongjiang, the extraordinary appearance of two\u0014\n                      foreigners drew crowds, who at one point made \nsport of the two men, mocking them and\u0014\n                      threateningly backing them down a street that \nended at the river. Taylor and Edkins\u0014\n                      barely escaped (hopping onto a passing boat) \nand continued their 200-mile, round-trip\u0014\n                      journey. Taylor soon made other trips to the \ninterior, eventually using the city of Ningpo\u0014\n                      (Ningbo), home to a number of mission \norganizations, as his base. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Chinese Evangelization Society proved to be \nwell-intentioned but increasingly\u0014\n                      incompetent; it failed to pay its missionaries \nin a timely manner and often sent\u0014\n                      missionaries unprepared for their work. After \nmuch prayer and wrestling, Taylor resigned\u0014\n                      from its service in 1857. He didn't know \nexactly how his work would be financed, though\u0014\n                      he decided he would not ask for donations-nor \neven let friends and relatives know of his\u0014\n                      needs. He would simply trust God to supply him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor also had for some time been seeking a \nwife. He had been rejected by two women\u0014\n                      in England, one before and one after he left \nfor China, leaving him deeply lonely. But in\u0014\n                      1857, he met and immediately fell in love with \n20-year-old Maria Dyer, the\u0014\n                      much-sought-after daughter of prestigious \n(though deceased) missionary parents.\u0014\n                      Despite snobbish and fierce opposition from \nsome in the Ningpo missionary\u0014\n                      establishment (Taylor's Chinese dress and lack \nof sophistication put them off), the young\u0014\n                      couple married in January 1858. It was an \nuncommonly happy marriage partly because\u0014\n                      they shared a deep passion to evangelize China \neven at great personal sacrifice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor continued to pour himself into his work, \nboth treating the sick and preaching, and\u0014\n                      by March 1860, Taylor's church on Bridge \nStreet, Ningpo, had grown to 21 members. But\u0014\n                      by the summer of 1861, he had contracted some \ndisease (probably hepatitis) that\u0014\n                      completely sapped his strength. After seven \nyears of ministry in China, he was forced to\u0014\n                      return to England for an extended period of \nrecovery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seeking the impossible \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though he was supposed to rest in England, he \ncontinued his furious work pace,\u0014\n                      translating the Bible, recruiting missionaries, \nand obtaining a qualification in midwifery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor was troubled in England by the lack of \ninterest in China. In 1865, as he paced the\u0014\n                      floor, he dictated to Maria China: Its \nSpiritual Need and Claims. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Can all the Christians of England,\" he wrote, \n\"sit still with folded arms while these\u0014\n                      multitudes [in China] are perishing-perishing \nfor lack of knowledge-for lack of that\u0014\n                      knowledge which England possesses so richly, \nwhich has made England what England is\u0014\n                      and made us what we are? What does the Master \nteach us? Is it not that if one sheep out\u0014\n                      of a hundred be lost, we are to leave the \nninety and nine and seek that one? But here\u0014\n                      the proportions are almost reversed, and we \nstay at home with the one sheep, and take\u0014\n                      no heed to the ninety and nine perishing ones!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor became convinced that a special \norganization was needed for the evangelization\u0014\n                      of inland China-to go beyond the five treaty \nports to which nearly all missionary work had\u0014\n                      been confined. He was determined not to cut the \nfinancial ground from under the feet of\u0014\n                      the older missionary societies, but what form \nshould such an organization take? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He began making plans for recruiting 24 \nmissionaries: two for each of eleven inland\u0014\n                      provinces of China that were without a \nmissionary, and two for Mongolia. It was a\u0014\n                      visionary plan that would have left experienced \nmissionaries breathless: at the time, a\u0014\n                      host of seasoned missionary organizations had, \nall told, only some 90 Protestant\u0014\n                      missionaries in China. Taylor single-handedly \nwanted to increase that by over 25\u0014\n                      percent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This would be an enormous financial commitment, \nso Taylor opened a bank account\u0014\n                      under the name of the China Inland Mission \n(CIM). Soon he had money and five\u0014\n                      missionary volunteers to send to China-even \nbefore he had formally committed himself to\u0014\n                      head a new missions society. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      He hesitated to take that step because he found \nhimself wracked with doubt. For months\u0014\n                      in 1865, a myriad of concerns raced through his \nmind; he rarely slept for two hours at a\u0014\n                      time, sometimes not at all. On the one hand, he \nagonized over the millions of Chinese\u0014\n                      who were dying without the hope of the gospel; \non the other hand, he wrestled with what\u0014\n                      he called his \"unbelief\": he feared taking \nresponsibility for sending young men and\u0014\n                      women into the China interior, where they would \nbe subject to rejection, illness, and\u0014\n                      persecution-all of which he knew about first \nhand. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor thought he might be on the verge of a \nnervous breakdown: he wrote in his diary\u0014\n                      later, \"For two or three months, intense \nconflict. Thought I should lose my mind.\" A\u0014\n                      friend, seeing that Taylor desperately needed a \nbreak, invited him to Brighton on the\u0014\n                      south coast of England for the weekend of June \n24-26. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On Sunday morning, he slipped out after \nworship: \"Unable to bear the sight of a\u0014\n                      congregation of a thousand or more Christian \npeople rejoicing in their own security while\u0014\n                      millions were perishing for lack of knowledge,\" \nhe later recalled, \"I wandered out on the\u0014\n                      sands alone, in great spiritual agony.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some time during that walk, he found relief. \n\"There the Lord conquered my unbelief, and I\u0014\n                      surrendered myself to God for this service. I \ntold him that all responsibility as to the\u0014\n                      issues and consequences must rest with him; \nthat as his servant it was mine to obey and\u0014\n                      to follow him-his to direct, to care for, and \nto guide me and those who might labor with\u0014\n                      me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With that, he felt his halting steps had been \nconfirmed. Immediately he wrote in the\u0014\n                      margin of his Bible, \"Prayed for 24 willing, \nskillful laborers, Brighton, June 2\u0014\n                      Taylor was determined that the CIM would have \nsix distinctive features. First, its\u0014\n                      missionaries would be drawn from any \ndenomination-provided they could sign a simple\u0014\n                      doctrinal declaration. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, they would have no guaranteed salary \nbut trust in the Lord to supply their\u0014\n                      needs. Income would be shared. No debts would \nbe incurred. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Third, no appeals for funds would be made. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fourth, the work abroad would be directed not \nby home committees but by himself and\u0014\n                      eventually other leaders on the spot in China. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fifth, the organization would press to the \ninterior of China (\"where Christ had not been\u0014\n                      named\"). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sixth, the missionaries would wear Chinese \nclothes and worship in Chinese-styled\u0014\n                      buildings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Challenges to the vision \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Within a year, a two-year-old clipper, the \nLammermuir, sailed out of the East India dock in\u0014\n                      London bound for China. Aboard, with Hudson and \nMaria Taylor and their four children,\u0014\n                      were 16 young missionaries, six men and ten \nwomen, who looked forward to joining the\u0014\n                      four men and one woman already working under \nTaylor's direction as cim missionaries in\u0014\n                      China. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the inland towns of Hangchow (Hangzhou) and \nHsiaoshan (Xiao-shan), the CIM began\u0014\n                      its work, a combination of medical care and \nevangelistic preaching amidst the hustle and\u0014\n                      bustle of Chinese life. CIM missionary John \nMcCarthy, from Dublin, described the scene\u0014\n                      that greeted him when he arrived in Hangzhou in \n1867. It was the Chinese New Year\u0014\n                      holiday, and a crowd hovered outside the CIM \nclinic. Sedan chairs lined up dropping off\u0014\n                      patients and waiting to be hired for the return \njourney. Food and drink vendors had\u0014\n                      moved in and were doing a good trade. In the \nmidst of the seeming confusion, Taylor\u0014\n                      stood on a table preaching to the people. As \nMcCarthy and his family were shown into the\u0014\n                      CIM house, Taylor waved his hand and \nacknowledged them with a brief word of welcome\u0014\n                      and then carried on preaching. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor was seeing more than 200 patients daily. \nHis operations to remove cataracts\u0014\n                      seemed like miracles to the Chinese. One \nconvert, Mr. Tsiu, who had been converted\u0014\n                      under Taylor's preaching in Ningpo, also \npreached to those who waited for medical\u0014\n                      treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The visionary and indefatigable Taylor made \nenormous demands on himself, and as one\u0014\n                      would expect, equally high demands on CIM \nmissionaries, and some of them balked. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of his missionaries, Lewis Nicol, visited \nChurch Missionary Society (CMS)\u0014\n                      missionaries and grumbled about things he \nthought were wrong at New Lane (CIM\u0014\n                      headquarters). He soon abandoned his Chinese \ndress, claiming that English clothes\u0014\n                      gave him more protection and respect. \"I will \nnot be bound neck and heel to any man,\" he\u0014\n                      told Taylor. After nearly two years of \nunpleasantness, Taylor dismissed Nicol from the\u0014\n                      mission, mainly for spreading lies about the \nCIM. Three CIM missionaries resigned in\u0014\n                      sympathy with Nicol. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Around the same time, two cms missionaries \ncomplained that it was dangerous for so\u0014\n                      many unmarried men and women to live together \nat New Lane and that Taylor was too\u0014\n                      familiar with the young ladies (he and Maria \nkissed some of them on the forehead before\u0014\n                      they went off to bed). The ladies themselves \ndenied any inappropriate behavior on\u0014\n                      Taylor's part, but still the complaint reached \nLondon and for a while led to a fall in support\u0014\n                      for the mission. For appearance' sake, Taylor \nended the kissing, but he refused to stop\u0014\n                      directly supervising single women. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Then Timothy Richard, an able young Welsh \nBaptist who arrived in China in 1870, began\u0014\n                      to win over some members of the CIM, \nparticularly those who lived in the Shansi (Shanxi)\u0014\n                      area. Richard emphasized establishing the \nKingdom of God on earth and protecting the\u0014\n                      poor and needy from tyranny. He also argued \nthat God worked through other religions\u0014\n                      such as Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism; if \ntheir similarities to Christianity could be\u0014\n                      pointed out, he believed, then followers could \nbe won over to Christ, and thus, the whole\u0014\n                      life of China would eventually undergo a \nthorough Christian transformation. A handful of\u0014\n                      CIM missionaries were influenced by Richard's \nmore liberal views, and they left the\u0014\n                      mission. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In spite of controversy, the number of CIM \nmissionaries grew. By 1876, 18 new\u0014\n                      missionaries set sail for China, bringing the \ntotal to 52, making CIM a fifth of the total\u0014\n                      missionary force in China. CIM missionaries \nmoved increasingly into the interior\u0014\n                      provinces: to Honan (Henan), Shensi (Shaanxi), \nKansu (Gansu), Hunan, Kweichow\u0014\n                      (Guizhou), and at least one brave soul reached \nTibet. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor made another bold move, for which other \nmission societies criticized him: he\u0014\n                      began sending unmarried women into the \ninterior, a testimony to the courage of these\u0014\n                      women. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor's boldness seemed to know no bounds. In \n1881 he had the temerity to ask for\u0014\n                      another 70 missionaries by the close of \n1884-and he got 76. Late in 1886, Taylor was\u0014\n                      praying for another hundred missionaries by \n1887. A veteran missionary told Taylor, \"I\u0014\n                      am delighted to hear that you are praying for \nlarge reinforcements. You will not get a\u0014\n                      hundred, of course, within the year, but you \nwill get many more than if you did not ask for\u0014\n                      them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Thank you for your interest,\" Taylor replied. \n\"We have the joy of knowing our prayers\u0014\n                      answered now. And I feel sure that, if spared, \nyou will share the joy of welcoming the last\u0014\n                      of the hundred to China!\" By early November \n1887, Taylor announced that 102\u0014\n                      candidates had been accepted for service and \nthat enough money had been given to\u0014\n                      pay for their passages to China! \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many of the early missionaries of the CIM had \nlittle formal education, but a number were\u0014\n                      university graduates. Some arrived idealistic \nand enthusiastic but mentally and spiritually\u0014\n                      unprepared for the rigor of interior mission \nwork. Some were arrogant and insensitive to\u0014\n                      Chinese culture. Some found that once on the \nscene, they didn't care for Taylor's\u0014\n                      leadership or CIM's high ideals. Some wilted \nunder the pressure of sustaining a living and\u0014\n                      assimilating a new culture while trying to \nspread the gospel. Indeed, the toll on human\u0014\n                      health was great, but the mission remained true \nto its purpose and eventually became the\u0014\n                      largest missionary organization in China, and \neven more important to Taylor, with a\u0014\n                      Christian presence in all 18 provinces of \nChina. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Setbacks and heartaches \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whether in China or back in England, Taylor \nfaced a relentless round of speaking\u0014\n                      engagements, personal visits, correspondence, \nand administrative tasks. Still he greeted\u0014\n                      each sunrise with prayer, and he often worked \nlate into the night, catching sleep day or\u0014\n                      night when his body demanded it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unforeseen events of local history often slowed \nthe work. Members of the mission,\u0014\n                      including Taylor's family, were injured in an \nanti-foreigner riot that attacked the CIM\u0014\n                      house in Yangchow (Yangzhou) in 1868. When the \nnews reached London, the House of\u0014\n                      Lords began debating whether allowing \nmissionaries into the China interior was good for\u0014\n                      British trade. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rivalry between the London and China councils \nof the CIM , which Taylor had established\u0014\n                      to run the mission, caused him enormous strain \nfor a time and led to the resignation of\u0014\n                      nearly 30 missionaries. The issue was this: \nTaylor wanted the China Council, as closest\u0014\n                      to the work, to have executive powers; the \nLondon Council disagreed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      William Sharp of the London Council thought \nTaylor was dictatorial and ought to have his\u0014\n                      powers severely clipped. He told Taylor, \"When \nit doesn't accord with your views, you try\u0014\n                      to force your council to fall in with your \nviews. I could wish you were led to let the mission\u0014\n                      get on by itself while you concentrated on \nexpounding the Scriptures and stirring up the\u0014\n                      churches.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Taylor could be demanding and seemingly \nautocratic, but in Taylor's mind, he was merely\u0014\n                      anxious to protect the integrity of his \nmission. Writing to London about new recruits, he\u0014\n                      said, \"I only desire the help of such persons \nas are fully prepared to work in the interior\u0014\n                      [of China], in the native costume, and living, \nas far as possible, in the native style. I do not\u0014\n                      contemplate assisting, in the future, any who \nmay cease to labor in this way. China is\u0014\n                      open to all, but my time and strength are too \nshort, and the work too great to allow of my\u0014\n                      attempting to work with any who do not agree \nwith me in the main on my plans of action.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As a man who had literally given all to Christ \nin China, he found it difficult to expect any\u0014\n                      less commitment from others: \"China is not to \nbe won for Christ by quiet, ease- loving\u0014\n                      men and women. The stamp of men and women we \nneed is such as will put Jesus,\u0014\n                      China, souls, first and foremost in everything \nand at every time-even life itself must be\u0014\n                      secondary.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In spite of his self-confessed periods of \nirritation and impatience, he could show\u0014\n                      forbearance and flexibility. It was only after \ntwo years of defiance that he reluctantly\u0014\n                      dismissed Lewis Nicol, and at times he even \nwaived some of the mission's rules (like the\u0014\n                      prohibition against single female missionaries \nmarrying) to respond to local\u0014\n                      circumstances. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his work \nwas that he managed to continue it in\u0014\n                      spite of constant poor health and regular bouts \nwith depression. On a speaking tour of\u0014\n                      the United States in 1900, Taylor nearly had a \ncomplete physical and mental breakdown.\u0014\n                      As his wife, Maria, had noted decades earlier, \n\"I am more intimately acquainted than\u0014\n                      anyone else can be with his trials, his \ntemptations, his conflicts, his failures and failings,\u0014\n                      and his conquests.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The personal cost was often high indeed: Maria \ndied at age 33, and four of Maria's eight\u0014\n                      children died before they reached the age of \n10. (Taylor eventually married Jennie\u0014\n                      Faulding, another CIM missionary.) Even more \ndevastating to the mission: while Taylor\u0014\n                      was convalescing in Switzerland in the summer \nof 1900, the Boxer Rebellion spread\u0014\n                      through China, murdering 58 CIM missionaries \nand 21 of their children. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The world catches on \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the late 1880s, Taylor's vision had begun to \nignite imaginations all across the world. In\u0014\n                      1888 Taylor visited Canada, and wherever he \npreached, young people offered\u0014\n                      themselves as missionaries to China. Taylor had \nbeen opposed to the idea of\u0014\n                      establishing a branch of the CIM in North \nAmerica but grew convinced that it was God's\u0014\n                      will. By the time his visit was finished, over \n40 men and women applied to join the CIM. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By the end of his life, the very mission \norganizations that had scoffed at his methods had\u0014\n                      begun adopting many of them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Just after Taylor died, a young Chinese \nevangelist looked upon his body and summed up\u0014\n                      Taylor's most important legacy: \"Dear and \nvenerable pastor, we too are your little\u0014\n                      children. You opened for us the road to heaven. \nWe do not want to bring you back, but\u0014\n                      we will follow you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Roger Steer is a free-lance writer living in \nDevon, England.

    "words": "Missionary granddaughter of \"Preacher\" \nHallock\u0014\n                                  won't sign SBC's affirmation of BF&M\u0014\n\u0014\n By Mark Wingfield\u0014\n Baptist Standard\u0014\n\u0014\n GARLAND, Texas -- Officially, Charlotte Greenhaw is a \"church and \nhome\" missionary, working\u0014\n alongside her husband, a former seminary professor who now is a \nchurch starter. By training\u0014\n and experience, she's a music educator. In reality, she's an \nevangelistic social worker among\u0014\n the poor and imprisoned of Recife, Brazil.\u0014\n\u0014\n Hundreds of inmates in northeastern Brazil have professed faith in \nJesus Christ through\u0014\n Greenhaw's ministry; some have gone to seminary upon release and are \npreparing to be\u0014\n pastors.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"You can go anywhere with music,\" the veteran Southern Baptist \nConvention missionary\u0014\n explained during a recent interview at her daughter's home in \nGarland, Texas, where\u0014\n Greenhaw was visiting a newborn grandson.\u0014\n\u0014\n While God has opened new doors for Greenhaw's witness in Brazil, she \nfears the politics of\u0014\n SBC life may attempt to shut those doors. The reason: She and her \nhusband, Houston, both\u0014\n have declined to sign an affirmation of the SBC's 2000 Baptist Faith \n& Message and an\u0014\n accompanying commitment to work \"in accordance with and not contrary \nto\" SBC faith\u0014\n statement.\u0014\n\u0014\n Music has opened a door for Greenhaw's ministry not only in Brazil's \nprisons, but also with the\u0014\n street children of Recife.\u0014\n\u0014\n After working her way through the \"Experiencing God\" discipleship \nbook, Greenhaw felt God's\u0014\n leadership to move beyond the traditional music education ministry \nshe had done for years at\u0014\n the Baptist seminary in Recife. She was drawn to the words of Jesus \nas recorded in Matthew\u0014\n 25: \"I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty \nand you gave me something\u0014\n to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes \nand you clothed me, I was sick\u0014\n and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Armed with a boldness that runs in her family--her parents were \nlegendary and innovative\u0014\n missionaries to Brazil, and her grandfather, \"Preacher\" Edgar \nHallock, was a legendary Baptist\u0014\n pastor in Oklahoma--Greenhaw hit the streets to round up a \nchildren's choir. In Recife,\u0014\n thousands of children live on the streets, and most are addicted to \nsniffing glue to ease the\u0014\n pain of their troubled young lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n She took an electronic keyboard, sat down on a curb near a church \nand started playing. Soon\u0014\n she had a crowd of children interested in what she was doing. She \nformed that crowd into a\u0014\n choir.\u0014\n\u0014\n Her one rule: The children must put down their glue.\u0014\n\u0014\n From that choir, other ministries to the street children developed \nin which they learned the\u0014\n gospel of Jesus Christ and received help for their physical needs. \nThe ministry continues with\u0014\n leadership from seminary students and others.\u0014\n\u0014\n Greenhaw still felt she had not accomplished all God intended for \nher to do, however. Matthew\u0014\n 25 still beckoned. So she went to prison, where she started an \ninmate choir.\u0014\n\u0014\n Again, the choir led to a Bible study, and the Bible study led to \nformation of a church within the\u0014\n prison walls. Eventually, prison officials granted her permission to \nbuild a chapel on the prison\u0014\n grounds. With help from First Baptist Church of Norman, Okla., and \nothers, a team of\u0014\n volunteers and the prisoners themselves built the chapel in five \ndays.\u0014\n\u0014\n The chapel also features a well-used outdoor baptistry as a visual \nwitness to other prisoners.\u0014\n More than 500 prisoners have professed faith in Jesus Christ in the \nlast three years.\u0014\n\u0014\n Greenhaw has expanded her ministry to serve the families of \nprisoners. She assists them when\u0014\n they visit the prison on Sundays, and she devotes one day a week \ntraveling around the region\u0014\n to visit prisoners' families in their homes. She has arranged for 45 \nprison weddings--including\u0014\n 22 at one time--having emphasized to the male prisoners the \nimportance of a marriage\u0014\n commitment.\u0014\n\u0014\n Now, she's developing plans to assist inmates once they're released \nfrom prison. Prisoners in\u0014\n Brazil often enter freedom destitute and with no direction for their \nlives.\u0014\n\u0014\n Meanwhile, she also teaches at the seminary and assists her husband \nin his work as a church\u0014\n starter among wealthy Brazilians. In a recent campaign which reached \nout to the whole city,\u0014\n more than 900 young professionals professed faith in Christ. The \nBaptist couple is reaching out\u0014\n to both ends of the socio-economic spectrum.\u0014\n\u0014\n Greenhaw knows she is an American, but she feels just as much \nBrazilian. She was born in Rio\u0014\n de Janeiro and had only been to the United States twice before she \narrived at the University of\u0014\n Oklahoma to attend college.\u0014\n\u0014\n Her parents, Edgar and Zelma Hallock, served as SBC missionaries to \nBrazil for 45 years. Her\u0014\n father also was a driving force behind the Baptist World Alliance, \ncoordinating world\u0014\n congresses in 1960, 1990 and1995.\u0014\n\u0014\n Her grandfather, known as \"Preacher\" Hallock, was pastor of First \nBaptist Church of Norman for\u0014\n 46 years and was widely known as a conference speaker.\u0014\n\u0014\n But now, that rich legacy, the evidence of her witness in Brazil and \nher own rigorous theological\u0014\n examination upon appointment by the SBC as a missionary in 1980 \nappear not to be enough to\u0014\n satisfy unnamed skeptics among Southern Baptists, she fears.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jerry Rankin, president of the SBC's International Mission Board, \nearlier this year mandated\u0014\n that IMB missionaries must sign an affirmation of the 2000 Baptist \nFaith & Message statement.\u0014\n That faith statement was drafted by an SBC committee but has been \nrejected by some SBC\u0014\n partners, including the Baptist General Convention of Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\n Critics charge the new faith statement was drafted--and is being \nused--as a creed rather than a\u0014\n statement of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n Rankin said he is requiring missionaries to sign the affirmation in \norder to silence unnamed\u0014\n people who are suspicious of the doctrinal integrity of the \nmissionary force.\u0014\n\u0014\n Greenhaw said she and her husband never thought the political and \ntheological controversy\u0014\n that has raged among Southern Baptists in the United States since \n1979 would reach\u0014\n missionaries who live and work outside the United States. But the \nday they received notice that\u0014\n they must sign an affirmation of the convention's new faith \nstatement, they knew the\u0014\n controversy had indeed touched them.\u0014\n\u0014\n For three days, Greenhaw stayed awake nearly all night, reading her \nBible, praying for\u0014\n guidance and agonizing over how to respond to the IMB mandate. \nFinally, she settled on Daniel\u0014\n 3, the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego thrown into \nNebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace\u0014\n because they would not bow down to his idol.\u0014\n\u0014\n At that moment, \"the Lord spoke very clearly to me not to sign,\" she \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n She also thought about her family's experience living in Oakington, \nEngland, before returning\u0014\n to Brazil. Near their home was a church graveyard where three men \nwere buried who had spent\u0014\n a total of 52 years in prison rather than pledge allegiance to the \nChurch of England under\u0014\n Henry VIII.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"We are not willing to sign off on somebody else's statement of \nbelief,\" Greenhaw said. \"I will\u0014\n not sign as a statement of my faith something I did not write. \nNeither will I promise to conduct my\u0014\n ministry according to a statement of belief which was prepared for a \nsituation foreign to the\u0014\n culture in which I live and work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n During her appointment process in 1980, Greenhaw said, she and her \nhusband both\u0014\n completed all the scrutiny required by the SBC's mission board. At \nthe prompting of key\u0014\n questions, they wrote out their own statement of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"My statement of beliefs still stands,\" she declared. \"My faith has \ngrown, and my relationship\u0014\n with the Lord has deepened. But my statement of beliefs still stands.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I will notify the IMB the day it changes, but it hasn't changed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Three of the six IMB missionaries serving in Recife have not signed \nthe affirmation of the 2000\u0014\n Baptist Faith & Message, Greenhaw reported.\u0014\n\u0014\n Missionaries in Brazil were given a deadline of March 31 to sign the \nnew faith statement.\u0014\n\u0014\n After that deadline passed, the Greenhaws were among 12 missionaries \ncalled to a meeting\u0014\n with their regional leader and former IMB Executive Vice President \nDon Kammerdiener. At that\u0014\n meeting, Greenhaw said, they were asked what it would hurt them to \nsign the affirmation, and\u0014\n then they were admonished to sign it. Then they were advised to \n\"pray about this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Greenhaw responded that she already had prayed about it, \nextensively, and still would not\u0014\n sign.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"If you have a problem with us as missionaries, come check us out,\" \nshe urged. \"Come see\u0014\n what we're doing. Help us meet the daily spiritual and cultural \nchallenges of ministry, instead of\u0014\n taking doctrinal potshots from a distance on matters foreign to our \nculture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Although missionaries at the Brazil meeting asked Kammerdiener and \nthe regional leader,\u0014\n \"Who are these people who have questioned our beliefs?\" they \nreceived no answer, Greenhaw\u0014\n said.\u0014\n\u0014\n Now, as she prepares to leave her new grandson behind in Texas and \nreturn to her ministries\u0014\n in Brazil, Greenhaw wonders what will happen next. The missionaries \nin Brazil who did not sign\u0014\n the affirmation have not been told what will happen to them. They \nhave been told only that IMB\u0014\n trustees will meet in May to discuss the matter.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I don't know what will happen,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"But the \nLord has told me my time is\u0014\n not up, and I'm not leaving Brazil. I am not sure at this point who \nwill support me, but I'm not\u0014\n willing to back off on what the Lord has called me to do.\"\u0014",

    "words": "May 15, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         Prosecutors Try to Recreate \nBirmingham's '63 Nightmare\u0014\n\u0014\n By RICK BRAGG\u0014\n\u0014\n      IRMINGHAM, Ala., May 14  Prosecutors led the jury today on a  \nnightmare journey of crumpled church walls, shattered stained glass \nand murdered children and tried to bind a  now-old white supremacist \nto that terror with a white  Klansman's robe and a 38-year-old clip \nof black-and-white film.\u0014\n\u0014\n Bobby Frank Cherry, the 71-year-old former Klansman who stands \naccused  here in an Alabama court of killing four girls with a \ndynamite bomb at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sunday, Sept. 15,\u0014\n 1963, bragged about that deed much of his life, said  Robert Posey, \none of the prosecutors.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"He has worn this crime like a badge of honor,\" said Mr. Posey, as  \nprosecutors went on to paint a hellish picture of the scene inside \nthe church, and the blizzard of glass, concrete and brick that\u0014\n killed Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley  and Addie \nMae Collins.\u0014\n\u0014\n Two of the mothers of the murdered children wept on the witness \nstand as  they described their daughters on what would become the \nsingle most infamous day of the civil rights movement. Alpha\u0014\n Robertson, Carole's mother, is 83 now and had to be  wheeled into \nthe courtroom in a wheelchair. She remembered the shoes her \n14-year-old daughter wore. \"Her first pair of real, black, heeled \npumps,\" Mrs. Robertson said.\u0014\n\u0014\n Maxine McNair, whose 11-year-old daughter, Denise, died while Addie \nMae, 14, was tying the sash of her dress, remembered hearing the \nblast beneath her, in the church basement. \"My baby, my\u0014\n baby,\" she thought.\u0014\n\u0014\n Lawyers for Mr. Cherry, who is expected to be the last man tried in \nthe  historic, flawed, four-decade investigation into the civil \nrights era crime, said they did not question the wrongness of the act \nor\u0014\n the racial attitudes of the era.\u0014\n\u0014\n But prosecutors are trying, through the defendant's past, to \nfalsely  insert Mr. Cherry's hands into \"blank fingerprints,\" said \nMickey Johnson, one of Mr. Cherry's defense lawyers.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"In 1963, in Birmingham, the people whose fingerprints would have \nfit  into those blanks numbered in the hundreds if not thousands,\" \nMr. Johnson said.\u0014\n\u0014\n There were countless people whose racist attitudes would have made \nthem suspects, defense lawyers said. Mr. Cherry, the last of the \nprimary suspects in the bombing, has not been linked to the crime  by \neven one piece of forensic evidence, Mr. Johnson  said.\u0014\n\u0014\n But prosecutors said they would tie him to that crime with other  \nevidence, and put a man on the stand today who said he heard  Mr. \nCherry mention 16th Street Baptist Church and a bomb less than a\u0014\n week before the blast.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe man, Bobby Birdwell, a commercial plumber who grew up near Mr. \nCherry's house in Ensley, just outside Birmingham, said he often \nplayed with Tommy Frank Cherry, Mr. Cherry's son. Mr.\u0014\n Birdwell testified that, in September 1963, he and  Tommy Frank \nCherry  Mr. Birdwell called him Frank  were playing in the \nneighborhood and decided to go into Bobby Frank Cherry's house to get \nsome water. It was, Mr. Birdwell said, just four or five days before \nthe bombing.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"We went through the living room,\" Mr. Birdwell recalled. \"There was \na  robe on the couch. White robe. Cutouts in the eyes, and \neverything,\" he said. It was a Klansman's robe, Mr. Birdwell said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I asked Frank whose it was. He said, `It's my daddy's,' \" Mr. \nBirdwell said.\u0014\n\u0014\n The boys walked on through the house to get their water, and found \nMr. Cherry and three other men sitting in the kitchen, talking. The \nmen were talking about integration.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I heard them mention a bomb, and 16th Street,\" Mr. Birdwell said. \n\"Well, me and Frank went out and played.\" He did not call the police. \nHe was just a boy, he said, and he was frightened of what\u0014\n might happen if he told on Mr. Cherry.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mr. Birdwell's own parents, like many people then, also opposed \nintegration, he said. \"I was scared,\" he said. \"There was a lot going \non back then, a lot of hatred.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n In 1997, he read an article in a Birmingham newspaper about Mr. \nCherry and the church bombing. \"I called the F.B.I.,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n In cross-examination, Mr. Johnson attacked Mr. Birdwell's \ncredibility. He asked Mr. Birdwell how often he drank, and Mr. \nBirdwell replied that he had an occasional \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein.\u0014\n\u0014\n He then asked Mr. Birdwell if an F.B.I. agent had asked in 1997 if \nhe had a drinking problem, and if the agent had accused him of giving \ntwo versions of the story.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mr. Birdwell said no, and Mr. Johnson  without explaining where he \nwas headed with that line of questioning  asked and received \npermission from the judge, James Garrett, to recall Mr. Birdwell \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\n It was the only testimony on the trial's opening day that linked, \neven circumstantially, Mr. Cherry with the actual bombing.\u0014\n\u0014\n But prosecutors went on to try to link Mr. Cherry to other acts of  \nracial violence, and used history to show the escalating tensions in \nthe city at that time.\u0014\n\u0014\n Trying to establish motive, they tried to place Mr. Cherry  through \nan old film  at the scene of a mob beating of a Birmingham civil \nrights hero as he tried, with his own children, to integrate a public \nschool.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jimmy Parker, a master technician and broadcast engineer, was a \ncollege student and cameraman in the late 1950's. A graduate of the \nschool, Phillips High, he had gone back to get some grade transcripts \nso that he could apply to college. It was September 1957, and as he \ncame out of the school, he testified, he saw a group of about 50 \nwhite people and \"four, five or six cops\" in a confrontation with the \nRev. Fred Shuttlesworth, his wife and two children. Mr. Shuttlesworth \nwas trying to enroll his children in\u0014\n that all-white school, and the mob attacked them.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"I noticed a ruckus going on,\" Mr. Parker said. \"I grabbed my \ncamera, and shot some film.\" His film shows a man who prosecutors \nbelieve is a young Bobby Frank Cherry in that mob, and shows\u0014\n him reaching into his pocket for something  \"a roll of quarters,\" \nMr. Parker guessed  and then swinging hard at Mr. Shuttlesworth.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"He swung, couldn't tell if he connected or not,\" Mr. Parker said. \nThe film showed the mob flailing at the smaller group of black \npeople, including the children, as the police  at least at first  \nmostly let it happen. Prosecutors then froze the film on a shot of \nthe man believed to be Mr. Cherry, a cigarette dangling from his lip.\u0014\n\u0014\n On cross-examination, Mr. Johnson asked what Mr. Parker did with the \nfilm he shot. \"I sold it,\" he said. \"This looks like evidence of a \ncrime,\" Mr. Johnson said. Why, he asked, did Mr. Parker not take the \nfilm to the police? Mr. Parker, straight-faced, told him there were \nseveral police watching it all happen. People in the courtroom \npolitely chuckled.\u0014\n\u0014\n Prosecutors seemed intent on showing how the events of the civil \nrights movement, and the mob violence and bombing that dogged it, led \nultimately to the creation of people like Mr. Cherry and\u0014\n the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mr. Birdwell said he heard Mr. Cherry say his \"kids will never go to \nschool\" with black children, using a racially offensive term.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mr. Birdwell's testimony drew a glance from Mr. Cherry, who had \nmostly seemed uninterested in the proceedings, even as the mothers of \ntwo of the slain girls gave their emotional testimony. Mr.\u0014\n Cherry, who suffers, his lawyers say, from dementia, seemed alert as \nhe moved around the courtroom, but sat stone-faced during the \ntestimony. He had dozed off during jury selection.\u0014\n\u0014\n The relatives of the bombing victims stared hard at him, with the \nexception of Mrs. Robertson, who refused to even look at him as she \nwas wheeled through the courtroom.\u0014\n\u0014\n Mr. Cherry, a truck driver who left Alabama for Texas in the 1970's, \nis expected to be the last man to stand trial in connection with the \nbombing. Robert Chambliss, an associate of his, was convicted\u0014\n in the bombing in 1977. He died in prison. Herman Frank Cash, \nanother suspect, died untried. Thomas E. Blanton Jr. was convicted \nlast year, in a crime that  almost 40 years\u0014\n\u0014\n The Rev. John Cross, the pastor then, testified as to the condition \nof the bodies he found in the rubble. He had known all four of the \ngirls. \"Damage had occurred that made them look altogether \ndifferent,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Copyright 2002 The New York Times Company |\u0014",

    "words": "Federal Appeals Court Says 'Under God' in Pledge of Allegiance Is \nUnconstitutional\u0014\nSchools can't ask children to swear loyalty to monotheism, says Ninth \nCircuit panel.\u0014\nBy Ted Olsen | posted 06/27/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nA federal appeals court yesterday ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance \nis unconstitutional and must not be recited in schools.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the context of the Pledge, the statement that the United States \nis a nation 'under God' is an endorsement of religion,\" a panel of \nthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision. \"To \nrecite the Pledge is not to describe the United States; instead, it \nis to swear allegiance to the values for which the flag stands: \nunity, indivisibility, liberty, justice, andsince 1954monotheism.A \nprofession that we are a nation 'under God' is identical, for \nEstablishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation \n'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a \nnation 'under no god,' because none of these professions can be \nneutral with respect to religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ban (which covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \nMontana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) elicited immediate responses \nfrom politicians and advocacy organizations.\u0014\n\"The President's reaction was that this ruling is ridiculous,\" White \nHouse spokesman Ari Fleischer said. \"The view of the White House is \nthat this was a wrong decision, and the Department of Justice is now \nevaluating how to seek redress.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Associated Press quotes President Bush this morning saying that \nthe decision is \"out of step\" with the country's history. \"America is \na nation ... that values our relationship with the Almighty,\" Bush \nsaid. \"We need commonsense judges who understand that our rights were \nderived from God.\"\u0014\nAtheist Michael A. Newdow first filed the suit in 1998 on behalf of \nhis then-four-year-old daughter, when the two lived in Broward \nCounty, Florida. Courts dismissed the trial there because his \ndaughter wasn't yet in school, so he moved to California and tried \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis complaint wasn't that his daughter would be forced to recite the \nPledgecourts have upheld the right not to say it since even before \n\"under God\" was added in 1954but that his daughter was injured \nsimply by being forced to watch and listen.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There are lots of cases like this that are filed that you never hear \nanything about because they die a quiet death, but this one didn't,\" \nsays Greg Baylor, director of the Christian Legal Society's Center \nfor Law and Religious Freedom. \"The other thing that made this fly \nunder the radar was that he was not represented by anybody, \nparticularly some group that has a PR machine that gets the word out \nabout it.\"\u0014\nNewdow, a physician with a law degree, represented himself in the \ncase.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough not parties to the case, both the American Civil Liberties \nUnion (which turned it down) and Americans United for the Separation \nof Church and State defended the court's decision. \"Schools can and \nshould teach tolerance and good citizenship, but must not favor one \nreligion over another or belief over nonbelief,\" said an ACLU press \nrelease.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious advocacy organizations also responded quickly to the \ndecision. \"We believe the 9th Circuit is clearly out of step with the \npeople of this country and the history of its founding,\" said Family \nResearch Council president Ken Connor in a press release. \"The ruling \nrepresents another attempt to secularize a country born out of \nreligious liberty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"While [the court] may be under the foolish notion that we have \nsurpassed the need to honor or acknowledge him, they must not be \nallowed to force their damnable arrogance on the rest of us,\" said \nConcerned Women for America president Sandy Rios.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Family Association president Tim Wildmon also criticized the \nruling. \"The 9th Circuit seems to be on a search and destroy mission \nto remove any and all vestiges of our religious heritage from the \npublic square,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 9th Circuit Court is often the target of criticism from religious \nconservativesit upheld a school's right to deny a valedictorian's \nreligious speech in 2000, for example, and recently considered \nwhether the parsonage tax exemption is unconstitutional. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1970, however, the court defended the inscription \"In God We \nTrust\" on currency. In yesterday's decision, the appeals court took \nnote of this decision, but argued the cases are too different: \n\"School children are not coerced into reciting or otherwise actively \nled to participating in an endorsement of the markings on the money \nin circulation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is the most reversed court in the \ncountry by the United States Supreme Court,\" notes Mat Staver, \npresident of Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit legal organization \nspecializing in religious-freedom cases. \"In one recent survey, the \nU.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit 80 to 90 percent of the \ntime in one term.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, Staver tells Christianity Today, this decision will be \noverturned by the Supreme Court if not by the full 9th Circuit Court \nof Appeals. In the meantime, he says, the decision will likely make \nthe pledge more popular than ever. \"I think it will galvanize \nAmericans and actually wake Americans up to the judicial activism \nthat's in the courts,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it may also make school administrators across the country wary \nabout any mention of God in the classroom, says John Whitehead, \npresident of The Rutherford Institute, which also specializes in \nreligious-liberty cases. However, he warns against caricaturing the \nruling. \"This was a decision carefully based on precedent. It's not a \nflim-flam decision, and it's not a flim-flam case.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitehead agrees that the Supreme Court will likely overturn the \ndecision if the full 9th Circuit doesn't do so first, but he predicts \nit would be a 5-4 decision. \"There's a lot of ambiguity right now \nabout the use of the word God,\" he says. \"Our country has been \nundergoing an identity crisis since the 1940s. This is not an \nillegitimate issue based on today's society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, says Whitehead, by striking \"Under God\" as unconstitutional, \nthe court has called into question even more important religious \nreferences. \"According to the Declaration of Independence,\" he says, \n\"the very right this father used to sue comes from God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith additional reporting by Todd Hertz.

    "title": "PEOPLE AS PROPERTY",
    "words": "People as Property\u0014\nFace to face with slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Lischer\u0014\n\u0014\nNot long ago an A.M.E. Christian activist and member of the American \nAnti-Slavery Group reported redeeming, or buying back, 6,000 persons \nheld in slavery in Sudan. The Boston group is part of a network of \norganizations, Christian and otherwise, dedicated to ending slavery \nin Africa and throughout the world. Anti-slavery is once again a \nChristian cause because slavery's main perpetrators, at least in \nSudan, are Arabs from the north who prey on and enslave Christians \nand traditional African religionists in the south. The resurgence of \nslavery appears to offer a clean line of demarcation between \npersecutors and the persecuted. But even in Sudan, where Christians \nare suffering mightily, the conflict has twisted historical roots and \ndoes not yield a simple answer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe practice of buying back slaves, or, as the Sudanese government \ncalls them, \"prisoners of war,\" has been severely criticized by un \nagencies and various religious groups, who charge that buying human \nbeings has only encouraged the further taking of slaves and fueled \nthe growing arms trade as well. A spokesman for Christian Freedom \nInternational calls the practice of buying slaves \"a debacle.\" \nWhatever the solution, no one, save for a few offending regimes, \ndenies the continued existence of worldwide slavery or slavery-like \npractices, which include the sale of children, child prostitution, \nthe female sex-trade, forced labor, and the arming of children. In \nMauritania, Amnesty International reports that 90,000 blacks are held \nas property in relations from which they may not withdraw. Worldwide, \n100 million children are exploited for their labor. More than an \nissue dividing two world religions, slavery is an abiding human \nscourge that has been perpetrated by and visited upon all the \nreligious people of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the strength of David Brion Davis's new book, In the Image of \nGod: Religion, Moral Values, and Our Heritage of Slavery, is not \nmerely the accuracy of its data but its witness to the terrible \ncontinuity between historic and contemporary practices of slavery. \nDavis, who is Sterling Professor of History at Yale, is best known \nfor his books The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, \n17701823, which won a National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize, \nand The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture, which won a Pulitzer \nPrize. The present book is a collection of review essays from the \npast 15 years, ranging from studies of Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin \nLuther King, Jr., to Andrew Hacker's Two Nations and the first \nwomen's movements in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut most of all, his book is about the history of worldwide slavery \nand the slave trade. Davis has amassed a wealth of information not \nonly on the details of the everyday lives of slaves but also on the \nvast, interlocking systems of finance, commerce, geopolitics, \nagriculture, religion, and philosophy in which North American slavery \noccupied a late but significant place. His book offers multiple \ntestimonies to the haunting power of history over contemporary \nevents. It helps us understand why we areall of usreaping the \nwhirlwind in race and religious conflict. Davis explores the history \nof slavery in all its competing and coexisting \nincarnationsChristian, Jewish, traditional African, and Muslimbut \nnever by simplifying the record or giving in to popular cultural \nstereotypes. In his book, the facts speak for themselves. When he \ndiscloses that the Muslim practice of African slavery predated that \nof the Christian West, he concludes, \"[S]uch knowledge can be gained \nonly by abandoning the search for historical villains, by seeking a \nmutual understanding of Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions, and \nby acknowledging the shared guilt and moral blindness that led to \ncenturies of immeasurable suffering for African peoples.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWorking like an opthalmologist, Davis painstakingly reads the world \nthrough the single brown eye of slavery. He raises the question of \nwhy the English abolished the slave trade in 1807 and the practice of \nslavery in the colonies in 1834. Was it due to the decline of the \nsugar industry in Jamaica and other economic conditions, or was it \nthe result of the moral persuasion of Christians like William \nWilberforce? Did abolitionist fervor inadvertently distract attention \nfrom hideous labor conditions in industrial Britain? Every reform \nmovement risks being caught in a bind between vacuous generalities \nand the selectivity that highlights certain evils while ignoring \nothers. Davis is no economic determinist. He recognizes the social \nforce of religious outrage and concludes that it played a significant \nrole not only in outlawing slavery but in sensitizing Britons to \ndomestic oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, he asks pointedly, which came firstslavery or racism? Did the \nwidespread belief in the animalistic inferiority of blacks lead to \nslavery, or did the economic \"necessity\" of buying and selling \nAfrican human beings produce racial stereotyping and the worldwide \nequation of slave=black (even though slave is derived from slav, the \n\"barbarians\" of Eastern Europe)? He shows that the bestialization of \nblacks long antedates the modern justification of slavery based on \nthe so-called Curse of Ham. Even in those societies in which the \n\"noble savage\" was romanticized, sentimentality ineluctably gave way \nto expropriation and murder. The difference between black and white \nhas forever been associated with the practice of slavery, which in \nturn helped construct and perpetuate the racial absolutes under which \nso many continue to suffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of slavery becomes even more complex when we factor in the \nJews. After generations of discrimination and quotas but not pogroms \nand concentration camps, American Jews have watched the anti-Semitic \nbarriers gradually come down. According to a 1974 study, more than \nhalf of America's intellectual lite was Jewish. By the 1980s Jews \nmade up one quarter of Ivy League faculties and an even higher \npercentage of elite law and medical school faculties.\u0014\n\u0014\nJews were among the first to recognize a kinship between their \nstruggles and those of blacks in America. Many acknowledged that \nthey, like virtually every immigrant group, won acceptance by \nclimbing over African Americans. Perhaps for these reasonscommon \nsuffering and guilt induced by successJewish editors, lawyers, \nrabbis, labor leaders, and philanthropists were among the most \ngenerous and courageous supporters of blacks in America. During the \nCivil Rights Movement of the '60s, Martin Luther King and his \norganization benefited from the counsel and support of many Jews, and \nKing explicitly modeled the black struggle on the Jewish struggle. \nLike the black protest movements that preceded him, King found his \ninspiration for black suffering as well as black freedom in the \nExodus and the Jewish experience in America. And today, advocates of \nreparations for blacks look to the precedent of reparations lately \ngranted to survivors of the Holocaust. Those who oppose any plan of \nnational restitution might well have their minds opened, if not \nchanged, by Davis's portrait of the systemic deprivations of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn our current cultural battlefield, where historic Jewish support \nfor blacks is routinely relegated to paternalism or self-interest, it \nis important to look at the evidence related to Jewish attitudes and \nbehavior toward blacks. In view of the contested relations between \nAfrican Americans and Jews and the resurgence of anti-Semitism in \nWestern countries such as France, the historical questions are \ngrowing in significance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that some Jews bought and sold slaves, but they were \nvastly outnumbered by the thousands of Muslims, Protestants, and \nCatholics who profited from such trade. Davis, who announces his own \nconversion to Judaism on the very first page of the book, argues that \nthe selective hunt for Jews in the slave trade is itself a form of \nanti-Semitism. And why, he asks, does the Jewishness of an \neighteenth-century slave trader carry greater political weight than \nthe Jewishness of Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, who were \nmurdered by the Ku Klux Klan while trying to register black voters in \nMississippi? While there is much to understand in the current black \ndissatisfaction with Jews, is it really conceivable that Jewish \nsupport has represented nothing more than the self-serving \nmanipulation of blacks? Would not Jews have achieved their ends even \nmore quickly by adopting \"the prevailing and insidious antiblack \nprejudices of white Anglo-Americans\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nDavis will not resort to comparative victimization; he will not \nattempt to quantify the suffering of Jews and African Americans. What \nhe will say, however, is that absolutely nothing can equal the \nhistoric and cultural scale on which black people the world over have \nbeen subjected to the vilest and most abject forms of domination.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of the most memorable passages of Dostoevsky's Crime and \nPunishment, Raskolnikov dreams of a drunken man who beats his horse \nto death. Without purpose or meaning, the man clubs the defenseless \nbeast while shouting to the approving crowd, \"My property!\" The \ncruelty of the scene does not first remind us of the horrors of any \nsocial or commercial system. It evokes a sin more original than \nslavery, one that cannot be isolated in a particular nation, \nreligion, or race. Before any group can point the finger at others, \nit must point at itself. Davis's research shows that all the players \nparticipated in something deeper and more terrible than the \nconditions historians are usually willing to talk about.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith its combination of uncompromising accuracy and heartfelt \ncompassion, Davis's book witnesses to the possibility of a saner and \nmore balanced method of addressing the problems of history. In one of \nhis essays he remarks that slavery foundered on \"the irreducible \nhumanness of the slave.\" Persons are not property. For just as all \nhave sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, so all are made in \nthe image of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Lischer teaches at Duke Divinity School. His most recent book \nis Open Secrets: A Memoir of Faith and Discovery (Doubleday/Broadway).\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today International\u0014",

    "words": "Putting Your Pain in \nPerspective\u0014\n\u0014\nBarry Howard\u0014\n08-02-02 \u0014\nHow do you handle your own pain and suffering? Whether you are \nexperiencing the physical pain of illness, the emotional distress of \ngrief, or the spiritual affliction of persecution, your suffering \nmust be put in perspective or you may become a nagging complainer.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes we complain about the most trivial things. Then, when we \nencounter someone whose problems are much more severe than our own, \nwe realize that, in comparison, our pain and suffering seem almost \ninsignificant.\u0014\n\u0014\n The following story may help us put our personal pain in perspective:\u0014\n\u0014\n So it was that when the Hasidic pilgrims vied for who among them had \nendured the most suffering, who was most entitled to complain, the \nZaddik told them the story of the Sorrow Tree. \u0014\n\u0014\n On the Day of Judgement, each person will be allowed to hang all of \nhis unhappiness on a branch of the great Tree of Sorrows. After each \nperson has found a limb from which his own miseries may dangle, they \nmay all walk slowly around the tree. Each is to search for a set of \nsufferings that he would prefer to those he has hung on the tree. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, each man freely chooses to reclaim his own personal set \nof sorrows rather than those of another. Each man leaves the tree \nwiser than when he came.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point, everyone encounters problems, inconveniences and \ndifficulties. Some will experience very deep and ongoing suffering. \nComplaining about our circumstances doesnt change anything. In fact, \nas we constantly hear our own complaining, we may become more \ndiscouraged. We must put our suffering in perspective and deal with \nit proactively.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you deal proactively with your pain and suffering? \u0014\n\u0014\nBe aware that Jesus empathizes with our suffering. Jesus is no \nstranger to physical or emotional affliction. The Old Testament \nprophet described the coming messiah as one who is \"a man of sorrows \nand familiar with suffering\" (Isa 53:3). \u0014\nKnow that Jesus invites us to bring our sorrows and suffering to him. \n\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you \nrest\" (Mt 11:30). Prayer, worship and meditation may all be \nappropriate channels through which to take our suffering to the Lord. \u0014\nRemember that your suffering is temporary. The Apostle Paul put \nsuffering in eternal perspective when he wrote, \"I consider that our \npresent sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will \nbe revealed in us\" (Rom 8:18). \u0014\nPray for others who may be suffering. \"Pray for each other so that \nyou may be healed\" (Jas 5:16). Even during the experience of our own \nsuffering, we have the opportunity to pray for others who are \nhurting. \u0014\nOffer to help another person who is suffering. \"Carry one anothers \nburdens and in this you will fulfill the law of Christ\"(Gal 6:2). \nThere is something encouraging about trying to help a hurting person. \nSometimes when we share the burden of another individual, we find \nthat our own burden is lighter.\u0014\nWhen you encounter seasons of pain and suffering, remember that you \nare not alone. A tenacious faith, supportive companionship and the \nabiding presence of God can get you through some extremely difficult \ndays.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarry Howard is senior minister of First Baptist Church in Corbin, Ky.\u0014\n\u0014\nEthics Daily\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 EthicsDaily.com\u0014",

Most of the \nchildren are in the custody of another parent or relative or foster \ncare.\u0014\nEighty percent of the children were molested by one of their own \nparents, the officials said.\u0014\n\"I've rarely seen crimes as despicable and repugnant,\" the customs \ncommissioner, Robert C. Bonner, said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the defendants are men with the exception of Bente Jensen of \nDenmark, who is charged with her husband, Eggert Jensen. Ten \nAmericans have been charged since January, including nine people \nnamed in an indictment unsealed today in Fresno, Calif. The other \ndefendant, Jeffrey Naimo of Killeen, Tex., has pleaded guilty and \nbeen sentenced to 20 years in prison, Mr. Bonner said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix residents of Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland were \nindicted, and Washington is seeking their extradition, Mr. Bonner \nsaid. Four other Europeans were charged in a joint investigation with \nthe Danish police that reached Belgium, England, Germany, the \nNetherlands and Switzerland. Customs officials said they would not \nidentify them or their nationalities because the inquiry was \ncontinuing. Officials said they expected additional arrests. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe charges of sexual exploitation of children, conspiracy to exploit \nchildren and receiving and distributing child pornography each carry \nmandatory minimum sentences of 10 years to a maximum of 20 years. \nSome defendants could receive 60 years if convicted of all the \ncharges against them, Mr. Bonner said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe indictment says members of the ring, referring to themselves as \n\"the club,\" traded messages across the Internet to request \nphotographs of specific sexual poses. One man asked for an audio tape \nso he could hear a child crying while being spanked, the indictment \nsaid, and another man posed naked with an under-age girl. One man \nswapped his children with another pedophile to be abused, Mr. Bonner \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Danish police, officials said, found files on the Jensens' \ncomputer that it forwarded to the Customs Service and led to the \narrest in January of a chiropractor, Lloyd Alan Emmerson of Clovis, \nCalif. Paul Whitmore and Brooke Rowland, both of San Diego, were also \narrested in January based on Danish information, investigators said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSearches of suspects' computers led to nine other Americans, a \ncustoms agent said.

    "words": "Preaching for Change\u0014\nHow positive sermons promote personal growth.\u0014\nRandy Frazee\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said, \"You experts in the law, woe to you, because you load \npeople down with burdens they can hardly carry\" (Luke 11:46). How \ncan preachers keep themselves from doing this?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most significant challenges to my preaching came when a \ncolleague said, \"Randy, I want you to do something that someone did \nfor me. Listen to a couple of your sermon tapes. Diagnose the \npercentage of time you spend preaching against things versus \npreaching for things.\" I consider myself a positive person. But I was \nappalled that the majority of my time I spent preaching against \nsomething. It's simply easier. Instead, we need to tell people what \nwe live for.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat effect does this kind of preaching have?\u0014\nPreaching is similar to raising children. One strategy for correcting \nan overweight child is to pick on them about their weight. But it \ndoesn't work. Instead, whenever there's a small success, stand up and \nbrag on them. Preaching should celebrate more than scold.\u0014\nRecently I was encouraged by my congregation's response to community \nneeds. I simply said, \"I'm overwhelmed by what you have been doing. I \njust want to say how proud I am of you.\" I didn't add, \"But let's do \nmore.\"\u0014\nIf you simply brag on them, that really motivates.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you help a congregation want to change?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSermons allow us to be passionate about change by being vulnerable \nabout our struggles. I find tremendous impact when people know that \nI've made mistakes, but that I am passionate about what Christ can do \nto change me.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently my daughter lost my wife's cell phone at the mall. I was \nhaving a really bad day. I told her, \"You need to go back. Look at \nevery store. I don't care what it's going to take.\" I was really hard \non both my wife and my daughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater that day I wasn't paying attention while driving and hit the \ncurb. It destroyed the wheel. When I saw my daughter, I said, \"The \ncell phone you lost is going to cost about $20 to replace, and that \nwas irresponsible. But I was irresponsible, too, and it's going to \ncost me $500. I'll tell you what. I will cut you some slack, if you \nwill cut me some slack.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSharing that story gave people a sense of my vulnerability and my \nreal passion to be more grace-filled and forgiving. That kind of \npreaching and that kind of example encourage life change.\u0014\n\u0014\nRandy Frazee is pastor of Pantego Bible Church in Ft. Worth, Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeadership Journal, Summer 2002\u0014",

    "words": "Poverty Increases First Time in Four Years\u0014\nBY Jodi Mathews \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 2001 U.S. Census Bureau report on income revealed that the rich \nare getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the annual report, there are 1.3 million more poor \nAmericans, bringing the total for 2001 to 32.9 million. Last year, \n11.7 percent of all Americans were living in poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report noted that last year marked the first increase in poverty \nin four years.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedian household income also declined 2.2 percent, making it $42,228 \nin 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Like the last year-to-year increase in poverty in 1991-1992 and the \nlast decrease in real household income in 1990-1991, these changes \ncoincide with a recession,\" Daniel Weinberg, chief of the Census \nBureau's Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division, said in \na press release.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recession affected Americans of all races, religions and classes, \naccording to the report.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll regions of the United States, except the Northwest, experienced a \ndecline in household income.\u0014\n\u0014\nA family of four was considered poor if it had a cash income of less \nthan $18,104.

Increases in poverty in 2001 were \nconcentrated in suburbs, in the South and among whites.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poverty rate in the South rose to 13.5 percent last year, from \n12.8 percent in the previous year. \"The South is home to more than 40 \npercent of all the nations poor, and it accounted for more than half \nof the national increase in the number of poor last year,\" the Times \nreported.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of poor people in the suburbs rose by 700,000 people, \nmaking the total 12 million, according to the report.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the 32.9 million poor in the United States, 11.7 million were \nunder 18 and 3.4 million were older than 65.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report also revealed that the number of \"severely poor\"--those \nwith family incomes totaling less than half of the official poverty \nlevel--rose to 13.4 million last year, from 12.6 million in 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Census Bureau also found that the richest fifth of Americans \nreceived half of all household income last year, up from 45 percent \nin 1985. The poorest fifth received 3.5 percent of total household \nincome.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Average income for the top 5 percent of households rose by $1,000 \nlast year, to $260,464,\" the Times reported.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The census data show that income inequality either set a record in \n2001 or tied for the highest level on record,\" Robert Greenstein, \nexecutive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \ntold the Times.\u0014\n\u0014\nJodi Mathews is BCE's communications director.\u0014",

    "words": "PERSONAL GROWTH-PAINFUL BUT REWARDING\u0014\n   By Clark Cothern, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   My dad had a saying: \"It's gonna feel so good when it stops\u0014\n   hurting.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   When I was in fifth grade, after the doctor cast my broken\u0014\n   arm, Dad used that phrase. He explained that God made our\u0014\n   bones so that after a break a special reinforcement is formed\u0014\n   around the area, making it stronger than before. He was right.\u0014\n   After the cast was cut off I was back playing flag football\u0014\n   and running track. The weeks of painful growth paid off.\u0014\n\u0014\n   As a high school freshman, when I failed to make the Varsity\u0014\n   Band, my band director explained that those who made the JV\u0014\n   Band would \"wood shed\" the fundamentals of rhythm and sight-\u0014\n   reading, rendering us stronger musicians than before. He was\u0014\n   right. The next year I made the Varsity Band, challenging my\u0014\n   way to first chair in the trombone section. The two semesters\u0014\n   of painful growth paid off.\u0014\n\u0014\n   When I was grieving over a breakup with a high school\u0014\n   girlfriend, my mom explained that God made our hearts in such\u0014\n   a way that he would reinforce them with his own love. She was\u0014\n   right. I graduated, went on to college, grew through a couple\u0014\n   more breakups, and finally discovered that God had shaped my\u0014\n   character, preparing me for the girl who would later become my\u0014\n   wife. The years of painful personal growth paid off.\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few months ago I received a letter that cut me to the quick.\u0014\n   It revealed that I had become timid in expressing my faith. My\u0014\n   first response was to say, \"What does that guy know about me\u0014\n   anyway?\" and dismiss the criticism. But I couldn't dismiss it\u0014\n   because I knew that person loved me like a son. The phrase,\u0014\n   \"It's gonna feel so good when it quits hurting\" came to mind.\u0014\n   A few days later I found myself thinking, \"You know, he was\u0014\n   right.\" I grew in confidence and began expressing my faith\u0014\n   more boldly. That growth was painful, but the days of smarting\u0014\n   from the sting of truth told by a friend paid off.\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few weeks later I received some critique about my leadership\u0014\n   style from another close friend. At the time I wanted to say,\u0014\n   \"What does this person know about me?\" and dismiss the\u0014\n   critique. But I knew that this person loved me like a brother.\u0014\n   The phrase, \"It's going to feel so good when it quits hurting\"\u0014\n   came to mind. Several weeks later I thought, \"You know, a lot\u0014\n   of what this person said was right.\" I learned additional\u0014\n   lessons about assertive leadership. A little more pain. A\u0014\n   little more growth. The weeks of relational conflict paid off.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The writer of Proverbs said, \"My child, don't ignore it when\u0014\n   the Lord disciplines you, and don't be discouraged when he\u0014\n   corrects you. For the Lord corrects those he loves, just as a\u0014\n   father corrects a child in whom he delights\" (Proverb 3:11,12\u0014\n   NLT). No discipline, criticism, or character correction seems\u0014\n   pleasant at the time, but when it results in personal growth,\u0014\n   it feels so good when it quits hurting.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Clark Cothern pastors in Ypsilanti, Michigan.\u0014",

    "title": "PENTECOSTAL'S GLOBAL LANGUAGE",
    "words": "Pentecostalism's Global Language\u0014\nIt's not tongues but a different way of being a Christian.\u0014\nan interview with Walter J. Hollenweger \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is Pentecostalism so popular? It is nearly half a billion strong \nworldwide, and has been and continues to be the fastest growing \nChristian movement in the world. It has made inroads not only in \nthird-world regions like Africa and Latin America, but it also \ncontinues to attract huge followings in the United States and Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter J. Hollenweger is the leading expert on worldwide \nPentecostalism, which he has been studying for more than 40 years. \nHaving grown up in the Pentecostal church, he later became ordained \nin the Reformed Church of Switzerland. From 1965 to 1971 he was \nexecutive secretary of the World Council of Churches, then served as \nprofessor of mission at England's University of Birmingham for 18 \nyears. His seminal book The Pentecostals (Hendrickson, 1972) was \nrecently followed up by Pentecostalism: Origins and Developments \nWorldwide (Hendrickson, 1997). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is a Pentecostal?\u0014\n\u0014\nWorldwide there is so much variety that about all one can say is that \na Pentecostal is a Christian who calls himself a Pentecostal. Though \nAmericans tend to focus on the gift of tongues, overall Pentecostals \nemphasize that God has given several giftsnot just speaking in \ntongues but also healing and the so-called rational gifts like \norganization or building a school. Diverse gifts to diverse people. \nIt's not a strictly theological definition but a phenomenological one.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is speaking in tongues the focus in America?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many reasons, of course, but one is that American and other \nmiddle-class cultures, as in Switzerland, find tongues an \nextraordinary phenomenon, so these experiences get a lot of \nattention. In Africa or Mexico, on the other hand, speaking in \ntongues and healings are not considered extraordinarythey can even \nbe found in some indigenous pagan religions. (Speaking in tongues is \nnot even \"supernatural,\" as many Pentecostals have found out.) \nTongues aren't even spoken in a lot of third-world Pentecostal \nchurches. Instead, third-world Pentecostals focus on corporate \nworship, singing together, and Christian education. American \nPentecostals don't seek education as much as an experience of the \nsupernatural.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur issue covers Pentecostalism up to about 1950. What have been the \nkey changes in Pentecostalism since then?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, more and more young Pentecostals are becoming scholars through \nreputable universities. It's true for Pentecostals in Europe, North \nAmerica, and Latin America. It's also true for Africa and for Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are now several hundred young Pentecostal scholars with \ndoctorates, and that, of course, changes the breadth and depth of \nPentecostalism. Most of them have maintained their roots in \nPentecostalism, so they are now bilingual. They can speak in the \nuniversity language, in the language of concepts and definitions, but \nthey can also speak in the oral language of Pentecostalism, and I \nthink that is an extremely important part of their success.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, this increase in education has led in many places to more \necumenical openness. In the past, nobody wanted to talk to the \nPentecostals, and the Pentecostals didn't want to talk to any of the \nother churches because they saw them as a lost cause. Now, for \ninstance, there is a worldwide dialogue between Pentecostals and \nRoman Catholics that has been going on for 20 years. There have also \nbeen many contacts with the World Council of Churches, and the latest \nexample is a global dialogue with the Presbyterian churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid du Plessis, a pioneer in ecumenism, has been instrumental in \nboth these changes. He went to the Catholics. He went to the World \nCouncil of Churches. He went to all the universities. And the fact \nthat he was a reasonable man and also a Pentecostal astonished many \npeople. They thought Pentecostals were all a little crazy and could \nnot think properly. But when they got to know him, they realized that \nit is possible to speak in tongues and be a critical scholar.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother change, of course, is the worldwide explosive growth to \nnearly half a billion adherents. Why is Pentecostalism so popular?\u0014\nSome scholars think it has to do with its theology and doctrine. But \nPentecostal theology is not homogeneous. Others think it's because of \nPentecostals' aggressive evangelism. That is partly true because a \nreal Pentecostal is by definition an evangelist, whose faith is as \ninfectious as the flu.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most important reason is that it is an oral religion. It is not \ndefined by the abstract language that characterizes, for instance, \nPresbyterians or Catholics. Pentecostalism is communicated in \nstories, testimonies, and songs. Oral language is a much more global \nlanguage than that of the universities or church declarations. Oral \ntradition is flexible and can adapt itself to a variety of \ncircumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan't oral tradition drift off into sub-Christian and even heretical \nbeliefs?\u0014\nCertainly, but overall there is a basic evangelical consensus among \nPentecostals. They are similar to the early church in this respect. \nEarly Christians didn't have a formal, written confession of faith, \nas Presbyterians and others do today. They had the stories of Jesus. \nEven Jesus didn't spell out doctrine; he gave his followers stories \nof miracles, and taught through proverbs and parables.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest church was united, but not as much through their \ntheology as through the Lord's Prayer, Paul's collection for \nJerusalem (his theological \"enemies\"), baptism, and the Eucharist. \nTheir statements of faith were simple, and the simplest was \"Jesus is \nLord.\" It was a very different way of achieving togetherness, and it \nwas achieved through these oral forms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, when the ecumenical confessions came later, they did not \nunite the church. They divided it, as propositional theology always \ndoes. But across divided theology, it is possible to pray together, \nto sing together, and to act together. That's what Pentecostals do at \ntheir best.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it fair to say that when you convert to Pentecostalism, you are \nconverting not to a certain theology but to a new experience of faith?\u0014\nYes, and that has important evangelistic consequences for \nPentecostals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many circles, when you become a Christian, you talk about gaining \na new understanding of the Lord's Supper and baptism (they are either \nmore or less sacramental), but other people are not terribly \ninterested in that. When you become a Pentecostal, you talk about how \nyou've been healed or your very life has been changed. That's \nsomething Pentecostals talk about over and over, partly because \npeople are interested in hearing that sort of thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPentecostalism today addresses the whole life, including the thinking \npart. More mainline forms of Christianity address the thinking part \nfirst and that often affects the rest of life, but not always.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet it seems most Pentecostals are far more right-brained and \nintuitive than left-brained and rational.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, the \"orality\" of Pentecostalismthe singing, the dancing, the \nspeaking in tonguesaccents the intuitive. But a mature Pentecostal \nwill try to connect the intuitive and the rational. Always \nemphasizing the analytical will destroy faith. But only emphasizing \nthe intuitive leads to chaos. A challenge of the Pentecostal movement \nis to combine rational thinking with its spontaneous emotional side.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the challenge for all Christians, really. The rationalist \nneeds the Toronto Blessing and has to be slain in the Spirit to \nrealize that. It sometimes seems silly to me, but you'll notice that \nit is rationalists and intellectuals who fall down. People who have a \nbalanced emotional and intuitive life don't need that. True, some \nrationalists dance, sing, go walking in the mountains, or play a \nmusical instrument, but then they go back to their science, to \nrational lives, and the two are not connected.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat most concerns you as you think about Pentecostalism in the \ncoming century?\u0014\nFirst, Pentecostalism must confront its tendency to segregate and \nseparate into countless denominations. It's happening all the time, \nand it really is a scandal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other challenge is common to all Christian churches: What do we \ndo with the ecological threat to the world? What do we do with the \nthreat of hunger and the plight of refugees? It's a challenge that \nwill hit Pentecostals harder than any other churches because their \nlargest churches are on the poor side of the world. But as \nChristians, we have a contribution to make not just in money but in \nprayer and in developing solutions that politicians cannot.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Pentecostals are not known for their social activism.\u0014\nThat's true in some ways, but it is a misconception in others. Many \nof Martin Luther King's marchers were black Pentecostals. In Brazil \nthere are many Pentecostals sitting in parliament. And in many \nthird-world countries, Pentecostals are trying to develop new ways of \ngaining political influence without the game playing we have in the \nWest. In Latin America, for example, they try to work with sectors of \nthe Catholic church to get water or a school or a new street for a \npoor district. So there are quite a number of places where \nPentecostals take up the structural issues, but they do not take them \nup by founding political parties. They start from the local needs and \nthe local misery people experience every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1998 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "PASTORAL AUTHORITY AS A SOURCE OF CONFLICT",
    "words": "PASTORAL AUTHORITY AS A SOURCE OF CONFLICT\u0014\nMark Wingfield, The Baptist Standard\u0014\n\u0014\nWho runs the church!  In healthy churches, secure pastors and secure \nlay leaders share a common vision of mutual leadership, according to \nthose who have studied conflict in Baptist churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in unhealthy churches, either the pastor or lay leaders attempt \nto tip the balance in their favor against the wishes of the other\u0014\nparty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIssues related to who controls the church are the No.1 reason for \nforced terminations of Baptist pastors nationwide, according to\u0014\ndata collected by UfeWay Christian Resources of the Southern Baptist \nConvention.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, the number of forced ter - minations of pastors by \nBaptist churches has reached alarming proportions, concurred Jan \nDaehnen, director of minister/church relations for the Baptist \nGeneral Convention of Texas. Following the national trend, each year, \n200 to 300 Texas Baptist ministers are fired by their churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a majority of these cases, disputes over pastoral authority played \na significant role in the conflicts that led to termination, Daehnen \nsaid. And in many other cases, pastors who were not fired left \nchurches under duress related to authority issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it's easy to point a finger one way or the other, \nresponsibility for conflict rooted in authority issues lies at the \nfeet of both pastors and laity, Daehnen and others said. \u0014\n\u0014\n'The authority issue is primarily seen in the pastoral role, but it's \nalso a layman's authority issue, \" he explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn congregations, these conflicts play out along two common \nscenarios, analysts report.  Either the pastor is accused of being \n\"too heavy-handed,\" \"too authoritarian\" or a \"dictator, \" or the \npastor declares that some lay leaders are thwarting his leadership by \ntheir controlling tactics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe theological perspectives of pastors who believe they have a \nGod-given mandate to run the church sometimes compound the problem, \naccording to Baptists who deal regularly with conflict resolution. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many people associate authoritarian pastoral styles with a \nfundamentalist theology, authoritarianism cuts across the political \nspectrum, said Howard Batson, pastor of First Baptist Church of \nAmarillo, Texas. \"It has nothing to do with Baptist politics. It \nreally is an interpersonal skills problem. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"As a pastor develops a healthy self- esteem, he is less likely to be \ndictatorial and more likely to be a strong leader,\" he added. \"When \nhe's not sure of himself, he'll either hide in a comer or shout from \nthe rooftop. When he's sure of himself, he'll do neither of those.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Sheffield, a specialist in church conflict mediation with \nLifeWay, concurred. \"The more insecure a person is, sometimes the \nmore authoritarian he has to be. If you're secure, you can allow \npeople to be involved in decision making.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nConflicts over pastoral authority reveal deeper unsettled issues in \nthe Christian church, Daehnen suggested. \"Pastoral authority is a \npiece of the picture that has been over-emphasized because other \nparts of the picture are out of shape.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem, he believes, is that Protestant churches \"never \ncompleted the Reformation ...; we've never known how to reconcile the \nrole of the pastor and the role  of the layman in ministry. \"\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes, the fault lies with pastors  who, even though Baptist, \n\"have kept some of the old Catholic church tendencies\" ofj clerical \nsuperiority, Daehnert said. That may  be compounded when laity \"turn \nover to the pastor authority that really belongs to Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOther times, lay leaders become so accustomed to managing all the \nbusiness of the church amid a succession of short-tem  pastors or \npart-time pastors that they tilt tl j other way and allow no room for \npastoral~ leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough it perhaps receives less attention, some pastors give too \nlittle leadership,  Batson noted.\"On that end, they're withdrawn and \napathetic and provide sporadic leadership. They lack initiative.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best road to travel lies between these two ditches, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What most churches want is a healthy teamship approach to \nleadership. You lead  but you do it as part of a team, including the \ncommittees and the congregation. It's not so much, 'God told me, and \nthis is what we've got to do: but 'Here's what God has told us \ntogether:\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Batson, Daehnert and others acknowledged that some Baptist churches \nwant a pastor who will give strong direction. That's OK, they said, \nif the church hires a pastor who shares that vision of leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nProblems usually arise when a congregation expects one type of \npastoral authority and they get another,\" Batson noted. This requires \nthe pastor-search committee to really know the story of the church \nand match that with the story of the candidate. \u0014\n\u0014\nToo often, however, pastor search committees don't understand what \nthe church wants in a pastor, Sheffield added. If you get one pastor \nwho has been a precipative-type pastor, trying to develop a shared \nministry approach, followed by a person who is very autocratic, \nyou're going to have problems, Sheffield said. Congregations don't \nrealize this. They don't take this into consideration in the pastor \nsearch process.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sometimes what the congregation has been heard to say is,'We need a \nstrong leader'.  But their definition of a strong leader and the \npastor's definition are different, he said. But more often, \"the \npastor search committee will go on the basis of what they think, \nwithout surveying the congregation, Sheffield said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat can be a problem because umost pastor search committees don't \nrepresent the church as a whole; they represent the cutting edge of \nthe church. Why are people put on the pastor search committee in the \nfirst place? Because they're leaders and they want things to happen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reality, churches may need different styles of pastoral leadership \nat different stages of the congregation's life, Sheffield said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe compares the situation to a parent's role in leading a child. \n'There are times, if you're pastoring a mission church, the pastor is \ngoing to have to be more hands-on and directive than he might need to \nbe if he has developed his congregation properly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut just as a parent cannot give direction to a grown child the same \nway he or she would to a toddler, a pastor must adjust his leadership \nrole as a congregation matures, he added. Sheffield and Daehnert both \nbelieve many pastors have bought into an incorrect definition of \nleadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaders are not managers, they insist, and authority is not the same \nas influence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you take Ephesians 4 literally, our job as pastors is to equip \nthe saints for a work of ministry,\"  Sheffield said. \"We will be \nleaders, which is a sphere of influence, not managers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDaehnert concurred and pointed to a book, The Servant, written by a \ncorporate executive using biblical principles. The author, James \nHunter, quotes sociologist Max Weber's distinction between power and \nauthority.\u0014\n\u0014\nPower, he said, is uthe ability to force or coerce someone to do your \nwill, even if they would choose not to, because of your position or \nmight.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthority, however, is \"the skill of getting  people to willingly do \nyour will because of  your personal influence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo a person could be in a position of  power but not have authority \nwith people,j Daehnert said. \"Authority is based not on position but \non influence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA practical misapplication of authority happens when young pastors or \npastors new to their churches look at older mentors with long tenures \nand attempt to duplicate their leadership styles, Sheffield explained.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe older, more tenured pastors have \"gone through the fire\" and \nearned the right ofleadership, he said. \"Yet we may think we can be \nthere without earning the right to be the leader.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem of church conflict due to leadership issues is \nwell-known, acknowledged Larry Ashlock, a professor of pastoral\u0014\n ministry at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and former \npastor of Texas Baptist churches. \"We seem to know the reasons for \nthe problems but have not taken proactive steps to correctIng it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n It is possible, in fact, that even professors like himself while \nteaching the importance of servant leadership actually model the \nopposite, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n LifeWay is attempting to address the problem nationwide through its \nLeaderCare unit, which includes counseling and other resources for \nministers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe BGCT addresses the problem through its minister/church relations \noffice. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most practical solutions is for pastors to learn better \nlistening skills, Batson suggested.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We teach people in seminary how to talk, not how to listen. The \ngreatest skill a pastor can have is his ability to listen.\" The same \nmay be true for lay leaders as \"A healthy church is where people are \nsubmissive to the leadership of God in their lives and equally \nsubmissive to one another, \"\u0014\nDaehnert said.\u0014\n\u0014\n In the ideal situation, he added, \"the pastor has a role and \nresponsibility and lay leaders also have a role and responsibility. \nTogether, they determine what is God's will for the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe model that works best for a pastor, he suggested, is Jesus the \nGood Shepherd rather than the Old Testament model of religious \nleaders as \"prophet, priest and king.\" Yet while the New Testament \noffers principles for church leadership, it does not spell out a \ndetailed plan of church administration, Batson said. \"I don't think \n(first-centuryChristians)  ever imagined the church being structured \nlike it is now.\"\u0014",

    "words": "His name was John. People knew him locally as the Baptist. Some would \nsay of\u0014\nhim that he was a religious eccentric. Others less kind would dismiss \nhim as\u0014\nbeing simply a flake. He definitely did not seem to be the kind of \n\"How to\u0014\nwin friends and influence people\" type of personality to usher in the \nnews\u0014\nof the Messiah's coming. He just somehow doesn't seem to fit in with\u0014\nshepherds and wise men and the other characters that we traditionally\u0014\nassociate with the Christmas story. Yet, this was God's unlikely \nservant\u0014\nchosen to herald the spectacular events that would soon follow. A most\u0014\nunlikely promotions man to be sure, but God's man nevertheless.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the very beginning everything about John was unique. His mother\u0014\nElizabeth was related to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Elizabeth \nconceived six\u0014\nmonths before Mary. But Mary happened to be a very young girl, indeed \nalmost\u0014\na child. Most scholars put her probable age at thirteen. It was not \nunusual\u0014\nfor a girl in that day and time to be of childbearing age at such a \ntender\u0014\nage. Indeed, it is not unheard of even in cotemporary America.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth, on the other hand, was a woman who was in the golden years \nof her\u0014\nlife. She had never given birth to a child. You would think of her \nmore in\u0014\nthe category of great grandmother than mother. Yet, she and her aging \npriest\u0014\nof a husband were the unlikely candidates. Just this week, on Monday, \nNBC\u0014\nnews featured a woman who was 50 years old, a coach of a women's \ncollege\u0014\nsports team, who had had twins. It's not out of the question, but beg \nthe\u0014\ngrandmother's here today, don't take this as a word from the Lord!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then there was John himself. Being the same age as Jesus they \ngrow up\u0014\ntogether, played together, yet as they reached adulthood they were \ndifferent\u0014\nin so many ways. When John began his ministry he lived in the desert\u0014\nsolitude of Judea, a rugged desert wilderness. He fed on honey and \nwild\u0014\nlocust and dressed in garments of camel hair. He constantly brooded \nover the\u0014\nscriptures, especially the prophetic ministry of Elijah, after whom he\u0014\nmodeled his own ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor was John a respecter of persons or rank. He had an intimidating\u0014\npersonality. For that reason the upper class folk rejected both he \nand his\u0014\nmessage. You can read about that in Luke 7:29.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, John gathered a respectable following. He attracted many hearers \namong\u0014\nthe lower class, many of whom received baptism by his hands. John \neven drew\u0014\na group of disciples around him, which is significant for two reasons.\u0014\nFirst, some of these disciples later became disciples of our Lord. \nSecondly,\u0014\na number of people began to think of John himself as being the long \nexpected\u0014\nMessiah. For that reason John's gospel felt obliged to specifically \npoint\u0014\nout \"There was a man sent from God whose name was John, He came for\u0014\ntestimony to bear witness to the light that all might believe through \nhim.\u0014\nHe was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat drew people to John and his message? Well, John was far-fetched. \nHis\u0014\naustere life style was a compelling reason to listen to him and \nperhaps his\u0014\nstrange ways convinced some people to follow him. I think many \nthought he\u0014\nwas Elijah the prophet who returned. But there was more to John than \nsimply\u0014\na bizarre strange life. John understood that God was about to do \nsomething\u0014\nthat would shake the foundations of the earth and he needed to \nprepare the\u0014\nway for that event.\u0014",

    "words": "Peace on Earth? \u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas Carols and the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American Civil War sparked revival on both sides of the \nMason-Dixon Line. Between 100,000 and 200,000 Union soldiers \nreportedly converted to Christ, as did approximately 150,000 \nConfederates. Many soldiers' quarters featured chapels, and it was \nduring this conflict that military chaplains became common. During \nthe fall of 1863 and the winter of 1864 alone, some 7,000 of Robert \nE. Lee's troops became Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same era saw a flurry of hymn-writing and carol-writing, \nespecially in the North. In 1849, with the Mexican-American war just \nover and smaller skirmishes (between settlers and American Indians \nand between slavery-supporters and abolitionists) igniting across the \nfrontier, Edmund Hamilton Sears expressed a longing for peace in \"It \nCame Upon the Midnight Clear.\" Sears, a New Englander, was not \ndirectly involved in these battles, but as a Unitarian pastor and \njournalist, he had cause to comment on them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs scholar Alfred Edward Bailey noted in his 1950 classic The Gospel \nin Hymns, Sears's carol specifically emphasizes the social \nsignificance of the Christmas angels' message. Sears writes of a \n\"weary world,\" with \"sad and lowly plains\" where \"Babel sounds\" echo. \nHe laments \"two thousand years of wrong\" and the fact that \"man, at \nwar with man, hears not / the love song which they [the angels] \nbring.\" The carol's last stanza anticipates the day \"when peace shall \nover all the earth / its ancient splendors fling.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of peace, the 15 years following Sears's song saw \nunprecedented strife. The ravages of the war directly inspired \nanother carol, \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" which was penned \nby Maine native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow around 1862. The sadness \nof this song reflects Longfellow's grief over the 1861 death of his \nsecond wife (burned to death at home when candles ignited her \nclothing), his bitter opposition to the war, and the sorrow of his \nson Charles having been gravely injured in battle. The poet's staunch \nYankee views also show through in the original version of the text, \nfrom which three particularly partisan stanzas were dropped when the \npoem was set to music in 1872.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe excised stanzas include such lines as \"Then from each black, \naccursed mouth / The cannon thundered in the South\" and \"It was as if \nan earthquake rent / The hearth-stones of a continent.\" Retained, \nhowever, were the following two poignant passages:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"'There is not peace on earth,' I said\u0014\n'For hate is strong and mocks the song\u0014\nOf peace on earth, good will to men\"\u0014\n\u0014\nand\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then pealed the bells more loud and deep\u0014\n'God is not dead, nor doth He sleep,\u0014\nThe wrong shall fail, the right prevail\u0014\nWith peace on earth, good will to men.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother carol to come out of Civil War experience is \"O Little Town \nof Bethlehem,\" by Phillips Brooks. A pastor in Philadelphia during \nthe war, Brooks also ministered to Union soldiers. He called the \nEmancipation Proclamation \"the greatest and most glorious thing our \nland has ever seen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDebate over the date when Brooks his poem continues to this day, and \nit touches on how closely related the song is to the war and its \naftermath. One theory holds that Brooks wrote the text in 1868 and \nthat the stillness in Bethlehem mirrors the stillness in \nPhiladelphia, where a generation of young men had been wiped out. \nMore likely Brooks wrote the text in 1865, during a Christmastime \nvisit to the Holy Land, and he was merely describing Bethlehem as he \nsaw it. At any rate, the words were not set to music until 1868, \nafter which the carol was sung annually by the children's choir at \nBrooks's church. Few people outside the parish knew of the carol \nuntil it suddenly appeared in newspapers about a decade later.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Brooks had visited Bethlehem today, of course, he would have \nwritten a very different carol. Thankfully, the \"hopes and fears\" of \neven this tragic year are \"met\" in Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n* Some information for this newsletter was collected from the book \nChristmas Songs Made in America by Albert J. Menendez and Shirley C. \nMenendez (Cumberland House, 1999).\u0014",

    "words": "Henry Clay was a famous Kentucky politician who ran for president \nthree times between 1824 and 1844. Best known for the stirring \nphrase, \"I had rather be right than President,\" Clay flip-flopped on \nissues throughout his career to advance himself politically. \"I'd \nrather be President than right,\" would have been a more accurate \nsummary of Clay's life.\u0014\n\u0014\nClay always coveted the presidency. He entered the US Senate at age \n29, below the Constitutionally required age of 30. (No one thought to \nask his age, and he never volunteered it.) Later, as Speaker of the \nHouse, Clay begged President James Monroe to appoint him secretary of \nstate. Because three prior presidents had been secretaries of state, \nClay viewed the office as a stepping stone. When Monroe appointed \nJohn Quincy Adams instead, Clay prevented Monroe's inauguration from \ntaking place in the House chamber, as had been the custom. Though \nCongress was experiencing a rare era of cooperation among political \nparties, Clay stonewalled Monroe's legislation, countering with his \nown programs. \u0014\n\u0014\nEight years later, Clay faced Adams in a four-way race for president. \nClay threw his votes, possibly illegally, to Adams (though he \ndespised him), in return for the secretary of state post. In two \nsubsequent presidential campaigns, Clay's platforms were primarily \nbased on whatever issues his opponent was against. He was known \ngenerously at the time as \"the Great Compromiser\" and \"the Great \nPacifier.\" He opposed Andrew Jackson's banking issues, and James Polk \non Texas statehood. Clay's frequent runs for president suggest that, \nat least in the 19th century, nimble skirting of issues and great \nconnections were not enough to convince the public of one's \nqualifications for reaching the oval office.\u0014\n\u0014\nHB Club\u0014",

    "words": "This fall I was in a large suburban Presbyterian church in Kansas \nCity. I found that almost everyone in that large congregation had our \npresent war fever on his or her heart and mind. These were not by any \nmeans your garden-variety leftists or pacifists, who form the usual \nlist of suspects, and these were not Cambridge crunchies, by any \nmeans. This was Kansas, for heaven's sakeAlf Landon and Bob Dole \ncountryand these were Presbyterians. They love their country, and \nthey love their God; and what do you do when your country is headed \nwhere you think your faith and your God don't want you to go?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we have an intelligent conversation on the most dangerous \npolicy topic of the day without being branded traitors, self-loathing \nAmericans, anti-patriotic, or soft on democracy? That's a good \nquestion, especially when even the president of the United States \nquestions the patriotism of those few in the U.S. Senate who question \nhis policy or challenge his authority to wage war at will. Must the \nfirst casualty of patriotism always be dissent, debate, and \ndiscussion?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a frightening time, and if one cannot speak out of Christian \nconscience and conviction now, come what may, then we are forever \nconsigned to moral silence. We hear much talk of \"moral clarity,\" but \nit sounds more to me like moral arrogance, and it must not be met \nwith moral silence. Anthony Lewis, formerly of The New York Times, \nsaid recently that if the purpose of the terrorists of Sept. 11, \n2001, was to destroy our confidence in our own American values, then, \nhe feared, they had succeeded. In the name of fighting terror both \nabroad and at home, our governmentparticularly through the attorney \ngeneral, together with a culture of patriotic intimidationhas \nsuspended our constitutional liberties, stifled dissent, and defined \na good American as one who goes along with the powers-that-be, in a \n\"my way or the highway\" mentality. When patriotism is defined in this \nnarrow, partisan, opportunistic, jingoistic way, then perhaps that \nold cynic Dr. Samuel Johnson was right when he defined patriotism as \nthe \"last refuge of a scoundrel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, I prefer his contemporary, Edmund Burke, who said, \"To make \nus love our country, our country ought to be lovely.\" Our country is \nlovely, which is why we love it and are willing to serve it and, if \nnecessary, to die for it. It is because we love it that we dare to \nspeak to affirm the goodness and righteousness in it, the virtue and \nthe power of its core values, and to speak against the things that \nwould do harm to it and to those core values. What is and has always \nbeen lovely about our country is our right and our duty to criticize \nthose in power, to dissent from their policies if we think them to be \nwrong, and to hold our alternative vision to be as fully valid as \ntheirs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIN 1952, ADLAI STEVENSON was running for president against the \npatriotic and heroic Dwight D. Eisenhower. Charges of egg-headism, of \nintellectualism, of being soft on communism and soft on patriotism \nhad been leveled on the intelligent and eloquent Stevenson. In a \nspeech to the American Legion convention called \"Patriotism in \nAmerica,\" Stevenson said, \"What do we mean by patriotism in the \ncontext of our time? I venture to suggest that what we mean is a \nsense of national responsibility, a patriotism which is not short, \nfrenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication \nof a lifetime.\" How carefully, poignantly, and aptly chosen are those \nwords in comparison with some of the language we hear flashed about \nin recent days.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many of you have seen the white marble statue of a British nurse \nstanding just above Trafalgar Square and beneath Leicester Square in \nLondon? It is the statue of Nurse Edith Cavell. One of her claims to \nfame is that in the early morning hours of October 12, 1915, she was \ntied to a stake in German-occupied Belgium and shot as a traitor for \nthe \"crime\" of assisting soldiers in their flight to neutral Holland. \nHer last moments were described by an eyewitness: \"After receiving \nthe sacrament, and within minutes of being led out to her death, she \nsaid, Standing as I do in view of God and eternity, I realize that \npatriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness toward \nanyone.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the base of her London statue are carved the words, \"Patriotism is \nnot enough.\" This is an impressive message from one who lost her life \nin the name of somebody else's patriotism.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdith Cavell, an English vicar's daughter, lived and died a \nChristian, but her last words are almost too enigmatic and too \nsimple, and they compel us to ask now, in a time of war and of rumors \nof war, what ought to be the proper relationship between love of God \nand love of country. If mere patriotism is not enough, what is it \nthat will help us to be both conscientious citizens and faithful \nChristians? Are the two mutually exclusive, or is it possible, \nsomehow, to live responsibly in the tension between those two claims? \nThat is always the business of any Christian who takes seriously his \nallegiance to Jesus Christ and his responsibility to his country and \nhis society.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the text from Jeremiah, wisdom, might, and riches are set in clear \nopposition to love, justice, and righteousness. That creates for us a \nself-conscious biblical tension not easily resolved or explained \naway. Jeremiah knows that we are inclined to boast of our wisdom, and \nthat is what the Hebrew word that is translated as \"glory\" really \nmeans: boasting, and the thumping of our intellectual chests. We know \nhow to boast about our might and our riches in this land of \nopportunity. Washington these days is full of rich, smart, and \npowerful people, many of them in the oil business: Jeremiah knows \nthat it is our natural penchant to seize upon and celebrate our \nachievements, for they define who we are, what we have, and what we \ndo. This is the way of the world, and when we are \"number one\" in the \nworld, it is \"our way or the highway.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophet does not deny the reality of these claims, but over and \nagainst them he sets God's claims of love, justice, and \nrighteousness. That is not only intellectual symmetry; it is moral \nsymmetry. He is unambiguously clear here. If we as God's people are \nto glory in anything, we must glory in the things that God values, \nthat God loves, and that God blesses. Why should God bless America if \nAmerica does not bless the things that God delights in? What are \nthey? Here they are, right in front of us: \"[B]ut let him who glories \nglory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord \nwho practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the \nearth; for in these things I delight.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we do not delight in the things that the Lord delights in, why \nshould the Lord delight in us? Try that one on for size. This will \nnot fit on a bumper sticker or on a T-shirt, but you might carry it \naround to ponder in your hearts and minds.\u0014\n\u0014\nLISTEN TO how J.B. Phillips translates Romans 12; it is meant to grab \nus by our vitals: \"With eyes wide open to the mercies of God, I beg \nyou, as an act of intelligent worship, to give him your bodies as a \nliving sacrifice, consecrated to him and acceptable by him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNote \"With eyes wide open.\" Not in fake devotion or in pseudo-piety, \nbut with eyes wide open as an act of intelligent, thoughtful worship. \nYour mind's engaged, and not on hold. That's what Paul says. He goes \non: \"Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mold, \nbut let God remold your minds from within, so that you may prove in \npractice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all his demands, \nand moves toward the goal of true maturity\" (Romans 12:1-3; Phillips).\u0014\n\u0014\nThink about that call to nonconformity. Think about that call to \ntransformation. Think of that in the context of a choice you have \nmade and have to make. That tension simply will not go away; it will \nnot easily be resolved, and we, like all faithful Christians and \nhonest citizens throughout all time, will have to live with it and \nthrough it. If we are uncomfortable in this conflict of values, we \nare meant to be uncomfortable. The easy syllogism, that we go to war \nin order to keep the peace, ought not to comfort us or our Christian \npresident. It is that same alleged \"moral clarity\" that led to the \ninfamous Vietnam logic. Perhaps you will remember it, that we had to \ndestroy the village in order to \"save\" it. If that is \"moral \nclarity,\" then I am Peter Rabbit.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, my beloved friends, we are not without guidance or hope. Many, \nand perhaps some of you, will argue: Who are we to challenge the \nmoral clarity and vision of our government, of people who presumably \nknow more than we do, and who have the awful duty not only to protect \nand to serve, but to anticipate and to initiate? Who are we to kibitz \nfrom the sidelines without access to secret briefings, intelligence, \nknowledge, and all of the apparatus of government? Well, who, indeed, \nare we?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not require degrees from the Kennedy School or the Wharton \nSchool to have an opinion about the moral future of our country. In \nfact, it has usually been the so-called experts who have managed to \nget us into wars in the first place. We have a duty to speak, to \ndissent, and to demand a better case for compromising our most \nfundamental principles as Christians and citizens than has thus far \nbeen made. As a citizen I demand a better excuse than revenge, or \noil, for the prosecution of a war that is likely to do more harm than \ngood, that will destabilize not only the region but the world for \nyears to come, and that, worst of all, will confirm for all the world \nto see our country's reputation as an irrational and undisciplined \nbully who acts not because it ought, but because it can; we make up \nthe rules, so it seems, as we please. I love my country too much to \nsee it complicit in its own worst stereotype. Right after Sept. 11 a \nyear ago, we asked, in some agonizing perplexity, \"Why do they hate \nus?\" Remember that question? Well, if we persist in making war the \nfirst rather than the last option, we will soon find out. The answer \nwill be all too terribly manifest.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know that in the mighty roar of wisdom, might, and riches, the \nsounds of love, justice, and righteousnessthose things in which God \ndelights, and in which God's people are meant to delightsound thin, \nfeeble, and anemic. Yet my Christian conscience tells me that these \n\"soft\" values should prevail every time over the \"hard,\" even though \nthey often do not. If I am compelled to compromise those Christian \nvalues in the service of the state, I had better be as certain as is \nhumanly possible that such a compromise is worth sacrificing the \nthings I hold most precious; and I certainly won't know that, nor \nwill you, unless there is a great deal more thoughtful discussion, \ndebate, and dissent than there has been so far.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt pleases me to join with other religious leaders who are beginning \nto speak and be heard on behalf of a thoughtful case for peace and to \nengage in a rigorous debate. Religious opinion is by no means \nunanimous: those evangelicals who have found little fault with \nanything that this administration has done or proposes to do, and who \nseldom met a war they didn't like, lined up to be counted on the \npresident's side.\u0014\n\u0014\nPOLLS SHOW that most Americans, frustrated, alas, by the ephemeral \ncharacter of the \"war on terrorism\" and still angry and confused \nabout Sept. 11, 2001, want to do something. As we know, however, in \nangry, vengeful moments, the desire to do \"something\" is easily \ntranslated into the will to do \"anything,\" and that \"anything\" may \nvery well be the wrong thing. Bombing Iraq into oblivion as payback \nto those who have done us injury at this moment seems to me to be the \nwrong thing to do. Polls do not get at the truth. Thirty-five years \nago, most polls showed significant majorities in favor of whatever it \nwas we were doing in Vietnam, and eventually the majority in favor \nconcluded that the minority opposed were, in fact, right. Polls \nsimply tell us where we are, not where we ought to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gospel, however, does tell us where we ought to be, tough, \nuntenable, and difficult as that place may be. Love, justice, and \nrighteousness are superior to wisdom, might, and riches. How often do \nwe have to be told that? \"And these are God's words,\" says Paul at \nthe end of Romans 12: \"If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, \ngive him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon \nhis head.\" Don't allow yourself to be overpowered with evil: Take the \noffensive and overpower evil with good. That is what Paul is saying: \nTake the offensive: Overpower evil with good! Now that is a radical \nforeign policy. That would scare the bejesus out of a lot of people, \nto know that with all of our power we decided that we were going to \noverpower evil with goodand what a topsy-turvy world this would be! \nThat should give all the hawks in Washington something to think \nabout, that if they want us to be noticed, the world would notice us \nif we took seriously the idea of overpowering evil with good.\u0014\n\u0014\nNurse Cavell was right: \"Patriotism is not enough.\" If we wish to be \non God's side rather than making God into our own ally of American \nrealpolitik, then we would do well to remember our text from \nJeremiah. God's values are clear; so too ought ours to be. If you \nlove the Lord, you will love the things the Lord loves. There is no \nother way around it.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Peter Gomes is Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey \nMinister at The Memorial Church of Harvard University.

People, \nvigilantes, terrorists do not wage just wars; only a legitimate \ngovernment is permitted to wage a war that can be considered \njustified. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war can only be fought to redress wrongs that have been \ncommitted. A first strike attack on a nation that has committed no \natrocities cannot be considered justice; that's aggression. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war can only be fought with \"right\" intentions. War is not \njustified to gain control of another nation, it's assets or it's \npeople. If the right intention for going to war is not present, \njustice is not present. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war can only be fought if there is a reasonable chance of \nsuccess. Deaths and injury incurred in a hopeless cause are not \nmorally justifiable. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war can only be fought if the ultimate goal is to \nre-establish peace. More specifically, war is not justified if the \nsituation in a country cannot be reasonably expected to be better \nafter the war than before. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war must never allow the force used to be disproportional to \nthe need. Nations must be prohibited from using force not necessary \nto attain the limited objective of addressing the wrongs that have \nbeen committed. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tA just war must employ weapons and tactics that discriminate \nbetween combatants and non-combatants. Innocent civilians are never \npermissible targets of war, and war can only be just if every effort \nis made to avoid civilian casualties.\u0014",

    "title": "PRESIDENT PLAYS THE \"CHRISTIAN\" TRUMP CARD",
    "words": "President Bush often reminds me of a first year seminary student who, \nafter one course in theology, thinks his particular view of faith \nanswers all of life's most complex problems. As a Baptist minister \nfor over 40 years, I hold sacred the beliefs and mora! principles \ninherent in my faith, yet as a Christian I can tell you the President \ndoes not always speak for me, nor can he claim to speak for all \nChristians in America. Christians like all other people of faith are \nincredibly diverse in their thoughts and political ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as religious leaders must refrain from trying to dictate the \npolitical beliefs of their congregants, political leaders must dis- \ndain the misguided illusion that they speak as prophets of God's \nwill. It is not remotely within the realm of the President's \nexecutive duties to voice and advance particular sectarian priorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet at this week's National Religious Broadcasters convention, the \nPresident sat by and listened approvingly to himself being described \nas God's chosen man for this hour in our nation. He then made one \nstatement that I find deeply disturbing: he linked an imminent \nAmerican attack on Iraq to his understanding of Christian morality, \nsaying that this attack would be, \"in the highest mora! traditions of \nour country.\" How can he say that when for four centuries Chris- \ntians refused to serve in the military?\u0014\nThe President of the United States is the political leader of the \nnation, not the reli- gious leader. Just as religion should not be a \ntest for any political candidate for public office, religion should \nnot be a tool of any political leader in a public office. In no w;iy \nshould the President of the United States \u0014\npoliticize religion, or by the use of religious language from one \nparticular religious tradi- tion, alienate citizens from other \ntraditions or no tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe distinction that I see between the language in President Bush's \nstatements and the kind of historic civil religion that had \npreviously existed in America, is that Presi- dent Bush is drawing \nfrom a very particular faith tradition, Evangelical Christianity, and \nis using that language to advance policies and to make arguments for \nthe support of his various initiatives.'\u0014\n\u0014\nThat language, whether used in state- ments to comfort, challenge, or \nguide the nation, leaves out whole segments of Americans who don't \nunderstand its meaning and who don't identify with, or in many \ninstances even agree with, its substance.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing this language, the President has escalated every issue to a \nkind of transcendental religiously-morally  substantive subject. \nThrough this language, the President is telling people who disagree \nwith or question his public policies that these are not just \npolitical issues, these are moral issues. That's akin to playing the \nChristian trump card.\u0014\n\u0014\nDemocracy has been crippled. No longer can Americans practice healthy \ndebate. By employing this language, the President has succeeded in \nframing every American who questions his policies as opposing good, \ngood that ought to triumph over evil. When everything is absolutized \nin this way, debate stops: the moment there is a difference of \nopinion it's not just another idea, it's an expression of evil.\u0014\nHow dare any politician, including the President, even implicitly \nsuggest that God is a kind of mascot for the nation. Affinnation of a \nparticular faith tradition must never be made a litmus test for \nmeasuring patriotism.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dr. Welton Gaddy, March, 2003, The Interfaith Alliance\u0014",

    "title": "PHOENIX BISHOP ADMITS MOVING ACCUSED PRIESTS",
    "words": "June 3, 2003   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nPhoenix Bishop Admits Moving Accused Priests\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLIE LeDUFF\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Catholic bishop of Phoenix, Thomas J. O'Brien, has signed \nan agreement admitting that he knew of accusations of sexual abuse by \npriests but transferred them without telling their new superiors or \nparishioners, an Arizona prosecutor said yesterday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn exchange for his admission, the bishop will avoid prosecution, the \nMaricopa County prosecutor, Richard M. Romley, said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Romley also said that his yearlong grand jury investigation into \naccusations of sexual misconduct in the Phoenix diocese had ended in \nindictments of six priests for abuse of children and that indictments \nmight come against two more priests.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Mr. Romley said there was no evidence that Bishop O'Brien, the \nspiritual leader of more than 400,000 Catholics, had engaged in \ncriminal sexual misconduct, the agreement states that the bishop \nfailed to protect the victims of such misconduct by others employed \nby the diocese. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost important, Mr. Romley said, was an 82-word admission from the \nbishop apologizing for his mishandling of the accusations by \nshuffling the priests into new assignments.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop O'Brien, who agreed to surrender authority in sexual abuse \ncases, did not respond to requests for comment. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a separate statement released yesterday, he did not apologize for \nhis mistakes but said he would dedicate himself to the protection of \nchildren in his churches and schools.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This has been a very difficult time for our entire diocese, for me, \nfor our priests, and especially for the victims of sexual \nmisconduct,\" the bishop wrote, adding, \"Several of the most \nsignificant provisions that are included in the agreement with the \ncounty attorney were initiated by the diocese and are already being \nimplemented.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the arrangement, which calls for an overhaul in the way the \ndiocese deals with accusations of sexual misconduct, Bishop O'Brien \nwill be granted immunity from prosecution for failing to report the \nabuses over his 22-year tenure or from any charges of covering up \nthose abuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince a sex scandal erupted last year within the American Catholic \nChurch, five bishops have resigned in disgrace, including Cardinal \nBernard F. Law, the archbishop of Boston, after it was revealed that \nhe had protected scores of priests who later went on to abuse again. \nThough some priests have been indicted, no bishop or cardinal has.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Phoenix agreement is similar to one signed in December by Bishop \nJohn B. McCormack of Manchester, N.H. In that deal, Bishop McCormack \nadmitted that the government had enough evidence to convict the \ndiocese for child endangerment.\u0014\n\u0014\nvery public way the diocese will be forced to operate. Among the 14 \nconcessions agreed to by Bishop O'Brien is the appointment of a \nmoderator of the curia, essentially a chief of staff who could handle \ndaily operations of the diocese.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop will also appoint an independent youth protection advocate \nwho will oversee accusations of sexual misconduct past and present \nand report them to the appropriate civil authorities. The bishop may \nnot be involved with the advocate, under penalty of prosecution, Mr. \nRomley said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe diocese will also be responsible for establishing a victims \ncompensation fund that is to be used for treatment and counseling. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why did I choose immunity in turn for an agreement?\" Mr. Romley \nasked. \"The No. 1 priority is to stop abuse and protect children in \nthe future. Those who actually committed crimes were charged \nyesterday. In all likelihood, the bishop would have remained even if \nI had charged him. What I'm trying to do is build a framework where \nthe church culture changes  at least here in Phoenix.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop revealed late last year that at least 50 church leaders in \nthe diocese has been accused of inappropriate sexual contact with \nminors. The bishop then vowed to play an active role in cleaning up \nthe diocese in the face of the scandal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Romley said yesterday that despite the bishop's promise of \ncooperation, his response to requests for information was slow and \ngrudging. He said that though he had uncovered evidence of \nobstruction of justice, an indictment against the bishop would have \nbeen counterproductive. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Obstruction of justice is a low-level felony that more than likely \nwould have meant probation,\" Mr. Romley said. \"We had been told that \neven if the bishop had wanted to resign, Rome would not allow it. \nThat is, if he had been indicted, he would remain. The simple fact is \nwe are moving forward.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome observers said the bishop's actions and apology appeared to be a \nlegal tactic to prevent an onslaught of criminal charges against \nother American bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is a melancholy day when a bishop has to cop a plea,\" said Eugene \nKennedy, a former priest who is a professor emeritus of psychology at \nLoyola University in Chicago. \"He is doing what he must do in order \nto avoid being indicted. It is a graceless maneuver, and the human \ntransaction will satisfy no one.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Romley said that he had evidence that Bishop O'Brien had \ncounseled families who had contended abuse, and told them not to \nreport their suspicions to the authorities. He had promised to deal \nwith the accused clergy internally. That did not seem to happen, Mr. \nRomley said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of Those \nAbused by Priests, said the bishop's ability to avoid criminal \nprosecution did little to protect children and even less to get a \nfull accounting of past sins. \"The one untested approach  criminal \ncharges against a bishop  were dropped,\" Mr. Clohessy said with a \nheave of sadness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the priests indicted yesterday were Patrick O. Colleary, \ncharged with three felonies in connection with sodomy with a boy \nunder 15, and Lawrence J. Lovell, charged with sexual contact and \nmolestation of a child.\u0014",

    "words": "Author Phil Callaway Learns about Fatherhood\u0014\n\u0014\n    May 31, 1986, was a Saturday. My friends played softball that \nday. I paced a hospital hallway with my wife. At least I think it  \nwas my wife. Whereas Ramona had always been rather sweet and \nsoft-spoken, this woman was more like Attila the Hun in a hospital \ngown. \u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Rub my back,\" she commanded.\u0014\n\u0014\n    I pulled out the tennis ball. \u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Don't touch me!\" She hollered.\u0014\n\u0014\n    This continued for what seemed like 14 days, until I found myself \nface to face with my firstborn son. Sure, he was a little wrinkly, \nbut who could blame him? I held him close. I touched his tiny \nfingers, and counted his toesall ten of them. I looked  into his \neyes. They were blue. Like mine.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Then the most amazing thing happened. A revival, I suppose. As I \nlooked into those blue eyes, it was as if I heard these words: \n\"Callaway, for the first 25 years of your life you've been a \nhypocrite. You've been close to the church but far from God.\u0014\n\u0014\n    You are holding in your arms the one person you'll never be able \nto hide it from. If you think this little guy won't see it, you're \nnaive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    People ask me when I became a Christian, and I say May 31, 1986. \nYou see, that night for the first time in my life, I bowed my head \nand said, \"Dear God, I'm sorry. Make me real. I want my precious \nlittle boy to hunger and thirst after righteousness.\u0014\n    \u0014\nIf he won't learn to from me, he has two strikes against him \nalready.\" I meant every word.\u0014\n\u0014\n    It's been slow-going sometimes, but I believe God heard that \nprayer. Five years later this same little boy looked up at me one \nnight and said, \"Daddy, I wanna be like you,\" and tears came to my \neyes. \u0014\n\u0014\n    I don't have all the child-rearing answers for you. But I do know \nthis: If you want your child to love God, love Him first. If you want \nyour son to obey, be obedient to the still small voice of God. If you \nwant to change your life to change for good, have  children.

    "title": "PRIMARY SOURCES - WHAT DO THE EVANGELISTS TELL",
    "words": "Primary Sources\u0014\nWhat type of history do the four Evangelists tell, and what does it \nreveal about Jesus?\u0014\nby Ben Witherington III\u0014\n\u0014\nNo modern biographer would ignore all of Jesus' early life, as Mark \ndoes, or skip over his formative experiences as a young adult, as all \nGospels but Luke do (Luke 2:41-52). Nor would a modern biographer of \nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy, for example, spend half of his account on \njust the last week of his subject's life, even if the person died \ntragically. And most modern historical works at least attempt to \npresent themselves as reasonably objective.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the authors of the four Gospels broke all these rules, especially \nthe last. They were not disinterested observers of Jesus and his \nmovement. No author who launches his work with the phrase \"The \nbeginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God\" is \npretending to write as a neutral reporter.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the Gospels are not like modern works of history, neither are they \nlike folklore. The time gap between the death of Jesus and the \nwriting of the Jesus traditions (between 30 and 60 years) is too \nshort to consider the Gospels as mere legends or folklore, which \nalways have long gestation periods.\u0014\nIf they are neither modern biographies nor legends, what type of \nhistory do these Gospels contain? What do they reveal about Jesus? I \nbelieve upon close reading that three of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, \nand John) are ancient biographies, and one (Luke) presents itself as \nan ancient history.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevealing character\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospels were not written to give a chronology of Jesus' ministry \nas much as to reveal who he was. Even markers that seem to be precise \nwere only devices to move the narrative along. Mark, for example, \nfrequently uses the term immediately in transitions, but he usually \nonly means \"after that.\"\u0014\nThe authors did not have access to the extensive sources available \ntoday; besides, they were more interested in presenting what was \ntypical and revealing of a person than in giving a blow-by-blow \nchronicle of each year of a person's life. So ancient biographies \nwere anecdotal by necessity.\u0014\nFurthermore, most ancients did not believe a person's character \ndeveloped over time. Character was viewed as fixed at birth, \ndetermined by factors such as gender, generation, and geography; it \nwas revealed gradually but consistently. Ancients also believed that \nhow one died was especially revealing of one's true character. This \nis one reason the Gospel writers spent so many words recounting \nJesus' last week.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne feature of the Gospels that troubles some modern readers is their \nlack of chronological precision, but this is typical of ancient \nbiographies. Again, the focus is on the persons involved and what \nthey did, not on the space-time coordinates of the event.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' cleansing of the temple provides a fine illustration. While \nall four Gospels record only one cleansing, the fourth Gospel places \nthis event near the outset, while the Synoptics (Matthew, Mark, Luke) \nplace it during Passion week. A modern reader may think Jesus \ncleansed the temple twice. But this interpretation overlooks two \npoints: (1) ancient readers would have concluded there was only one \ncleansing since no Gospel includes two such events; (2) the ancient \naudience was aware that a biographer had freedom to arrange his \nmaterial in whatever fashion he felt most revealing of his subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this case, the fourth Evangelist wished to stress at the outset \nhow Jesus replaced the institutions of Judaism with himself (e.g., he \nis God's Torah or Word, he is the temple, he is the source of new \nlife and purity). Many ancient biographies, such as Plutarch's \nParallel Lives or Tacitus's Agricola, were likewise more interested \nin events that reveal character than in a strict chronological record.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some ancient historical (versus biographical) works, especially in \nthe Greek tradition, there was more attention to chronology. This \nhelps explain the \"synchronisms\" in Luke 3:1-2 or Acts 18:2. A \nsynchronism tries to locate an event in divine history in relation to \nsecular events, like the reign of a certain governor. Thus Luke-Acts \nwould have seemed to ancients to be less biographical and more \nhistorical in character.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can we depend on?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of historical information, then, do the Gospels give about \nJesus?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the Gospel accounts (especially Matthew, Mark, and John), \npresent a good deal about Jesus' character and how he was evaluated \nby his contemporaries. These character sketches, however, are largely \nindirect, and let Jesus' words and deeds speak for themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the Gospel writers presented what they deemed were the \nsalient facts readers absolutely must know to understand Jesus' \nmission, person, and work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, these writers presented this information in a broadly \nchronological way (e.g., Jesus' birth obviously came before his \nministry, and his ministry before his death), but they were not \nconcerned with chronological minutiae (except, perhaps, in parts of \nLuke).\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, this literature was written by and for a special communitya \ntiny minority in the Roman Empireso they could know more about their \nSavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospels also appear to have been written, in at least the case of \nthe last three Gospels, for audiences that had inadequate knowledge \nof Jesus' Jewish world, including the meaning of Aramaic words (Mark \n15:34; John 19:13) and Jewish customs (Mark 7:3).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case of the fourth Gospel, the audience was not expected to \nhave personally known the characters in the story (see John 11:2, \n12:4,6). The Gospels, then, were by and large written for non-Jewish \nconverts to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven all this, what can the discipline of history, using the Gospels \nas the main source, tell us about Jesus?\u0014\n\u0014\nA birth that needed explaining\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was born somewhere between 4 and 6 B.C. It might seem strange \nto suggest that Jesus was born \"before Christ,\" but this is due to an \nearly miscalculation when in A.D. 525 Pope John I ordered a new \ncalendar that would be reckoned from Christ's birth. Regardless of \nthe numbers, the Gospel accounts are clear that Jesus was born during \nthe reign of Herod the Great, who died before this new calendar had \nbegun counting the new era. In fact, Matthew 2:1-12 (where Jesus' \nfamily flees to Egypt until Herod dies) suggests Jesus was born some \ntime before Herod's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remarkable story of the virginal conception is found in two \ndifferent accounts: Matthew 1:18-25 and Luke 1:26-38. What is most \nremarkable about these stories is that they try to account for \nsomething extraordinary that, so far as we can tell, Jews were not \nexpectinga Messiah coming into the world by means of a virginal \nconception.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah 7:14 in the Hebrew simply says, \"Behold, the nubile young \nwoman is with child and will bear a son,\" though the later Greek \nversion says, \"The virgin will be with child, and will give birth to \na son.\" Still, it was not necessary to conclude that a miraculous \nconception was involved, only that a woman who had, up to that point, \nbeen a virgin, would now conceive. In other words, it was the anomaly \nof what happened at Jesus' origins, not the Old Testament text, that \nled early Christians to search the Scriptures for an explanation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a minimum, the historical conclusion is that Jesus' origins were \nunusual. It seems unlikely that early Christians would invent a story \nabout a virginal conception knowing it would inevitably lead to \ncharges that Jesus was illegitimate (a charge in fact we find in the \nthird-century debate between Celsus the Jew and Origen, and one \nperhaps hinted at in Mark 6:3 and John 8:41). It was enough that \ntheir Savior had a scandalous death; early Christian writers were not \nlooking to add more implausibility to the account.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe facts of youth\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the Gospel writers, with the exception of the story in Luke \n2:41-52 (Jesus talking with teachers in the temple), said nothing of \nJesus' youth, four things we know with a high degree of certainty.\u0014\nIt seems unlikely Christians would invent a story about a virginal \nconception knowing it would inevitably lead to charges that Jesus was \nillegitamate.. First, Jesus grew up in a devout Jewish home. This is \nsuggested by the birth narratives: Joseph is described as \"a \nrighteous man;\" the family went to Jerusalem for the rites of \npurification after the birth; they attended Jewish festivals (Luke \n2:41-52, John 7:2-5). By the time Jesus began his ministry, he knew \nthe Hebrew Scriptures: he frequently quoted them in his discussions \nand debates and was even asked to read them in his hometown synagogue.\u0014\nSecond, Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a backwater town in Galilee. No \nhistorical scholar doubts this. It was not the kind of thing Jesus' \nadmiring biographers would make up, for no one was looking for a \nMessiah who came from Nazareth; indeed no one was looking for one who \ncame from Galilee in general (John 1:46).\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, in addition to knowing Hebrew, Jesus spoke Aramaic (a Semitic \ncousin of Hebrew) as his native tongue. It is also likely he knew at \nleast some Greek (enough to deal with a centurion and a toll \ncollector). Our earliest Gospel (Mark) stresses that Jesus prayed in \nAramaic (15:34) and even used the Aramaic form of the word father \n(Abba, Mark 14:36) to address God. Jesus regularly identified himself \nto others using the Aramaic phrase bar enasha (\"Son of Man\"), an \nallusion to the figure spoken of in Daniel 7, one of the Aramaic \nchapters of the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, Jesus grew up in an artisan's home. The traditions emphasize \nthat Jesus was the son of an artisan, a carpenter, and may have been \nan artisan himself. Jesus was therefore not a peasant in the normal \nsense of that term (a poor person who makes his living by farming). \nHe had a trade, which would have been considered an honorable thing \nin a Jewish or lower income Greco-Roman context (though the social \nelite of the Greco-Roman world looked down on anybody who worked with \ntheir hands).\u0014\n\u0014\nA prophet, and then some\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was about 30 years old when he began his public ministry (Luke \n3:23), and the four Gospels imply his ministry lasted from one to \nthree years (the latter is more probable). The Gospels, as ancient \nworks, are interested in discerning the character of Jesus and his \nministry, and they accomplish this by showing Jesus in relationships \nwith various people and movements of his times.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, there was his relationship with the prophet John, also known \nas \"the Baptist,\" which reveals something of Jesus' relationship to \nall Jewish prophets.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll four Gospels explain that the ministries of John and Jesus were \nclosely related. It is also clear that Jesus had great admiration for \nJohn and frequently compared himself and his ministry to John's (Mark \n11:27-33; Matt. 11:16-19). There may also have even been a period of \njoint or closely parallel ministry (John 3:22-4:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nMost important, Jesus submitted to baptism at John's hands, which not \nonly validated John's ministry but was a \"watershed\" event for Jesus. \nAs for its historicity, the Gospel writers clearly would not have \nmade up a story about Jesus' submitting to John's baptism: the \nbaptism of a sinless Messiah (Heb. 4:15) was only another problem to \nhave to explain.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the baptism, Jesus, like other Jewish prophets, had a \nconfirming vision and received an anointing from God for ministry. \nThis call was unique, however, in that Jesus heard himself called \nGod's Son, and he later responded by calling God Abba, a term of \nintimate familiarity. The Gospel writers suggested that Jesus' \nministry was a confirmation and fulfillment of all prophetic \ncallings. God's final saving and judging activity was on the horizon, \nand God's people needed to be prepared. They needed to repent.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, Jesus' ministry was more extensive than that of other \nprophets: he reached out to the rejected of society; he dined with \ntax collectors and notable sinners. While John, like other prophets, \nwas something of an ascetic, Jesus was a convivial attender of \nparties and banquets (Mark 2:18-20; cf. John 2:1-12; Luke 19:1-9).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' public utterances were another way in which he transcended the \ncharacter of the Old Testament prophets, who prefaced their \nprophecies with \"this is what the Lord says.\" Jesus spoke on his own \nauthority, and the Gospels also suggest that in an extraordinary \ngesture, he affirmed the truthfulness of his own teaching in advance \nby prefacing it with \"I tell you the truth\" (Mark 14:18, 30; Luke \n23:43; John 3:5, 5:19).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe well-known story of John's beheading (Mark 6:14-29) suggests that \nanyone with a following would have been considered a threat by Roman \nand Jewish authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nProphets and messianic pretenders made those in power nervous. In \nthis environment, it is not surprising that Jesus' ministry was a \nshort one. What is surprising, historically speaking, is that it \nlasted as long as it did. Jesus, like John, was seen as a political \nthreat, even if he did not cast himself as a leader of some sort of \nrevolt or protest movement (Luke 13:31-32).\u0014\n\u0014\nInner circle\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four Gospels further portray Jesus' character by showing his \nrelationships with his own disciples, both men and women (it is \nrevealing that he dared, in an apparently unprecedented move, to have \nwomen followers in his itinerant groupLuke 8:1-3). That Jesus chose \n12 is attested not only in the Gospels but in the earliest letters of \nPaul (1 Cor. 15:5). Jesus did not include himself among those 12, \nwhich suggests he saw himself not as a part of a reconstituted Israel \nbut as a shepherd or leader of a new Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' relationship with his family is also revealing. A number of \nstories suggest his family did not fully understand him (Mark \n3:21,31-35; John 2:1-12 and 7:4-5 and Luke 2:41-52). Indeed, the \nevidence suggests Jesus believed the coming of God's final dominion \nmeant primary loyalty was owed to an alternative family, the family \nof faith (Mark 3:31-35). Jesus called disciples away from their \nfamilies and warned that physical families would be divided over him. \nIt is hardly likely that the early church made up a saying like \nMatthew 10:34 (\"I have come to turn a man against his father\"). This \nsuggests that Jesus may well have been too radical for many in his \nown day who wanted to ground religion in family ties.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid he know he was the Messiah?\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo themes most characterized Jesus' preaching: his announcement that \nGod's saving reign was happening through his ministry, and that he \nwas the \"Son of Man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the Gospels agree Jesus used this phrase to describe himself. It \nhas strong claims of going back to Jesus himself, rather than being \nsomething the early church put on his lips. In Paul's letters and in \nthe Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is called \"Christ\" or \"Lord.\" Son of \nMan was not a title the early church usually used to refer to Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn combination with the phrase \"Kingdom of God,\" Son of Man suggests \nJesus saw himself in light of the prophecy found in Daniel 7, where \none like a \"son of man\" was promised an eternal kingdom. Furthermore, \nthe Daniel text stresses not just the humanness of this figure but \nalso his more-than-mortal character, for he is said to be destined to \nreign forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome historians debate whether it was possible for Jesus to have \nbelieved such a thing about himself. Yet many messianic pretenders \nand contenders of the times (including Theudas and Judas the \nGalileanActs 5:35-39), made such claims for themselves. Why couldn't \nJesus have done the same?\u0014\nRemarkable week\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel writers spent their greatest efforts on the last week of \nJesus' life, largely to explain how a good man was crucified. The \nfollowing events, historically speaking, transpired:\u0014\nActions and words by Jesus in the outer precincts of the temple \nprovoked Jewish authorities to begin the process that led to Jesus' \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus shared a final meal with his inner circle in which he \nforewarned the disciples about his demise but interpreted the event \nas connected to the redemption of God's people, as the Exodus-Sinai \nevents celebrated at Passover had been.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was captured in the garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives \n(a frequent camping spot for pilgrims) as a result of a tip off by \nJudas, one of Jesus' inner circle.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pre-trial hearing, and possibly a hastily convened ad hoc trial by \nJewish authorities, resulted in the handing over of Jesus to Pontius \nPilate, the Roman governor.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Roman trial was held, after which Jesus was executed on the eve of \nPassover on Friday, April 7, A.D. 30, on a hill called Golgotha, \noutside the city gates of Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was buried in a Judean sympathizer's tomb near the site of the \ncrucifixion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn empty tomb was discovered the following Sunday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nVarious followers of Jesus claimed to have seen Jesus alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Jesus' shameful death is treated as something positive \nneeds to be explained. Jesus' earliest followers were Jews, and there \nis no hard evidence that first-century Jews were looking for a \ncrucified Messiah. Nor did Gentiles see such a death in a positive \nlight. It seems reasonable to conclude that there must indeed have \nbeen a rather remarkable sequel to this crucifixion to cause these \nGospel writers and early Christians to diligently search the \nScriptures looking for clues that would explain each aspect of Jesus' \nlast week.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, it is not believable that the early churchin a \npatriarchal age in which women were not usually considered credible \nwitnesseswould have invented a story about women being the first to \nsee the empty tomb and the risen Jesus. This was not how someone in \nantiquity would construct a myth to win friends and persuade people.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn ancient would begin by supplying credible male witnesses, then add \nan impartial third party who could not be accused of wishful thinking \nor being delusional after the loss of their hero. A propagandist \nwould also want to describe in detail the crucial event \nitselfremarkably, something not one of the four Gospels does.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom a historical point of view, an adequate explanation must be \ngiven for the exquisite and extensive acclamations of Jesus after his \ndeath. There were many prophets, sages, and messianic pretenders who \nwalked the stage of the Holy Land before and after Jesus, but none \nspawned a world religion. Many charismatic Jewish leaders had died in \nmore heroic fashion (e.g. some of the Maccabees), yet they did not \ncreate new forms of Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven looking at the deeds and words of Jesus, one is hard pressed to \nfind the basis of later acclamations: Jesus' miracles were not \nunprecedented; his words, while remarkable in themselves, would not \nlikely have started a Jesus movement among Jews, especially in light \nof his crucifixion. His relationships suggested a good deal about \nJesus, but were they sufficient to have created the \"Good News of \nJesus Christ, Son of God\"? I doubt it.\u0014\n\u0014\nExplaining the resurrection\u0014\n\u0014\nI am therefore left with the conclusion that the end of Jesus' life \nand immediate sequel to his death must explain both the shape of the \nGospels and the rise of early Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not an accident that in the earliest source about Jesus and \nearly Christianity, Paul's letters, the focus is on Jesus crucified \nand risen (Paul is the only once-hostile witness to have claimed to \nhave seen the risen Jesus). To Paul, it seems, knowing Jesus' deeds \nand words was secondary to knowing his death and resurrection: \"For \nwhat I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that \nChrist died for our sins . . . that he was buried, that he was raised \non the third day\" (1 Cor. 15:3-4).\u0014\nNo, the Gospels aren't modern biographies or modern histories, but \nthe modern historian can still learn a great deal about Jesus' life \nand times from them. Most importantly, I believe they reveal why \nJesus, who had been known as the Son of Man during his life, came to \nbe known, shortly after his death, as the risen Son of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBen Witherington is professor of New Testament at Asbury Theological \nSeminary in Kentucky. He is author of the highly praised The Jesus \nQuest: The Third Search for the Historical Jesus (InterVarsity, 1997).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Humane Side of \"the Extreme Penalty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe philosopher Cicero said crucifixion was \"the most cruel and \nhideous of punishments.\" Others just called it \"the extreme penalty.\" \nAs such, Rome reserved it for the worst elements of society: \nmurderers, revolutionaries, and slaves. Contrary to popular \ndepictions, Jesus was probably crucified, as in this picture, without \nany covering and in this cramped position.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough designed to be a slow and painful death (and thus a \ndeterrent), some practices were instituted to make it more humane. \nThe condemned were usually first stripped, tied to a post, and given \n39 lashes with a short whip that held tiny, lead balls that would \nbite into the flesh and cause bleedingto hasten death once on the \ncross. Breaking the legs of the crucified, which constricted the \nchest and lungs and made breathing finally impossible, was another \nmeans of bringing death on more quickly.\u0014\nWithout such measures, victims would hang in agony for days on end.\u0014\nMark Galli\u0014\n\u0014\nMore resources:\u0014\nBen Witherington III is the author of The Jesus Quest, an excellent \nlook at today's research from an evangelical perspective. From the \nJesus Seminar to N.T. Wright, Witherington examines and critiques the \nmany ways scholars have interpreted Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis latest book, to be published in November, is The Paul Quest: The \nRenewed Search for the Jew of Tarsus, which you can preorder at \nAmazon.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has also written many fascinating books on the roles of women in \nJesus' ministry and in the early days of the Christian church. These \ninclude Women and the Genesis of Christianity, Women in the Earliest \nChurches, and Women in the Ministry of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nLinks:\u0014\nWitherington's Jesus Quest was reviewed in several publications, \nincluding First Things.\u0014\nThe most recent quest has received a lot of press. U.S. News has \ncovered it often, with articles like \"In Search of Jesus\", \"Who Was \nJesus?\" (for which they had a special online chat session), and \"Bob \nFunk's Radical Reformation Roadshow\" (about the Jesus Seminar's \npublicity attempts).\u0014\nTime has of course covered the Jesus Seminar as well, in their \narticle \"The Gospel Truth?\"\u0014\nThe Atlantic's article, \"The Search for a No-Frills Jesus,\" by \nCharlotte Allen, is interesting too.\u0014\nTraditionalist Christians have been vocal but reasoned in their \nresponse, such as in this article by Craig L. Blomberg: \"The \nSeventy-Four 'Scholars': Who Does the Jesus Seminar Really Speak For?\"\u0014\nIn 1996, Harper SanFrancisco published an e-mail debate exploring the \nsignificance of the historical Jesus for Christian faith. The \nseven-week debate took place between John Dominic Crossan and Marcus \nBorg, both members of the Jesus Seminar, and Luke Timothy Johnson, \nthe Seminar's foremost critic. Even after the seven weeks, the \nconversation continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1998 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christian History.\u0014\nIssue 59, Summer 1998, Vol. XVII, No. 3, Page 12\u0014",

    "title": "PETER THE GREAT, BY LINDSEY HUGHES -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "\u0014\n                         For centuries, it was widely held that \nprivate life was irrelevant to the chronicles of great men. Voltaire \ninsisted that the\u0014\n                         transactions ofpublic life were more \nimportant than the secrets of his cabinet, his bed or his table. \nWhile this\u0014\n                         approach is suitable for those rare few who \nsingle-mindedly dedicated themselves to pursuing public goals to the\u0014\n                         exclusion of all else, it does not work when \nconsidering the extraordinary career of Peter the Greatthe man \ncredited\u0014\n                         with bringing civilization to Russiawhose \nlife was filled with great achievement, personal drama, and bizarre \nincident. \u0014\n\u0014\n                         There have been many biographies of Peter, \nbut most have failed to strike a balance between the public man and \nthe\u0014\n                         real private Peter. Lindsey Hughes, one of \nthe leading historians of 18th-century Russia, succeeds brilliantly \nwith Peter\u0014\n                         the Great: A Biography, a slimmed-down, \nthoroughly engaging version of her great work, Russia in the Age of \nPeter the\u0014\n                         Great. Drawing on his letters, papers, and \nother contemporary accounts, she provides new insights into Peters \ncomplex\u0014\n                         character as well as his actions, \ndeliberations, possessions, and significant fantasy worldhis many \ndisguises and\u0014\n                         pseudonyms, his interest in dwarfs, his \nclowning and vandalism. It also sheds fresh light on his relationship \nwith his\u0014\n                         second wife, Catherine, and his closest \nfriend, Alexander Menshikov.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Hughes never loses sight of the context \nwithin which Peter made his crucial decisions, from the building of \nan entirely\u0014\n                         new capital city, St. Petersburg, to the \nconduct of the decades long war against Sweden for control of \nnortheast Europe.\u0014\n                         She also discusses Peters image, focusing \non key portraits in painting and sculpture, his legacy, and \ncommemoration\u0014\n                         from his death to the present in buildings, \ngalleries, museums, and anniversary celebrations.  \u0014\n\u0014\n                         Peter was a study in mind-boggling \ncontrasts: He was the absolute ruler of one of the biggest countries \nin the world, but\u0014\n                         he married an illiterate peasant woman and \ndeferred to a mock sovereign known as Prince-Caesar. The hero of \nPoltava\u0014\n                         and founder of the Russian navy numbered \namong his hobbies extracting teeth, performing autopsies, \nwood-turning, and\u0014\n                         fire-fighting.

Asked \nwhy by the rider, he retorted with great dignity, \"Sir, I am a \ncorporal!\" The stranger apologized, dismounted, and proceeded to help \nthe exhausted soldiers. The job done, he turned to the corporal and \nsaid, \"Corporal, next time you have a job like this and not enough \nmen to do it, go to your commander-in-chief, and I will come and help \nyou again.\" With that George Washington got back on horse and rode \noff.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere did Washington learn such leadership skills? I have no doubt he \nlearned them here. In these words of Jesus: Whoever wants to become \ngreat among you must be your servant. The young corporal had these \nwords modeled to him from the man at the top. The disciples, \nlikewise, receive from their leader a picture of servant hood.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it is high time they start imitating their leader. It is now five \ndays before Jesus' crucifixion. Four days before his betrayal and \ntrial. One day before the clearing of the temple. A few hours before \nthe Triumphal Entry.

The \ndementia-riddled wife is, Robertson said, \"not there\" anymore. This \nis more than an embarrassment. This is more than cruelty. This is a \nrepudiation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew Christians take Robertson all that seriously anymore. Most roll \ntheir eyes, and shake their heads when he makes another outlandish \ncomment (for instance, defending China's brutal one-child abortion \npolicy to identifying God's judgment on specific actions in the \nSeptember 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, or the Haiti earthquake). \nThis is serious, though, because it points to an issue that is much \nbigger than Robertson.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage, the Scripture tells us, is an icon of something deeper, \nmore ancient, more mysterious. The marriage union is a sign, the \nApostle Paul announces, of the mystery of Christ and his church (Eph. \n5). The husband, then, is to love his wife \"as Christ loved the \nchurch\" (Eph. 5:25). This love is defined not as the hormonal surge \nof romance but as a self-sacrificial crucifixion of self. The husband \npictures Christ when he loves his wife by giving himself up for her.\u0014\n\u0014\n+++++\u0014\nPat Robertson's cruel marriage statement is no anomaly. He and his \ncohorts have given us for years a prosperity gospel with more in \ncommon with an Asherah pole than a cross. They have given us a \npoliticized Christianity that uses churches to \"mobilize\" voters \nrather than to stand prophetically outside the power structures as a \nwitness for the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jesus didn't die for a Christian Coalition; he died for a church. \nAnd the church, across the ages, isn't significant because of her \nsize or influence. She is weak, helpless, and spattered in blood. He \nis faithful to us anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\n++++++\u0014\nIt's easy to teach couples to put the \"spark\" back in their \nmarriages, to put the \"sizzle\" back in their sex lives. You can still \nworship the self and want all that. But that's not what love is. Love \nis fidelity with a cross on your back. Love is drowning in your own \nblood. Love is screaming, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus tells us he is present in the weak, the vulnerable, the \nuseless. He is there in the least of these (Matt. 25:31-46). \nSomewhere out there right now, a man is wiping the drool from an 85 \nyear-old woman who flinches because she think he's a stranger.

The tradition in which I was raised leaned more toward the \nfundamentalist side of being Baptist, but I still associate with the \nBaptist tradition (more with what I consider to be the more \nhistorically recognizable Baptist faith that is more moderate and \nopen minded).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, I also find myself in community with the Reformed tradition, \nparticularly as it is expressed in the Presbyterian Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I am a minister ordained in the Baptist tradition, I am very \noften called upon by Presbyterian churches to be a guest preacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, having lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, and having studied at \nNew College, the divinity school that is part of the University of \nEdinburgh, I am very in tune with the Presbyterian faith, whose \nfounder is John Knox, the Scottish minister of the 16th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese experiences have fostered in me a deeper understanding of the \nReformed traditions and have enriched my Christian faith and \ndiscipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, as Protestants, we should remember that although these \nhistorical figures' actions provide us with the faith we now embrace, \nthey were indeed flawed human beings who may not be as heroic as we \nimagine them to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, although historians credit Luther with starting the \nProtestant Reformation, and we consider his brave stance against the \noverreaching authority of the papacy as a hallmark of deep conviction \nand courage, we should not neglect the historical reality that Luther \nwas an anti-Semite.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that Luther perhaps sided with Europe's Jews against the \nRoman Catholic Church, but once they did not embrace his \nChristianity, he spewed all kinds of derogatory and hate-filled \nspeech about them, referring to them as \"blind\" and \"stupid fools,\" \nand he equated them with the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther also sided with the ruling authorities in their attempts to \nsquash the peasant rebellions of the 16th century  a position that \nmay have been influenced by Luther's own views about the freedom of a \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his \"Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants,\" Luther \naccuses the peasants of not taking their God-ordained place within \nthe structure of God's planned society in which the kings ruled by \ndivine right.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther supported the use of brute force against these peasants, \narguing that this was the only method by which they would be stopped.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin, the great father of the Reformed Tradition, was also \nsignificantly flawed.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor one thing, his theological teachings, which continue to influence \nvarious Christian traditions, was centered on the view of God as some \nsort of capricious and arbitrary God, who Calvin argued \"predestined\" \nsome for salvation and others for damnation.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin's view of God leaves little to no room for human freedom and \nfor human goodness; all of eternity has been predetermined by God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, perhaps Calvin's most flawed action was his support for the \ndeath of Michael Servetus, a Spanish theologian accused of \nanti-trinitarianism and anti-infant baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nServetus had escaped to Geneva where Calvin was, and while attending \na sermon being delivered by Calvin, Servetus was recognized and \narrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin gave his support for Servetus to be burned at the stake as a \nheretic. Calvin referred to his teachings as \"execrable blasphemies,\" \nand he stated, \"Whoever shall maintain that wrong is done to heretics \nand blasphemers in punishing them makes himself an accomplice in \ntheir crime and guilty as they are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Knox, the great Scottish Reformer  whose house I visited on a \ncouple of occasions, whose statue stands in the courtyard of New \nCollege, and in whose church I often sat in still reflection  was \nalso no saint.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of \nWomen,\" a misogynistic treatise against Mary, Queen of Scots, Knox \nrefers to women as blind, weak, mad and foolish.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe asks, \"How can woman be the image of God, seeing (says he) she is \nsubject to man, and has none authority, neither to teach, neither to \nbe witness, neither to judge, much less to rule or bear empire?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on the one hand, we can perhaps applaud the boldness and courage \nof the Reformers like Luther, Calvin and Knox, whose actions changed \nforever Western civilization and Christendom.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, we must remember that they are severely flawed \nheroes.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps having this perspective will help us see our own flaws as we \nmake Christian history for tomorrow's believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd maybe it should also cause us to consider with all seriousness \nhow flawed the Christian faith really is.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrew Smith, an ordained Baptist minister, is director of \ninternational programs at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, \nArk. He blogs at Wilderness Preacher.\u0014",

People editor Richard Stolley even devised a set of rules \nfor a successful cover: Young is better than old. Pretty is better \nthan ugly. Rich is better than poor. TV is better than music. Music \nis better than movies. Movies are better than sports. Anything is \nbetter than politics. And nothing is better than a celebrity who has \njust died.

    "words": "By: Paul Woody \u0014\nPublished: November 13, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, \nhis alleged victims and who knew what and when will be sickening \nreminders of failures by too many people to protect children.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf anything can be salvaged from this horrific mess, maybe it is the \ndissolution of the idea of the coach as imperial, someone above the \nlaw and more powerful than the college president.\u0014\n\u0014\nPenn State coach Joe Paterno and Sandusky, by virtue of his time \nspent as defensive coordinator of the powerful Nittany Lions football \nteam, were viewed as residents of some type of coaching Mount Olympus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were men who could do no wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, Sandusky is accused of doing heinously wrong things to children.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo football program, and no member of the program, should be larger \nthan the university. Yet that was the situation for Paterno at Penn \nState.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe potential exists for the same situation at a number of major \ncollege programs throughout the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis creates problems, not the least of which is the disconnect the \ncoach has with the real world.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaterno's responses to the Sandusky charges are mindboggling examples.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn retrospect, he said, he wished he had done more.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would resign, he said, after the 2011 season, so the Penn State \nBoard of Trustees didn't need to spend any more time discussing his \nstatus. The trustees, Paterno said, had more important matters to \nconsider.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaterno was attempting to give orders to the trustees. He didn't \nrealize, or didn't want to understand, his negligence was central to \nthe considerations of the Penn State trustees. Nor did he seem to \nrealize, or want to realize, he worked for the trustees, not they for \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost as an afterthought, Paterno told the students and supporters \nwho had gathered outside his home to pray a little bit for the \nvictims.\u0014\n\u0014\nA little bit?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the best he could do for the alleged victims?\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the trustees fired him, Paterno was a power unto himself at \nPenn State. Such a situation is rife with problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nRarely does anyone in the administration have the courage to speak \ntruth to power. And when someone finally did, graduate assistant Mike \nMcQueary in 2002, Paterno followed protocol and pushed the report up \nthe line.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor decades, Paterno has been labeled a moral authority in college \nathletics. He practically was deified. He has been seen as the one \ncoach who always would do the right thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaterno did not do the right thing regarding Sandusky's alleged \ncrimes. Simply following protocol was not acceptable. Much more was \nexpected of someone of Paterno's stature and standing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is where the biggest disconnect occurs. Paterno, and those who \nreacted in moblike fashion to his dismissal, seem incapable of \ngrasping that.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether in an effort to shield his friend and former assistant coach, \nthe Penn State football program or the Penn State brand, Paterno took \nthe path of least resistance. Instead of protecting the legacy he had \nbuilt in six decades and the all-important \"brand,\" Paterno helped to \ndestroy it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not yet know how many children suffered because of that \ndecision.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is alleged to have occurred at Penn State is unprecedented in \ncollege athletics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe factors that made the alleged wrongdoing possible and permitted \nit to continue are not.\u0014",

The oldest was named Bean Plant, \nthe middle sister was named Marigold, and the youngest was called \nLily. It was summer; the weather was beautiful and all who lived in \nthe forest were happy and gay. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe two older sisters thought themselves to be rather important. Bean \nPlant attracted lots of attention through the lush and rich beans \nwhich she produced so abundantly. All the squirrels, rabbits, and \nother animals came and ate their meals at Bean Plant's house. Bean \nPlant was proud; she found importance in what she produced. Marigold, \nthe middle sister, was also very popular. She produced nothing of \nvalue, but she attracted a lot of attention, nonetheless. The reason \nwas that Marigold was radiantly beautiful. The gold, yellow, and \norange blossoms which she produced brought her many suitors. They \nwere all tall, dark, and handsome and had names of spruce, elm, and \noak. Marigold lived in her radiant beauty as the summer days passed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe youngest sister, Lily, did not attract a lot of attention. She \nproduced no fruit; she was not radiantly beautiful. Lily was short, \nskinny, and just plain green. She also had a habit which her sisters \nthought was odd; she was constantly talking with the sun. Each day \nwhen the sun would come up in the eastern sky Lily would say, \"Good \nmorning\" and the sun would answer, \"Good morning, I hope you slept \nwell. Have a nice day.\" Lily spoke with the sun at midday when the \nforest was warm from the sun's rays. When the sun would slip over the \nwestern horizon she also spoke to her friend saying, \"Good night, \nthanks for the day. See you in the morning.\" Bean Plant and Marigold \nthought their sister was odd. \"You can't speak with the sun,\" they \ninsisted. But Lily would only answer, \"Maybe yes, maybe no, but I \nwill continue to talk with my friend the sun.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, Lily came to her two older sisters; she was in tears. \"The \nsun is dying,\" she said, \"the sun is dying.\" Now her sisters truly \nknew that Lily was crazy. How can the sun be dying? It comes up every \nday and goes down each night. The sun is strong and powerful, how can \nit be dying? \"But, what of it?\" the older sisters thought. \"We really \ndon't need the sun after all.\" Yet, Lily insisted that it was true, \nthe sun had told her so. Bean Plant and Marigold had to agree about \ntwo things, however. The sun arose a little later and set a little \nearlier each day. Additionally, they noticed that the sun was not as \nhigh in the sky as it had been earlier. It just was not as warm these \ndays in the forest. \"But what of it?\" they said. \"We don't really \nneed the sun.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the warmth of the summer months turned into the cooler months of \nautumn, Lily continued to speak with her friend the sun. One sunny \nbut cool day a strong driving wind rushed through the forest. The \nwind blew the beauty that once was Marigold all over the place. Her \nsuitors no longer thought her attractive. They lost their interest in \nher, dropped their leaves, and decided to sleep for the rest of the \nwinter. A couple of weeks later the first frost came to the forest. \nThe fruit which Bean Plant produced began to shrivel up; it was no \nlonger attractive to the animals of the forest. They, too, decided to \nsleep for the winter. One day the cold became so intense that Bean \nPlant was snapped off at the base; she was no more. But before the \nsun's strength went away totally, it bent down and kissed its friend \nLily and said, \"Thank you for talking with me. I love you very much.\" \nWith that, winter came to the forest with all its strength.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a few months, life once again began to appear in the forest. \nThe snows melted and streams again began to run freely. Budding \nleaves appeared on the trees and the animals again began to forage \nfor food, and there in the middle of the forest appeared one day the \nmost beautiful snow white lily that one can ever imagine. As the sun \narose in the eastern sky, Lily turned and opened her beautiful flower \nto her friend and said, \"Thank you for talking with me. I love you, \ntoo.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story, \"Lily,\" by Walter Wangerin, Jr., challenges us to look \naround and perceive the presence of God that is all around us\u0014",

He needed an \n\"attention-getter\"something to shock his students and force them to \ntake an ethical stand. He hoped that this would form a \"baseline\" \nfrom which they could evaluate other ethical decisions. Here's how he \nexplained what happened next:\u0014\n\u0014\nI decided to open by simply displaying, without comment, the photo of \nBibi Aisha. Aisha was the Afghani teenager who was forced into an \nabusive marriage with a Taliban fighter, who abused her and kept her \nwith his animals. When she attempted to flee, her family caught her, \nhacked off her nose and ears, and left her for dead in the mountains \n She was saved by a nearby American hospital. I felt quite sure that \nmy students, seeing the suffering of this poor girl of their own age, \nwould have a clear ethical reaction .\u0014\n\u0014\nThe picture is horrific. Aisha's beautiful eyes stare hauntingly back \nat you above the mangled hole that was once her nose. Some of my \nstudents could not even raise their eyes to look at it. I could see \nthat they were experiencing deep emotions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I was not prepared for their reaction. I had expected strong \naversion; but that's not what I got. Instead, they became confused. \nThey seemed not to know what to think. They spoke timorously, afraid \nto make any moral judgment at all. They were unwilling to criticize \nany situation originating in a different culture. They said, \"Well, \nwe might not like it, but maybe over there it's okay.\" Another said, \n\"It's just wrong to judge other cultures.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI wondered, \"How can kids who have been so thoroughly basted in the \nlanguage of minority rights be so numb to a clear moral offense?\" . \nNo matter how I prodded they did not leave their nonjudgmental \nposition. I left that class shaking my head. It seemed clear to me \nthat for some studentsclearly not allthe lesson of character \neducation initiatives is acceptance of all things at all costs. While \nwe may hope some are capable of bridging the gap between principled \nmorality and this ethically vacuous relativism, it is evident that a \ngood many are not. For them, the overriding message is \"never judge, \nnever criticize, never take a position.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Stephen L.

    "words": "January 3, 1560 \u0014\nPeter Palladius, Denmark's Dedicated Reformer\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Luther's Reformation began in Germany, it was inevitable that \nhis ideas would seep through border cracks into neighboring \nScandinavia. The most vigilant efforts of Denmark's government and \nits established church could not stop German ideas, books, and \npreachers from slipping into the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nA shoemaker's son was the chief agent of reform in Denmark. Peder \nPalladius was still a student when Reformation ideas arrived. He \nfound himself agreeing with the Reformation call to a life of faith \ngrounded on the word of God alone. The writings of Melanchthon drew \nhim as the scent of flowers draws bees.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenmark fought a civil war over the Reformation in 1533 when its \nCatholics revolted at the prospect of a Protestant king. Duke \nChristian defeated them and was crowned King Christian III. Since the \nCatholics had fomented the war, he asked their churches to pay his \nwar debts, but the bishops refused, so he locked them up. (When he \nlater released them, some joined his side.) Although Christian III \nwas so reform-minded that he sometimes even preached from pulpits \nhimself, he was remarkably tolerant for those times, and eventually \npensioned off the Catholic churchmen who refused to join the \nReformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1537 the Danish church broke completely with Rome. King Christian \nhad Johann Bugenhagen consecrated several bishops outside of the \napostolic succession. Palladius had just completed his doctoral exams \nat Wittenberg, the center of Lutheran thought in Germany. Christian \nIII summoned the scholar and appointed him to the highest church \noffice in Denmark--Superintendent of Zealand. At the same time, he \nordered Palladius to wear another influential hat: theology professor \nat the University of Copenhagen.\u0014\n\u0014\nPalladius showed everyone what a bishop should be. Not only did he \nvisit all of the 390 parishes under his oversight, but he held \nhundreds of seminars, preached, taught at the university, and wrote \nbooks that explained complicated theology so simply that the common \nfolk could understand it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hard-working bishop prepared a liturgy in the Danish language, \ntoo. Of course, some Danes didn't want to become Lutherans. Palladius \ninstructed their bishops to accept this hesitancy with patience and \neducate them in the new doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Palladius died, on this day, January 3, 1560 (it is thought), he \nleft behind a lasting legacy of devotional and professional writings. \nHis life had been so zealous that the new generation eagerly studied \nhis works to imitate him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDunkley, E.

    "title": "PURITAN HYMNWRITER PHILIP DODDRIDGE",
    "words": "October 26, 1751 \u0014\nPuritan Hymnwriter Philip Doddridge\u0014\n\u0014\nEighteenth century England produced many excellent hymnwriters whose \nhymns are still sung today -- Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, and the \nPuritan Philip Doddridge, who died on this day, October 26, 1751.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Doddridge was born in London, England on June 26, 1702, the \nyoungest of twenty children. His health was so poor when he was born \nhe was not expected to live, and Philip continued to be plagued by \nill health all of his life. His parents died when he was a boy, but \nhe was cared for by friends of the family. Recognizing Doddridge's \nintellectual abilities, one benefactress offered to pay Philip's \nstudies at Cambridge. Philip rejected the offer, however, because he \ncould not accept the tenets of the Anglican church. He went to a \nnon-conforming seminary instead and became an evangelical, \nindependent church leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt twenty-seven Doddridge began to pastor the Castle Hill \ncongregational chapel in Northampton, England. He was to continue \nthere for the next twenty-two years. While in Northampton Doddridge \noffered a theological training school to prepare young men for \nministry in independent churches. Over the years Doddridge taught \nabout 200 men, conducting classes in Hebrew, Greek, math, philosophy, \nBible, and theology. Because of his many accomplishments, the \nUniversity of Aberdeen conferred a Doctor of Divinity degree upon \nDoddridge in 1736.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoddridge was a prolific writer. His The Rise and Progress of \nReligion in the Soul was translated into seven languages. Reading \nthis book led William Wilberforce, foe of slavery, to become a \nChristian. Besides a New Testament commentary and other theological \nworks, Doddridge also wrote over 400 hymns. Most of the hymns were \nwritten as summaries of his sermons and were to help the congregation \nexpress their response to the truths they were being taught. None of \nthese hymns were published in Philip's own lifetime, although they \ncirculated in manuscript copies. At forty-eight, at the height of his \nministry, Doddridge was dying of tuberculosis. Friends collected \nmoney to send him to Portugal where it was hoped warm air and \nsunshine might cure him; but it was too late. Philip Doddridge died \non this day, October 26, 1751 and is buried in the English cemetery \nin Lisbon.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his death a friend collected many of his hymns and had them \npublished. Several still appear in today's hymnals, including \"Grace! \nTis a Charming Sound\" and \"O Happy Day\". The latter is probably \nDoddridge's most famous hymn. Based on II Chronicles 15:15, the hymn \nexpressed the joy of a personal relationship with God. Doddridge \nhimself titled the hymn \"Rejoicing in our Covenant Engagement to \nGod\". Baptists and Methodists often use the hymn at dedication \nservices for Christian baptism, while British royalty have used it at \nthe confirmation services for court children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah.

    "words": "September 25, 1555 \u0014\nPeace at Augsburg\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat was the turmoil and many the monstrous crimes committed in the \nname of Christ in the wake of the Reformation in Europe. Religious \npassions quickly passed into political conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Diet (a formal assembly of princes) of Worms in 1521, Emperor \nCharles V outlawed Lutheranism . But he was unable to stamp out the \nreform movement at the time because of other crises. Not until 1529 \nwas Charles able to follow up on the Lutheran issue. He sent word \nthat Catholicism was to be restored everywhere in Germany. Many \nGerman cities and princes protested. These were called the \n\"Protesting estates\" and from them we got the name \"Protestant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles saw that some sort of conciliation would be in order. In 1530 \nhe attended an assembly known as the Diet at Augsburg. Lutherans \npresented the Confession of Augsburg in an attempt to prove to Rome \nthat their views were Biblical. This confession remains the basis of \nthe Lutheran faith. However, reconciliation proved impossible and \nCharles ordered Lutherans to reunite with the Catholic church by \nApril 15, 1531. This had the effect of stiffening opposition against \nhim. A military alliance of Protestants, known as the Schmalkaldic \nLeague came into being. Charles crushed this, but Elector Maurice \nswitched sides and declared war on the emperor, forcing him to \nnegotiate with the Protestants. In 1552, at the Peace of Passau, \nCharles accepted the existence of the evangelical church and promised \nto hold a \"diet\" to settle the controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe diet was not convened until 1555. Again it was held in Augsburg. \nPeace was arranged between the Lutherans and Catholics on this day, \nSeptember 25, 1555. In many respects it was imperfect. Although \nLutherans were given legal standing, Anabaptists and Calvinists were \nnot. \"[A]ll such as do not belong to the two above-named religions \nshall not be included in the present peace but be totally excluded \nfrom it.\" Each German territory must take the faith of its prince. \nThis inbuilt religious divisiveness crippled Germany's ability to \nunite as a nation. There was no toleration within a territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg did, however, permit people to transplant to a \nregion whose faith was more congenial to each. \"In case our subjects, \nwhether belonging to the old religion or to the Augsburg Confession, \nshould intend leaving their homes, with their wives and children, in \norder to settle in another place, they shall neither be hindered in \nthe sale of their estates after due pay, net of the local taxes nor \ninjured in their honor... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg offered the merest hint of toleration. Weak as \nwas the treaty, it brought increased stability. However, not until \nthe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 were Calvinists added to the list of \ntolerated religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Augsburg, Peace of.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

    "words": "September 26, 1861 \u0014\nPresident Lincoln's Fast\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians have argued whether or not Abraham Lincoln, one of \nAmerica's best-known presidents, ever became a committed Christian. \nAs a youth Lincoln mocked the scriptures. After the death of his \nfavorite son, Willie, he groped for some hope which could give him \nsolace. His wife Mary and he attended seances, but eventually \nrenounced them as fraudulent. The cares and trials of the war drove \nLincoln increasingly to his Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis lifelong friend Joshua Speed remembered, \"As I entered the room \nnear night, [Lincoln] was sitting near a window reading his Bible. \nApproaching him, I said, 'I am glad to see you profitably engaged.' \n'Yes,' said he, 'I am profitably engaged.' 'Well,' said I, 'if you \nhave recovered from your skepticism I am sorry to say that I have \nnot!' Looking me earnestly in the face, and placing his hand upon my \nshoulder, he said: 'You are wrong Speed; take all of this book upon \nreason that you can, and the balance on faith and you will live and \ndie a happier and better man.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of Lincoln's communications allude to God. In his personal \ncorrespondence to Mrs. Gurney, a Quakeress, he wrote, \"We hoped for a \nhappy termination of this terrible war before this; but God knows \nbest and has ruled otherwise.\" Increasingly he saw himself as an \ninstrument of the Lord's will, inscrutable though that might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrestled to understand why the North continued to lose although \nits cause, the abolition of slavery and preservation of the union, \nseemed the more justifiable side. In the end, in a note not written \nfor public consumption, Lincoln concluded that \"the will of God \nprevails. . . .Both [sides] may be wrong. . . .in the present civil \nwar it is quite possible God's purpose is something quite different \nfrom the purpose of either party.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was as much sin to evoke God's wrath upon the Union as on the \nslave-owning Confederacy. On August 12, 1861 he issued a proclamation \nin the Northern States for a day of public humiliation, prayer and \nfasting \"to be observed by the people of the United States with \nreligious solemnities. ... It is peculiarly fit for us to recognize \nthe hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful \nremembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as \nindividuals to humble ourselves before Him, and to pray for His \nmercy... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fast was observed on this day, September 26, 1861, the last \nThursday of the month. As anyone knows who is familiar with the \nhistory of the war, the fighting ground along for another three \nyears, chewing up the lives and limbs of men in prodigious numbers. \nIn the end Lincoln himself was assassinated. He left a legacy of \nprofound words.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Current, Richard N. The Lincoln Nobody Knows. New York: \nMcGraw-Hill, 1958.\u0014\n2.Gross, Ernie.

    "words": "August 24, 1683 \u0014\nPuritan John Owen Focused on Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Owen's later years were hard. As a young man, he had been \nmajestic in appearance; but long hours of study, the many troubles of \nhis life, and disease wasted him. He died on this day, August 24, \n1683 at Ealing (a few miles from London). But his funeral showed how \nhighly he was regarded, for throngs attended, including many notable \nmen.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Oxford University, which he entered in 1628 at twelve years of \nage, John pored over books so much that he undermined his health by \nsleeping only four hours a night. In old age he deeply regretted this \nmisuse of his body, and said he would give up all the additional \nlearning it brought him if only he might have his health back. \nNaturally, he studied the classics of the western world, but also \nHebrew, the literature of the Jewish rabbis, mathematics and \nphilosophy. His beliefs at that time were Presbyterian, however, his \nambition, although fixed on the church, was worldly.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was driven from Oxford in 1637 when Archbishop Laud issued rules \nthat many of England's more democratically-minded or \"low\" church \nministers could not accept. After this, John was in deep depression. \nHe struggled to resolve religious issues to his satisfaction. While \nin this state, he heard a sermon on the text \"Why are you fearful, O \nyou of little faith?\" which fired him with new decisiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter that, John wrote a rebuke of Arminianism (a theology which \nteaches that man has some say in his own salvation or damnation \nalthough God is still sovereign). Ordained shortly before his \nexpulsion from Oxford, he was given work at Fordham in Essex. After \nthat he rose steadily in public affairs. Before all was over, he \nwould become one of the top administrators of the university which \nexpelled him and he even sat in Parliament.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe became a Congregationalist (Puritan) and took Parliament's side in \nthe English Civil Wars. Oliver Cromwell employed him in positions of \ninfluence and trust, but John would not go along when Cromwell became \n\"Protector.\" In spite of this, many of Parliament's leaders attended \nJohn's church.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's reputation was so great that he was offered many churches. One \nwas in Boston, Massachusetts. John turned that down, but he once \nscolded the Puritans of New England for persecuting people who \ndisagreed with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also engaged in controversy with such contemporaries as Richard \nBaxter and Jeremy Taylor. Through it all, John focused his teaching \non the person of Christ. \"If Christ had not died,\" he said, \"sin had \nnever died in any sinner unto eternity.\" In another place he noted \nthat \"Christ did not die for any upon condition, if they do believe; \nbut he died for all God's elect, that they should believe.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn wrote many books including a masterpiece on the Holy Spirit. \nKidney stones and asthma tormented him in his last years. But he died \npeacefully in the end, eyes and hands lifted up as if in prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Owen. http://www.theocentric.com/johnowen/\u0014\n\"Owen, John.\" Dictionary of National Biography.

    "title": "PIERRE VIRET ORDERED OUT OF FRANCE",
    "words": "August 27, 1565 \u0014\nPierre Viret Ordered Out of France\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre Viret was the most popular preacher in sixteenth century \nFrance. Among the cities which invited him to preach were Paris, \nOrleans, Avignon, Montauban, and Montpellier. He was established at \nNimes at the time. Pierre accepted Montpellier's offer, believing \nChrist wanted him there; and he converted almost the whole faculty of \nthe city's medical college to Reformation Christianity. But unlike \nCalvin, Knox and other reformers, Pierre Viret's name gets almost no \nrecognition today.\u0014\n\u0014\nCuriously enough, he was not even a Frenchman. He was born in the \nlittle Swiss town of Orbe in 1511. His parents were poor, but Pierre \ntook advantage of a free education to begin his life of scholarship. \nEventually he attended the University of Paris. As in Switzerland, \nsome of his teachers were Lutheran sympathizers and he became a \nconvert to Reformation faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Farel, the same man who later convinced John Calvin to become \na preacher, convinced Pierre too. From then on, his whole life was \ndedicated to godliness and spreading the gospel. He was so effective \nthat Catholic enemies tried to stab him to death; he was severely \nwounded. Later, Catholics poisoned his spinach. He survived, but he \nsuffered stomach problems ever afterward.\u0014\n\u0014\nA beautiful thing about Pierre was that these ugly attacks and the \nriots that accompanied his sermons, did not warp his spirit. To the \ncontrary, he preached just as lovingly to his enemies as ever. \nAlthough he was staunchly Protestant, he labored to bring about \nreconciliation between Catholics and Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many years he worked in Lausanne and Geneva before beginning his \nwork in France. Thousands attended his sermons. Whole regions came to \nChrist under his teaching. Although we often describe the Huguenots \nas French Calvinists, many were actually converts to Pierre's \nslightly different teachings. (For instance, he viewed the Lord's \nSupper as more symbolic than Calvin did.) When Pierre was at Lyons in \nSouthern France, Catholics regained control of that region. On this \nday, August 27, 1565 Pierre received a notice telling him to get out. \nHe went to Navarre which was ruled by the Protestant queen, Jeanne \nd'Albret.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years later, Pierre and eleven other ministers were captured by \nthe Catholics. Seven were executed. Pierre, however, was allowed to \nlive because the commander had heard so much good about him from \nother Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre suffered many things in his life. His first wife and his \nchildren by her died of plague. His second wife and two children also \ndied of plague. These griefs made him a sympathetic figure to those \nwith similar sufferings. Despite ill health, Pierre preached \ncountless sermons and wrote about fifty books. He died at the age of \nsixty, worn out with hard work and suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nLinder, Robert D. \"Forgotten Reformer.\" Christian History. \u0014\n\"Viret, Pierre.\" Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation. \u0014\nVarious internet articles.\u0014",

Quakers William Penn and William Mead had been \narrested on this day, August 14, 1670 for daring to preach in public. \nOne of the charges against them was rioting. Threatened with \nflogging, Penn did not remove his hat.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwelve jurors were impaneled to determine the guilt of the pair. \nCharges were first read against Penn. He asked for a written copy. It \nwas refused. Not until he had entered his plea would he be given the \ncharges, he was told. Penn pleaded not guilty. The Quakers were \nreturned to lockup.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn September 3 they were brought back to court. Their hats were off. \nThe judge ordered them put on so he could fine them for not removing \nthem. Penn protested. Witnesses came forward but had not heard what \nPenn said or could not agree on it. Penn demanded to know by what law \nhe was accused. The Common Law, he was told. Penn asked for a \nspecific law to be read. The court refused. He was told to enter a \nplea. Penn refused. Until a law was read showing what he had done was \nwrong, his indictment was illegal, he contended. For this defiance \nPenn was hustled into an enclosure. He went under protest, saying he \nwould not be silent on a question which affected thousands of other \npersons. If such proceedings could be taken against him, they could \nbe taken against anyone in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nMead boldly repeated Penn's arguments. He further quoted the \nconstitutional lawyer Coke on what constituted a riot. The recorder \nsneered at him. Mead replied in Latin. In a rage the mayor shouted, \n\"You deserve to have your tongue cut out!\" Mead stood on his rights \nas an Englishman. The recorder snarled that he considered Mead an \nenemy to England and therefore Mead would not be allowed to speak. \nMead, too, was dragged away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe court demanded that the jury find the two guilty of preaching to \nthe people and drawing a tumultuous crowd after them. Failure to do \nso, said the court, would be at the jurors' peril. Penn shouted to \nthe jury that he had not yet been heard as was his right. The judge \nlocked Penn and Mead in the hole.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jurors found the men guilty of preaching--no more. Court officers \nranted at the twelve and ordered the verdict changed. When the jurors \nrefused, they were locked up without food, water or a chamber pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen this did not bring the jurors to heel, they were sent to prison. \nEight of them paid fines to gain immediate released. The remaining \nfour remained in prison and filed a lawsuit. Meanwhile, Penn and Mead \nwere released. Finally England's high court ruled in the jurors' \nfavor. Juries could not be coerced. The four jurors, inspired by the \ntwo devout Quakers, had had stood firm and thereby helped secure \nimportant freedoms.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nDixon, W. Hepworth.

This was one of the primary duties of \nfirst century Jewish families. In the book of Exodus appear these \nwords:  Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord \n(13:2). That's interesting, don't you think? No mention of little \ngirls, just firstborn males. We are doing a little better today.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Leviticus 12 while they were presenting their son before \nGod the family was also supposed to offer a sacrifice of a year-old \nlamb. In Leviticus 12:8, however, there is a disclaimer and little \ngirls make it in this time. Speaking about the mother of a newborn we \nread these words: When the days of her purification for a son or \ndaughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to \nthe tent of meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering . . . But if \n[the mother] cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two \nyoung pigeons . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, if you can afford it, you are to offer a lamb. However, if you \ncan't afford a lamb, you are to offer two doves or two pigeons. That, \nof course, is exactly the sacrifice that Mary and Joseph made when \nthey presented Jesus to God--two doves.\u0014",

    "words": "Exegesis by Elizabeth Achtemeier based on Jeremiah 31:31-34 excerpted \nfrom Preaching And Reading The Old Testament Lessons: With an Eye to \nthe New.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew accounts are more instructive of the ways of God with his people \nIsrael and with us than is the record of the prophetic ministry of \nJeremiah that we find in the Old Testament. Jeremiah was called by \nGod to be a prophet probably in 626 B.C. during the reign of good \nKing Josiah in Judah. Jeremiah was a very young man at the time, \nunskilled in speaking and exceedingly reluctant to accept the call. \nThe Lord equipped him with words, however, and set him under an \nirresistible compulsion to preach, assuring Jeremiah that he would \nalways be accompanied and guarded by the presence of his Lord (cf. \nJeremiah 1; 20:7--12).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message that the young prophet was given to deliver was one of \nGod's forthcoming judgment on Judah in the form of some mysterious \nfoe from the north. Like his northern predecessor Hosea, Jeremiah \nportrayed Judah as the unfaithful son or bride of a loving and \nlife--giving God (cf. Jeremiah 3:19--20). But Judah had been lured \naway from the Lord by the fertility gods of the baals. In 621 B.C., \ngood King Josiah tried to eliminate all baal worship from Judah, but \nJosiah was tragically killed in battle in 609 B.C., and Judah slipped \nback into the old idolatrous ways. The despot Jehoiakim succeeded to \nthe throne, and the nation's life was corrupted not only by \nsyncretism and idolatry, but also by injustice, falsehoods, and the \ntotal neglect of the covenant with God and its commands.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah leveled God's harshest words at his sinful people, accusing \nthem of phony religion. Though they continued their religious \npractices, their worship was rotten to its core. In his famous Temple \nSermon in 609 B.C., Jeremiah proclaimed, \"Will you steal, murder, \ncommit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and go after \nother gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me \nin this house, which is called by my name, and say, 'We are \ndelivered!' - only to go on doing all these abominations?\" (Jeremiah \n7:9--10). The people repeatedly broke the covenant commands of the \nDecalogue, and yet claimed that God was on their side and would \nalways be gracious to them. That's not an unknown phenomenon in our \ntime too.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah suffered horribly for his words of judgment on the populace. \nHe was betrayed by his friends and driven from his hometown of \nAnathoth. He was constantly scorned and sneered at. One night he was \nsubjected to imprisonment in the stocks. Another time he was thrown \ninto a pit and left to die, rescued only at the last minute by a \nfaithful follower. Toward the end of his life, he was imprisoned. And \noften he was so downcast that he despaired of both God and his own \nlife, wishing that he had not been born. But he had to proclaim God's \nwords of judgment that burned like fire in his bones.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring perhaps the first half of his long ministry, Jeremiah \ntherefore urged his sinful people and their leaders to repent and \nturn, to abandon their idolatrous, unjust, and murderous ways, and to \nreturn in faithfulness to their covenant God. \"Amend your ways and \nyour doings\" was his message, and God will not destroy you. The \npeople's sin was totally unnatural. Even the birds know the times of \ntheir migrations, he pointed out, \"but my people know not the \nordinances of the Lord\" (Jeremiah 8:7). \"Can a maiden forget her \nornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me \ndays without number,\" says the Lord (Jeremiah 2:32). Sin was \nunnatural.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Jeremiah suffered through his ministry, however, he came to learn \nfrom the Lord the same lesson that the prophet Hosea had learned, \nthat Judah was captive to sin and could not mend her ways (cf. Hoses \n5:4). She was, as the Apostle Paul later would write, a slave of sin. \n\"Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then \nalso you can do good who are accustomed to do evil,\" Jeremiah \nrealized. The Judeans had no power in themselves to repent and return \nto the Lord. Their evil was too much with them, and they were \nimprisoned by it.\u0014",

Here in Mark's \nversion, Jesus sends some representatives ahead of him to secure a \ncolt. Once they assure its owner that Jesus needs it (and will return \nit), he relents. (In Luke's version, by contrast, the phrase \"The \nLord has need of it\" appears to be some kind of pre-arranged \npassword; there is no mention of a promise to return the animal, for \nthis would not have been necessary if the use of the beast had been \nagreed upon ahead of time.) \u0014\n\u0014\nSince Jesus never refers to himself as \"Lord\" elsewhere in Mark's \nGospel, the appearance of that word in the statement, \"The Lord needs \nit,\" is noteworthy. The people spread \"leafy branches\" out before \nhim; there's no specific mention of palms (as in John's Gospel) -- \nwhich would have had the specific connotation of Jewish nationalism \n-- although it's possible that Mark's readers would have understood \nthese leafy branches to be palms. Nor is there any mention of crowds \nfrom the city coming out to welcome Jesus -- the procession could \n(and, in this version, probably is) comprised mostly of his \nentourage. The spreading of cloaks on the road probably refers to an \nancient coronation custom described in 2 Kings 9:13. The cry of the \npeople is \"Hosanna!\" -- literally, \"Save us!\" The full quotation, \n\"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\" comes from \nPsalm 118:25-26, a royal psalm that was also traditionally sung by \npilgrims as they entered the city. It would have had connotations of \npilgrims coming into the city in any event, but the addition of the \nroyal accoutrements means that Jesus' followers are also invoking the \nenthronement connotations.\u0014",

Quakers William Penn and William Mead had been \narrested on this day, August 14, 1670 for daring to preach in public. \nOne of the charges against them was rioting. Threatened with \nflogging, Penn did not remove his hat.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwelve jurors were impaneled to determine the guilt of the pair. \nCharges were first read against Penn. He asked for a written copy. It \nwas refused. Not until he had entered his plea would he be given the \ncharges, he was told. Penn pleaded not guilty. The Quakers were \nreturned to lockup.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn September 3 they were brought back to court. Their hats were off. \nThe judge ordered them put on so he could fine them for not removing \nthem. Penn protested. Witnesses came forward but had not heard what \nPenn said or could not agree on it. Penn demanded to know by what law \nhe was accused. The Common Law, he was told. Penn asked for a \nspecific law to be read. The court refused. He was told to enter a \nplea. Penn refused. Until a law was read showing what he had done was \nwrong, his indictment was illegal, he contended. For this defiance \nPenn was hustled into an enclosure. He went under protest, saying he \nwould not be silent on a question which affected thousands of other \npersons. If such proceedings could be taken against him, they could \nbe taken against anyone in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nMead boldly repeated Penn's arguments. He further quoted the \nconstitutional lawyer Coke on what constituted a riot. The recorder \nsneered at him. Mead replied in Latin. In a rage the mayor shouted, \n\"You deserve to have your tongue cut out!\" Mead stood on his rights \nas an Englishman. The recorder snarled that he considered Mead an \nenemy to England and therefore Mead would not be allowed to speak. \nMead, too, was dragged away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe court demanded that the jury find the two guilty of preaching to \nthe people and drawing a tumultuous crowd after them. Failure to do \nso, said the court, would be at the jurors' peril. Penn shouted to \nthe jury that he had not yet been heard as was his right. The judge \nlocked Penn and Mead in the hole.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jurors found the men guilty of preaching--no more. Court officers \nranted at the twelve and ordered the verdict changed. When the jurors \nrefused, they were locked up without food, water or a chamber pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen this did not bring the jurors to heel, they were sent to prison. \nEight of them paid fines to gain immediate released. The remaining \nfour remained in prison and filed a lawsuit. Meanwhile, Penn and Mead \nwere released. Finally England's high court ruled in the jurors' \nfavor. Juries could not be coerced. The four jurors, inspired by the \ntwo devout Quakers, had had stood firm and thereby helped secure \nimportant freedoms.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nDixon, W. Hepworth.

    "words": "July 26, 2012\u0014\nPacking Heat and Trusting Providence: Why I Own a Handgun\u0014\nBeing a pro-life woman means protecting my life, too.\u0014\nKaren Swallow Prior, July 28, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not every Christmas morning you wake up with a Bersa .380 in \nyour Christmas stocking. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story starts on an isolated stretch of road, escalated into \nflagging down a police car, and resolved with more calls to the \npolice and their surprise visit at the home of a very dirty old man. \nThe handgun is the epilogue.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this post isnt about guns as much as it is about how Christian \nwomen should think and act in matters of self-defense given the \nrealities of today. For the record, Im for gun control, but that \nterm includes greatly divergent types of control that are not the \npurpose of this post to address. \u0014\n\u0014\nI run 35 to 40 miles a week. Living as I do in a rural area, those \nmiles are on roads of varying degrees of inhabitation. I live in a \nlow crime areabut all the more reason to resist the lull of a false \nsense of security, especially when being a woman alone is enough to \nmake one vulnerable, always. So I spend a fair amount of time during \nthose miles being wary, vigilant, and proactive with self-defense \nstrategies. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first trouble I had, years ago when I lived in another state with \nmore crime, was a flasher who parked on my road in the early \nmornings, awaiting my daily runs. He would keep far away, face me to, \num, service himself, then get in his car and speed off before I was \nclose enough to read his license plate. Teamwork with a neighbor, \nhowever, resulted in identification, a house call by the police, and \nan end to his shenanigans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe incident that birthed the Bersa started with a truck pulling up \nbeside me and the driver asking me if I wanted a ride. Its \nsurprising how many such offers one encounters when one is out \nrunning. (Note: if you see me running along the road in running shoes \nand running shorts, rest assured, I do not want a ride. Besides, Im \ndying to know: has anyone ever really gotten lucky with such an \noffer?) When the truck turned around and passed me again, I \nsuccessfully used what was then the first strategy of my self-defense \nplan (which I cant disclose publicly without rendering it \nuseless).This was before I was in the habit of taking a cell phone \nwith me (the purpose of such runs being, after all, the sense of \nlightness and disconnectivity), but miraculously, when I got out on \nthe main road, a police car drove by and I flagged it down. Even so, \nit took one more encounter with the man before the police were able \nto put an end to it. \u0014\n\u0014\nThats when my husband bought me the handgun.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I wasnt surprised to read in my local newspaper that a new \nshooting range in my area is attracting a significant portion of \nfemale clients. Locations around the country reflect similar \npatterns. A poll conducted by Gallup in October 2011 reported that 43 \npercent of women surveyed reported having a gun in their house, a \nrecord high since 1993, and 23 percent of women polled said they own \na gun. Interestingly, in Texas, the fastest-growing group of \nconcealed handgun owners in the state is black women. Also not \nsurprising is the spike in firearms sales immediately after the \nColorado movie theater shootings. \u0014\n\u0014\nI know that Christians in favor of tighter gun control laws argue \nthat as Christians, particularly ones like me who strongly identify \nas pro-life, we, of all people, should love our enemies and turn \nthe other cheek. But while as a Christian I try to cultivate my \nwillingness to lay down my life for the sake of the gospel or for the \nlife of another, I dont believe Im supposed to risk my life for a \nwould-be rapist. To me, being pro-life means protecting my own life, \ntoo.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome might say I should simply give up my love of the outdoors and \nrunning (which Ive enjoyed since I began running cross-country in \nJunior High), join a gym, maybe, or drive 20 miles one way into the \ncity to run in a more populous area. But surrendering my freedom and \ngiving in to evil so willingly doesnt seem like the call of the \nChristian either. Matters of stewardship play into the equation, too: \nstewardship of my time, talents and my physical and mental health. \nMore than anything else, running meets these needs in my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides, the handgun is a self-defense strategy of last resort. I now \nrun with a phone. I pay attention to my surroundings at all times. I \ntext the plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles (or those whose \ndrivers offer me a ride) to my husbands phone, and call immediately \nif I am alone on a long stretch and encounter an unfamiliar, parked, \nor slow-moving vehicle. And I gave up running on the beautifully \nforested road where the man in the truck accosted me the first and \nsecond time (the final time was on my own road).\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, in my running, as in all things, I must put my trust in \nthe Lord, yet without testing him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was reminded of Gods sovereign protection in yet another incident. \nI was running uphill on a two-mile stretch of a private, uninhabited \ndirt road when I saw an older model car with an out-of-state plate \nparked up ahead. A man was leaning against the car smoking a \ncigarette. Quickly, I pulled my phone from the pack that holds all my \nnecessaries and called my mother, whom I knew to be home. I stayed on \nthe phone with her as I ran a wide berth around the man and his car. \nAs I crested the hill, I saw a police car sitting at the top. \nUnbeknownst to me, the officer, from his elevated position at the \ncrossroads, had been able to see us the entire time and waited for me \nto arrive safely. \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, God is watching over me. Yet, I am still called to wisdom and \ngood stewardship of all the gifts hes given me, including my life \nand health. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about you? What self-defense strategies do you or the women in \nyour life employ?\u0014\n\u0014\nposted by Sarah Pulliam Bailey, Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "PREACHING THE GOSPEL TAKES WORDS",
    "words": "Preaching the Gospel Takes Words\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent article for Outreach, Ed Stetzer writes: \"There's a \npopular saying often repeated by Christians. It has found new life on \nFacebook and Twitter. Maybe you have even uttered these words, \ncommonly at tributed to Francis of Assisi: 'Preach the gospel. Use \nwords if necessary.' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think we can appreciate what many are getting at when they say \nsomething like this. As Christians, we should live in such a way that \nour lives point to the person and work of Jesus. However, good \nintentions cannot overcome two basic problems with this quote and its \nsupposed origin. One, Francis never said it, and two, the quote is \nnot biblical. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mark Galli has pointed out that there is no record of Francis, a \nmember of a preaching order, uttering anything close to this. In \nfact, everything we know about the man suggests he would not have \nagreed with his supposed quote. He was well known for his preaching \nand often preached up to five times a day. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The idea may not have resonated with Francis; but for many today, \nwordless ministry is a compelling approach. 'Words are cheap,' we \nlike to say, and 'Actions speak louder than words.' Galli explains \nthe sentiment complements our culture rather well:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"'Preach the gospel; use words if necessary' goes hand in hand with a \npostmodern assumption that words are finally empty of meaning. It \nsubtly denigrates the high value that the prophets, Jesus and Paul \nput on preaching. Of course, we want our actions to match our words \nas much as possible. But the gospel is a message, news about an event \nand a person upon which the history of the planet turns. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"And this is the real problemnot from whom the quote originally \ncame, but just how it can give us an incomplete understanding of the \ngospel and how God saves sinners. Christians are quick to encourage \neach other to 'live out the gospel,' to 'be the gospel' to our \nneighbors, and to 'gospel each other.' The missional impulse here is \nhelpful, yet the gospel isn't anything the Christian can live out, \npractice or become. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The apostle Paul summarized the gospel as the life, death and \nresurrection of Jesus Christ, through whom sin is atoned for, sinners \nare reconciled to God and the hope of the resurrection awaits all who \nbelieve. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The gospel is not habit, but history. The gospel is the declaration \nof something that actually happened. Because the gospel is the saving \nwork of Jesus, it isn't something we can do; but it is something we \nmust announce. We do live out its implications, but if we are to make \nthe gospel known, we will do so through words.\"\u0014",

Putin responded with a rather remarkable \nstatement: We must move away from the primitive notion of separation \nbetween church and state, he said. On the contrary, we must devote \nourselves to the totally different idea of cooperation. And \ncooperate they did.

Congress incubates and \ninsulates these knuckle-draggers.\u0014\n\u0014\nLets take a quick tour of the crazies in the House. Their war on \ncritical thinking explains a lot about why the United States is \nlaughed at on the global stage, and why no real solutions to our \nproblems emerge from that broken legislative body.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere currently experiencing the worst drought in 60 years, a siege \nof wildfires, and the hottest temperatures since records were kept. \nBut to Republicans in Congress, its all a big hoax. The chairman of \na subcommittee that oversees issues related to climate change, \nRepresentative John Shimkus of Illinois is  you guessed it  a \nclimate-change denier.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a 2009 hearing, Shimkus said not to worry about a fatally \ndyspeptic planet: the biblical signs have yet to properly align. The \nearth will end only when God declares it to be over, he said, and \nthen he went on to quote Genesis at some length. Its worth \nrepeating: This guy is the chairman.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the same committee is an oil-company tool and 27-year veteran of \nCongress, Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas. You may remember \nBarton as the politician who apologized to the head of BP in 2010 \nafter the government dared to insist that the company pay for those \nwhose livelihoods were ruined by the gulf oil spill.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarton cited the Almighty in questioning energy from wind turbines. \nCareful, he warned, wind is Gods way of balancing heat. Clean \nenergy, he said, would slow the winds down and thus could make it \nhotter. You never know.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou cant regulate God! Barton barked at the House speaker, Nancy \nPelosi, in the midst of discussion on measures to curb global warming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Catholic Church long ago made its peace with evolution, but the \nsame cannot be said of House Republicans. Jack Kingston of Georgia, a \n20-year veteran of the House, is an evolution denier, apparently \nbecause he cant see the indent where his ancestors monkey tail used \nto be. Wheres the missing link? he said in 2011. I just want to \nknow what it is. He serves on a committee that oversees education.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his party, Kingston is in the mainstream. A Gallup poll in June \nfound that 58 percent of Republicans believe God created humans in \nthe present form just within the last 10,000 years  a wealth of \nanthropological evidence to the contrary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother Georgia congressman, Paul Broun, introduced the so-called \npersonhood legislation in the House  backed by Akin and \nRepresentative Paul Ryan  that would have given a fertilized egg the \nsame constitutional protections as a fully developed human being.\u0014\n\u0014\nBroun is on the same science, space and technology committee that \nAkin is. Yes, science is part of their purview.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere do they get this stuff? The Bible, yes, but much of the \nmisinformation and the fables that inform Republican politicians \ncomes from hearsay, often amplified by their media wing.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember the crazy statement that helped to kill the presidential \naspirations of Michele Bachmann? A vaccine, designed to prevent a \nvirus linked to cervical cancer, could cause mental retardation, she \nproclaimed. Bachmann knew this, she insisted, because some random \nlady told her so at a campaign event. Fearful of the genuine damage \nBachmanns assertion could do to public health, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics promptly rushed out a notice, saying, there is \nabsolutely no scientific validity to this statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor is there is reputable scientific validity to those who deny that \nthe globes climate is changing for the worst. But Bachmann calls \nthat authoritative consensus a hoax, and faces no censure from her \nparty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts encouraging that Republican heavyweights have since told Akin \nthat uttering scientific nonsense about sex and rape is not good for \nthe partys image. But where are these fact-enforcers on the other \nidiocies professed by elected representatives of their party?\u0014\n\u0014\nAkin, if he stays in the race, may still win the Senate seat in \nMissouri. Bachmann, who makes things up on a regular basis, is a \nleader of the Tea Party caucus in Congress and, in an unintended \njoke, a member of the Committee on Intelligence. None of these folks \nare without power; they govern, and have significant followings.\u0014\n\u0014\nA handful of Republicans have tried to fight the know-nothings. I \nbelieve in evolution and trust scientists on global warming, said \nJon Huntsman, the former Utah governor, during his ill-fated run for \nhis partys presidential nomination. Call me crazy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in an on-air plea for sanity, Joe Scarborough, the former G.O.P. \ncongressman and MSNBC host, said, Im just tired of the Republican \nParty being the stupid party. I feel for him. But dont expect the \nreality chorus to grow. For if intelligence were contagious, his \nparty would be giving out vaccines for it.\u0014",

Todd Akin bungled science when he claimed that women \nwho are raped are naturally protected from pregnancy. But he's not \nthe first politician to have a shaky relationship with scientific \nfact \u0014\n\u0014\nTodd Akin and the Myth About Rape and Pregnancy\u0014\nBy Alice Park | August 20, 2012 | \u0014\n\u0014\nMost politicians arent scientists, but that hasnt stopped them from \nplaying one on TV  badly  when the fancy strikes. On Sunday, Rep. \nTodd Akin of Missouri became the latest legislator to bungle science, \nwhen he revealed his stunning lack of knowledge about human \nreproduction during an interview with KTVI-TV in St. Louis.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about his stance on abortion, the Republican Senate candidate \nattempted to explain his unqualified opposition to it, even in cases \nof rape: From what I understand from doctors, thats really rare, \nAkin said of pregnancies from rape. If its a legitimate rape, the \nfemale body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, the Congressman seemed to suggest, a womans chances \nof becoming pregnant by rape depends on her intent. If she truly does \nnot want to have intercourse, her body would shut down a pregnancy. \nAnd, by logical extension, if she gets pregnant, then she must not \nhave been raped.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiologically speaking, no such link between intent of intercourse and \npregnancy exists (though the myth goes back centuries). Pregnancy \nresults when an egg is fertilized by sperm during intercourse, \nwhether the act is consensual or not. I am constantly amazed at the \nlack of understanding not only of folks running for office, but in \noffice, about womens reproductive health, says Cecile Richards, \npresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The statement \nby Mr. Akin, I think is politics at its worst, ignoring basic \nmedicine and science in pursuit of some political ideology.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften, such ideology is rooted in religious beliefs, but just as \noften its driven by nothing more than shaky or incomplete knowledge \nabout the basics of biology. Later, Akin said he misspoke during \nthe TV interview and recanted his previous comment: Rape is never \nlegitimate. Its an evil act thats committed by violent predators. I \nused the wrong words in the wrong way. He noted that he knew women \ncould get pregnant through rape.\u0014\n\u0014\nAkin apologized, but he wasnt the first and unfortunately wont be \nthe last elected official to wade foolishly into the realm of \nscience, where facts, and not ideology, take precedence.\u0014",

    "title": "PHOEBE PALMER'S HAND IN METHODIST MISSIONS",
    "words": "September 4, 1847 \u0014\nPhoebe Palmer's Hand in Methodist Missions\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Methodist missions to China were created largely through the \ninfluence and prompting of one extraordinary woman. Phoebe Palmer is \nbest known in our day as the writer of revival hymns such as this on \nChrist's blood: \u0014\n\u0014\nThe cleansing stream I see, I see!\u0014\nI plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me;\u0014\nOh, praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,\u0014\nyes, cleanseth me.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Methodist lay person, she worked tirelessly for social change and \nimprovement and was a key influence in 19th century Methodist \nrevival. She also was the driving force behind funding the first \nMethodist missionaries to China. She had considered going to China \nherself, but decided she was needed more where she was. But she and \nher husband pledged the first $1,000 and stimulated others to raise \nsimilar amounts.\u0014\n\u0014\nMethodists were not the first to send missionaries to China. Many \nother missions had preceded them, including Hudson Taylor who founded \nthe China Inland Mission. The first American Methodist missionaries \nto China, Moses White, Robert Maclay and Henry Hickok, supported by \nthe direct efforts of Phoebe Palmer and her husband, reached Fuchau \nin the land of Confucius on this day, September 4, 1847.\u0014\n\u0014\nFuchau was a city of over 600,000 souls. Yet for a long time no one \nturned to Christ, although the people were friendly enough. Despite a \nhealthy location, illness dogged the missionaries. At times their \nefforts seemed fruitless. Seven years after arriving, they had seen \nno evidence that a single soul had converted. It was three more years \nbefore they baptized their first convert, Ting Ang, on July 7, 1857. \nBy 1867 only a minute fraction of Fuchau's population, a mere 450 \npeople, had become Christians. It was enough to fill a single church.\u0014\n\u0014\nA phenomenon of our time is the explosive growth of the Chinese \nchurch. This did not come about by accident. One of the principles of \n\"chaos\" mathematics is the snowball effect. A tiny change today can \nbuild to an enormous effect later. The seemingly insignificant work \nof the Methodists in Fuchau was one of many streams which contributed \nto today's resilient and faithful Chinese church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch tiny beginnings suggest the timeless power of individual acts of \ngoodness. Phoebe Palmer was a prominent face in that concourse of \nChristian effort.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGross, Ernie. This Day in Religion.

    "words": "Thom Rainer is an insightful analyst of churches and their \nleadership.\\He recently posted an article (at \\ThomRainer.com) based \non some startling LifeWay Research findings, demonstrating that more \nthan half of all pastors are experiencing discouragement and \nloneliness. When pastors are hurting, churches are hurting.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is this happening? Thom suggests several factors:\u0014\n\u0014\n Spiritual warfare. The Enemy does not want God's servants to be \neffective in ministry. He will do whatever it takes to hurt ministers \nand their ministries.\u0014\n\u0014\n Unrealistic expectations. The expectations and demands upon a pastor \nare enormous. They are unrealistic. But if one person's expectations \nare not met, that person can quickly let the pastor know that he is a \nfailure.\u0014\n\u0014\n Greater platforms for critics. In \"the good old days,\" a critic was \ntypically limited to telephone, mail, and in-person meetings to \ncriticize a minister. Today the critics have the visible and \npervasive platforms of email, blogs, and social media such as \nFacebook and Twitter.\u0014\n\u0014\n Failure to take time away from the church or place of ministry. \nWorkaholism leads to burnout. Burnout leads to depression.\u0014\n\u0014\n Marriage and family problems. Too often the pastor neglects his \nfamily as he cares for the larger church family.\u0014\n\u0014\n Financial strains. Many pastors simply do not have sufficient income \nfrom the churches they serve. That financial stress can lead to \ndepression. Some pastors do not know how to manage they money they do \nhave, leading to further financial strain.\u0014\n\u0014\n The problem of comparison. Every pastor will always know of a church \nthat is larger and more effective. Every pastor will always know of \nanother pastor who seems more successful. The comparison game can be \ndebilitating to some pastors.\u0014",

    "words": "Protestants No Longer the Majority in U.S., Study Says\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first time in its history, the United States does not have a \nProtestant majority, according to a new study by the Pew Forum on \nReligion & Public Life, Fox News reports. The percentage of \nProtestant adults in the U.S. has reached a low of 48 percent, the \nfirst time the Pew Forum has reported with certainty that the number \nhas fallen below 50 percent. The drop has long been anticipated, and \ncomes at a time when no Protestants are on the Supreme Court and \nwhen, for the first time, no Protestants are on the Republican \npresidential ticket. \u0014\n\u0014\nPew cited among the reasons for the change the growth in \nnondenominational Christians who can no longer be categorized as \nProtestant, and the rise in the number of Americans with no religious \naffiliation. The study found that about 20 percent of Americans say \nthey have no religion, an increase from 15 percent in the last five \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 10/10/12\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LAURIE GOODSTEIN,  New York Times   10/10/12\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first time since researchers began tracking the religious \nidentity of Americans, fewer than half said they were Protestants, a \nsteep decline from 40 years ago when Protestant churches claimed the \nloyalty of more than two-thirds of the population. \u0014\n\u0014\nA new study released on Tuesday by the Pew Forum on Religion and \nPublic Life found that it was not just liberal mainline Protestants, \nlike Methodists or Episcopalians, who abandoned their faith, but also \nmore conservative evangelical and born again Protestants. The \nlosses were among white Protestants, but not among black or minority \nProtestants, the study found, based on surveys conducted during the \nsummer. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they leave, instead of switching churches, they join the growing \nranks who do not identify with any religion. Nearly one in five \nAmericans say they are atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular. \u0014\nThis is a significant jump from only five years ago, when adults who \nclaimed no religion made up about 15 percent of the population. It \nis a seismic shift from 40 years ago, when about 7 percent of \nAmerican adults said they had no religious affiliation. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, more than one-third of those ages 18 to 22 are religiously \nunaffiliated. These younger millennials are replacing older \ngenerations who remained far more involved with religion throughout \ntheir lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe really havent seen anything like this before, said Gregory A. \nSmith, a senior researcher with the Pew Forum. Even when the baby \nboomers came of age in the early 70s, they were half as likely to be \nunaffiliated as compared with young people today. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nones, as they are called, now make up the nations \nsecond-largest religious grouping. The largest single faith group is \nCatholics, who make up about 22 percent of the population. Their \nnumbers have held steady, mostly because an influx of immigrants has \nreplaced the many Catholics who were raised in the church and left in \nthe last five years, Mr. Smith said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise in people who claim no religion is likely to have political \nconsequences, said Phil Zuckerman, a professor of sociology and \nsecular studies at Pitzer College in Southern California. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe significant majority of the religiously unaffiliated tend to be \nleft-leaning, tend to support the Democratic Party, support gay \nmarriage and environmental causes, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pew report offers several theories to explain the rise of the \nreligiously unaffiliated. One theory is that the young adults grew \ndisillusioned with organized religion when evangelical Protestant and \nCatholic churches became so active in conservative political causes, \nlike opposition to homosexuality and abortion. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother theory is that the shift merely reflects a broader trend away \nfrom social and community involvement, the phenomenon dubbed bowling \nalone by Robert D. Putnam, a public policy professor at Harvard \nUniversity. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother explanation is that the United States is simply following the \ntrend toward secularization already seen in many economically \ndeveloped countries, like Australia and Canada and some in Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States has always been the great exception to this \nsecularizing trend, and it is not clear that Americans are \nnecessarily moving toward the European model.\u0014",

    "words": "Plummeting Protestants Become a Minority\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Tony Cartledge\u0014\nPosted: Monday, October 15, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders ... continue to scratch their heads, wondering why \nreligious affiliation continues to skid, fearing that America will \nfollow Western Europe, where church attendance has plummeted, \nCartledge writes.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants in America made big news last week  by officially \nbecoming a minority. \u0014\n\u0014\nA major study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life in 2007 \nshowed that American Protestants, at 51.3 percent of the population, \nwere \"on the verge of becoming a minority Protestant country.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA smaller, 2012 study by the Pew Forum shows that we've clearly \ncrossed the line: just 48 percent of Americans now identify \nthemselves as Protestant, down from 62 percent in 1972.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther denominational preferences include 22 percent reporting as \nCatholic, 2 percent are Mormon, 1 percent are Orthodox, and 6 percent \nbelong to another faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest factor in the shrinking Protestant numbers is the rise of \nthe \"nones,\" people who identify with no religion at all, now 20 \npercent of the population.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese include those who identify as atheists and agnostics (about 2 \npercent together), with 14 percent saying \"nothing in particular\" and \n2 percent checking \"don't know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt comes as no surprise that younger adults are more likely to be \nunaffiliated: more than a third of \"younger millennials\" (age 18-22) \nindicate no religious preference, while only 5 percent of those 80 \nand older and 9 percent of Americans 67 to 79 years old state no \nreligious affiliation.\u0014\n\u0014\nYounger generations are showing a steady erosion in religious \ninvolvement: in 2012, 21 percent of Gen Xers (now 32-47) and 15 \npercent of Baby Boomers (age 48-66) describe themselves as \nreligiously unaffiliated, according to the Pew report, both up 3 \npercentage points (from 18 percent and 12 percent in 2007).\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders, of course, continue to scratch their heads, wondering \nwhy religious affiliation continues to skid, fearing that America \nwill follow Western Europe, where church attendance has plummeted.\u0014\nAny number of factors comes into play as culture and society evolve, \nand as the stigma of being religiously unaffiliated lessens.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't claim to have an answer or any survey data to back it up, but \none thing remains true, I think: the appeal of any religious group \nhinges largely on the public perception of those who profess it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Protestant Christians are perceived as judgmental, hypocritical or \nuncaring, their numbers will continue to decline.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we're seen as accepting, hopeful, loving people who care for each \nother and the world, we have a much better chance of attracting \nothers. Who doesn't want to feel acceptance, hope and love?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the secular world does a better job of demonstrating those things \nthan the church, we should not be surprised to see the numbers \ncontinue to swing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge is associate professor of Old Testament at Campbell \nUniversity Divinity School and contributing editor to Baptists Today, \nwhere he blogs.\u0014",

    "words": "Theres something rotten in the N.F.L., an obviously dysfunctional \nculture that either brings out sad, destructive behavior in its \nfearsome gladiators or fails to protect them and those around them \nfrom it. And while its too soon to say whether Belcher himself was a \nvictim of that culture, its worth noting that the known facts and \nemerging details of his story echo themes all too familiar in pro \nfootball over recent years: domestic violence, substance abuse, \nerratic behavior, gun possession, bullets fired, suicide. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis death was the most stunning N.F.L. news of the last few days, but \nnot the only peek into a world of tortured souls and crippled bodies. \nIn The Times, Judy Battista reported that this year would be a record \none for drug suspensions in the league, a result in part of an \napparent rise in the use of the stimulant Adderall. The record could \nreflect heightened vigilance by league officials, but still: the high \nstakes, physical demands and physical agony inherent in pro football \nindisputably encourage drug taking, and some oft-medicated players \ngraduate to years of addiction problems. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe scientific journal Brain just published a study by Boston \nUniversity investigators of 85 people who had received repeated hits \nto their heads while they were alive and were examined posthumously \nfor degenerative brain disease. Sixty-eight of those people had such \ndisease, which can lead to mood swings, dementia, depression. Fifty \nof them had played football, 33 in the N.F.L., including Dave \nDuerson, the former Chicago Bears safety who shot himself fatally in \nthe chest last year after sending his ex-wife a text message \nrequesting that his brain tissue be analyzed for football-related \ndamage. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe studys publication follows the consolidation earlier this year \nof more than 100 lawsuits involving more than 3,000 former N.F.L. \nplayers and their families, who accuse the league and its official \nhelmet maker of hiding information about the relationship between \ninjuries on the field and brain damage. It also follows the \nrevelation this year that the New Orleans Saints engaged in a bounty \nprogram by which defensive players got extra money for knocking \nopponents out of games. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn May the former San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, a \nveritable legend whom Id known for years as Nemesis No. 1 of my \nbeloved Denver Broncos, shot and killed himself, and in a \nheartbreaking assessment of his demise five months later, the San \nDiego Union-Tribune noted that within two years of retiring, three \nout of four N.F.L. players will be one or more of the following: \nalcohol or drug addicted; divorced; or financially \ndistressed/bankrupt. Junior Seau was all three. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same article, the newspaper reported that the suicide rate for \nmen who have played in the N.F.L. is nearly six times the national \naverage. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Union-Tribune maintains a database of N.F.L. players arrested \nsince 2000. The list is long, and the league is lousy with criminal \nactivity so varied it defies belief. The quarterback Michael Vick of \ncourse staged inhumane dog fights; the wide receiver Plaxico Burress \naccidentally shot himself in the leg with a gun hed toted illegally \ninto a nightclub; the wide receiver Dez Bryant was accused of \nassaulting his own mother. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow all of this misfortune and all of these misdeeds do and dont \nrelate to one another isnt clear. But to be an N.F.L. fan these days \nis to feel morally conflicted, even morally compromised, because \nyoure supporting something that corrodes too many lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chiefs quarterback Brady Quinn said on Sunday that Belchers \nbloody end left him wondering what I could have done differently. \nThats a question that everyone in the N.F.L. should mull. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrank Bruni, New York Times, 12/3/12\u0014",

    "words": "Post-Election Fight over the 'Evangelical' Brand\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Daly, other leaders want 'evangelical' to be less about politics.\u0014\nTobin Grant \u0014\n\u0014\n[ posted 11/20/2012 ] Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nlection night did not go the way most evangelicals wanted. President \nObama's reelection, losses by social conservative candidates in red \nstates, and outcomes of four same-sex marriage ballot initiatives are \nall causing some evangelical leaders to reexamine what it means to be \nan \"evangelical\" in American politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary president Al Mohler called the \nelection a \"catastrophe\" and a \"disaster\" for evangelicals. Mohler \ntold The New York Times that the \"disaster\" was more than the \noutcomeit was how social conservatives lost.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's not that our messagewe think abortion is wrong, we think \nsame-sex marriage is wrongdidn't get out. It did get out,\" \nMohlersaid. \"It's that the entire moral landscape has changed. An \nincreasingly secularized America understands our positions, and has \nrejected them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile social conservative groups think that the election loss was due \nto a failure of Republicans to emphasize social issues, other \nevangelical leaders are calling for a divorce of evangelicalism from \npartisan politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourners president Jim Wallis said the elections were not a \ndisaster for evangelicals per se, just those who \"had again tied \ntheir faith to the partisan political agenda of the Republican Party.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWallis wants evangelicals to be defined by their faith, not their \npolitics. \"Evangelical,\" said Wallis, is too often equated with \n\"conservative white evangelical.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a post-election poll by the Pew Center for the People \nand the Press, 22 percent of Americans are white, self-described \nevangelicals. Of these, 84 percent voted for Republican candidate \nMitt Romney. When non-whites are included in the evangelical \ncategory, evangelicals make up 31 percent of the electorate. This \nalso makes them less Republican, but still solidly in the GOP camp. \n65 percent of all evangelicals voted for Romney, keeping it one of \nthe most-Republican demographic groups in the electorate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The ironic and tragic thing about the religious right is how little \nof their own agenda they have achieved. And by voting for a \nconservative ideological agenda, they have actually hurt the poor, \nresisted immigration reform, promoted endless wars, and neglected the \nenvironment,\" Wallis said. \"There is a new evangelical agenda for a \nnew evangelical demographic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWallis's critique is echoed by conservatives. Matthew Lee Anderson, \nfounder and lead writer of Mere Orthodoxy, said that evangelicals and \nconservatives \"seem to be standing by the status quo of viewing \npolitics as the most significant cultural bellweather [sic] on the \none hand and of privileging the acquisition of political power over \nprinciples on the other. It's an unholy mess and unbecoming of our \nleadership.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Leithart of New St. Andrews College also said that it was time \nfor a new evangelical politics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Conservative Christians have much to die to,\" Leithart said. \"The \nmore basic death has to be a death to the Reaganite creed on whose \ncoattails the religious right rose to power. Christians have the \nopportunity to construct a genuinely evangelical public philosophy, a \npublic philosophy and practice that is not an ill-fitting addendum to \nthe gospel but arises from the gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFocus on the Family president Jim Daly told National Public Radio \nthat evangelicals need to find ways to collaborate with those who \ndisagree with them politically in order to make progress on major \nsocial problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think as Christians, we need to anchor down, not with hostility \nbut with humility, and just ride this forward and continue to talk to \npeople about the message of Christ, what the Gospel means,\" Daly \nsaid. \"And if that resonates and if people connect, I think the other \nissues will come in line.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Private Jets for Jesus\u0014\nNigeria's Pentecostal preachers say expanding ministries justify \ntheir personal planes. \u0014\nSunday Oguntola in Lagos, Nigeria \u0014\nposted 12/10/2012             Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAllegations of extravagant living among Nigeria's Pentecostal \npreachers have deepened following the gift of a private jet to the \npresident of the Christian Association of Nigeria.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe multi-million dollar jeta 10-seater with a range of 3,900 \nnautical mileswas presented to Ayo Oritsejafor by members of his \ncongregation, Word of Life Bible Church in the oil-rich Delta state \ncity of Warri. The gift celebrated the pastor's birthday and his 40th \nanniversary in ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nOritsejafor, who also serves as president of the Pentecostal \nFellowship of Nigeria, joins a growing list of preachers with private \njets in the West African nation, which is Africa's largest oil \nproducer.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Ministries (popularly \nknown as Winners' Chapel) in Lagos, Nigeria's major port and \nmost-populous city, owns three Gulfstreams (plus a Learjet) worth \nalmost US$100 million. (By contrast, Oritsejafor's Bombardier \nChallenger jet is worth less than US$5 million.) \u0014\n\u0014\nEnoch Adeboye, general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of \nGod, also owns a private jet. So does the flamboyant founder of \nChrist Embassy Church, Chris Oyakhilome.\u0014\n\u0014\nApart from preachers, only top business tycoons and a few governors \nand politicians own private jets in a nation where more than 70 \npercent live on less than US$1 per day.\u0014\n\u0014\nNigeria's wealthy have spent US$6.5 billion on private jets in the \nlast five years, making it Africa's biggest market for private \nplanes. The number of privately-owned aircraft rose by 650 percent \nbetween 2007 and 2012, up from 20 to 150 planes at an average cost of \nUS$50 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut most Christians in Africa's most-populous nation remain poor, \nfueling anger that pastors have been feeding fat on their \nparishioners.\u0014\n\u0014\nGideon Para-Mallam, regional secretary of the International \nFellowship of Evangelical Students, said such preachers are setting \nbad examples.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This represents another minus to Christianity in a country riddled \nwith much corruption,\" he said. \"We are simply displaying the \nrottenness of what has become of Nigeria. It is so sad.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah Gado, president of the 3 million-strong Evangelical Church \nWinning All, agrees. \"Having a private jet is a distraction and an \nindication of the lack of unity in the body,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Oritsejafor defends the gift, maintaining that his private jet is \na necessity and not a luxury. \"Sometimes, my schedule is so \ncomplicated,\" he said at a press conference. \"Now, I can move. I can \neven go and come back home. It is a bit more convenient for me, and I \nsuspect that this is one of the reasons a lot of these other \npreachers have planes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOritsefajor has his defenders. To Wale Oke, national vice president, \nPentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) South West, a jet is just a \ntool for faster evangelization. \"How can an Ayo Oritsejafor, who has \nto minister around the globe, pastor a very large congregation in \nWarri and attend to critical national matters in Abuja cope if he has \nto keep waiting at the airports, in a system where nothing is \npredictable?\" he asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe maintained Pentecostal preachers will buy more jets to cope with \nexpanding ministries. \"They ain't seen anything yet! More of us will \nyet buy and maintain our jets because, by the mercy of God, we have \nbeen given the wisdom to do so.\"\u0014",

    "words": "In 2005, townspeople in Gevas, Turkey, watched in horror as one sheep \njumped to its death, and then 1,500 others followed over the same \ncliff. When the villagers, whose livelihoods depended on the flock, \nreached the bottom of the mountain, they found a billowy white pile \nof death. Some 450 sheep were lost, but amazingly 1,000 survived. As \nthe pile grew, the dead bodies cushioned the fall of other sheep.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did this accident happen? The shepherds responsible for \nprotecting the flock had left the sheep on the mountain to eat \nbreakfast, and then the fleeces started to fly.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe importance of a shepherd is inversely proportional to the \nintelligence of the animal being shepherded. Dogs, for example, \nmanage to survive fairly well without human oversight. Dolphins do \neven better. Sheep, on the other hand, don't have the good sense not \nto jump off a cliff. They need a shepherd to survive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Scripture compares God's people to sheep ought to \nhumble us. We need godly shepherds to lead, feed, and protect us from \nthe world and from ourselves. We are irrefutably sinful (and often \nstupid) creatures willing to throw ourselves off cliffs of \nself-destruction. This truth, however, can tempt shepherds to \noverstep their role. Sometimes the most difficult part about pastoral \nministry is knowing what is not our responsibility.\u0014",

She then seems \nto contradict herself by saying, \"For many of us, what happened in \nNewtown only reinforces our conviction that there must be a God.\" I'm \nnot sure one can have it both ways. \u0014\n\u0014\n If you think there is a God who affects human behavior and this God \nis omnipresent, then God watched as the Newtown children and adults \nwere slaughtered. And he or she also watched during every \u0014\nother earthly event where humans were slaughtered, e.g., the Jews, \nArmenians, Catholics, Protestants, Sunnis, Shiites, Native Americans, \nBosnian Muslims, Hutu, Tutsi, etc. Furthermore, God was present when \npeople died in mine accidents, shipwrecks, tsunamis, earthquakes, \nmudslides, etc. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen people see God's impact only in positive, loving or miraculous \nbehavior, they are engaging in wishful thinking.

That's pretty typical for restaurants serving \nlarger parties and is normally posted on the menu.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, this particular minister took the ticket, zeroed out the \ngratuity line, and wrote in: \"I give God 10 percent.

    "words": "1 Corinthians 11:23-26\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is essential that we look closely at the context in which Paul \npresents the Words of Institution of the Eucharist here. We can \neasily overlook the fact that Pauls primary concern in 1 Corinthians \n11:1714:40 is not the Words of Institution. Instead, Pauls primary \nconcern is to command the followers of Jesus in Corinth to change the \nways in which they were eating food when they were gathered together. \nThe ones who were affluent had not been sharing their food with the \nones who were poor. Apparently, even when they used the Eucharistic \nwords, they were not participating together, but separately. Some of \nthem were very disrespectful of others in the community of believers. \nBecause they were not resolving these difficulties and problems, Paul \nsternly chided them for their behavior. He was not scolding them for \ntheir lack of intellectual understanding of the mystery of the \nEucharist. He was chiding them for their segregated behavior, for not \neating and drinking in the Eucharist together, for not having love \nfor and respect for one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is tragic and disrespectful to Jesus and to Paul that even into \nthe 21st century the sharing of pulpit and altar fellowship is \nstill so limited within the Church, even within the same \ndenomination, as it is in my own Lutheran Christian denomination. If \nPaul, not to mention Jesus, were physically present and evaluating us \ntoday, Paul, as Paul indicated in 1 Corinthians 11:1714:40, would \nchide us sternly, not because we have not achieved a single identical \nunderstanding of the mystery of the Eucharist, but because of our \nsegregated behavior, because so many of us refuse to receive the \nEucharist together with others or to permit others to receive the \nEucharist with us. Many of us who are Lutheran Christians refuse to \npermit even other Lutheran Christians to join with us at our altars \nand in our pulpits, because we have decided they these other Lutheran \nChristians are not Lutheran enough, that they do not segregate \nthemselves sufficiently from other Christians who are not Lutheran \nChristians. What would the Apostle Paul, whom especially we who are \nLutheran Christians claim to honor so highly, say about us and our \nfailure to honor the Church as the Body of Christ, comprised as \nPaul put it in 1 Corinthians 12 of many diverse parts (ears, eyes, \nfeet, etc.)?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need much more serious study of Scripture in the Church, \nespecially of Scripture in the context of other Scripture. We need to \nstudy and to use the Words of the Institution of the Eucharist in 1 \nCorinthians 11:23-26 in the context of 1 Corinthians 11:1714:40, not \nisolated from their context as we do in the Holy Thursday selections \nin the Revised Common Lectionary. It would be preferable on Holy \nThursday to be using the Words of Institution in the context of their \nplace in Mark 14, Matthew 26, and Luke 22 in successive years, not \nevery year as they are in a secondary position in 1 Corinthians.\u0014",

It was not immediately clear what evidence there was, \nif any, of a romance.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The girl left her home on Monday and met Anwar Din when villagers \nsaw them,\" said Munir Hussain, the head of the local jirga, or tribal \ncourt, that sentenced Din to death. \"We took the girl into custody \nand took the boy to the local graveyard where he was stoned to death \nand buried.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDin was killed on Monday, he added. A government official, speaking \non condition of anonymity, said the jirga had ruled the woman must be \nshot to death. It was not immediately clear if this had already taken \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe army was not immediately available for comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nKurram, the only part of Pakistan's largely lawless border region \nthat has a significant Shi'ite population, is racked by sectarian \nviolence between Sunni and Shi'ite tribes. Anti-Shi'ite ideology from \nthe Taliban and al Qaeda has meant years of bloody fighting.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibi is Shi'ite while Din was Sunni, Hussain added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Federally Administered Tribal Areas have never been fully \nintegrated into Pakistan's administrative, economic or judicial \nsystem.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, families and tribes often take justice into their own hands, \npresiding over \"jirgas\" or \"panchayats\", gatherings of elders that \nhand down punishments including rape, killing and the bartering of \nwomen to settle scores and restore honor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn such tribal justice, women often fair far worse than men.\u0014\n\u0014\nHussain said that the jirga had also requested that another Pakistani \nsoldier, Saif Ullah, be handed over for helping the couple meet and \ncoordinate the planned elopement.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The army is here for our security but if they engage in such \nactivities we will not let them stay here,\" Hussain said. \"This is an \ninsult to tribal customs. We will revolt against this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(Writing By Mehreen Zahra-Malik; Editing by Amie Ferris-Rotman and \nNick Macfie)\u0014\n Thomson Reuters 2011.\u0014",

Having said that, we \nhave pretty much exhausted our knowledge of his background.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe began his short term on this day, April 18, 309 or 310. He \nimmediately faced serious problems within the church, which was \nquarreling over whether on not to readmit brethren who had fallen \nfrom the faith during the recent persecutions. Eusebius sided with \nthose who argued for readmittance upon completion of a stiff penance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not everyone was buying this solution. The Novatians said there \nshould be no restoration at all. On the other hand, many of the \nlapsed demanded immediate readmittance to the church. One of these \ngroups elected a rival pope, Heraclius. The squabble erupted into \nviolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nExasperated, Emperor Maxentius exiled both the pope and the antipope. \nEusebius was ordered to Sicily, where he soon died.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a year, no pope was chosen. At the time, Galerius was persecuting \nthe eastern church with great ferocity. When Miltiades finally became \npope in 311, he brought Eusebius' bones back to Rome for an honorable \nburial in the Cemetary of Calixtus. Later, this tomb was damaged. \nHowever, copies of its inscription survived and they tell us almost \neverything that we know about this obscure bishop of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Eusebius defended the tradition of discipline that he had \ninherited, and because he died in banishment he was considered both a \nsaint and a martyr.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrusher, Joseph Stanislaus.

    "words": "Protestants 1st Called Protestants\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen someone asks what religion you are, what do you answer? There \nare a lot of different labels to describe the varieties of Christian \nfollowers, and the word \"Protestant\" is one. It was on this day, \nApril 19, 1529, that the designation \"Protestant\" might be said to \nhave come into existence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMartin Luther had been declared a heretic by both the pope and the \nemperor, but his followers continued to multiply rapidly. Emperor \nCharles V could not suppress the reformers as he wished, because the \nTurks were threatening his empire from the east, and the pope and he \nwere quarreling with each other. In 1521, at Worms, Germany, Charles \nsigned a document which outlawed Luther. Five years later at another \nimperial council, Charles agreed to postpone any settlement of \nreligious issues. He agreed that until an official policy could be \nestablished, every State within his territories would be governed as \nthe ruler thought most pleasing to God. In practice, this meant that \nthroughout Germany's many independent cities, principalities and \nelectorates, the religion of each prince or local ruler became the \nreligion of his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIn 1529 a Diet (Congress) met at Speyer, Germany to consider action \nagainst the Turks and attempt again to come to terms with the \nReformation. The Diet forbade any extension of the Reformation until \na German council could meet the following year. Charles V declared he \nwould wipe out the Lutheran \"heresy.\" Five reforming princes and \nfourteen cities drafted a protest, a formal legal appeal, for \nthemselves, their subjects and all who then or in the future should \nbelieve in the Word of God. (It was not formally published until \nJuly.) \u0014\n\u0014\nEight years before, Martin Luther was a lone monk standing for the \nWord of God and liberty of conscience at the Diet of Worms. But by \n1529, the world had changed: there was an organized party of \ngovernment leaders with consciences bound by the Word of God against \ntyrannical authority. Not every protester was a Lutheran. The whole \nparty of the reformers needed a name. From the protest and appeal at \nthe Diet of Speyer, these breakaways from the Roman Church began to \nbe called Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday Protestants are one of three major branches of Christianity. \nWhile all three hold the same fundamental creed, other differences \nare many. Perhaps the key difference is that while the Eastern \nOrthodox and Roman traditions combine the Scripture with the \nauthority of church tradition or of a pope, Protestants claim to find \nthe sole authority for their faith in the Bible, the Word of God. \nMany can also be identified because they accept the priesthood of all \nbelievers and the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBezold, Friedrich von.

    "words": "Pius V Excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tDuring the Reformation, England broke away from the Roman Church. \nMary Tudor briefly reestablished the connection, but when Elizabeth \ncame to the throne, she saw that it was politically expedient (and \nperhaps morally preferable) to uphold the reformed church and did so. \nLike her father before her, she headed the English church through an \nact of Parliament, although her private chapel services remained more \nCatholic than Protestant.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn this day, April 27, 1570, Pope Pius V issued a bull against her. \nHe claimed that there was no \tsalvation outside the Roman Church and \nthat the pope alone was successor to Peter and head of the earthly \nchurch. The ungodly had grown in power and \"Elizabeth, the pretended \nqueen of England and the servant of crime, has assisted in this.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe pope went on to excommunicate Elizabeth. \"...we do out of the \nfullness of our apostolic power declare the foresaid Elizabeth to be \na heretic and favorer of heretics, and her adherents in the matters \naforesaid to have incurred the sentence of excommunication and to be \ncut off from the unity of the body of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his fourth point, he said \"And moreover (we declare) her to be \ndeprived of her pretended title to the aforesaid crown and of all \nlordship, dignity and privilege whatsoever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe forbade all nobles, subjects and people to obey Elizabeth on pain \nof excommunication. This, of course, placed England's Catholics in a \ntrying position. While most were loyal to the throne, some used the \npapal statement as an excuse to plot against Elizabeth for the \npurpose of replacing her with a Catholic. Elizabeth cracked down on \nthese opponents with vigor. Innocent Catholics suffered alongside the \nguilty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bull concluded with the words, \"Given at St. Peter's at Rome, on \n27 April 1570 of the Incarnation; in the fifth year of our \npontificate.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth survived this blast and maintained high popular approval \nduring much of her reign.

    "words": "June 13, 2013, New York Times\u0014\n \u0014\nCensus Benchmark for White Americans: More Deaths Than Births\u0014\n\u0014\nBy SAM ROBERTS\u0014\n\u0014\nDeaths exceeded births among non-Hispanic white Americans for the \nfirst time in at least a century, according to new census data, a \nbenchmark that heralds profound demographic change. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe disparity was tiny  only about 12,000  and was more than made \nup by a gain of 188,000 as a result of immigration from abroad. But \nthe decrease for the year ending July 1, 2012, coupled with the fact \nthat a majority of births in the United States are now to Hispanic, \nblack and Asian mothers, is further evidence that white Americans \nwill become a minority nationwide within about three decades. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver all, the number of non-Hispanic white Americans is expected to \nbegin declining by the end of this decade. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese new census estimates are an early signal alerting us to the \nimpending decline in the white population that will characterize most \nof the 21st century, said William H. Frey, a demographer with the \nBrookings Institution. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe transition will mean that todays racial and ethnic minorities \nwill no longer be dependent on older whites for their economic \nwell-being, Dr. Frey said. In fact, the situation may be reversed. \nIt makes more vivid than ever the fact that we will be reliant on \nyounger minorities and immigrants for our future demographic and \neconomic growth, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe viability of programs like Social Security and Medicare, Dr. Frey \nsaid, will be reliant on the success of waves of young Hispanics, \nAsians and blacks who will become the bulwark of our labor force. \nThe issues of minorities, he added, will hold greater sway than ever \nbefore.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2010, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, more \nnon-Hispanic whites died than were born in 11 states, including \nCalifornia, Florida and Pennsylvania. White deaths exceeded births in \na majority of counties, including Los Angeles, the most populous. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe disparity between deaths and births in the year that ended last \nJuly surprised experts. They expected that the aging white population \nwould eventually shrink, as it has done in many European countries, \nbut not for another decade or so. \u0014\n\u0014\nNationally, said Kenneth M. Johnson, the senior demographer at the \nCarsey Institute, a research center based at the University of New \nHampshire, the onset of natural decrease between 2011 and 2012 was \nnot anticipated. He attributed the precipitous shift in part to the \nrecession, adding that the growing number of older non-Hispanic \nwhites, which will accelerate rapidly as the baby boom ages, \nguarantees that non-Hispanic white natural decrease will be a \nsignificant part of the nations demographic future.\u0014",

    "words": "Game Changer: Pastors Blame Kids' Sports for Attendance Dips\u0014\n\u0014\nWould embracing organized youth sports help? \u0014\n\u0014\nRuth Moon      8/27/2013    Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans told Gallup they rarely or never attended \nreligious services in 2012. And many pastors blame the secularization \nof Sundays, led by a commonly perceived culprit: children's sports.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's what Steve McMullin found after the Acadia Divinity College \nprofessor interviewed church leaders and members at shrinking \ncongregations. His study, published in the \\Review of Religious \nResearch, showed that pastors most often identified \"competing Sunday \nactivities\"led by youth athletic eventsas the primary reason for \ndeclining worship attendance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sentiment echoes the 2008 Faith Communities Today survey. On its \nlist of \"obstacles making it difficult for people to regularly \nparticipate in [a] congregation,\" pastors cited driving distance, \nconflicts with work schedules, and fear of crime (among other \nreasons).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut children's school and sports activities proved to be \"by far the \ngreatest obstacle.\" This held true for rural, suburban, and urban \nchurches alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, McMullin said, other studies show that children's sports are \nlikely not the main culprit. The families involved in sports programs \nare generally the families that still attend church, he said, so the \nreal cause of shrinking attendance likely lies elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether or not organized sports are Public Enemy No. 1 for churches, \nthey still represent a symbolic challenge: how to engage members in a \nchanging culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sunday has lost its sacredness for most people,\" McMullin said. \n\"Churches need to ask, 'Since that's true, how do we then respond?' \"\u0014\n\u0014\nRather than resenting organized sports, churches should learn to \nembrace their value, said John White, director of Baylor University's \nnew sports ministry and chaplaincy program, which accepted its first \nincoming class last fall.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen done well, children's sports can show the value of play to a \nholistic Christian life, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Most adults don't know how to play,\" said White. \"They just never \nlearned. Oftentimes Christians are the worst at competition, and we \nneed to educate them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSports can teach discipline, friendship, teamwork, and ethics if \nChristians approach them well, he added. White and his family miss \nSunday worship for occasional games. Those events lead to \nconversations about how sports can build character but shouldn't take \nprecedence over church.\u0014\n\u0014\nCollin Sparks, executive director of camp ministries for Kanakuk \nKamps, a sports-themed Christian summer camp, believes sports can \nhelp teach character formation. But he recognizes that sports can \nalso represent misplaced cultural values, which the church should \ncounter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The things that we esteem in our cultureeven in the churchare \nsuccess, accomplishment, being happy,\" he said. \"We'll give thousands \nof dollars to play these games. But we won't give 20 minutes to sit \ndown and read the Bible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany churches are making practical changes to acknowledge the draw of \nsports on family life, said David Roozen, director of the Hartford \nInstitute for Religion Research.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Roozen, 4 in 10 evangelical and historically black \nchurches have at least some program emphasis on team sports, fitness \nactivities, or exercise classes. Compared to their peers, churches \nwith a high emphasis on such programs tend to experience more growth, \naccording to survey data.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome churches have shifted schedules. \"Here in New England, I know \ncongregations that shut down youth programs during ski season,\" said \nRoozen. \"Whether that's adaptive or totally capitulating, I'm not \nsure. They at least recognize that no one's going to show up. That's \nthe world we've become.\"\u0014",

Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets from \ninside the church,\" said the lead detective. \"It was a room that was \nlocated toward the rear of the church that was like a children's \nplayroom.

    "words": "November 26, 2013  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Major Document, Pope Francis Presents His Vision\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ELISABETTA POVOLEDO\u0014\n\u0014\nVATICAN CITY  Pope Francis presented the vision for his papacy on \nTuesday, calling on Catholics to battle what he called the \nglobalization of indifference to create a more compassionate church \nthat champions the poor as it works to achieve social justice in an \nincreasingly secular and money-oriented society. \u0014\n\u0014\nCalled Evangelii Gaudium, (the Joy of the Gospel), the document \noffers the Roman Catholic Church a road map of sorts for navigating \nthe complexities of the modern world, with the Gospel as a compass \nfor what the pope called a new phase of evangelization, one marked \nby enthusiasm and vitality. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe document, a papal pronouncement known as an apostolic \nexhortation, was the first major written work Francis has created \nsince he was chosen eight months ago to lead the 2,000-year-old \nchurch. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt challenges the church to abandon the complacent attitude that \nsays: We have always done it this way,' to find novel, bold and \ncreative ways to speak to the faithfuland to make the church more \nmeaningful. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 84-page document is essentially a compendium of what Pope Francis \nhas said in dozens of speeches and sermons since he became pope in \nMarch. It is the fruit of personal reflection, the Vatican \nspokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said at a news conference. \nThere is coherence between the words of the documents and the \nactions of the pope. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn apostolic exhortation does not define Church doctrine, and the \ndocument makes clear that some issues  like abortion, or the \nordination of women  are not up for discussion. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is an acknowledgment too, that the world has changed, and \nthat the church must change with it. It is time, Pope Francis said, \nfor still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence \nin the Church, in particular in the various other settings where \nimportant decisions are made. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe local church must have greater say in decision-making, and the \nrenewal of the church can only gain strength if it begins from the \nbottom up, the pope said. \u0014\n\u0014\nBishops and priests on the ground have a better sense of the needs of \nthe faithful, as well as their frustrations, and parishes should \nbecome a critical part of the churchs evangelization and outreach. A \nparish should be a point of contact with the homes and the lives of \nits people, and not a useless structure out of touch with people or \na self-absorbed cluster made up of a chosen few, he wrote.\u0014",

    "title": "PHYSICIST DOUBTS THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM",
    "words": "Physicist Aaron Adair is skeptical about the star of Bethlehem\u0014\n\u0014\nKimberly Winston | Dec 23, 2013  RNS\u0014\n\u0014\n(RNS) Aaron Adair earned his Ph.D. in physics from Ohio State \nUniversity. A former Catholic who now identifies as an atheist, he \njust wrote The Star of Bethlehem: A Skeptical View, which examines \ntheories about the stars movement. Next October, he will travel to \nthe Netherlands to speak at a scholarly conference about the star of \nBethlehem. This interview was edited for length and clarity.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: The Gospel of Matthew describes the star as rising in the east \nand leading the Magi from north to south. He also describes it as \nhovering over the house where Jesus stayed. What could have done all \nthose things? Could it have been a meteor or a comet?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: It could not have been a meteor because they are extremely common \nand short-lived and could not have hovered over Jesus location. \nThere was a comet in about 5 B.C.E. but it would have been moving in \nthe wrong direction. And comets were considered the most ominous sign \nin ancient astrology, not something that would herald the coming of a \nJewish king.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: What about a supernova or an alignment of the planets?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: Well, it could not have been a supernova because they do not move \nin the sky and we have no historical evidence that any were seen at \nthe time  and someone would have noticed a supernova. And as for an \nalignment of the planets, they do not move the way the star of \nBethlehem is described as having moved.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: My favorite is that the star was actually a UFO. Why would anyone \nbelieve this theory?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: It actually fits the description of the star in the Gospels. A UFO \ncan move around and look like anything it wants to, given sufficient \ntechnology. It could lead people to a location and hover over a \nparticular spot and say, for example, Eat at Joes. And \nsufficiently advanced aliens could have communicated with the Magi. \nBut all this just means it is imaginable. Of course the problem is, \nwe dont know if there are intelligent aliens out there or whether \nthey traveled to Earth to mess around with a few local Palestinians.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: If the star of Bethlehem wasnt historical, was it a symbol?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: I think the story of the star is written in a way that in part \ntries to co-opt a common myth of the Romans  that a star guided \nAeneas to found the city of Rome. Matthew was superseding that myth \nby using the star to say Jesus, even as a baby is more worthy of \nworship than the warrior Aeneas ever was. This is a common practice \nin mythology  co-opting an old myth and changing it to express new \nvalues. And it seems to be there as part of the Gospels fulfillment \nof Old Testament Scripture. There was a prophecy of a star rising \nthat would symbolize the new Jewish king. It was to show that Jesus \nwas the new Moses, the new King David and the great final prophet of \nthe Christian faith. It is there to align the New Testament with \nJewish Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: What is it about the star of Bethlehem that makes us want to \nprove, or disprove it?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: For believers, it would be a way to have science tell us that \nsomething from the Gospel stories is true. And for the broader \naudience, it would show a harmony between science and religion, a \nplace where most people think theres conflict. I think it is \ncomforting to believe it is actually true. It was comforting for me \nwhen I first learned about it and I was pretty much a Catholic deist \nat the time. It said there is a God who does not need miracles to get \nthings done and that seemed like a more interesting and amazing God \nthan one who does.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: Why did you want to write this book?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: I did not write the book in such a way to overthrow Christianity, \nonly literalist forms of it at best. I argue about the literary \nnature of the gospel and the message it is going for, so a liberal \nChristian would have no problems with it. So I may disprove the \nhistoricity of the star of Bethlehem, but I help discover the real \nmessage in the story.\u0014",

    "words": "Presbyterians Vote to Allow \nSame-Sex Marriages\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LAURIE GOODSTEIN   JUNE 19, 2014  NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDETROIT  The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) voted at its General \nAssembly on Thursday to change its constitutions definition of \nmarriage from a man and a woman to two people, and to allow its \nministers to perform same-sex marriages where it is legal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth measures, passed by large majorities, are a reversal for a \nchurch that in 1991 and in 2008 barred its pastors from performing \nsame-sex marriages, and that has held ecclesiastical trials for \nministers who violated the ban and blessed gay couples.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Presbyterian Church, a historic mainline Protestant denomination \nthat spans a broad spectrum from liberal to conservative \nevangelicals, has been mired in the debate over homosexuality for \nabout three decades. The General Assemblys decision in 2010 to \nordain openly gay ministers caused many congregations, including some \nof the largest, to depart.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe convention hall fell silent as the vote counts were announced, in \ndeference to a plea by the churchs moderator, leading the session, \nto be respectful of the divide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were some of us with tears of joy, and some of us with tears \nof grief, said the Rev. Susan De George, stated clerk of the Hudson \nRiver Presbytery, in New York, a lesbian minister who years ago was \namong those brought up on charges for blessing same-sex unions. \nAfter the vote, the first thing I did was to text a friend on the \nother side of the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Presbyterians follow other religious groups that have taken \nsimilar steps, including the United Church of Christ, which affirmed \nequal marriage rights for couples regardless of gender in 2005; \nQuakers; the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations; and \nthe Reform and Conservative movements in Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe vote giving discretion to ministers to marry gay couples takes \neffect on Sunday, at the close of the General Assembly.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut changing the definition of marriage in the churchs Book of Order \nwould still require ratification by a majority of the churchs 172 \nregions, or presbyteries  a yearlong process. At the assembly in \nDetroit, the measure passed overwhelmingly  71 percent to 29 percent \n but only after an amendment that altered the language of the change \nfrom two people to two people, traditionally a man and a woman, a \nnod to conservatives who would otherwise have voted against it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe votes delighted observers and participants at the assembly who \nhave been pushing for gay equality, many draped in hand-knit \nrainbow-colored stoles.\u0014\n\u0014\nCompared with previous General Assemblies, this has felt completely \ndifferent, said Alex McNeill, a candidate for ordination and the \nexecutive director of More Light Presbyterians, a group advocating \ngay equality in the church. There is such a sense of growth and \nmutual respect across the theological spectrum.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it deeply pained those Presbyterian commissioners in the churchs \nconservative wing, who warned that congregations that have been on \nthe brink of departure would leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy heart breaks, the Rev. Steve Wilkins, representing the New \nHarmony Presbytery in South Carolina, said during the debate. I \ndont think its up to us to change the definition of marriage; in \nfact marriage has been defined by us and revealed to us in Gods \nword.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 350 of the denominations congregations have left since 2010, \nwhen the General Assembly voted to ordain openly gay clergy members, \nsaid the Rev. Gradye Parsons, the churchs stated clerk, in an \ninterview. But it is still the nations largest Presbyterian \ndenomination, with 10,038 churches in 2013 and about 1.8 million \nmembers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the measure to allow the clergy to perform same-sex marriages, the \nvote of the 565 commissioners was 61 percent in favor, and 39 percent \nopposed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rev. Jeffrey Bridgeman, pastor of El Montecito Presbyterian \nChurch, in California, served as the moderator of the 71-member \ncommittee that voted overwhelmingly to endorse both resolutions, even \nthough, personally, he is opposed to same-sex marriage. He said in an \ninterview before the vote that 10 of the 33 churches in his \npresbytery had left in the past two years, but that his quite \nconservative church was staying for now because they feel they have \na ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe assembly also passed a resolution to undertake a churchwide \nreconciliation effort to reach out to congregations that disagree \nwith these decisions but want to remain in the denomination. But \nchurch leaders said they had no concrete plans yet for how the church \ncould promote reconciliation in the next year while each presbytery \nmust debate and vote whether to ratify changing the definition of \nmarriage in the Book of Order.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeath Rada, the newly elected moderator of the church, said at a news \nconference that he thought the measures passed because many \nPresbyterians were simply tired of having themselves and their church \ndefined by the controversy over homosexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think the fact that a decision has been made is viewed as a relief \nin many ways, he said, because were so much more than that issue.\u0014",

He was then told to get into the hole and was told that \ndepending on how he acts would determine if he would leave alive.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n[Redacted] said he was afraid he was going to be killed and begged \nboth Nick and DJ for one more chance.

    "words": "Painful Council Met at Ephesus\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Third Ecumenical Council opened on this day June 22, 431 in the \ncity of Ephesus in Asia Minor. It was called to resolve a dogmatic \ncontroversy that had divided the church into two main camps. Theodore \nof Mopsuestia, supported by Nestorius, Archbishop of Constantinople, \nheld to what has become known as the Nestorian heresy. The opposite \ncamp was represented by Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, the pope, \nand emperor Theodosius the Younger. Theodosius, who called the \nCouncil, believed that the strength of his empire depended upon true \nworship of God without the intermingling of falsehood. Two hundred \nfathers attended.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nestorian teaching originated in the school of Antioch, and was \ntaught by Diodorus and by Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia. What was \nthe heresy? These men did not accept the Orthodox belief that the \nhuman and divine natures of Christ were united from the instant of \nthe Word's conception in the womb of Mary. A symbol of this \ncontroversy was the acceptance or non-acceptance of the title, \n\"Theotokos,\" or \"God Bearer,\" translated in the West to \"Mother of \nGod,\" for the Virgin Mary. Of course that did not mean that Mary was \nthe Mother of the eternal and indivisible Trinity, but that she was \nthe mother, not just of the man Christ, but of the complete God-man. \nIt was and remains in the Orthodox world as a title intended to \nemphasize the union of the two natures. But the term \"God-bearer\" is \nalso used for saints in the Orthodox church, such as the \"God-bearing \nFathers,\" meaning those who lived Christ-like lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius verbally and in writing refused to accept the title \nTheotokos (God-bearer) for Mary, the mother of Jesus. In doing so, \nthe rest of the church felt he he was proclaiming his refusal to \naccept the two natures of Christ. He was embittered by the refusal of \nthe \"other side\" to agree with his teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has been pointed out many times that there was competition -- \nsometimes fierce -- between Alexandria and Constantinople. Alexandria \nwanted a Patriarch who would understand the needs of the African \nChurch and listen to her theologians. They were very unhappy with \nNestorius. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council opened under Cyril, a thoroughly unsympathetic figure, \nand a master of political intrigue. He had the agreement of Pope \nCelestine (who was deceased by the time the council began). Cyril was \nno believer in fair play. He opened the proceedings before Nestorius \nand his supporters arrived. For this and other actions, historians \ncriticize Cyril of high-handedness; and of serving as both accuser \nand judge. But Cyril seems to have truly believed Nestorius was \nteaching heresy. In response he adopted a position of his own which \nwas close to the monophysite heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nA careful reading of Nestorius has led some scholars to say he was no \nheretic. Certainly he set out to ensure that the manhood of Christ \nwas not lost in his deity, and eventually, grudgingly allowed the \nterm \"Theotokos\" to be used as long as it was understood Mary did not \nthereby become a deity. Whatever the faults of Cyril's approach, he \nand his camp believed that Nestorianism attacked a basic dogma of the \nChurch -- the very nature of Christ himself. They reacted fiercely, \nin the strongest way they knew how.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S. Lives of the Saints.

    "words": "Pit \nbulls: The most hated dog in America \u0014\nTHE WEEK, August 1, 2014\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Wantonly bred,\" \"frequently abused,\" and \"promiscuously abandoned,\" \nthe pit bull is the most misunderstood dog in America, said Tom Junod \nin Esquire. As many as 3,000 pit bulls are euthanized in U.S. \nshelters every day. But despite being widely reviled and passionately \ndefended, pit bull is not even a breed; \"it's a classification\" based \non physical characteristics suggesting a genetic link to the American \nPit Bull Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and similar dogs. \nYet there is no other dog that plays a more central role in the \nnational narrative, usually in the wake of a frightening attack on a \nchild or other innocent bystander. I've owned two pit bulls, and can \ntell you they are not all alike. It's simply not fair to blame all \npit bulls for attacks that result from poor training or mistreatment \nby humans. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's just one more example of a pit bull owner living in denial, \nsaid Heather Wilhelm in Real ClearPolitics.com. Despite overwhelming \nstatistical evidence that pit bulls are \"far and away the most \ndangerous dogs in America,\" enthusiasts insist their pets are \"sweet, \nloving, and funny\" and \"wouldn't hurt a flea.\" But the numbers don't \nlie, said Charlotte Alter in Time. \"Pit bulls make up only 6 percent \nof the dog population, but they're responsible for 68 percent of dog \nattacks and 52 percent of dog-related deaths since 1982.\" Herding \ndogs have been bred to herd, pointing dogs to point. Pit bulls were \nbred to go into a pit and fight with incredible aggression and biting \npower. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they attack, they maul people and other dogs and even kill them. \nAs a plastic surgeon at a children's hospital emergency room, said \nDavid Billmire in The Cincinnati Enquirer, I can tell you that \"the \nproblems associated with dog bites are indeed breed specific.\" I've \nrebuilt the \"noses, lips, eyelids, jaws, and cheeks of numerous \nchildren\" disfigured in pit bull attacks. I watched a child bleed to \ndeath after a pit bull tore his throat out. \"The risk posed by pit \nbulls is equivalent to placing a loaded handgun with the safety off \non the coffee table.\" There are plenty of breeds capable of \npeacefully coexisting with human society. \"How many mauled children \ndo we have to see before we realize the folly of allow- \u0014\ning these dogs to exist?\"\u0014",

    "title": "PITTS COMMENTS ON PAUL RYAN'S VIEW ON POVERTY",
    "words": "Leonard Pitts   August 1. 2014\u0014\nPitts: Paul Ryan breaks the silence\u0014\n\u0014\nCover your eyes and hide the kids: A Republican is talking poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis has not been a pretty picture in the recent past. Who can forget \nthen-South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer likening poor people to \nanimals one feeds from the back door and Nebraska Attorney General \nJon Bruning calling them stray raccoons? And lets not even get into \nMitt Romneys wholesale slander of the so-called 47 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo one receives with a certain trepidation the news that Romneys \nrunning mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, has issued a proposal aimed at curbing \npoverty. But Expanding Opportunity in America, produced by the House \nBudget Committee Ryan chairs, is a surprise  serious, substantive \nand sprinkled with interesting ideas. Not that you should take that \nas a blanket endorsement.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe lack the space to analyze it in detail, but in a nutshell, Ryan \nproposes an Opportunity Grant, consolidating federal anti-poverty \nprograms into 50 chunks of money to be administered by each state as \nit sees fit. The states would be encouraged to experiment and find \ncreative ways of providing the necessary services to their citizens.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is in keeping with GOP orthodoxy which holds that anything \ncrafted by Washington will lack flexibility to meet the needs in \nlocal municipalities and thus it makes more sense to empower states \nto create programs tailored to their specific conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us are skeptical of the idea that giving states more power is \na panacea. Some of us fear all that does is take one problem and turn \nit into 50. But to his credit, Ryans proposal imposes performance \nstandards and requires accountability. It is a blank check, but with \nstrings attached.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne critic, Washington Post blogger (and former Obama administration \neconomic adviser) Jared Bernstein, thinks the proposal reflects the \nGOPs pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is \nwant a job. In that context, its worth noting that Ryan was \nchastised in March for essentially blaming poverty on the laziness of \nblack and brown men. In a radio interview he lamented this tailspin \nof culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and \njust generations of men not even thinking about working or learning \nthe value and the culture of work....\u0014\n\u0014\nThis, of course, ignores the fact that most poverty is neither black \nnor brown, but white. What tailspin of culture keeps Appalachia \npoor? Somehow that question is never addressed. The thing Ryan \napparently does not know, but should, is that urban poverty is driven \nnot by a lack of people wanting to work, but by a lack of work  and \nskills and transportation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWorse, Ryan cited as an authority Charles Murray, the infamous social \nscientist (he co-authored The Bell Curve), who argues the \nintellectual and moral inferiority of black and brown people. Which \nsuggests Ryan, like too many in his party, still needs to wean \nhimself from the noxious notion of poverty as a defect of character \nor heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll that said, give him credit for what hes done here.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a national disgrace that the problem of poverty has been all \nbut invisible in our culture and politics since the era of Lyndon \nJohnson. The only politician over that half-century who lifted it to \nthe level of national discourse was John Edwards  and then he went \nand got his career caught in his zipper.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, one welcomes even this flawed proposal. One hopes it presages \nrenewed GOP interest in an issue the party has largely ceded to the \nDemocrats and spurs us all to reconsider what we can  and should  \ndo to erase the specter of want in a land of plenty. For too long, we \nhave responded to that urgent need only with silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the best thing about Paul Ryans proposal is the simple fact that \nit exists.\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Leonard Pitts at lpitts@miamiherald.com.  2014, The Miami \nHerald Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC\u0014",

    "title": "PASTORS LEARNING FROM THE SUN AND THE WIND",
    "words": "By Travis Collins\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a little boy, my mom told me the fable of a contest \nbetween the sun and the wind. They were arguing about which of the \ntwo was the stronger, when along walked a man wearing a coat. \u0014\nThe wind challenged the sun by saying, \"I'll bet I can get his coat \noff him quicker than \u0014\nyou can,\" and the sun accepted the challenge. So, the wind blew and \nblew and blew \u0014\nuntil the man could hardly keep his feet on the ground. But the \nharder the wind blew, the \u0014\nmore tightly the man pulled his coat around him. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe wind finally gave up. The sun then began to shine gently on the \nman. The sun caressed the man with warmth until the man eventually \nremoved his coat. The moral of the story is that warmth and \u0014\ngentleness are stronger than might and rage. That certainly is true \nof spiritual leadership. \u0014\n\u0014\nEphesians 4:3 offers helpful words for the spiritual leader: \"Speak \nthe truth in love ... Get \u0014\nrid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along \nwith every form of malice.\" \u0014\nKindness, of course, is not synonymous with indulgence or lenience. \nRemember that in the Bible there are two values that must be kept in \nbalance: compassion and In Loving Monday, John Beckett,\u0014\na Christian and a business leader, wrote, \"Compassion without \naccountability produces sentimentalism. Accountability without \ncompassion is harsh and heartless.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, courageous and visionary decisions must be made. \nOpposition must be endured, and inappropriate opposition has to be \nmet head-on. But even when the Christian leader must engage in \nlegitimate confrontation, it should be done in love, \u0014\nwith an attitude of humility and respect.\u0014\n \u0014\nCallousness is not an admirable attitude for a spiritual leader. \nNastiness, unfortunately, seems to be on the rise in some ministerial \ncircles. I have heard pastors brag about the uproar they raised while \nbringing about changes. \u0014\n \u0014\nIn conversations with fellow pastors, I have heard some disparage the \nold spoilsports who opposed the pastors. Some of the pastors have \neven appeared proud of the number of people who have left the church.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe arrogant ministers have collected those stories of church clashes \nlike the notches on a gunslinger's pearl-handled revolver. That \nattitude disturbs me more than a little bit.\u0014\n \u0014\nThere seems to be a popular idea circulating in some circles that one \ncannot be compassionate and lead a church through \u0014\nnecessary transitions. I fear that the propagation of that assumption \nis fostering a harshness among some ministers that is both unbecoming \nand unnecessary.\u0014\n \u0014\nI can't decide if this is a martyr complex, a Messianic complex or \nmegalomania. One thing's for sure: it is over the top. \u0014\nCould it be true that some vocational ministers assume the \ndomineering role when when we are least confident in who we are and \nwhat we are doing? \u0014\n\u0014\nReggie McNeal thinks so. In A Work of Heart, he wrote, \"Some leaders \n... claim to operate from 'spiritual authority' when in fact they are \noperating out of a deep sense of insecurity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nInsecure ministers are tempted to throw their weight around, thinking \nthat if they do, they will alienate many people and have a difficult \ntime. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders aren't tyrants, and tyrants aren't good leaders.\u0014\n \u0014\nOf course, mousiness will get you and your church nowhere. But \nkindness, genuine kindness, goes a long way. \u0014\n \u0014\n- Travis Collins is a consultant with the Center for Healthy \nChurches, and the \u0014\nauthor of Tough Calls (New Hope, 2008).\u0014",

    "title": "PUNISHMENT OR CHILD ABUSE?",
    "words": "Punishment or Child Abuse?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy MICHAEL ERIC DYSON                 SEPT. 17, 2014    New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON  THE indictment last week of the N.F.L. player Adrian \nPeterson by a Texas grand jury for reckless or negligent injury to a \nchild has set into relief the harmful disciplinary practices of some \nblack families. Mr. Peterson used a switch, a slim, leafless tree \nbranch, to beat his 4-year-old son, raising welts on the youngsters \nlegs, buttocks and scrotum. This is child abuse dressed up as \nacceptable punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile 70 percent of Americans approve of corporal punishment, black \nAmericans have a distinct history with the subject. Beating children \nhas been a depressingly familiar habit in black families since our \narrival in the New World. As the black psychiatrists William H. Grier \nand Price M. Cobbs wrote in Black Rage, their 1968 examination of \npsychological black life: Beating in child-rearing actually has its \npsychological roots in slavery and even yet black parents will feel \nthat, just as they have suffered beatings as children, so it is right \nthat their children be so treated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lash of the plantation overseer fell heavily on children to whip \nthem into fear of white authority. Terror in the field often gave way \nto parents beating black children in the shack, or at times in the \npresence of the slave owner in forced cooperation to break a \nrebellious childs spirit. Black parents beat their children to keep \nthem from misbehaving in the eyes of whites who had the power to send \nblack youth to their deaths for the slightest offense. Today, many \nblack parents fear that a loose tongue or flash of temper could get \ntheir child killed by a trigger-happy cop. They would rather beat \ntheir offspring than bury them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf beating children began, paradoxically, as a violent preventive of \neven greater violence, it was enthusiastically embraced in black \nculture, especially when God was recruited. As an ordained Baptist \nminister with a doctorate in religion, I have heard all sorts of \nreligious excuses for whippings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I have borne the physical and psychic scars of beatings myself. I \ncant forget the feeling, as a 16-year-old, of my body being lifted \nfrom the floor in my fathers muscular grip as he cocked back his \nfist to hammer me until my mothers cry called him off. I loved my \nfather, but his aggressive brand of reproof left in me a trail of \nun-cried tears.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tLike many biblical literalists, lots of black believers are fond of \nquoting Scriptures to justify corporal punishment, particularly the \nverse in Proverbs 13:24 that says, He who spares the rod hates his \nson, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him. But in \nHebrew, the word translated as rod is the same word used in Psalms \n23:4, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. The shepherds rod \nwas used to guide the sheep, not to beat them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMany believers  including Mr. Peterson, a vocal Christian  have \nconfused the correction of childrens behavior with corporal \npunishment. The word discipline comes from the Latin discipuli, \nwhich means student or disciple, suggesting a teacher-pupil \nrelationship. Punishment comes from the Greek word poine and its \nLatin derivative poena, which mean revenge, and form the root words \nof pain, penalty and penitentiary.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe point of discipline is to transmit values to children. The \npurpose of punishment is to coerce compliance and secure control, and \nfailing that, to inflict pain as a form of revenge, a realm the Bible \nsays belongs to God alone.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYet secular black culture thrives on colorful stories of punishment \nthat are passed along as myths of ancient wisdom  a type of moral \nglue that holds together varying communities in black life across \ntime and circumstance. Black comedians cut their teeth on \ndramatically recalling whoopings with belts, switches, extension \ncords, hairbrushes or whatever implement was at hand. Even as genial \na comic as Bill Cosby offered a riff in his legendary 1983 routine \nthat left no doubt about the deadly threat of black punishment. My \nfather established our relationship when I was 7 years old, Mr. \nCosby joked. He looked at me and says, You know, I brought you in \nthis world, Ill take you out. And it dont make no difference to me, \ncause Ill make another one look just like you. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThere was a study conducted by Dr. Kenneth Dodge which was \nhighlighted in \"Nurture Shock\" that studied the long term effects of \ncorporal...\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe humor is blunted when we recall that Marvin Gayes life ended \nviolently in 1984 at the hands of his father, a minister who \nbrutalized him mercilessly as a child before shooting him to death in \na chilling echo of Mr. Cosbys words.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tPerhaps comedians make us laugh to keep us from crying, but no \nhumor can mask the suffering that studies say our children endure \nwhen they are beaten: feelings of sadness and worthlessness, \ndifficulties sleeping, suicidal thoughts, bouts of anxiety, outbursts \nof aggression, diminished concentration, intense dislike of \nauthority, frayed relations with peers, and negative high-risk \nbehavior.\u0014\n \u0014\n\tEqually tragic is that those who are beaten become beaters too. And \nmany black folks are reluctant to seek therapy for their troubles \nbecause they may be seen as spiritually or mentally weak. The \npathology of beatings festers in the psychic wounds of black people \nthat often go untreated in silence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAdrian Petersons brutal behavior toward his 4-year-old son is, in \ntruth, the violent amplification of the belief of many blacks that \nbeatings made them better people, a sad and bleak justification for \nthe continuation of the practice in younger generations. After Mr. \nPetersons indictment, the comedian D. L. Hughley tweeted: A fathers \nbelt hurts a lot less then a cops bullet!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe is right, of course, but only in a forensic, not a moral or \npsychological sense. What hurts far less than either is the loving \ncorrection of our childrens misbehavior so they become healthy \nadults who speak against violence wherever they find it  in the \nbarrel of a policemans gun, the fist of a lover or the switch of a \nmisguided parent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tMichael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown, is \nwriting a book on President Obama and race.\u0014",

    "words": "Pedophilia: \nA Disorder, Not a Crime\u0014\n                                       By MARGO KAPLAN     OCT. 5, \n2014      New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCAMDEN, N.J.  THINK back to your first childhood crush. Maybe it was \na classmate or a friend next door. Most likely, through school and \ninto adulthood, your affections continued to focus on others in your \napproximate age group. But imagine if they did not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy some estimates, 1 percent of the male population continues, long \nafter puberty, to find themselves attracted to prepubescent children. \nThese people are living with pedophilia, a sexual attraction to \nprepubescents that often constitutes a mental illness. Unfortunately, \nour laws are failing them and, consequently, ignoring opportunities \nto prevent child abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines \npedophilia as an intense and recurrent sexual interest in \nprepubescent children, and a disorder if it causes a person marked \ndistress or interpersonal difficulty or if the person acts on his \ninterests. Yet our laws ignore pedophilia until after the commission \nof a sexual offense, emphasizing punishment, not prevention.\u0014\n\u0014\nPart of this failure stems from the misconception that pedophilia is \nthe same as child molestation. One can live with pedophilia and not \nact on it. Sites like Virtuous Pedophiles provide support for \npedophiles who do not molest children and believe that sex with \nchildren is wrong. It is not that these individuals are inactive or \nnonpracticing pedophiles, but rather that pedophilia is a status \nand not an act. In fact, research shows, about half of all child \nmolesters are not sexually attracted to their victims.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second misconception is that pedophilia is a choice. Recent \nresearch, while often limited to sex offenders  because of the \nstigma of pedophilia  suggests that the disorder may have \nneurological origins. Pedophilia could result from a failure in the \nbrain to identify which environmental stimuli should provoke a sexual \nresponse. M.R.I.s of sex offenders with pedophilia show fewer of the \nneural pathways known as white matter in their brains. Men with \npedophilia are three times more likely to be left-handed or \nambidextrous, a finding that strongly suggests a neurological cause. \nSome findings also suggest that disturbances in neurodevelopment in \nutero or early childhood increase the risk of pedophilia. Studies \nhave also shown that men with pedophilia have, on average, lower \nscores on tests of visual-spatial ability and verbal memory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Virtuous Pedophiles website is full of testimonials of people who \nvow never to touch a child and yet live in terror. They must hide \ntheir disorder from everyone they know  or risk losing educational \nand job opportunities, and face the prospect of harassment and even \nviolence. Many feel isolated; some contemplate suicide. The \npsychologist Jesse Bering, author of Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All \nof Us, writes that people with pedophilia arent living their lives \nin the closet; theyre eternally hunkered down in a panic room.While \ntreatment cannot eliminate a pedophiles sexual interests, a \ncombination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication can help \nhim to manage urges and avoid committing crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the reason we dont know enough about effective treatment is \nbecause research has usually been limited to those who have committed \ncrimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur current law is inconsistent and irrational. For example, federal \nlaw and 20 states allow courts to issue a civil order committing a \nsex offender, particularly one with a diagnosis of pedophilia, to a \nmental health facility immediately after the completion of his \nsentence  under standards that are much more lax than for ordinary \ncivil commitment for people with mental illness. And yet, when it \ncomes to public policies that might help people with pedophilia to \ncome forward and seek treatment before they offend, the law omits \npedophilia from protection.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination against otherwise \nqualified individuals with mental disabilities, in areas such as \nemployment, education and medical care. Congress, however, explicitly \nexcluded pedophilia from protection under these two crucial laws.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts time to revisit these categorical exclusions. Without legal \nprotection, a pedophile cannot risk seeking treatment or disclosing \nhis status to anyone for support. He could lose his job, and future \njob prospects, if he is seen at a group-therapy session, asks for a \nreasonable accommodation to take medication or see a psychiatrist, or \nrequests a limit in his interaction with children. Isolating \nindividuals from appropriate employment and treatment only increases \ntheir risk of committing a crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no question that the extension of civil rights protections to \npeople with pedophilia must be weighed against the health and safety \nneeds of others, especially kids. It stands to reason that a \npedophile should not be hired as a grade-school teacher. But both the \nA.D.A. and the Rehabilitation Act contain exemptions for people who \nare not otherwise qualified for a job or who pose a direct threat \nto the health and safety of others that cant be eliminated by a \nreasonable accommodation. (This is why employers dont have to hire \nblind bus drivers or mentally unstable security guards.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe direct-threat analysis rejects the idea that employers can rely \non generalizations; they must assess the specific case and rely on \nevidence, not presuppositions. Those who worry that employers would \nbe compelled to hire dangerous pedophiles should look to H.I.V. case \nlaw, where for years courts were highly conservative, erring on the \nside of finding a direct threat, even into the late 1990s, when \nmedical authorities were in agreement that people with H.I.V. could \nwork safely in, for example, food services.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemoving the pedophilia exclusion would not undermine criminal \njustice or its role in responding to child abuse. It would not make \nit easier, for example, for someone accused of child molestation to \nplead not guilty by reason of insanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pedophile should be held responsible for his conduct  but not for \nthe underlying attraction. Arguing for the rights of scorned and \nmisunderstood groups is never popular, particularly when they are \nassociated with real harm. But the fact that pedophilia is so \ndespised is precisely why our responses to it, in criminal justice \nand mental health, have been so inconsistent and counterproductive. \nAcknowledging that pedophiles have a mental disorder, and removing \nthe obstacles to their coming forward and seeking help, is not only \nthe right thing to do, but it would also advance efforts to protect \nchildren from harm.\u0014\n\u0014\nMargo Kaplan is an assistant professor at Rutgers School of Law, \nCamden.\u0014",

    "title": "PASTOR BLASTS INERRANCY",
    "words": "Pastor blasts biblical inerrancy\u0014\n\u0014\nFew words in the last 30 years have caused more mischief than the \nterm inerrancy, Richard Kremer told the congregation of Garden \nLakes Baptist Church in Rome, Ga., June 24.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bob Allen\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblical inerrancy  the idea that the Bibles authors were \nsafeguarded against error when inspired by God to write facts about \nscience and history in Scripture  is a misleading and harmful \nconcept that has been used to hurt people and is damaging to the \ncause of Christ, a Baptist pastor in Georgia said recently.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew words in the last thirty years have caused more mischief than \nthe word inerrancy, Pastor Richard Kremer said in his June 24 sermon \nat Garden Lakes Baptist Church in Rome, Ga.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer, who came to Garden Lakes three years ago from St. Johns \nBaptist Church in Charlotte, N.C., said while the word inerrant \nmight seem like a perfectly fine word to describe the authenticity \nand authority of the Bible, the term has been used and manipulated, \nespecially during the divisive area in Southern Baptist life often \ncalled the conservative resurgence.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard KremerThis word has in fact done horrendous damage to the \ncharacter of the Bible and ruined countless lives, Kremer said. The \ncause of Christ is being damaged by its use even now.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a sermon text picked up by a Save Our Shorter website opposed to \nrecent changes at the Georgia Baptist Convention-related Shorter \nUniversity, Kremer referred to a biology professor there who resigned \nbecause his boss wanted him to teach theories like young-earth \ncreationism that have no scientific basis.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn effect, Kremer said, the administrator wanted the professor to \nturn a blind eye to the fossil records, ignore the evidence of \ngeological shifts and continental drifts, ignore the pottery shards \n-- all of which make the point that six thousand years is but a \nsliver of human existence on this earth, much less the history of the \nearth as a whole.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer, who holds a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary, said the reason some people want to \ntreat the Bible like a science book is the doctrine of plenary \nverbal inspiration, which he summarized as, God said it, and \nhumanity wrote it down.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer said there are a few Bible passages that seem to support the \nidea, such as God dictating the Ten Commandments to Moses and \ncommanding Moses to write them down. On the other hand, Kremer said, \nGod would have to be pretty egotistical to dictate words to the \npsalmist to be read back as praise unto himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer said the fact that each of the four Gospels reports different \ndetails surrounding Christs resurrection, such as who was present \nand how many angels were at the empty tomb, shows the Bible wasnt \nintended to convey history in the same way that a modern historian \nwould write a book about the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer noted that the creation account in the first chapter of \nGenesis says that God created \u0014\neverything in the world first and humanity last. Another account in \nChapter 2 God created humanity first, and then followed with the \nnatural order. Kremer said the editor of Genesis was surely smart \nenough to notice the discrepancy, but he didnt care, because he \nwas not proposing a scientific explanation of creation, only that it \nultimately goes back to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer also pointed out that the traditional understanding of \nbiblical inerrancy applies not to modern versions of the Bible but to \na hypothetical original referred to as the autographs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats very convenient, he said. For no one has ever seen the \nBibles original autographs. Do you know why? They dont exist! There \nis not some dusty text, this original hidden away in some obscure \ncave in Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible came into being over a period of centuries, Kremer said. \nIts pages originated in diverse places and in diverse times. The Old \nTestament existed in oral tradition, passed down from generation to \ngeneration before it was ever recorded in print. When it was printed \nit was written in a variety of places in a variety of versions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no such thing as an original autograph of the Scripture, \nand to claim such a manuscript is the basis for the inerrancy is \nintellectually dishonest, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer said some people might desire to just dismiss the whole \nargument with, Why does it matter? but in fact it does matter what \npeople say about the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont want young people thinking they have to discard their faith \nbecause some scientist has made a discovery that seems to contradict \nsome biblical principle, he said. I dont want a scientist having \nto put his/her brain on ice because his/her discoveries contradict \nwhat the Bible allegedly teaches about one scientific discipline or \nanother.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer said Shorter Universitys new statement of faith We believe \nthe Bible ... is the inerrant and infallible Word of God is true to \na point. When you come to talking about the character of God, the \nBible is indeed inerrant, he said. When youre talking about the \nrevelation of God in Christ, we can trust that information with \nperfect confidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who assert that the Bible is correct on its teaching about \ngeology, however, grossly misinterpret the Bibles purpose, he \nsaid, because the ancient biblical writers did not even know that an \nendeavor known as geology would ever exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nKremer said those who argue for the Bibles perfection go beyond what \nScripture has to say about itself. The word never claims perfection \nfor the word, he said. The perfection is for the Word made flesh in \nJesus Christ.\u0014",

However, along with the microwave, dishwasher, frost-free \nrefrigerators, self-cleaning ovens and permanent press clothing comes \na host of responsibilities that make moms busier and more stressed \nthan at any other time in history. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, many mothers not only have to cook the bacon, but also have to \nbring it home. Most moms work 40+ hours at the shop or office in \naddition to managing household and caring for a family. Todays \nmother keeps the house, cooks the meals, washes the clothes, and \ntakes care of the children. Even if she has a husband whos willing \nto help with such tasks, seldom is it an even split. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe burden doesnt get any lighter when the typical Mothers Day \nchurch service heaps a big helping of guilt on top of everything \nelse. Proverb 31 is the icing on the cake! You have read the list. \nThe good wife doesnt just wash the clothes. She buys the wool, \nweaves the fabric, and makes the fashion-worthy garments with her own \ntwo handsall with a smile on her face. Thats just the beginning. \nShe manages the household, buys, sells, invests, helps the needy, and \nof course, has dinner ready and waiting for her family. The to-do \nlist never ends. What wife and mother possibly could live up to such \na job description? \u0014\n\u0014\nYet thats how the Proverb 31 woman often is portrayed. However, I \nthink thats a wrong interpretation of the chapter. Proverb 31 never \nshould be read through the eyes of a demanding husband scolding his \nwife. See, you should be more like this! It does not represent the \nannouncement of a foolish young groom complaining, Thats not the \nway mom did that, while his bride tries to approximate the \nreputation of her mythical always-did-everything-right-mother-in-law. \nProverb 31 is not the nightmare of a guilt-ridden overworked mom, \nruminating on all the impossible demands life places on her. Thats \nnot what this chapter is about! If it were, it probably wouldnt \nbelong alongside the counsel of the wise man!\u0014",

In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, \nforgive us!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Waldensian church was founded by Peter Waldo in the 12th century \nafter he gave up his possessions and took up a life of poverty and \npreaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nWaldos monastic lifestyle and ideas were similar to those of the \npopes namesake, Francis of Assisi, but his insistence on preaching \nas a lay person, and on speaking out against the excesses of the \nchurch, got him excommunicated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Waldensians took up residence in Italy, not far from the border \nof France. The little group suffered years of massacre, rape, and \npillaging during the Catholic Churchs attempt to stomp it out. \nDuring one famous massacre, more than 1,700 Waldensian lives were \ntaken on Easter week in 1655.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the Waldensians is a story of devotion to the \nScriptures, and of perseverancea story that should inspire us all, \nwrote Christian History magazine in a 1989 issue devoted to the \nWaldensians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThousands of Waldensians emigrated to Germany, where they became \nLutherans. Others came to the United States, where many were absorbed \nby the Presbyterian Church, and to South America, where one \nWaldensian pastor became good friends with Jorge Bergoglio before \nhis election as pope.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis apologized in Turin, the city where the Easter massacre was \nauthorized.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was recognized at the time that Pope Innocent III decided to \nauthorize Francis new religious order in 1210 because of Waldos \nsuccess, wrote Mark Silk, director of the Center for the Study of \nReligion in Public Life at Trinity College. Making friends and \namends with the Waldensians was thus not just another bit of \necumenical outreach for the present leader of the Catholic Church. In \nspeaking of the possibility of collaborating with them on service to \nhumanity which suffers, to the poor, the sick, the migrants, Francis \nshowed he knew that they are very much Christians after his own \nheart. Indeed, had Alexander III been as enlightened as Innocent III, \nthe present occupant of the See of Peter might very well have named \nhimself not Pope Francis but Pope Waldo.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apology comes 18 years after a Catholic archbishop stood in a \nWaldensian church and apologized for the suffering and injury \ninflicted on them.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, Francis apologized to Pentecostals for their persecution \nunder Italys fascist regime, which did not allow them to practice \ntheir faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nCT follows Pope Francis, including his recent letter on global \nwarming and how many evangelicals disagree with his warning, his \npopularity among Argentine evangelicals, and how his status among US \nevangelicals puzzles those in Italy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0014",

It was an unusual and somewhat informal \nmeeting, a gathering of 300 eager delegates, all of whom believed in \nthe baptism of the Holy Spirit. They had been called together by \nEudorus N. Bell, publisher of Word and Witness. Not many Americans \nthen believed in tongues speaking or other visible manifestations of \nthe Spirit, such as healing, visions, and everyday miracles. This \ngroup did--and enthusiastically so.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1901, modern Pentecostalism exploded at Bethel Bible College in \nTopeka, Kansas, spreading rapidly through the student body. Soon \nthere were profound stirrings at California's Azusa Street Mission \nand from there across America. In these early years, zeal sometimes \noutstripped propriety. Some groups were invaded by psychics. \nIndividuals slipped into serious moral errors, trusting inner \nguidance rather than the words of scripture. Many renounced study \naltogether, relying on the Holy Spirit for impromptu guidance. \nScattered observers realized Pentecostals needed to coordinate \nefforts if they were to propagate their faith with as much effect as \ntheir zeal craved.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter three days of prayer and devotion, they proceeded to business, \nan agenda which included five main issues: to set basic doctrine, \nconserve the gains of the movement, set standards for mission work, \ncharter the churches to be legal, and to consider creating a Bible \nschool. They quickly agreed on a preamble \"to disapprove of all \nunscriptural methods, doctrines and conduct, and approve of all \nscriptural truth and conduct...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThey elected an executive committee.

    "words": "Porn Is More Criticized and More Popular Than Ever\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are so many problems with porn; its hard to pick just one. \u0014\nHalee Gray Scott/ June 23, 2016   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nThis spring, Utah became the first state to declare pornography a \npublic health crisis, calling on businesses and educators to protect \nchildren from it. Around the same time, a Time Magazine cover story \nstory reported that porn causes erectile dysfunction in young men \nwhose minds have marinated in X-rated clips from the time they were \nteenagers.\u0014\n\u0014\nPornography trains the user to seek more extreme sexual experiences \nto receive the same satisfying flood of dopamine. Its what \nresearchers call the Coolidge effectthe prospect of a new sexual \npartner excites males (and sometimes females) so much that normal \nsexual activity becomes boring by comparison.\u0014\n\u0014\nTime focused on how porn usage prevents couples from having healthy \nsex lives. Thats only the beginning of a troubling and growing \namount of research and trends. Were learning more and more about the \nlasting impact of living in a world wired to a porn-saturated \nInternet.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a teenager in the 1990s, when the Internet was in its \ninfancy and all cell phones were dumb, churches major concern \nregarding sexual matters was premarital sex. In 1993, teens had to \nsteal magazines or VHS tapes to view porn; today, all they need is an \nInternet connection. While the evidence continues to reveal negative \neffects of this multibillion-dollar industry, few secular \ncommentators dare to say what many of us see: our porn problem is a \nmoral problem, with drastic consequences for individuals and \ncommunities.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudies have linked porn consumption to depression and higher drug \nand alcohol consumption. Researchers in Germany \\found that men who \nwatch porn showed a weaker connection between the part of the brain \nresponsible for decision-making and the part of the brain involved in \nmemory storage and information processing. A wave of pornified \nadvertisements, depicting women in erotic poses selling everyday \nproducts, lead both men and women to view womens bodies \ndifferentlyand certainly not more humanly.\u0014\n\u0014\nAside from the neurological consequences, science has unpacked a \nplethora of sociological effects. Pornography negatively shapes \nromantic relationships; one study found that women in relationships \nwith men who use porn report being less happy than those with men who \nabstain. Research in a dozen countries showed that men who viewed \npornography when they were boys were less likely to form healthy \nrelationships and more likely to think sexual harassment was \nacceptable.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time that researchers are unearthing porns tolls, \nAmericans have grown more tolerant of it. According to \\an extensive \nstudy conducted by Barna Group, only half of US adults and one-third \nof teens and young adults thought pornography was wrong. Teens and \nyoung adults believe not recycling is more immoral than using porn. \nBarna found porn use is up among Christians, too. Some 41 percent of \nChristian men ages 1324 and 23 percent of Christian men ages 25 and \nup said they frequently used porn. (The figures were 5 percent and \n13 percent for Christian women in those age groups.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPorn isnt just an individual moral problem. It strikes to the heart \nof what it means to be human. \u0014\n\u0014\nPorn advocates argue that pornography feeds our innate and \nuncontrollable instincts, and that healthy adults should explore \nthose instincts freely. Christians know better. We are right to \nexhort each other to make every thought captive to Christ and to live \ninto our new life in him.\u0014",

    "title": "PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S FAST",
    "words": "Historians have argued whether or not Abraham Lincoln, one of \nAmerica's best-known presidents, ever became a committed Christian. \nAs a youth Lincoln mocked the scriptures. After the death of his \nfavorite son, Willie, he groped for some hope which could give him \nsolace. His wife Mary and he attended seances, but eventually \nrenounced them as fraudulent. The cares and trials of the war drove \nLincoln increasingly to his Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis lifelong friend Joshua Speed remembered, \"As I entered the room \nnear night, [Lincoln] was sitting near a window reading his Bible. \nApproaching him, I said, 'I am glad to see you profitably engaged.' \n'Yes,' said he, 'I am profitably engaged.' 'Well,' said I, 'if you \nhave recovered from your skepticism I am sorry to say that I have \nnot!' Looking me earnestly in the face, and placing his hand upon my \nshoulder, he said: 'You are wrong Speed; take all of this book upon \nreason that you can, and the balance on faith and you will live and \ndie a happier and better man.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of Lincoln's communications allude to God. In his personal \ncorrespondence to Mrs. Gurney, a Quakeress, he wrote, \"We hoped for a \nhappy termination of this terrible war before this; but God knows \nbest and has ruled otherwise.\" Increasingly he saw himself as an \ninstrument of the Lord's will, inscrutable though that might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrestled to understand why the North continued to lose although \nits cause, the abolition of slavery and preservation of the union, \nseemed the more justifiable side. In the end, in a note not written \nfor public consumption, Lincoln concluded that \"the will of God \nprevails. . . .Both [sides] may be wrong. . . .in the present civil \nwar it is quite possible God's purpose is something quite different \nfrom the purpose of either party.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was as much sin to evoke God's wrath upon the Union as on the \nslave-owning Confederacy. On August 12, 1861 he issued a proclamation \nin the Northern States for a day of public humiliation, prayer and \nfasting \"to be observed by the people of the United States with \nreligious solemnities. ... It is peculiarly fit for us to recognize \nthe hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful \nremembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as \nindividuals to humble ourselves before Him, and to pray for His \nmercy... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fast was observed on this day, September 26, 1861, the last \nThursday of the month. As anyone knows who is familiar with the \nhistory of the war, the fighting ground along for another three \nyears, chewing up the lives and limbs of men in prodigious numbers. \nIn the end Lincoln himself was assassinated. He left a legacy of \nprofound words.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCurrent, Richard N. The Lincoln Nobody Knows. New York: McGraw-Hill, \n1958.\u0014\nGross, Ernie.

    "title": "PERSECUTION BY CHRISTIANS OVER THEOLOGY",
    "words": "Nathaniel Ward, who styled himself a Lawyer Divine, and drew up the \nfirst legal code for Massachusetts Bay Colony, in replying to the \nargument that it was religious persecution to deprive the individual \nof his right to liberty of conscience in religious matters, said: It \nis an astonishment to think that the brains of men should be \nparboiled in such impious ignorance.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious liberty was a perfect stranger, not only in New England, \nbut in every country in Europe and in every Christian denomination \nexcept the Baptists. The Protestant Reformers who had begun so nobly \nto proclaim the gospel of liberty, the absolute supremacy of the Word \nof God, the separation of church and state, a full and unrestricted \nfreedom of conscience for the individual in religious matters, and \nnoninterference of the state in matters of heresy, soon abandoned \nthis exalted platform, established their own religions by law, and \ndelivered heretics and dissenter to the state to be punished. Roger \nWilliams, of all the great Protestant Reformers, stood alone in the \nintegrity of his position, and finally worked out a concrete example \nof a free church in a free state, where no citizen was molested for \nholding and practicing dissenting views in religious matters. \nWilliams never once abandoned his position on the total separation of \nchurch and state. Martin Luther, in the beginning of his Reformation \nwork, said: \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one can command or ought to command the soul except God, who \nalone can show it the way to heaven. It is futile and impossible to \ncommand, or by force to compel any mans belief. Heresy is a \nspiritual thing, which no iron can hew down, no fire burn, no water \ndrown. . . . Whenever the temporal power presumes to legislate for \nthe soul, it encroaches.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Luther compromised this principle of religious liberty when he \nfaced an emergency and accepted aid from the state, and when he \nreceived the support of the state he robbed the great Reformation \nmovement of the glory and splendor of a great spiritual triumph \nthrough Christ and the power of His work. His later writings reveal \nthat he completely abandoned the principle of religious liberty and \nthe doctrine of a separation of church and state. In writing how \ndissenting preachers should be dealt with, he advised:\u0014\n\u0014\nSince it is not good that in one parish the people should be exposed \nto contradictory preaching, he [the magistrate] should order to be \nsilent whatever does not consist with the Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther made his appeal to the civil ruler as the final judge and \narbiter of truth, and believed that heretics should be delivered to \nthe civil magistrate for punishment. When the Anabaptists in the \nlands of the Reformation taught the doctrine of immersion as the \nproper scriptural mode of baptism, and proclaimed infant baptism as \nutterly useless and without divine authority, the great Protestant \nReformers applied the whip, the sword, the torch, as well as fines, \nconfiscation of property, and the dungeon cell to these dissenters. \nWhen the Protestant sects resorted to the civil authorities to punish \nheresy, it was merely a case of religious tyranny changing hands \nunder a new religious regime. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn writing to Menius and Myconius in 1530, Martin Luther favored \napplying the sword to the Anabaptists. He said:\u0014\n\u0014\nI am pleased that you intend to publish a book against the \nAnabaptists as soon as possible. Since they are not only blasphemous \nbut also seditious men, let the sword exercise its rights over them, \nfor it is the will of God that he shall have judgment who resisteth \nthe power.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon, a colaborer with Luther, in a letter to the diet at \nHamburg, in 1537, advocated death by the sword to all who professed \nAnabaptist views. Zwingli, the Swiss Reformer, who perished with the \nsword, and whose statue in Zurich pictures him with a Bible in his \nright hand and a sword in his left, persecuted not only the Baptist, \nbut all dissenting sects who disagreed with his views. Even John \nRobinson, the renowned pastor of the Pilgrims in Holland, who was far \nmore liberal in his views than the Puritans, vigorously defended the \nuse of the magistrates power in matters of church discipline to \npunish religious actions, he [the magistrate] being the preserver of \nboth tables, and so to punish all breaches of both.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see \"A Matter of Principle\"   Word/My documents/ A \nMatter of Principle\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nTheres no way around it. Paul thought he was special. In his \ndefense, Christ did knock him off a horse with a blinding light and \nan audible word from heaven. Peter saw Christ transfigured, but Paul \nalso saw the glorified Christ. This put Paul in an elite category.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remarkable thing, really, is how maturely Paul handled his \nstatus. Yes, he boasted of his apostleship, but he did so defending \nhis gospel, not his pride. It was essential that the Gentiles he \nministered to trusted his pedigree, because the gospel was their only \nhope and he was the only person preaching it to them. Before they met \nPaul, the Gentiles were spiritual orphans. They were trapped in a \nfruitless way of life, far from God and wandering further. Paul \nunderstood that in Christ Jesus I became your father through the \ngospel (1 Cor. 4:15), and he took that role of spiritual father \nseriously. Thats why he urged the Corinthians to imitate me (1 \nCor. 4:16). They couldnt read a gospel; those hadnt been written \nyet. The only way they could see Jesus was to look at Paul.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Paul is often critiqued for paternalism, an unattractive \nquality in a culture increasingly sensitive to privileged and \noverbearing (white) men telling everyone else how they ought to \nbehave. Although to us, Paul may sound paternalisticauthoritative \nand bossyhis audience would have heard him as paternaloffering the \ninstruction and guidance of a loving father. Paul really and truly \nconsidered his converts his spiritual children. His frustration with \nthe Judaizers wasnt simply a theological debate. Like any good \nparent, Paul was angry at those he viewed as a threat to the \nspiritual health of his children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe older we get, the more we see Pauls frustration with and strong \nlanguage toward his colleagues and congregations as motivated by his \nconcern that they fully understand the gospel and its implications \nfor daily Christian living. When he asserts, I am an apostle, he is \nnot saying, Im important, but rather, What Im saying is \nimportant. He is firm with his audience because what he says \nmatters. He didnt care if they liked him. He needed them to trust \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat personality, which earned him scores of followers but few close \nfriends, kept his eyes focused on the prize Christ set before him. \nOur views on boasting might make Paul a modern jerk, but they dont \nmake him an ancient one. It isnt fair to judge Paul by our modern \nconventions on collegiality. We may not personally have enjoyed \nPauls company, but when its all said and done, its hard to deny \nthat he left an incredible example that we are proud to follow.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaken from Paul Behaving Badly by E.

The \nBlaze reveals the moving story behind that song.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe refrain of Pretty Paper says:\u0014\n\u0014\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\u0014\nWrap your presents to your darling from you\u0014\nPretty pencils to write I love you\u0014\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\u0014\n\u0014\nThe backstory to this song is very moving. The Dallas News reports \nthat in the 1960s Nelson was walking around the streets of downtown \nFort Worth, Texas when he saw a disabled street vendor hawking his \nwares of colorful papers, pencils, and ribbons.\u0014\n\u0014\nPretty papers! the man called out. Pretty ribbons!\u0014\n\u0014\nNelson was struck by the sad scene of the vendor, whose legs were \namputated above the knees, calling out his wares to no avail. The \nsong continues:\u0014\n\u0014\nCrowded street, busy feet, hustle by him\u0014\nDowntown shoppers, Christmas is nigh\u0014\nThere he sits all alone on the sidewalk\u0014\nHoping that you won't pass him by\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scene inspired him to write the popular Christmas song, but now \nNelson is again using this experience as inspiration for a creative \nproject.\u0014\n\u0014\nNelson has just compeleted a novel titled Pretty Paper which provides \nfurther background to the story of the disabled street vendor. The \nnovel also includes Nelsons own story of being a struggling musician \nin the 1960s in Fort Worth\u0014\n\u0014\n.\u0014",

    "title": "PHILIP MELANCTHON REFORMER",
    "words": "This is a red letter day in the history of the Reformation. On this \nday, February 16, 1497 was born a man of peace into an age of \nconflict, a reasoner into a world of passion. His birth name was \nPhilip Schwarzerd, \"Black earth,\" which in Latin is \"Melanchthon.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt ten Philip was orphaned. His grandmother took him in. Melanchthon \nproved an apt scholar, entering the University of Heidelberg at \ntwelve. In two years he graduated with his bachelors degree. He \nproceeded to tutor while adding to his store of Greek. Soon afterward \nhe entered Tbingen where he received his masters degree. When he \ngraduated, the twenty-one-year old was awarded a position as \nProfessor of Greek at Wittenberg through the influence of his grand \nuncle, the famed humanist, Reuchlin. After a cool reception, he \nimpressed Luther and the schoolmen with his inaugural speech in which \nhe called for thorough-going reform of the curriculum. Martin Luther \nhad already posted his 95 theses and was stirring the Christian world.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon himself was ripe for reform. Having read Erasmus' Greek \nTestament, he, like Luther, was convinced salvation must be by faith \nrather than by works. He united his talent with Luther's and, in \npublic dispute, bested Luther's chief opponent, Johann von Eck. Not \ncontent to argue orally, Melanchthon defended his position in \nwriting. With careful reasoning he clarified what the Reformation was \nall about. Others characterized him as the brains behind it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he was a peaceable man, Melanchthon was the natural person \nfor Luther to ask to prepare a statement to deliver to Emperor \nCharles V who had summoned the German Diet to settle the nation's \nreligious differences. Melanchthon's statement was conciliatory. The \nfirst twenty-one points emphasized doctrines on which both sides were \nlargely agreed. In the last seven points he addressed those issues on \nwhich he felt Catholics had varied from scriptural authority. The key \npoint of the document was that justification of the soul is by faith \nalone. It became known as the Augsburg Confession and remains the \nbasic statement of Lutheran doctrine. Rome rejected it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon continued to strive for a formulation which would be \nacceptable to all sides. He did not want the church divided. But his \nvoice of reason was lost in the roar of the day. Because he would not \naccept Luther's vehement position on the Sacrament, the great \nreformer turned on his quiet friend and blasted him mercilessly. On \nhis death bed Luther felt remorse for this. \"Dear Philip, I confess \nto have gone too far in the affair of the Sacrament.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMelanchthon lived several years after Luther died, steadily teaching \nat Wittenberg, but ignored by the radicals who too often headed the \nProtestant movement. In the end his quiet soul longed for death as a \nway to escape the \"frenzy of theologians.\" Nonetheless his Augsburg \nConfession remained one of the few grounds mutually respected by the \nquarreling reformers. However, he himself was vilified as a \ncompromiser and neglected for 200 years after his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "Pulling a John Skaggs\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Skaggs is a loud, stubborn, preacher's son with Southern charm \nand a Texas twang, even though he claims he doesn't have one. He \nloves children, dogs, and horses, but not cats. It's not that he \ndislikes cats, he likes them. That's probably not how Miyagi felt \nwhen he put her into a pillow case, swung her around a few times and \nthrew her onto the couch. Oh, that reminds me, he can have a bit of a \ntemper, too. He loves music of all kinds, laughing, any dessert  la \nmode, tending to his Angel's trumpet plants, and shopping at Costco.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of my favorite memories of Dad are from teaching first and \nsecond grade Sunday School with him. He asked that the children call \nhim Fat Daddy, much to their delight and their parents' surprise. \nHe didn't believe in arts and crafts; instead he used that time to \nget to know the kids and talk to them about their lives. He'd be \nattentive to every story it seemed he never tired of hearing the \nsame descriptions of birthday parties, sleepovers, vacations, and \nschool just listening and asking questions. He played a hundred \ngames of hangman and colored a thousand pictures on the board. Also, \nDad was famous for snacks. While other classrooms had goldfish or \ncrackers he served a banquet of deli meat, cheeses, bananas, \nstrawberries, blueberries, doughnuts, cookies, and a fruit roll up \nfor the trip home. The church designed the faade of his room to look \nlike a restaurant complete with neon signs, a counter with stools, \nand a menu. They call the room Fat Daddy's Diner. Bumper stickers \nwere made that said, Fat Daddy's Sunday School: Feeds Your Tummy and \nYour Soul. On the playground he would organize races with the kids, \npush them on the swings, and play tag all in his suit and tie. He \nliked to get the class riled up and would have them run laps around \nthe table or have a push up contest to get the wiggles out. The \nother teachers marveled at how well his kids behaved, and the parents \nwould often comment on how their kids waited all week to come back to \nFat Daddy's class.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt home he isn't Fat Daddy, but his habits are the same. My family \nrefers to buying something in excessive quantities, on impulse as \npulling a John Skaggs. When I told Dad I liked reading the \nCosmopolitan magazine his next care package included at least ten \nmagazines: Runner's World, Self, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Vanity Fair, \nWomen's Health, Men's Health, and Maxim. When we'd go to Krispy Kreme \nfor hot doughnuts, we would walk away with six dozen doughnuts. Over \nspring break I came home to find Dad driving a red Suzuki Savage \nmotorcycle. It was a surprise to me as well as my mom. In the pet \nstore he saw my sisters admiring a riding crop and bought it. When \nMom asked what purpose it would serve considering we lived in the \nsuburbs of DC Dad said we'd use it as a microphone when we sang \nalong to CDs in the car. It turned out to be a good investment. We \nhad so many karaoke sessions to Shania Twain's Man! I Feel Like a \nWoman with that pink riding crop.\u0014\n\u0014\nDad is great at making people happy. When I had sleepovers with \nfriends, Dad would make us egg sandwiches at two o'clock in the \nmorning. He would wake up early and drive to Chick-Fil-A as soon as \nit opened to buy breakfast for my sisters and me, making our Monday \nmornings easier. He likes to surprise Mom with lunch and send her \ngifts at school. He braves the cold winter morning to start the cars \nto warm them up or shovel off the neighbor's driveway. His actions \nshowed how much he cared, but so did his words, and he has lots of \nwords.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy family likes to tease Dad about his tendency to chat up every \nwaitress, fellow airplane passenger, and ski lift rider he \nencounters, but one story in particular sticks out in my mind. My \nfamily and I were driving back down the East Coast after a vacation \nand we decided to stop at Jim's Steaks for a classic Philly \ncheesesteak. We realized we had put the wrong location into the GPS \nwhen we entered a very dilapidated part of West Philly. Passing \nhouses with boarded up windows and cars on cinder blocks we became \nrather uneasy. Jim's Steaks, our final destination,was a beat up \nhole-in-the-wall that looked to be smaller than a college dorm room \nand narrow as a hallway. We became immediately aware that we were the \nonly white people in the joint and we felt very out of place. The guy \nbehind the counter was a big, tall black man wearing a Baltimore \nRavens baseball cap and a glare. I remember feeling the employees' \ngaze. Clearly, this wasn't a tourist stop. The whole family visibly \ntensed up when Dad said, Baltimore Ravens? You're sure out of place \nin this town! The split second of silence was agonizing as we waited \nto see what would happen. The man cracked a huge smile, the ladies \nbehind the register cackled in laughter, and my family sighed in \nrelief. A little more football talk was exchanged and everyone was at \nease. My maternal grandfather says that if my dad were alone he would \ntalk to a post. And I'm sure that post would feel just as engaged, \ncomplimented, and pleasantly surprised by my dad's earnest interest, \nas all of us did that day in Jim's Steaks. Dad has a passion for \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, Dad has lots of passions. He fervently believes that warm \nbutter must be served with warm bread if either are cold the waiter \nwill be notified. I always thought it was kind of silly, to care so \nmuch about something as insignificant as that. But Dad lives his life \nwith a rare kind of intensity an intensity that makes the little \nthings like cold butter, snacks, and magazines matter so much to him. \nAn intensity that makes karaoke, motorcycles, and getting the \nwiggles out seem so fast, so exhilarating. He lives life at full \nspeed, never holding back his emotions, opinions, or generosity. This \npace has allowed Dad to live such a full life: one abundant with \nsmiles, kindness, and spontaneous adventures. Even though I always \ndrive the speed limit, I have loved every moment riding with Dad in \nthe fast lane.\u0014\nSara Skaggs\u0014",

    "title": "PASSOVER CONTRADICTIONS IN THE GOSPELS",
    "words": "\u0014\nThe Synoptic Gospels indicate that the Last Supper of Jesus and his \ndisciples occurred during the feast of the Passover (Matt 26:17; Mark \n14:12; Luke 22:7-8). Although no lamb is mentioned in their accounts, \nseveral statements lead the reader to conclude the meal was the \nPassover. On the other hand, John's Gospel seems to place the \nPassover meal on the evening after Jesus was crucified, not the \nevening before. Two statements are the primary evidence. The first, \nJohn 18:28, records that those who delivered Jesus to Pilate did not \nenter the Praetorium so they would not become ceremonially unclean \nand \"unable to eat the Passover.\" This seems to indicate that the \nPassover would be eaten on the evening following Jesus' execution. \nThe second statement, John 19:14, appears to be in accord with this \ntiming, stating that Jesus was crucified on \"the preparation day for \nthe Passover.\" If this means that the next day, which began at \nnightfall, would be Passover, Nisan 15, the Last Supper held the \nnight before Jesus' death was not the official Passover meal.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoachim Jeremias argued that the meal Jesus shared with His disciples \nthe night before He died, was indeed a Passover meal in both the \nSynoptic and Johannine accounts (41-61). While his fourteen evidences \ndo not prove the meal was Paschal, they are certainly suggestive \ndespite the misgivings that some have leveled against them. The \nevidences are as follows: 1) the meal was held in Jerusalem (a \nrequirement of the Passover), 2) the upper room was made available \nfor the meal, 3) the meal was held at night, which was not a common \npractice, 4) the Twelve were present, 5) they reclined; again, an \nuncommon practice for regular meals, 6) levitical purity was \nmaintained, indicating a special meal, 7) Jesus broke bread during \nthe course of the meal, 8) they drank wine, 9) the wine was probably \nred wine, 10) Jesus dismissed Judas, other disciples assumed he was \ngoing to make last minute purchases, 11) others thought Judas was \ngoing to give alms to the poor, a common practice on Passover, 12) \nthe participants sang a hymn, 13) Jesus and His band remained within \nJerusalem limits, rather than returning to Bethany, and 14) Jesus \ngives an interpretation of the meal's elements, common to the \nPassover. In the end, Jeremias concluded that in his time the \nattempts to reconcile the two traditions were insufficient, but he \nargued strongly that both traditions spoke of the same meal which was \nreplete with Paschal characteristics.\u0014\n\u0014\nScholarly opinions on the apparent discrepancy fall into three \ncategories. Some argue that the Synoptics are correct and John is \nincorrect. Others declare that John is accurate and the Synoptics are \ninaccurate. A third group represents those who attempt to harmonize \nthe two divergent traditions. This third group is of our main concern \nhere, but the proponents hold widely varying views, none of which has \ngained widespread consensus. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most popular means of harmonizing the two accounts is to \nargue that two different rituals were followed and that the Synoptics \nrecord one while John records the other. Paul Billerbeck argued that \nthe Pharisees and Sadducees followed two different calendars and had \na controversy which resulted in celebrating sequential Passovers in \nthe year Jesus died. Jaubert strongly suggested that Jesus and early \nChristians followed essentially the same type of calendar found in \nthe Book of Jubilees; they celebrated the Passover on Tuesday \nevening, and the crucifixion occurred several days later on Friday \nrather than on the next day, as the Gospels seem to imply. Hoehner \ndeduced that the Pharisees and Sadducees differed on the start of day \nto an extent that the days overlapped and allowed for the paschal \nlambs to be slaughtered on two consecutive days for Passover. \nShepherd suggested that the Diaspora Jews in that year celebrated the \nPassover on Thursday evening and the Palestinian Jews did so on \nFriday. The Synoptics date the event by Diaspora tradition while John \nrecords the correct Palestinian chronology. By Shepherd's own \nadmission, however, very little is known about calendars of \ndispersion Jews. These solutions, which are noble attempts at \nharmonization, all falter on the same point: a lack of hard evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHarmony of the Gospels.\u0014",

    "title": "POPULATION PROBLEMS WITH NUMBERS IN WILDERNESS",
    "words": "Numbers problem with \npopulation in the wilderness\u0014\n\u0014\nThe large numbers of men conscripted into Israel's army puzzle modern \nscholars (see, e.g., the \u0014\nfigures in 1 :46; 26:51). These numbers of men mustered for warfare \ndemand a total population in \u0014\nexcess of 2,000,000. Such numbers seem to be exceedingly large for \nthe times, for the locale, for \u0014\nthe desert wanderings, and in comparison with the inhabitants of \nCanaan. See note on 3:43. \u0014\n\u0014\nVarious possibilities have been suggested to solve this problem. Some \nhave thought that the \u0014\nnumbers may have been corrupted in transmission. The present text, \nhowever, does not betray textual difficulties with the numbers. \u0014\n\u0014\nOthers have felt that the Hebrew word for \"thousand\" might have a \ndifferent meaning here \u0014\nfrom its usual numerical connotation. In some passages, for example, \nthe word is a technical term \u0014\nfor a conipany of men that mayor may not-equaI1,000-(e-:-g., Jos \n22:14, \"family division\"; lSa 23:23, \u0014\n\"clans\"). Further, some have postulated that this Hebrew word means \n\"chief\" (as in Ge 36:15). In \u0014\nthis way the figure 53,400 (26:47) would mean \"53 chiefs plus 400 \nmen.\" Such a procedure would \u0014\nyield a greatly reduced total, but it would be at variance with the \nfact that the Hebrew text adds \u0014\nthe \"thousands\" in the same way it adds the \"hundreds\" for a large \ntotal. Also, this would make \u0014\nthe proportion of chiefs to fighting men top-heavy (59 chiefs for 300 \nmen in Simeon). \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother option is to read the Hebrew word for \"thousand\" with a dual \nmeaning of \"chief\" and \u0014\n\"1,000,\" with the chiefs numbering one less than the stated figure. \nFor example, the 46,500 of Reuben \u0014\n(1:20) is read as 45 chiefs and 1,500 fighting men, the 59,300 of \nSimeon (1:23) is read as 58 chiefs \u0014\nand 1,300 fighting men, etc. But in this case, as in the former, the \ntotals of 1:46 and 2:32 must then \u0014\nbe regarded as errors of understanding (perhaps by later scribes) . \u0014\n\u0014\nStill another approach is to regard the numbers as symbolic figures \nrather than as strictly math- \u0014\nlIOlatical. The numerical value of the Hebrew letters in the \nexpression bene yiste'e! (\"the Israelite \u0014\ncommunity,\" 1 :2) equals 603 (the number of the thousands of the \nfighting men, 1 :46); the remaining \u0014\n550 (plus 1 for Moses) might come from the numerical equivalent of \nthe Hebrew letters in the expres- \u0014\nsion \"all the men ... who are able to serve in the army\" (1 :3). This \nsymbolic use of numbers (called \u0014\n\"gematria\") is not unknown in the Bible (see Rev 13:18), but it is \nnot likely in Numbers, where there \u0014\nare no literary clues pointing in that direction. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the problem of the large numbers has not been satisfactorily \nsolved, the Bible does point \u0014\nto a remarkable increase of Jacob's descendants during the four \ncenturies of their sojourn in Egypt \u0014\n(see Ex 1:7 -12). With all their difficulties, these numbers also \npoint to the great role of providence \u0014\nand miracles in God's dealings with his people during their life in \nthe desert (see note on 1:46).\u0014",

    "title": "PAULS' COUNTERCULTURAL WORLDVIEW IN PHILIPPIANS",
    "words": "Paul's Countercultural Worldview in Philippians \u0014\nPosted: 09 Jun 2017 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his epistle to the Philippians, the Apostle Paul addresses \ninternal struggles and external pressures that the church faced. In \nthis volume, Mark Keown shows how Paul appeals to Christ's exemplary \nacts of humility and sacrifice to encourage believers to live worthy \nof the gospel in every aspect of life. Through rigorous examination \nof the original Greek text and engagement with the latest \nscholarship, Keown delivers an in-depth commentary on Philippians \nthat captures the message of Paul's letter for believers today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt can be easy to think that Paul's encouraging message to the \nPhilippian church is simple to understand and apply. But examining \nthe first-century context reveals a deeper underlying message \ncountercultural to the Graeco-Roman world. In this excerpt from the \nintroduction, Keown relays the importance of this Roman backdrop to \nthis letter, showing us how Christians must be defined by the gospel \nand not by the values of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important for students of Philippians to understand the \nimportance of Rome, Roman rule, and Roman values to understanding \nPhilippians. Philippi was a Roman colony, modeled on Rome; \neffectively, they self-consciously sought to be a mini-Rome. As such, \nRome lies at both ends of the conversation. Knowledge of Roman \nimperial power and rule, along with Roman social values, underlies \nthe appeal of the letter. This plays in two important ways: power and \nChristian life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the clash between Christ and Caesar should be considered. The \nChrist hymn forms the \u0014\ntheological center of Philippians. Without a doubt its language and \nthought stand in direct opposition to Roman notions of power. In \nPhilippians, it is Jesus who is Savior and Lord, rather than Caesar, \nwith whom these terms were regularly associated. Jesus is patron to \nthe Philippians, supplying all their needs. He is their protector who \nwill intervene and deliver, heal and sustain in suffering. He is the \nhead of the military force of Christian soldiers who operate with the \nvalues of the kingdom and not military might. He reigns in love \nrather than force. His obedience to death is both the salvation of \nthe Philippians and their example of how to live in a world obsessed \nwith power. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe renounced rank and status, preferring to empty himself, and become \na doulos, the lowest of the low, to serve humanity. This pattern of \npower through love and service, and not direct political or military \nforce or status and rank, undergirds the Christ-pattern and the \npositive examples splashed through the letter. Believers must cling \nto this Christ, not turning aside to Jewish notions of law, or Roman \nnotions of materialism and licentiousness. Knowing him, being found \nin him, believing in him, saves. Believers must not be drawn away to \nthe ways of Rome, but must, like Paul, press on in him to win the \nprize. This in Christ living is total, including experiencing his \nsuffering and death (Phil 3:10), while being sustained by the \nresurrection Spirit until the resurrection of the body. Notably, in a \nletter from Rome to little Rome, Christos is still his favored name \nfor Jesus. Nothing in Greek or Roman literature can be utilized to \nfully contain the notion of a crucified Jewish Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, the values and lifestyle of believers, while set and engaged \nin the Graeco-Roman world, are to be defined by the gospel and not by \nthe values of Rome. They are to live as citizens worthy of the \ngospel of Christ (Phil 1:27). They are not to be characterized by \nselfish ambition, envy, rivalry, vain conceit, \nself-centerednessseeking to move up the Roman or Christian pecking \norder to achieve status and power. Rather, they are to lay such \nthings down, and be humble, loving, living as servants and living the \nChrist-pattern. They are to suffer in and for Christ, even to the \npoint of death. Remaining faithful to the gospel of grace, they are \nto be relentless in their unity, standing in love, proclaiming \nChrist, pressing on as they live and share the gospel. They are to \nrenounce grumbling and arguing and, as they live out the \nChrist-pattern, to be lights to the world in a crooked and depraved \ngeneration. They are not to succumb to self-reliance through legal \nobservance or licentiousness, but trust in the coming Savior. They \nare to be reconciled where they are divided; they are to show \ngentleness, to rejoice, to be at peace, trusting God to answer \nprayers. They too have transformed minds, pondering the good things \nof God and his world, emulating Paul in all they say and do. They are \nto live in utter dependence on God the patron, trusting him that no \nmatter what their material situation, he will provide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe letter then is utterly subversive and countercultural. Written \nunder the nose of Nero's elite to the center of one of his prize \ncolonies, it challenges Rome and its values, implies its eventual \ntransformation or downfall as the gospel radiates through it, and \nencourages the Philippians to live out their days trusting the true \nCaesar, Jesus Christ our Lord.\u0014",

    "title": "PERSECTION OF HUGUENOTS BY SPANIARD CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "The Huguenots were converted out of Catholic France when preachers \nbrought Bibles and the Calvinist doctrines of predestination and \njustification by faith from Switzerland. Growth of this Reform church \nwas rapid in Gallic lands. Within a hundred years it had won a \nmillion and a half converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome French leaders saw in the emergence of this sect a chance to \ncatapult themselves to power. Unfortunately, this led to a succession \nof wars in which the Huguenots, fighting against overwhelming odds, \nwon enough victories to force concessions from Catholic France, but \nnever took the throne. One of these concessions was the Edict of \nNantes. Gradually it was gnawed away by government officials and \noverzealous prelates. Consequently many Huguenots began to migrate \noverseas, hoping to improve their lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the Christian sects which emerged from the Reformation, the \nAnabaptists and Huguenots suffered the most. The atrocities committed \nagainst both have filled books. One of the bloodiest and most \nsenseless acts of butchery against the Huguenots occurred in Florida \non this day September 20, 1565.\u0014\n\u0014\nColonies of Huguenots had struggled to establish themselves in \nFlorida for several years. The Huguenots at St. Johns expected \ntrouble when Spanish captain Pedro Menndez sailed into the area. \nSpain, after all, claimed the New World and had no use for the French \nand especially French Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne leader of the Huguenots, Laudonnire, wanted to throw up a fort. \nHe was overruled by Ribault, commander of the whole expedition. \nRibault had determined on a naval battle (he had seven ships). \nUnfortunately Ribault's ships were wrecked in a storm and the unhappy \nHuguenot refugees on shore were left to fend for themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nMenndez landed with 2,600 men. He butchered all the men he could lay \nhands on but spared women and children. Laudonnire fled with a few \nmen in a small remaining boat and eventually reached France. Ribault \nand those who had escaped the shipwreck, about 350 in all, asked for \nterms of surrender. Menendez said they must trust themselves to his \nmercy. It appears he swore an oath to spare them. Two hundred who \ndistrusted him fled into the wilderness. The rest surrendered.\u0014\n\u0014\nRibault reminded Menndez that Spain and France were at peace. That \nmattered little to the cruel Spaniard. Menndez wrote the king: \"I \nhad their hands tied behind their backs and themselves put to the \nsword. It appeared to me that by thus chastising them, God our Lord \nand your Majesty were served. Whereby this evil sect will in future \nleave us more free to plant the gospel in these parts.\" When the \nmatter became known in Europe there was a tremendous outcry from all \ndecent men, Catholic and Protestant alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remaining 200 Huguenots put up such fierce resistance that they \nwere finally promised their lives if they surrendered. They were \nconsigned to the Spanish galleys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAvery, Elroy McKendree.

    "words": "\u0014\n3 Case Studies Illustrate Problems with Philanthropy\u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat   EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 25, 2017 \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nMost philanthropists tend to aggrandize themselves in their \ncharitable giving, Seat writes. \u0014\nWhen is philanthropy problematic?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis question has been on my mind in recent months as I've read books \nand watched films about three philanthropists who amassed wealth in \ndubious ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. The case of Andrew Carnegie.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To the Stars through Difficulties\" is a new book by Kansas author \nRomalyn Tilghman.\u0014\nI recently read Tilghman's delightful novel and enjoyed hearing her \ndiscuss it recently at a regular meeting of Vital Conversations, a \ngroup sponsored by the Greater Kansas City Interfaith Council that \nhosts intentional conversations to help people work together to form \na better community.\u0014\nThe Carnegie libraries of Kansas are the backdrop of Tilghman's novel.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly on, she informs her readers that industrialist Andrew Carnegie \n(1835-1919) built 59 libraries in Kansas in the early 1900s and that \n\"he gave the country 1,689 libraries that served thirty-five million \npeople by 1919.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is impressive philanthropy! And it is only part of what Carnegie \ndid with his great wealth.\u0014\nBut on the same page, Tilghman acknowledges Carnegie's \"despicable \ntreatment of mineworkers, including the murder of seven men in his \nattempt to break up the union,\" and reports that some Kansas \ncommunities \"refused to take his tainted money even for the promise \nof a library.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe then rightly states that Carnegie was \"both a philanthropist and \nrobber baron.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n2. The case of John D. Rockefeller.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Carnegie vied with John D. Rockefeller as being the richest \nman in the world. Like Carnegie, Rockefeller (1839-1937) also started \nlife in rather humble circumstances but through hard work, ingenuity \nand shrewd business deals, he also became a man of great wealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom boyhood and throughout his lifetime, Rockefeller was a faithful \nBaptist church member - and a tither. From his early 50s, he \ndeliberately began his philanthropic activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nA chapter in Ellen Greenman Coffey's small book about John D. \nRockefeller is titled \"The Pious Robber Baron.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a later chapter, \"An Investment in Good Works,\" Greenman tells of \nRockefeller's increasing involvement in giving his money away under \nthe tutelage of Frederick T. Gates, a young Baptist minister whom he \nemployed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the many projects Gates (1853-1929) led his boss to support, \none of the best known is the Rockefeller Foundation, established in \n1913 after years of planning.\u0014\n\u0014\nRockefeller's philanthropic work, however, was partly in response to \nthe negative publicity he had suffered from Ida Tarbell's 1904 book, \n\"The History of the Standard Oil Company,\" in which she depicted \nRockefeller as \"miserly, money-grabbing and viciously effective at \nmonopolizing the oil trade.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n3. The case of Joan Kroc.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, my wife, June, and I watched \"The Founder,\" the 2016 movie \nabout Ray Kroc, the man who built McDonald's restaurants into the \nwealthiest fast food chain in the world - but not without the use of \ndevious means.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan was Kroc's third wife. They married in 1969 when Ray was 67 \nyears old; she inherited his wealth after his death in 1984.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir story is told in Lisa Napoli's 2016 book titled \"Ray & Joan: \nThe Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All \nAway.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan's $1.5 billion gift to The Salvation Army is said to be the \nlargest philanthropic gift ever made by an individual in the U.S. The \nbulk of that gift has been used to build and maintain 26 Kroc Centers \nthroughout the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nVery summarily, here are some problems with philanthropy, clearly \nseen in the three people mentioned above:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. There is a problem of how the wealth of the philanthropists is \ngained, particularly when it is by exploitation of workers and shrewd \n(bordering on illegal) business practices.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Then, most philanthropists tend to aggrandize themselves in their \ncharitable giving. Everyone knows of Carnegie libraries, the \nRockefeller Foundation and the Kroc centers.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. And then consider these insightful words by William Jewett Tucker, \na contemporary critic of Carnegie. \"I can conceive of no greater \nmistake, more disastrous in the end to religion if not to society, \nthan of trying to make charity do the work of justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat was a missionary to Japan from 1966-2004 and is both \nprofessor emeritus of Seinan Gakuin University and pastor emeritus of \nFukuoka International Church.\u0014",

    "title": "PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S FAST",
    "words": "President Lincoln's Fast\u0014\n      Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians have argued whether or not Abraham Lincoln, one of \nAmerica's best-known presidents, ever became a committed Christian. \nAs a youth Lincoln mocked the scriptures. After the death of his \nfavorite son, Willie, he groped for some hope which could give him \nsolace. His wife Mary and he attended seances, but eventually \nrenounced them as fraudulent. The cares and trials of the war drove \nLincoln increasingly to his Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis lifelong friend Joshua Speed remembered, \"As I entered the room \nnear night, [Lincoln] was sitting near a window reading his Bible. \nApproaching him, I said, 'I am glad to see you profitably engaged.' \n'Yes,' said he, 'I am profitably engaged.' 'Well,' said I, 'if you \nhave recovered from your skepticism I am sorry to say that I have \nnot!' Looking me earnestly in the face, and placing his hand upon my \nshoulder, he said: 'You are wrong Speed; take all of this book upon \nreason that you can, and the balance on faith and you will live and \ndie a happier and better man.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of Lincoln's communications allude to God. In his personal \ncorrespondence to Mrs. Gurney, a Quakeress, he wrote, \"We hoped for a \nhappy termination of this terrible war before this; but God knows \nbest and has ruled otherwise.\" Increasingly he saw himself as an \ninstrument of the Lord's will, inscrutable though that might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrestled to understand why the North continued to lose although \nits cause, the abolition of slavery and preservation of the union, \nseemed the more justifiable side. In the end, in a note not written \nfor public consumption, Lincoln concluded that \"the will of God \nprevails. . . .Both [sides] may be wrong. . . .in the present civil \nwar it is quite possible God's purpose is something quite different \nfrom the purpose of either party.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was as much sin to evoke God's wrath upon the Union as on the \nslave-owning Confederacy. On August 12, 1861 he issued a proclamation \nin the Northern States for a day of public humiliation, prayer and \nfasting \"to be observed by the people of the United States with \nreligious solemnities. ... It is peculiarly fit for us to recognize \nthe hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful \nremembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as \nindividuals to humble ourselves before Him, and to pray for His \nmercy... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fast was observed on this day, September 26, 1861, the last \nThursday of the month. As anyone knows who is familiar with the \nhistory of the war, the fighting ground along for another three \nyears, chewing up the lives and limbs of men in prodigious numbers. \nIn the end Lincoln himself was assassinated. He left a legacy of \nprofound words.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCurrent, Richard N. The Lincoln Nobody Knows. New York: McGraw-Hill, \n1958.\u0014\nGross, Ernie.

He served for six years at the First \nBaptist Church, Boston, and became known for effectual sermons which \nbrought his listeners to repentance and conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaving the Boston church, Francis became a professor at Union \nCollege and then accepted the position as president of Brown College. \nHe would be there eighteen years, sometimes called the school's \n\"golden years.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough head of this seminary, Francis distrusted seminaries. \"The \ntendency of seminaries is to become schools for theological and \nphilological learning and elegant literature, rather than schools to \nmake preachers of the Gospel,\" he said. He was determined that his \nschool not drift with that tide. He himself led in worship and \ndelivered sermons to his students, urging those who were not \nconverted to get right with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis did not see seminary training as the sole ticket to \npastoring. \"I was said to be opposed to ministerial education because \nI held that a man with the proper moral qualifications might be \ncalled to the ministry by any church and be a useful minister of \nChrist and that we had no right to exclude such a man because he had \nnot gone through a nine or ten years' course of study. God calls men \nto the ministry by bestowing upon them suitable endowments, and an \nearnest desire to use them for His service.\" These views led him to \nestablish flexible entrance requirements.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe founded the free library of Wayland, Massachussets and won \nlegislation that allowed towns to support public libraries with tax \nmoney. After his retirement, he sometimes preached. In his last \npublic sermon, given just days before he died, he urged his listeners \nto be faithful followers of Jesus. He prayed with them. On his way \nhome, he remarked to the man escorting him that \"we do not pray \nenough; we lack faith in God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis was also involved in prison work and made such a deep \nimpression on the state prisoners that the prison chapel was filled \nwith sobs when the chaplain announced that he had died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCathcart, William.

    "words": "Politicians like to give speeches, you might have noticed  and \nmodern communication makes it easier than ever for their speeches to \nreach a broad audience. But in today's fast-paced world, who has the \ntime to watch or read them all?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a public service, herewith a major time-saver: a distilled version \nof every speech you can expect to hear over the next 12 months. No \nneed to send thanks - just cash.\u0014\n\u0014\n* * *\u0014\n\u0014\nThank you. Thank you all. Thank you very much.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is so great to be here in (locality), home of the (hometown team). \nGo, (mascot)!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMy friends, we stand at a crossroads. This is a defining moment for \nour (city / state / nation). We face many challenges, and there are \nno easy answers. We have (come a long way / achieved a great deal), \nbut there is still much to do. There are those who say we are not up \nto the task. There are those who want to turn back the clock. But I \nbelieve that if we work together, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut to achieve great things, we need bold leadership.  And that is \nwhy I am proud to stand before you today and announce my (candidacy / \nre-election campaign / new program).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAs some of you know, I come from humble beginnings. My father was a \nhobo who rode the railways. My mother was a hotel maid. On the side, \nshe sold paperweights that she made by melting leftover shampoo \nbottles in the oven. But my parents taught us important values: \nHonesty and hard work. Courage and determination. And one other pair \nof values, because audiences like lists that come in threes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is because of those values that I am the first member of my family \nto (go to college / avoid indictment / eat three meals a day.) We \ndidn't have it easy. But like my grandma always told me:  \"If you sit \nin a closet and pray for hot dogs, you'll get coat-hangers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so we have a responsibility to the American people. People like \nyou. People like me. People like a person I am about to mention by \nname, because my consultants say personal stories poll well with \nfocus groups. I'm talking about Joe Brown, who lost his job of 20 \nyears when the sprinkler factory he worked at moved to Mexico because \nof those who disagree with me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe found himself struggling to put food on the table. But with the \nhelp of a program that I started, Joe got retrained at the local \ncommunity college, and he is now night manager at a hose factory. Joe \nis with us here today. Joe, would you stand up please, so people can \nsee what a blessing I have been to ordinary people?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople like Joe are the reason we must build a stronger, more diverse \neconomy. An economy with a world-class business environment. An \neconomy that creates well-paying jobs. But let me be perfectly clear: \nthat strong economy should also provide quality health care, so that \nnobody is ever one illness away from having to choose between paying \nfor a prescription or paying the rent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, make no mistake: To build that economy, we need to invest. We \nneed to invest in infrastructure, and education, and a world-class \nworkforce development program. Studies have shown that for every \ndollar we invest in X, we get back Y. The fact of the matter is, X is \na good deal for taxpayers. But we also need to invest in \ngame-changing ideas that will benefit the forgotten middle class. And \nwe need to strengthen networks that will help us come together to \noffer solutions and implement plans. That is the vision I want to \ntalk to you about today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMy vision for a brighter future includes energy independence. It \nincludes support for law enforcement and our first responders. It \nincludes jobs. It includes public safety. We must close the digital \ndivide. We must help struggling areas meet their full potential. We \nmust devote additional resources to address the crisis of (refer to \ntrending topics on Twitter).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd above all else, we must make X the capital of Y.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, something about veterans. Thank you for your service.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a historical moment. And so I call on (my colleagues / my \nopponent / the other party) to work with me in a bipartisan fashion \nto (balance our budget / pass this legislation) in a fair and \nresponsible way. Let us come to the table and work together as we \ncontinue this important discussion about growing our economy and \ncreating new jobs. Let us not shrink from the task ahead. Let us, as \nMartin Luther King Jr. once said, (insert MLK quote here).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThank you all. And may God bless America!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA.

But no \none did until nearly 2,000 years after Aristotle's death. Legend has \nit that in 1589 Galileo summoned learned professors to the base of \nthe Leaning Tower of Pisa.

    "title": "POCAHONTAS ENTERED A MARRIAGE OF RACES",
    "words": "Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From \nthe Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since \nher baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter \nand gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for \nher. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a \nperiod of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or \nPocahontas, \"Princess,\" the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended \nthe invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown \nsettlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on \ntheir own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed \nthat Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during \nhis captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted \nto tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then \nLady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, \nplanning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. \nTaken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and \nbaptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she \nmarried John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience \nwhether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping \nto convert her, \"which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son \nChrist Jesus' sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has \nfalsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit \n(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning \ncartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film \nabout her perpetrated many distortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would \nhave chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed \nonly painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas \nrunning the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would \nhave ground corn and worked hides. Leisure for women and girls \n(except among the noble classes) was almost non-existent until two \ncenturies ago. Pocahontas is shown at peace with nature. Although \nIndian animism contained elements placating nature, peace it had not. \nIn one version, Pocahontas is given a pet raccoon. A raccoon would \nnot have been a cuddly pet but would have been destined for the pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian \nideals upon a pseudo-historical event. Christ changed the world so \ndrastically for women and animals that, even in imagination, we \ncannot remove the features contributed by faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFocus on the Family Newsletter.

    "title": "PREACHING HELL IN A TOLERANT AGE",
    "words": "Preaching Hell in a Tolerant Age\u0014\nBrimstone for the broad-minded\u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy Keller \u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man in my office was impeccably dressed and articulate. He \nwas an Ivy League MBA, successful in the financial world, and had \nlived in three countries before age 30. Raised in a family with only \nthe loosest connections to a mainline church, he had little \nunderstanding of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was therefore gratified to learn of his intense spiritual interest, \nrecently piqued as he attended our church. He said he was ready to \nembrace the gospel. But there was a final obstacle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You've said that if we do not believe in Christ,\" he said, \"we are \nlost and condemned. I'm sorry, I just cannot buy that. I work with \nsome fine people who are Muslim, Jewish, or agnostic. I cannot \nbelieve they are going to hell just because they don't believe in \nJesus. In fact, I cannot reconcile the very idea of hell with a \nloving Godeven if he is holy, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis young man expressed what may be the main objection contemporary \nsecular people make to the Christian message. (A close second, in my \nexperience, is the problem of suffering and evil.) Moderns reject the \nidea of final judgment and hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, it's tempting to avoid such topics in our preaching. But \nneglecting the unpleasant doctrines of the historic faith will bring \nabout counterintuitive consequences. There is an ecological balance \nto scriptural truth that must not be disturbed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf an area is rid of its predatory or undesirable animals, the \nbalance of that environment may be so upset that the desirable plants \nand animals are lostthrough overbreeding with a limited food supply. \nThe nasty predator that was eliminated actually kept in balance the \nnumber of other animals and plants necessary to that particular \necosystem. In the same way, if we play down \"bad\" or harsh doctrines \nwithin the historic Christian faith, we will find, to our shock, that \nwe have gutted all our pleasant and comfortable beliefs, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe loss of the doctrine of hell and judgment and the holiness of God \ndoes irreparable damage to our deepest comfortsour understanding of \nGod's grace and love and of our human dignity and value to him. To \npreach the good news, we must preach the bad.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in this age of tolerance, how?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to preach hell to traditionalists\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore preaching on the subject of hell, I must recognize that today, \na congregation is made up of two groups: traditionalists and \npostmoderns. The two hear the message of hell completely differently.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople from traditional cultures and mindsets tend to have (a) a \nbelief in God, and (b) a strong sense of moral absolutes and the \nobligation to be good. These people tend to be older, from strong \nCatholic or religious Jewish backgrounds, from conservative \nevangelical/Pentecostal Protestant backgrounds, from the southern \nU.S., and first-generation immigrants from non-European countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way to show traditional persons their need for the gospel is by \nsaying, \"Your sin separates you from God! You can't be righteous \nenough for him.\" Imperfection is the duty-worshiper's horror. \nTraditionalists are motivated toward God by the idea of punishment in \nhell. They sense the seriousness of sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut traditionalists may respond to the gospel only out of fear of \nhell, unless I show them Jesus experienced not only pain in general \non the cross but hell in particular. This must be held up until they \nare attracted to Christ for the beauty of the costly love of what he \ndid. To the traditional person, hell must be preached as the only way \nto know how much Christ loved you.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is one way I have preached this:\u0014\n\u0014\nUnless we come to grips with this terrible doctrine, we will never \neven begin to understand the depths of what Jesus did for us on the \ncross. His body was being destroyed in the worst possible way, but \nthat was a flea bite compared to what was happening to his soul. When \nhe cried out that his God had forsaken him, he was experiencing hell \nitself.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a mild acquaintance denounces you and rejects youthat hurts. If a \ngood friend does the samethe hurt's far worse. However, if your \nspouse walks out on you, saying, 'I never want to see you again,' \nthat is far more devastating still. The longer, deeper, and more \nintimate the relationship, the more torturous is any separation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Son's relationship with the Father was beginning-less and \ninfinitely greater than the most intimate and passionate human \nrelationship. When Jesus was cut off from God, he went into the \ndeepest pit and most powerful furnace, beyond all imagining. And he \ndid it voluntarily, for us.\u0014\nHow to preach hell to postmoderns\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast to the traditionalist, the postmodern person is hostile \nto the very idea of hell. People with more secular and postmodern \nmindsets tend to have (a) only a vague belief in the divine, if at \nall, and (b) little sense of moral absolutes, but rather a sense they \nneed to be true to their dreams. They tend to be younger, from \nnominal Catholic or non-religious Jewish backgrounds, from liberal \nmainline Protestant backgrounds, from the western and northeastern U. \nS., and Europeans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen preaching hell to people of this mindset, I've found I must make \nfour arguments.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Sin is slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nI do not define sin as just breaking the rules, but also as \"making \nsomething besides God our ultimate value and worth.\" These good \nthings, which become gods, will drive us relentlessly, enslaving us \nmentally and spiritually, even to hell forever if we let them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI say, \"You are actually being religious, though you don't know \nityou are trying to find salvation through worshiping things that \nend up controlling you in a destructive way.\" Slavery is the \nchoice-worshiper's horror.\u0014\n\u0014\nC. S. Lewis's depictions of hell are important for postmodern people. \nIn The Great Divorce, Lewis describes a busload of people from hell \nwho come to the outskirts of heaven. There they are urged to leave \nbehind the sins that have trapped them in hell. The descriptions \nLewis makes of people in hell are so striking because we recognize \nthe denial and self-delusion of substance addictions. When addicted \nto alcohol, we are miserable, but we blame others and pity ourselves; \nwe do not take responsibility for our behavior nor see the roots of \nour problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nHell  begins with a grumbling mood, and yourself still distinct from \nit: perhaps even criticizing it  . You can repent and come out of it \nagain. But there may come a day when you can do that no longer. Then \nthere will be no you left to criticize the mood or even enjoy it, but \njust the grumble itself going on forever like a machine.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern people struggle with the idea of God thinking up punishments \nto inflict on disobedient people. When sin is seen as slavery, and \nhell as the freely chosen, eternal skid row of the universe, hell \nbecomes much more comprehensible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is an example from a recent sermon of how I try to explain this:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, sin separates us from the presence of God (Isaiah 59:2), which \nis the source of all joy (Psalm 16:11), love, wisdom, or good thing \nof any sort (James 1:17) .\u0014\nSecond, to understand hell we must understand sin as slavery. Romans \n1:2125 tells us that we were built to live for God supremely, but \ninstead we live for love, work, achievement, or morality to give us \nmeaning and worth. Thus every person, religious or not, is worshiping \nsomethingidols, pseudo-saviorsto get their worth. But these things \nenslave us with guilt (if we fail to attain them) or anger (if \nsomeone blocks them from us) or fear (if they are threatened) or \ndrivenness (since we must have them). Guilt, anger, and fear are like \nfire that destroys us. Sin is worshiping anything but Jesusand the \nwages of sin is slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the greatest paradox of all is that the people on Lewis's bus \nfrom hell are enslaved because they freely choose to be. They would \nrather have their freedom (as they define it) than salvation. Their \nrelentless delusion is that if they glorified God, they would lose \ntheir human greatness (Genesis 3:45), but their choice has really \nruined their human greatness. Hell is, as Lewis says, \"the greatest \nmonument to human freedom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see MyDocuments/Preachingi Hell in a Tolerant Age\u0014",

    "title": "POCAHONTAS ENTERED A MARRIAGE OF RACES",
    "words": "Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races\u0014\n\u0014\n On this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From \nthe Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since \nher baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter \nand gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for \nher. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a \nperiod of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or \nPocahontas, \"Princess,\" the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended \nthe invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown \nsettlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on \ntheir own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed \nthat Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during \nhis captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted \nto tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then \nLady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, \nplanning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. \nTaken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and \nbaptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she \nmarried John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience \nwhether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping \nto convert her, \"which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son \nChrist Jesus' sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has \nfalsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit \n(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning \ncartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film \nabout her perpetrated many distortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would \nhave chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed \nonly painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas \nrunning the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would \nhave ground corn and worked hides. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeisure for women and girls (except among the noble classes) was \nalmost non-existent until two centuries ago. Pocahontas is shown at \npeace with nature. Although Indian animism contained elements \nplacating nature, peace it had not. In one version, Pocahontas is \ngiven a pet raccoon. A raccoon would not have been a cuddly pet but \nwould have been destined for the pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian \nideals upon a pseudo-historical event. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nKjos, Berit. \"Pocahontas.\" \n(http://logosresourcepages.org/pocahont.html).\u0014\nLossing, Benson J.

Cannon and his supporters were convinced \ntheir opposition to Smith would help to bring in the kingdom of our \nLord Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1960 election, W.A.

Ultra-conservative Baptist millionaire H.L.

Lincolns Democratic opponent was the Rev. Peter \nCartwright, Methodist circuit rider, anti-slavery-anti-liquor \nadvocate.\u0014\n\u0014\nConverted amid the rough-and-tumble frontier camp meetings, \nCartwright once bested a tavernkeeper who attacked him, singing All \nHail the Power of Jesus Name throughout the fight! Cartwright labeled \nLincoln an infidel, untouched by the new birth, and without \nmembership in any church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrother Cartwright asks me directly where I am going. I desire to \nreply with equal directness: I am going to Congress.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Lincoln showed up at one of Cartwrights revival meetings, the \nevangelist put the reputed unbeliever to the 19th century \nconversionist test. As the service drew to a close, Cartwright first \ncalled sinners to salvation, then demanded: All who do not wish to \ngo to hell will stand. The entire congregation rose to their feet, \nexcept Honest Abe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Cartwright\u0014\n\u0014\nCartwright then asserted: I further observe that all of you save one \nindicated that you did not desire to go to hell. The sole exception \nis Mr. Lincoln, who did not respond to either invitation. May I \ninquire of you, Mr. Lincoln, where are you going?\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln: I came here as a respectful listener. I did not know that I \nwas to be singled out by Brother Cartwright. I believe in treating \nreligious matters with due solemnity. I admit that the questions \npropounded by Brother Cartwright are of great importance.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe continued: I did not feel called upon to answer as the rest did. \nBrother Cartwright asks me directly where I am going.

    "words": "The Purest Gospel\u0014\nPauls Most Beloved Letter Was Entrusted to a Woman\u0014\nMeet Phoebe, the first interpreter of Romans.\u0014\n\u0014\nJENNIFER POWELL MCNUTT AND AMY BEVERAGE PEELER\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Scripture is God-breathed, but not every book of the Bible has \nhad the same kind of reception and influence in the history of the \nchurch as Romans. It is hard to quantify the letters seismic impact \non the theology of the church and the formation of its leaders. \nReading Romans has never been for the faint of heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the history of Christianity, Romans has a track record of \ntransforming some of the most significant church leaders. When \nAugustine heard the words take up and read, at that life-changing \nmoment, he opened the Bible to Romans 13:13. Medieval Scholasticism \nwas shaped by Romans through Peter Lombards Four Books of Sentences, \nthe theological textbook of the medieval period until Thomas Aquinas \nmade his mark.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing interest in the Pauline Epistles during the Reformation \ngenerated the publication of over 70 new commentaries on Romans alone \nwith the benefit of the printing press. Martin Luthers own \ntransformative experience involved his reading of Romans 1:17 on the \nissue of righteousness. He stressed the significance of the epistle \nin his preface:\u0014\n\u0014\nThis letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. \nIt is the purest gospel. It is well worth a Christians while not \nonly to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it \ndaily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul. It is \nimpossible to read or to meditate on this letter too much or too \nwell. The more one deals with it, the more precious it becomes and \nthe better it tastes. . . . [I]t is in itself a bright light, almost \nbright enough to illumine the entire Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies later, hearing Luthers preface to Romans at Aldersgate \nStreet on May 24, 1738, led to John Wesleys heart being strangely \nwarmed and his faith transformed. Further down the line, Swiss \ntheologian Karl Barths shift from liberal Protestantism to the \nstrange new world of the Bible was encapsulated by the publication \nof his Rmerbrief, famously described as a bombshell on the \ntheologians playground.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we think about Romans, we associate the book with church history \ntitans from Augustine to Barth. Yet the first person to interpret and \nexplain Romans was the one who bore the letter, and her name was \nPhoebe.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrailblazing the Roman Roads\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman Paul entrusted with such an important task is mentioned in \nonly two verses of the New Testament, but with that one reference, \nPaul leaves a treasure of insight into the early Christian community.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he reaches the end of his weighty theological letter, his tone \nbecomes incredibly personal. He mentions 29 people, greeting 28 of \nthem and commending one: Phoebe. To commend someone is to vouch for \nthem, stand with them, attest that they can be trusted. Paul throws \nhis apostolic weight behind Phoebe.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy what he says, it seems that she has proven herself worthy of it. \nShe is a believer in Christ (he calls her our sister), a member of \nthe community in the Lord, and worthy of being received as a saint. \nPaul gives specificity to her faith by describing her with two \ntitles: diakonos and prostatis.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do these terms mean? What is Phoebes role?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first term, diakonos, from which we get our English word deacon, \nis the masculine form of the word servant and certainly indicates \nthat she has made it a regular practice to help others, as Jesus \nrecommends (Mark 9:35; 10:43) and demonstrates (Rom. 15:8). It might \nalso indicate that she held the office of deacon in her church in \nCenchreae, a port city just a few miles east of Corinth. This is the \nsame term Paul used in 1 Timothy to describe the qualifications for \nthis important role (3:813). Whether your English translation says \nservant or deacon, the only translation not fitting to the New \nTestament is deaconess. A feminized form of the character trait or \noffice does not exist in Biblical literature. Later developments that \nposited the role of a female deaconess as subordinate to a male \ndeacon had no grounding in Scripture. All servants or deacons, \nwhether male or female, equally follow in the footsteps of Jesus, who \ncame to serve all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second term, prostatis, appears only here in the New Testament, \nbut it is widely known in the Greco-Roman world. As it is used in the \nGreek version of the Old Testament, it can indicate a leader. Paul \nsays, however, that she was a prostatis to him, and he is normally \nadamant about his co-leadership with others under God. The use of \nthis term could be as basic as stating that Phoebe helped others, but \nmost agree that Paul is using it as was common in the secular texts \nof his day: She is a benefactor, one who uses her wealth and social \ninfluence to advocate for others.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this leads to a further question: What was Phoebes role \nspecifically in Rome?\u0014\n\u0014\nInterpreters widely agree that by placing her first in his list, Paul \nintroduces Phoebe as the bearer of the letter. While in our own \ncontext we are grateful for the work of our postal service employees, \nwe do not need to know their background in order to trust that we can \naccept the mail from them. That Paul spends several sentences to \ndescribe Phoebe and uses several emphatic phrases to admonish the \nChristians in Rome to treat her well indicates that she is more than \njust a mail carrier who drops off the scroll. She will play some role \nin how they experience the letter, so Paul wants them to trust her.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne line of thought, popularized by N. T. Wright, is that Phoebe, as \nthe letter carrier, would have read the letter as well. He states, \nThe letter-bearer would normally be the one to read it out to the \nrecipients and explain its contents.\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars including Peter Head have questioned the first part of \nWrights conclusion. In his analysis of ancient letters, Head \nsuggests that there is little evidence that the carrier was the \nreader of the letter. Instead, members of the group receiving the \nletter would read it out loud.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes that return Phoebe to the sidelines as a silent helper?\u0014\n\u0014\nNot in the least. Head acknowledges that even if she did not read the \nletter, she would have had a role in explaining the contents of \nRomans. She would have been present, as Pauls representative, to \nanswer questions about it. People have had a few questions about \nRomans through the years, to put it mildly, and Phoebe would have \nbeen the first to respond to those.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe uncertainty about the words used to describe Phoebe should not \novershadow the consensus on her role. Wrangling over what offices \nPhoebe might have held distracts us from the more signifi cant \nreality of these verses: Paul trusted her to explain Romans. What do \nwe miss when we do not acknowledge the importance of Phoebes role?\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Rome to the Reformation\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Paul paired Phoebes name with the masculine form of \nservant (diakonos), the term was quickly feminized to deaconess \nby church tradition. Importantly, both John Chrysostom and Origen \ninterpreted Phoebes mention in Romans as evidence that women were \nordained to the particular church office of deacon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe female diaconate persisted among the offices of the church to \nvarying extents until the sixth century. Radegunde (circa 520587 ), \nwho contributed to the expansion of Christianity in the sixth century \namong the Franks, was one of the last notable female deacons ordained \nby a bishop. In the medieval period, the office of deacon lost \nfurther distinction as it became subsumed in the ordination process \nto the Roman Catholic (male) priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of the Reformation, Phoebe gained prominence again in \npart because the book of Romans garnered disproportionate attention \nfrom biblical commentators. Moreover, church traditions where \npreachers expounded Scripture verse by verse (called lectio continua) \nwere sure to engage her directly. In the end, it was John Calvins \nGeneva that led the way in restoring the female diaconate among the \nProtestant tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four-fold office of the churchpastor, elder, deacon, \ndoctorrepresented the backbone of Calvins ecclesiology, and women \nwere not excluded from these ranks in the context of the diaconate, \naccording to Calvins Institutes. As lay ecclesiastical ministers, \ndeacons were distinct from elders (presbyters). Furthermore, Calvin \ntook from Romans 12:8 the idea to divide the diaconate into two \ndistinct roles: almsgiving to the poor and care of the poor and sick. \nCalvin attributed the second role to the work of widows, according to \nhis reading of 1 Tim. 5:910, a passage used by the Roman Catholic \ntradition as a basis for monastic vows. Establishment of a diaconate \nopen to women served the city of Geneva well as the city navigated \nhow to care for thousands upon thousands of religious refugees \npassing through the city from all over Europe and especially France.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause reform under Calvin involved clarifying the responsibilities \nof its various leaders and distinguishing them from political rulers \n, the diaconate was a church office, and he believed it should \ninclude women. Although female deacons were not limited to Geneva, as \nElsie McKees work has pointed out, the Calvinist Reformed diaconate \nwas the only Protestant or Anabaptist church order that included the \nteaching (if not often the practice) of a (subordinate) place for \nwomen in the regular offices of ministry. Calvins Geneva is, \ntherefore, a model and an outlier for what it means to take Phoebe \nseriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhoebes significance was further highlighted in French Reformed \nBibles. Sections called colophons were printed at the end of each \nepistle of the New Testament to provide information about the \nauthorship and geography of each letter. From the 16th century \nthrough the 18th century, Phoebes special relationship to Romans was \ndescribed in these colophons as letter carrier, servant, or deaconess \nfor the church. She is the only female to be remembered this way in \nthe tradition of Reformed New Testament colophons.\u0014\n\u0014\nPass It On\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough dispute over the significance of Phoebe persists in \nscholarship today, wide agreement over Phoebes letter-carrier role \nmoves the needle toward greater clarity in ways that cannot be \nignored. For one, the conclusion that Paul barred all women from \nexegetical and theological discussion, and even instruction, is ruled \nout. What that looks like will play out differently in churches and \ninstitutions of differing commitments , but Phoebes story will not \nallow any Christian who seeks to understand Scripture in its \nhistorical setting to believe that being a woman disqualifies someone \nfrom the realm of theology. If Paul did not disparage womens ability \nto converse about the most intricate of theological documents, \nneither should we.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inclusion of Phoebes name and role as a gospel bearer is another \nreminder to the church today of how Scripture highlights women as \nintegral and faithful contributors to Gods plan of redemption \nthrough his Son, Jesus Christ. When Paul introduced Phoebe to the \nchurch of Rome and encouraged the believers there to receive her with \nhonor, he was also introducing us to her today. We too are being \nasked to welcome what she brings. As Calvin writes, it would be \nunbecoming [to] the servants of Christ not to show her honor and \nkindness. And since it behooves us to embrace in love all the members \nof Christ, we ought surely to regard and especially to love and honor \nthose who perform a public office in the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, by entrusting Phoebe with the communication of this letter, \nPaul established a precedent that we follow todaywhether we \nrecognize it or notevery time we listen to Scripture being read and \nexplained. We hear Gods Word proclaimed through the voices of \nothers, just as Phoebe spoke and explained Pauls words to the church \nof Rome. Anyone who takes up Romans and shares it with others walks \nin the footsteps of its first interpreter, Phoebe.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is Paul communicating in Romans? In this one letter, he is \naiming to respond to the local churchs issues and work out his own, \nbut he responds to boththeir challenges of intermingling Jew and \nGentile and his of faithfully proclaiming the gospelwith the same \nconsistent affirmation: God is trustworthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nRomans is well known for its towering spiritual truth: God can be \ntrusted with the problem of sin, the threat of death, and the \nultimate salvation of all. Since this is true, Paul also argues in \nRomans that God can be trusted with the more mundane realities of \ndivision and anxiety. The message of Romans is that God can be \ntrusted to handle them all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that message finds resonance in the messenger. God is \ntrustworthy, so Paul can trust a somewhat surprising person to \ndeliver this, his most influential message. He neither argues for her \nnor defends her skill or wisdom. His introduction is powerful but \nsuccinct. No special pleading necessary. He trusts her because she \ntrusts God, and that is enough. When we all, no matter who we are, \ntrust in the trustworthy God, we like Phoebe can pass it on as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is that everyone who has put faith in Christ is charged \nwith passing on the Good News. By this act, as the priesthood of all \nbelievers, we live into what it means to be connected across time to \none another in the body of Christ and by the power of the living God. \nOur daughters and our sons both should be fully equipped to know the \nhope that lies within them, because God will send them into the world \nas gospel-bearers, where they will be called to answer pressing \nquestions about our sacred texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we pass on the Good News, we are not only living into the legacy \nof writers like Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. We are also living \ninto the legacy of Mary Magdalene to the upper room, Priscilla to \nApollos, and Phoebe to the church of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe too act as letter carriers within an apostolic chain that reaches \nback to the gift of Gods revelation, which is the basis for our \nwitness to the hope that we have in the death and resurrection of \nJesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJennifer Powell McNutt is the Franklin S.

    "words": "Phillis Wheatley Seeks Poem Subscribers\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nTimes were tight for Phillis Wheatley. Although frail and asthmatic, \nshe still had to earn money to support her family. Ever since she had \nbeen granted her freedom, she had scrabbled to make a living. She \nhoped that her standing as the first published African-American poet \nwould help her. On this day, October 30, 1779, her notice appeared in \nthe Evening Post and General Advisor of Boston. At that time, much \npublication was done by \"subscription,\" meaning one had to get enough \norders for a volume in order that the publisher could cover his costs.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhillis projected a volume of poems and letters on various subjects \n\"dedicated to the Right Hon. Benjamin Franklin, Esq: One of the \nAmbassadors of the United States at the Court of France.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt seven or eight years of age, in 1761, Phillis had been captured in \nSenegal, Africa and sold as a slave to the Wheatleys, a Boston family \nwho showed kindness to her. She quickly mastered English. At twelve \nshe was reading Greek and Latin. The Bible and the poetry of John \nMilton, Thomas Gray and Alexander Pope made a strong impression on \nher. She wrote her first poem at thirteen.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhillis came to world attention when she authored a tribute to George \nWhitefield. She sent this to Whitefield's sponsor, Selina Hastings, \nCountess of Huntington. Like most of her poetry, it was deeply \nreligious in tone:\u0014\n\u0014\nHail, happy saint, on thine immortal throne,\u0014\nPossessed of glory, life, and bliss unknown;\u0014\nThe countess invited Phillis to England and helped her secure \npublication of her poems. This was the first book by an African \nAmerican published. Immediately those who sought to abolish slavery \nheld it up as proof that Africans were not inferior to other humans.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Phillis had been well-treated and had become a Christian she \ncould say:\u0014\n\u0014\n'Twas mercy brought me from my pagan land,\u0014\nTaught my benighted soul to understand\u0014\nThat there's a God, that there's a Savior too:\u0014\nOnce I redemption neither sought nor knew...\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wheatleys eventually offered her her freedom and she accepted, \nalthough she tended them until their deaths. When she struck out on \nher own, she entered a marriage that proved difficult. Her three \nchildren died young while she struggled to support them as a \nseamstress and poet. Poverty took its toll and New England's cold \nworsened her breathing problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer hopes of raising enough subscriptions to print the book and earn \na little extra money for food failed. She died in 1784, just \nthirty-one years old. Her poems were not earth-shaking. Thomas \nJefferson sneered at them as \"below the dignity of criticism.\" But \nher work has survived and she left a legacy as an individual who \novercame serious drawbacks to leave a lasting name. African Americans \ncan point back to her with pride, although many consider her a \ntraitor to their race because she found some good in the circumstance \nof her enslavement.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGates, Henry Louis, jr.

    "words": "Politicians Quote Abraham Lincoln a Lot. Historians Say They Don't \nAlways Do His Words Justice\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever there is a time of crisis and uncertainty in America, one \nthing is certain: Abraham Lincoln is going to get quoteda lot.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 (2021)  insurrection at the U.S. Capitol \nand lawmakers debating on impeaching Donald Trump for a second time \nduring his last days in office, politicos on both sides of the aisle \nhave claimed that the Civil War President would be on their side. \nWhen asked at a Feb. 4 press conference why bother going through \nwith a second impeachment trial for the former President, House \nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said Ask Abraham LincolnYou cannot go forward \nuntil you have justice. Before Trumps second impeachment trial \nstarted, Republican National Committee chair and Trump supporter \nRonna McDaniel urged Biden and Senate Democrats to heed Lincolns \nwords and forego the trial to bringing our badly divided country \ntogether. In Dec. 2019, a group of Republicans announced the \nfounding of The Lincoln Project in the last year of the 2020 \npresidential campaign as an effort to defeat incumbent President \nDonald Trump and restore the Republican partys reputation as the \nparty of Lincoln.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Lincolns birthday on Feb. 12 and Presidents Day on Feb. 15 \napproaches, historians look back at the most notable recent uses and \nmisuses of the Great Emancipators words. According to these \nhistorians of the Civil War and Reconstruction, Lincoln might not \nhave been saying what people think.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou cannot freeze him at any moment. He was evolving during the \nwhole course of his career, says Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia \nUniversity. To try to hold him immobile, you miss the essence of \nLincoln.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln delivered his often-quoted first inaugural address during a \nchaotic transition of power similar to 2021s, right after the \nsecession of seven U.S. states that feared he would abolish slavery. \nWe are not enemies, but friends, he said on Mar. 4, 1861. The \nmystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and \npatriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this \nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again \ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many have used this last line as a plea for unity as quoted by \nRepublican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy who argued, our place in \nhistory depends on whether we call on our better angels in a \nstatement against impeaching Trump againit might not have been the \nwhole of Lincolns intention. Back then, Lincoln was appealing to \npeople in southern states that hadnt yet joined the Confederacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not a speech thats all about conciliation, says Kate \nMasur, a historian at Northwestern University. This is a speech that \ndelineates what the sources of the conflict are and says that he \nbelieves one side is in the right and one side is in the wrong and he \nsure hopes that more people wont join the wrong side.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincolns words are often used in the spirit of compromise, though \nhistorians say the President was vocally steadfast about his values. \nHe wouldnt back down on the pledge that won him the 1860 \npresidential election: prohibiting slavery in new federal \nterritories. The seven states that seceded before Inauguration Day \n1861 interpreted that policy position as the first step to abolishing \nslavery altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nVery oftenhes being quoted as a conciliator, a \ncompromisercompromiser in the good sensesomeone who could see all \nsides of an issue and come to some kind of middle way, Masur says. \nAnd I think that really sells Lincoln short and doesnt actually \nrepresent what kind of a President he was He indeed was able to \ncompromise. But he also took very strong stands on controversial \nissues, especially as the war went on.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis side of Lincoln also tends to get lost when calls for unity \nquote his second inaugural address from 1865, saying with malice \ntoward none, with charity for all and let us strive on to finish \nthe work we are in; to bind up the nations wounds. During the \ndebates on whether or not to impeach Trump a second time, the \nRepublican House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise quoted those lines \nto argue against a rushed impeachment and for moving forward.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat bothers me the most is the way in which people today remember \nLincoln as mainly a forgiving peacemaker and quote him selectively \ninstead of as the President who made total war upon slavery and \nunderstood the Civil War as divine judgement for the national sin of \nslavery, says Manisha Sinha, a historian at the University of \nConnecticut.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn that second inaugural speech, Foner notes, Lincoln is saying with \nreconciliation must come accountability and justice, that you cant \njust say, lets forget about the past, lets forget about our \nconflicts and move on. That wasnt what he was saying at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the years after Reconstruction, instead of accountability and \njustice came more injustice for Black Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eventual reconciliation, when it came in the 1890s, really was a \nreconciliation of whites, Northern whites, Southern whites, with \nracism being a principle that brought them together, says Foner. \nThe people left out of the reconciliation were Black Americans, \nwhose rights were systematically being stripped away, as white North \nand white South came to feel a sort of commonality of outlook and \ninterest.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking out on slavery as the real cause of Civil War in his second \ninaugural speech, and later calling on limited suffrage for Black \nAmericans in his last public address on April 11, 1865, would cost \nLincoln his life. Afraid that Lincoln was going to enfranchise all \nBlack men, John Wilkes Booth assassinated him on April 14, 1865.\u0014",

    "title": "PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS FROM  64 A.D.",
    "words": "On July 19 that year a great fire engulfed much of Rome; only four of \nthe fourteen quarters of the city escaped damage. Suspicion \nimmediately fell on Emperor Nero: was this a madcap way of clearing \npart of the city to make room for new, magnificent streets and \nbuildings in his honor? Nero, however, managed to deflect blame \nfirst, apparently, on the Jews, who had a reputation for large-scale \narson but also had friends at court; and then onto the Christians. \nMany Christians (perhaps including Peter) were seized, tortured, and \ndone to death in the arena.\u0014\n\u0014\nTacitus, writing in c. 115, included an account of the incident in \nhis Annales (XV, 44). Except for the manner of the Christians \ndeaths, which he thought excessively cruel, he showed no sympathy for \nthe Christians. Recording that Christus, from whom the name \n[Christians] had its origin was executed by one of our procurators, \nPontius Pilate, Tacitus described the Christians as a class hated \nfor their abominations and guilty of hatred of the human race, an \naccusation he also made against the Jews. Theirs was not a religion \nbut a deadly superstition, and hence worthy of repression. Though \nthere was no immediate sequel to Neros persecution, the fire \nforfeited any chance Christians might have had of being recognized as \nlegal religion (religio licita) separate from Judaism.\u0014",

    "words": "Preaching the holy war (Bible in America)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the men in blue and the men in gray marched off to fight in \n1861, they carried more than rifles and knapsacks. They took the \nblessing of ministers and other Christian leaders. Exceptions \noccurred, of course. Historic peace churches did not endorse the \nconflict, and disaffected people on both sides voiced dissent. On the \nwhole, though, clergy in the North and South found scriptural grounds \nto ardently support their respective causes. American culture was \ndrenched in biblical images; the ability of ministers to justify war \nin the name of the sacred book did much to mobilize popular support.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new crusaders\u0014\nWhen Lincolns 1860 election prompted Southern secession, Northern \nministers advised caution. Some with strong abolitionist convictions \nargued this might prove a blessing, freeing the United States from \nthe taint of slavery. More numerous Northern conservatives, some of \nwhom sympathized with the South, hoped forbearance would bring \nseceded states to their senses. Reluctance vanished when Confederates \nopened fire on Fort Sumter in April 1861. Lincolns call to suppress \nthe rebellion won nearly universal backing from Northern ministers. \nOne noted: If the crusaders, seized by a common enthusiasm, \nexclaimed, It is the will of God! It is the will of God!much more \nmay we make this our rallying cry and inscribe it on our banners.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreachers believed the hopes of humanity rested on the Unions \npreservation; the United States pure Protestant Christianity and \nrepublican institutions must remain models to the world. If the Union \nwas destroyed, Baptist minister and educator Francis Wayland \n(17961865) argued, crushed and degraded humanity must sink down in \ndespair. Many Yankee ministers thought Union soldiers were preparing \nthe way for the Kingdom of God on earth. William Buell Sprague \n(17951876), editor of Annals of the American Pulpit, predicted \nNorthern success would usher in a flood of millennial glory, the \ngreat Thanksgiving Day of the World.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Southern clergy also viewed their cause as holy. Noted ministers \ncalled for secession. When conflict began clergy declared it to be a \njust warand more. Confederates believed they bore a special mandate \nto set before the world ideals of ordered liberty, states rights, \nand biblical values. Religious leaders rejoiced that the Confederate \nconstitution explicitly recognized the nations dependence upon God. \nOne minister called the Confederacy the Lords peculiar people. \nAnother wrote, the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night was not \nmore plain to the children of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany believed the Confederacy represented the future. Robert Lewis \nDabney (18201898), theology professor at Union Theological Seminary \nand adjutant (assistant) to Stonewall Jackson, contended that the \nSouth would save the world from false ideas of radical democracy. \nOther preachers asserted that God might use the Confederacy to \ninaugurate his kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptism of blood\u0014\nOn January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and \nfundamentally altered the character of the war. Northern churches \nreflectedand in some cases, promotedthis shift. Initially most \nministers were reluctant to support abolition, but the first few \nyears of the war convinced them otherwise as the Army of the Potomac \nstumbled through successive defeats. They asserted that through this \ndefeat of Union arms, God had punished the United States for slavery \nand signaled that the oppressed should go free.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a few notable exceptions, Southern ministers believed that \npreserving slavery was an integral part of the Confederate mission: \nthey argued God had ordained it as the most humane means of relating \nlabor to capital, protecting Africans, and introducing them to the \nblessings of Christianity. We do not place our cause upon its \nhighest level, wrote Episcopal bishop Stephen Elliott (18061866), \nuntil we grasp the idea that God has made us the guardians and \nchampions of a people whom he is preparing for his own purposes and \nagainst whom the whole world is banded. Sermons and art frequently \ninvoked images of contented, loyal slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome ministers demanded an end to laws prohibiting slave literacy and \nlimiting ministerial preaching, for these kept African Americans from \nthe gospel. Similarly reformers desired statutory recognition of \nslave marriages and families. Such proposals never became law, but \nwon favorable comment from some Southern ministers who argued that \nGod would not bless the Confederacy until it made bondage fully \nhumane.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresidents Davis and Lincoln designated various fast days for \nrepentance during the war, and Northern and Southern clergy often \nnamed surprisingly similar transgressions: intemperance, Sabbath \nbreaking, greed, unrestricted individualism, and lack of loyalty to \nauthorities. Although clergy sometimes used fast days to condemn the \nenemy, generally each side reflected on its own sins. Presbyterian \nminister and Southern plantation owner Charles Colcock Jones \n(18041863) wrote to his aunt: We have been sinning with the \nNorthern people as a nation for seventy or eighty years, and now we \nhave become two nations, and the Lord may use us as rods of \ncorrection to each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants hoped the war might wash the nation clean, albeit through \nbloodshed. In the South Presbyterian pastor James H. Thornwell \n(18121862) warned our path to victory may be through a baptism of \nblood. B. T. Lacy (18191900), Episcopal chaplain to the Stonewall \nBrigade, declared: Baptized in its infancy in blood, may [the \nConfederacy] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and be \nconsecrated to its high and holy mission among the nations of the \nearth. On the Union side, Congregational pastor Horace Bushnell \n(18021876), shortly after Bull Run, told his parishioners more \nhumiliation and suffering must purge Americas dross: tears in the \nhouses, as well as blood in the fields. But once the ordeal passed, \nhe predicted, the United States would become Gods own nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Northern clergy this blood baptism received final ritual \nenactment when an assassin struck down Abraham Lincoln on Good \nFriday, 1865. The presidents death symbolized reparation for \nnational sins: He has been appointed . . . to be laid as the \ncostliest sacrifice of all upon the altar of the Republic and to \ncement with his blood the free institutions of our land.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost cause and legacies\u0014\nLong after guns fell silent, some ministers still sounded battle \ncries. Prominent Congregationalist Theodore Munger (18301910) \ncontinued to interpret the war as Gods righteous retribution on the \nwicked South. Southerners such as Dabney nursed grudges against \nYankees and longed for retributive providence to obliterate the \nUnion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut most Southerners admitted that preservation of the Union had been \nfor the best. Over the next decades, though, they celebrated \nConfederate memorial days, erected statues of the fallen, and \nproduced an outpouring of literature, surrounding the defeated South \nwith an aura of sentimental nobility. Advocates of the Lost Cause \nconverted Confederate warriors into pious men reluctantly taking up \narms; in a haze of moonlight and magnolias, they transfigured them \ninto romantic heroes with virtues appreciated even by former enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany clergy wished to bury the acrimony of the past; in the process \nboth church and society often trivialized or obscured deeper moral \nissues. African Americans paid the price. Victor and vanquished \ntacitly agreed to end Reconstruction without securing political \nrights for formerly enslaved people, who soon faced epidemic \nlynching, the gutting of civil-rights legislation, and the creation \nof Jim Crow laws. Surely this outcome fell far short of the moral \nrebirth that Protestants had hoped would follow their baptism of \nblood. CH\u0014\n\u0014\nBy James H.

    "words": "Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From \nthe Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since \nher baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter \nand gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for \nher. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a \nperiod of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or \nPocahontas, \"Princess,\" the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended \nthe invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown \nsettlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on \ntheir own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed \nthat Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during \nhis captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted \nto tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then \nLady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, \nplanning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. \nTaken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and \nbaptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she \nmarried John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience \nwhether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping \nto convert her, \"which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son \nChrist Jesus' sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has \nfalsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit \n(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning \ncartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film \nabout her perpetrated many distortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would \nhave chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed \nonly painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas \nrunning the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would \nhave ground corn and worked hides. Leisure for women and girls \n(except among the noble classes) was almost non-existent until two \ncenturies ago. Pocahontas is shown at peace with nature. Although \nIndian animism contained elements placating nature, peace it had not. \nIn one version, Pocahontas is given a pet raccoon. A raccoon would \nnot have been a cuddly pet but would have been destined for the pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian \nideals upon a pseudo-historical event. Christ changed the world so \ndrastically for women and animals that, even in imagination, we \ncannot remove the features contributed by faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nKjos, Berit. \"Pocahontas.\" \n(http://logosresourcepages.org/pocahont.html).\u0014\nLossing, Benson J.

    "title": "PIERRE POIRET'S SOBER MYSTICISM",
    "words": "Pierre Poiret's Sober Mysticism\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many ways to approach the Scriptures. One of the common \nmethods of interpretation today is called Dispensationalism. This is \na fancy word which means that God deals with mankind using different \nsystems during different eras.\u0014\n\u0014\nDispensationalism is often traced back to John Darby, who made it \npopular. However, the first man to develop a fully worked out \ndispensationalist system was Pierre Poiret. His system said that God \nhas dealt with or will deal with people on earth under seven \ndispensations (or economies) between creation and the end of the \nMillennium (the thousand year rule of Christ).\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre's parents died when he was young. To support himself, the \nyoung Frenchman learned engraving. Meanwhile, he studied theology. \nFor a while, he fell under the spell of Rene Descartes philosophy. \nBut when he saw that it led thinkers like Spinoza into Deism, he \nrebelled against it, becoming a mystic and studying the works of men \nlike Tauler, Thomas  Kempis and the Dutchman Jansz van Barneveldt. A \nmystic is a person who believes that one can know God intimately and \npowerfully, directly with his or her inner spirit. Unlike many \nmystics, who tend to go astray under the spell of their own mental or \nspiritual impressions, Pierre never wavered from the doctrine of the \ntrinity and always appealed to Scripture as his final authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis advice was often very practical. For example, he wrote that to \nsuccessfully renounce ourselves and no longer follow our sensual \nnature, we must pray continually. But prayer must be more than \nmouthing words. People who do that insult God:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...Such men will say God is their father, without wishing to obey \nHim like children. Hallowed be thy name, they will say, when in \nreality they despise and dishonor Him, preferring their own honor and \nwill to that of God...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre pastored several churches. Later he left the pulpit in order \nto follow Antoinette Bourignon, another mystic; he spent years \nstudying with her and after her death, wrote a defense of her. His \nbooks collecting the lives and writings of mystics showed that \nmysticism was defensible. Some of his arguments in favor of it caused \nhis contemporaries to revise their theologies.\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre died on May 21, 1719. His influence lived on through his \ndisciple Gerhard Tersteegen and in the Pietistic movement which \nattempted to give Christian life more feeling and make it less formal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFremantle, Anne.

    "title": "PATRICK HENRY, FOUNDING FATHER, SLAVE HOLDER",
    "words": "PATRICK HENRY: FOUNDING FATHER, SLAVE HOLDER AND PIONEER\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry was a successful lawyer and politician from Virginia. \nHe went on the become governor of the state as well as being a \nFounding Father. As an extensive landowner, and as most Founding \nFathers, Henry owned a number of slaves throughout is life. The \nnumber of slaves that Henry owned is recorded at about 80. However, \nhe would go on to become aware of the wrongdoings within slavery and \npush for its abolishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenrys dissent towards slavery can be seen in numerous documents \nthroughout his life including letters to colleagues. One of the most \nrelevant of these documents includes Henrys January 18, 1773 letter \nto Robert Pleasants. Within this letter, Henry first thanks Pleasants \nupon receiving a slave, and then continues to discuss a number of \ndisagreements towards the idea of slavery. He speaks on Christianity \nand the fact that it consists in softening the human heart however \nit allows a practice so totally repugnant. Henry goes on to say \nthat it is hard to believe that during a time of enlightenment and \nemphasis on human rights, that the practice of slavery could continue.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an extremely outspoken and opinionated politician, it is hard to \ndetermine his influences in terms of disagreements within slavery. He \nwas one that was against the United States Constitution and a firm \nbeliever in the rights of the individual. However, he often \nreferenced religion when discussing the subject. Henry stated that \nthe abolishment of slavery is the furthest advance we can make \ntoward justice.The purity of our religionis at variance with that \nlaw which warrants slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of specific actions, Patrick Henry consistently held \nspeeches, wrote letters and was a prominent leader in the process of \nabolishing slavery. He became a prominent figure in opposition to \nslavery, something that his fellow Founding Fathers both acknowledged \nand embraced. Henry is quoted in stating that slavery was \ninconsistent with the Bible, and destructive to morality.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry is often referred to as the voice of revolution for his stern \nand outspoken demeanor. As Thomas Jefferson outlines, the push for \nthe abolishment of slavery in Virginia almost lied solely on the \napproaches of Henry. Jefferson can be quoted speaking of Patrick \nHenry stating that he was even more determined in his opposition to \nslavery then the rest of us. Jefferson also credits Henry with \nallowing Virginians to find the moral courage to take a bold and \ndecided stand.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry was a religious man, which often showed throughout his \nrole as one that was opposed to slavery. Although he is famously \nquoted stating that he was drawn along by the general inconvenience \nof living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it, his \nslaves were treated slightly different than the average. Henrys \nslaves were often taught to read the Bible. They were also taught \nother specific trades such as carpentry, distilling whiskey, tanning \nleather or blacksmithing.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also held numerous relationships with Quakers and Baptists. He \nrevered them and their willingness to free their slaves. Although \nradical Quakers had been continuously pushing for the abolishment of \nslavery, Henrys role was significant enough. He was labeled by these \nradical Quakers as a real half Quaker in religious matters a saint \nbut the very devil in politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with religious beliefs, Henry believed in ideals of liberty \nthat were becoming popular and America and contradicted the practice \nof slavery. James Madison shared a common view of slavery with Henry, \ncalling the practice unrepublican due to the fact that it \nencouraged vicious behavior by the planters against their weaker, \nvictimized laborers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt that Patrick Henry was revolutionary in the area of \nthe abolishment of slavery. He was outspoken, knowledgeable and \nprogressive within the practice that he resented. Although he often \nadvocated for abolishment, treated his slaves differently and rallied \nsupport for his ideas, he was under scrutiny by some. This was due to \nthe fact that he himself had never released his slaves, even upon his \ndeath. Henry was a man of revolution and his views on slavery were \nthose of dissent. He was one of the leading participants in ending \nthe slave trade between Africa and Virginia as well as an advocate \nfor abolishment as a whole.\u0014\n\u0014\nALL OF THIS WHILE HE WAS OWNING SLAVES\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of his death, there were 67 enslaved people on his \nproperty. 32 of these men and women were listed as being over the age \nof 16 and physically healthy. The rest of those listed would have \nbeen children or adults too old or infirm to work.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources\u0014\n\u0014\nKidd, Thomas S. Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots.

I thank you for it. It is not \na little surprising that Christianity, whose chief excellence \nconsists in softening the human heart, in cherishing and improving \nits finer feelings, should encourage a practice so totally repugnant \nto the first Impression of right and wrong. What adds to the wonder \nis that this abominable practice has been introduced in the most \nenlightened ages, times that seem to have pretensions to boast of \nhigh Improvements in the arts, sciences, and refined morality, have \nbrought into general use, and guarded by many laws, a species of \nviolence and tyranny, which our more rude and barbarous, but more \nhonest ancestors detested. Is it not amazing, that at a time, when \nthe rights of humanity are defined and understood with precision, in \na country above all others fond of liberty, that in such an age, and \nsuch a country we find men, professing a religion the most humane, \nmild, meek, gentle and generous; adopting a principle as repugnant to \nhumanity as it is inconsistent with the Bible and destructive to \nliberty.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Every thinking honest man rejects it in speculation, how few in \npractice from conscientious motives? The world in general has denied \nthe people a share of its honors, but the wise will ascribe to the a \njust tribute of virtuous praise, for the practice of a train of \nvirtues among which your disagreement to slavery will be principally \nrankedI cannot but wish well to a people whose system imitates the \nexample of Him whose life was perfectAnd believe me, I shall honor \nthe Quakers for their noble effort to abolish slavery. It is equally \ncalculated to promote moral and political good.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Would any one believe that I am master of slaves of my own purchase! \nI am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living without them. \nI will not, I cannot justify it. However culpable my conduct, I will \nso far pay my devoir to virtue, as to own the excellence and \nrectitude of her precepts, and to lament the want of conforming to \nthemI believe a time will come when an opposition will be offered to \nabolish this lamentable evilEvery thing we can do is to improve it, \nif it happens in our day, if not, let us transmit to our descendants \ntogether with our slaves, a pity for their unhappy lot, and an \nabhorrence for slavery. If we cannot reduce this wished for \nreformation to practice, let us treat the unhappy victims with \nlenity, it is the furthest advance we can make toward justice. We owe \nto the purity of our religion to show that it is at variance with \nthat law which warrants slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Here is an instance that silent meetings have done yet which learned \nand  elaborate preaching could not effect, so much preferable are the \ngenuine dictates of conscience and a steady attention to its feelings \nabove the teachings of those men who pretend to have found a better \nguide. I exhort you to persevere in so worthy a resolution. Some of \nyour people disagree, or at least are lukewarm in the abolition of \nslavery. Many treat the resolution of your meeting with ridicule, and \namong those who throw contempt on it, are clergymen, whose surest \nguard against both ridicule and contempt is a certain act of assembly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I know not where to stop, I could say many things on this subject; a \nserious review of which gives a gloomy perspective to future times.\"\u0014",

    "title": "PATRICK HENRY'S COMPLICITY IN SLAVERY",
    "words": "Slavery at Red Hill (Patrick Henry's Home)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the woods, about half a mile west of the Visitor Center at Red \nHill is an isolated cemetery that holds the remains of at least three \ngenerations of African Americans. It is a silent but powerful \nreminder that Red Hill, like the homes of other Founding Fathers at \nMount Vernon and Monticello, was a plantation dependent on the work \nof enslaved persons. Visitors to Red Hill can visit this sacred site \nby walking down the Quarter Place Trail.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry, like many of his compatriots in the pursuit of liberty \nfor the colonies, had a deeply complicated relationship with slavery. \nAs the Voice of the Revolution, Henry campaigned eloquently for \nliberty above all elsedevotion to liberty is the legacy that we \nattribute to him even today. And yet as a slave owner, he partook in \na practice that to our 21st-century eyes seems to be the height of \nhypocrisy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there is no way to gloss over Henrys ownership of enslaved \npeople, his fraught relationship with the practice provides an \nintriguing insight into his character. Henry became a slave owner at \nthe age of 18, as a part of his wife Sarahs dowry. And though we may \nwish that his troubled conscience had led him to take a stronger \ndecisive stance against slavery in the early days of forming the \nnation and his own life, the efforts he did make on behalf of \nenslaved individualsincluding support for legislation that made the \nmanumissions legal for the first time in Virginiais noteworthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis thoughts on the topic are an instructive glimpse into the debate \nthat would continue to brew within the states for almost 100 more \nyears before finally coming to a breaking point in the Civil War. In \na letter he wrote to a friend, he signs off with a chilling \nprediction that the issue of slavery gave a gloomy perspective to \nfuture times, something that would come true on the battlefields \nacross the South a century later.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelow you will find the details of the juxtaposing reality of slavery \nand enslaved life at Red Hill with the troubling thoughts Henry \nexpressed about his ownership of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nRed Hill as a Plantation\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the details we know of the enslaved people who lived and \nworked at Red Hill comes from an estate inventory, taken at the \nplantation in July 1799 just one month after Patrick Henrys death. \nAt the time, there were 67 enslaved people on the property. 32 of \nthese men and women were listed as being over the age of 16 and \nphysically healthy. The rest of those listed would have been children \nor adults too old or infirm to work.\u0014\n\u0014\nRed Hill produced on average some 20,000 pounds of tobacco per year \nduring his ownership. The cultivation of tobacco was tedious and \nlabor-intensive. The process included preparation of the seedbeds, \nfertilizing, planting, transplanting, topping, suckering, priming, \nweeding, worming, cutting, bulking, curing, stripping, and prizing. A \nyield of 20,000 pounds of leaf would have required a minimum of 20 \nenslaved people tending 50 acres of tobacco at Red Hill. The wheat \nand corn growing along the slope and lowlands below the plantation \nhouse also required attention. On average, one enslaved person could \ntend 4 or 5 acres of corn, while four or five enslaved people were \nneeded to reap the same acreage of wheat.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther work done by the enslaved population, as indicated in the \nestate inventory, would have been caring for the livestock, which \nincluded 156 cattle, 155 hogs, 60 sheep, and 22 horses. Livestock \nduties included fencing in fields, building and repairing pens, \nheaping and hauling manure, as well as castrating lambs, shearing \nsheep, milking cows, and fattening and slaughtering hogs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny enslaved people who werent working in the fields or with the \nlivestock at the plantation at Red Hill would have been considered \ndomestic servants, assigned to work in the main house, kitchen, \nscullery, and the laundry, under the supervision of the mistress of \nthe house. Enslaved people also were expected to operate the tannery \nand distillery, as well as the plantation store and blacksmith shop.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho Were They?\u0014\n\u0014\nThanks to the 1799 estate inventory, we know the names and specific \ndetails about a few of the enslaved people who resided at Red Hill. \nOne was a man named Jessee, who was named as a skilled \nworkerpossibly a blacksmith.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone else who had been with Henry for most of his adult life was a \nman named Pedro, who worked as a trusted messenger and coachman, and \nwho passed away shortly before Patrick Henry himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother estate inventory taken three years later in 1802 gives a bit \nmore detail into the names and work of several individuals. Two of \nthe women named in that inventory are Dinah,  an old woman, and \nBeck, who it states was in  the decline of life. These two were \nremarkable for having been with Henry since his very early days at \nRoundabout Plantation back in 1768 and had likely been given to him \nupon his marriage in 1754.\u0014\n\u0014\nA boy by the name of Shadrack, who would have been between 12 and 16, \nwas listed in the 1802 inventory as the familys coachman at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat position was later taken up by Harrison, who had lived with the \nfamily since his childhood when he had attended to Mrs. \nHenrycarrying her key basket and yarn for her. (Harrisons mother \nwas Critty, the familys enslaved cookshe and Harrison, along with \nhis two brothers, Jack and Coleman, had lived in the kitchen.) Living \npast the age of 100, Harrison worked for four generations of Henrys \nat Red Hill. Harrison continued to live on the property after he was \nfreed. The coachmans cabin, which can still be visited at Red Hill, \nwas given to him by William Wirt Henry to reward his years of service \nto the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nBesides the 67 enslaved people at Red Hill, Patrick Henry was also a \nslave owner at his Long Island and Seven Islands properties, totaling \n112 in all at the time of his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Henrys Death\u0014\n\u0014\nAs was usually the case, the death of Patrick Henry, as master of the \nplantation had a profound effect on the enslaved population at Red \nHill. In his will, he gave his wife Dorothea his Red Hill estate \nalong with 20 enslaved workers of her choosing. He also gave her \npermission to free one or two of them if she desired. By 1805, she \nhad freed at least five. The other enslaved people at Red Hill were \nto be distributed among his children as part of their inheritance. \nAfter the estate was settled, more than 2/3 of the enslaved people \nhad been moved from the plantation. Their departure had a devastating \neffect on the enslaved community at Red Hill, sending fathers, \nchildren, and grandchildren to live in different places apart from \none another.\u0014",

So many conflicting details were added that the makers \nof church calendars became confused and honored three different men \nnamed Procopius! His feast is on this day, July 8.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Roman Emperor Diocletian launched the last and most ruthless \nof the ten Roman persecutions against Christians, his first victim in \nPalestine was a young man named Procopius. Eusebius was alive at the \ntime. The Christian author, who became bishop of Caesarea and wrote \nthe most famous history of the early church, left an account of the \nmartyr:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The first of all the martyrs who appeared in Palestine was named \nProcopius. In truth he was a godly man, for even before his \nconfession he had given up his life to great endurance: and from the \ntime that he was a little boy had been of pure habits, and of strict \nmorals: and by the vigor of his mind he had so brought his body into \nsubjection, that, even before his death, his soul seemed to dwell in \na body completely mortified, and he had so strengthened his soul by \nthe word of God that his body also was sustained by the power of God. \nHis food was bread only, and his drink water; and he took nothing \nelse besides these two. Occasionally he took food every second day \nonly, and sometimes every third day; oftentimes too he passed a whole \nweek without food.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But he never ceased day nor night from the study of the word of God: \nand at the same time he was careful as to his manners and modesty of \nconduct, so that he edified by his meekness and piety all those of \nhis own standing. And while his chief application was devoted to \ndivine subjects, he was acquainted also in no slight degree with \nnatural science. His family was from Baishan; and he ministered in \nthe orders of the Church in three things: First, he had been a \nReader; and in the second order he translated from Greek into \nAramaic; and in the last, which is even more excellent than the \npreceding, he opposed the powers of the evil one, and the devils \ntrembled before him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Now it happened that he was sent from Baishan to our city Caesarea, \ntogether with his brother confessors. And at the very moment that he \npassed the gates of the city they brought him before the Governor: \nand immediately upon his first entrance the judge, whose name was \nFlavianus, said to him: 'It is necessary that thou shouldest \nsacrifice to the gods': but he replied with a loud voice, 'There is \nno God but one only, the Maker and Creator of all things.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And when the judge felt himself smitten by the blow of the martyr's \nwords, he furnished himself with arms of another kind against the \ndoctrine of truth, and, abandoning his former order, commanded him to \nsacrifice to the emperors, who were four in number; but the holy \nmartyr of God laughed still more at this saying, and repeated the \nwords of the greatest of poets of the Greeks [Homer], which he said \nthat 'the rule of many is not good: let there be one ruler and one \nsovereign.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And on account of his answer, which was insulting to the emperors, \nhe, though alive in his conduct, was delivered over to death, and \nforthwith the head of this blessed man was struck off, and an easy \ntransit afforded him along the way to heaven. And this took place on \nthe seventh day of the month Heziran, in the first year of the \npersecution in our days. This confessor was the first who was \nconsummated in our city Caesarea.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOver time, Eusebius' simple account became greatly exaggerated. So \nmany conflicting details were added that the makers of church \ncalendars became confused and honored three different men named \nProcopius!

    "title": "PAUL'S VIEW OF THE LAW",
    "words": "Pauls view of the law\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted from Understanding the Jewish Roots of Christianity: \nBiblical, Theological, and Historical Essays on the Relationship \nbetween Christianity and Judaism, David Rudolph considers the \nsometimes hotly contested debate about Paul and the law and whether \nhe was championing a new freedom fromor end toJewish law.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Paul and the law debate has been ongoing since the time of \nPaul, and there is no sign of it winding down. One person quotes \nRomans 10:4, Christ is the end of the law, while another responds \nwith 1 Timothy 1:8, We know that the law is good if it is used \nproperly. Back and forth, like a table-tennis game, the discussion \ncontinues. Is there anything new worth saying on the subject of Paul \nand the law? Many do not think so, and so commentaries recycle the \nsame arguments that have been made for almost 2,000 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I cannot claim to have discovered some secret knowledge that \nwill cause everyone to agree on the issue of Paul and the law, I do \nhave an observation to share that I think has the potential to cut \nthrough the morass surrounding the specific question of whether Paul \nwas championing a new freedom fromor end toJewish law for Jewish \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nActs 21:1726 then puts the nail in the coffin of the slander. In the \nchapters following Acts 21:1726, Paul confirms four times that he \nkeeps the Torah and that he has done nothing against the law or the \ncustoms of his people:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tConfirmation 1: Brothers, I am [present tense] a Pharisee, a son \nof Pharisees (Acts 23:6 ESV; see Acts 26:5).18\u0014\n2.\tConfirmation 2: But this I admit to you . . . I worship the God \nof our ancestors, believing everything laid down according to the law \nor written in the prophets. . . . I do my best always to have a clear \nconscience toward God and all people (Acts 24:14, 16 NRSV).\u0014\n3.\tConfirmation 3: I have in no way committed an offense against the \nlaw of the Jews, or against the temple, or against the emperor (Acts \n25:8 NRSV).\u0014\n4.\tConfirmation 4: Brothers, though I had done nothing against our \npeople or the customs of our ancestors, yet I was arrested in \nJerusalem (Acts 28:17 NRSV).\u0014\nIn literary context, each of these four confirmations points back to \nActs 21:1726.19 One may ask what more Luke could have included in \nhis narrative to express that Paul was a Torah-observant Jew. Acts is \nreplete with statements that describe Paul as faithful to Jewish law \nand custom; statements to the contrary are consistently identified as \nfalse rumors.\u0014\n\u0014\nA more detailed examination of the text of Acts 21:1726, the chief \ndefense, adds lexical and contextual support to the above conclusions:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. James maintains that Paul observes the law (phylasson ton nomon \n[Acts 21:24]). The language (in the present active tense) refers to \ncareful observance of the law as a whole (see Gal. 6:13; Rom. 2:26):\u0014\nMany NT occurrences of phulasso speak of observing the law or \ncommandments (used thus also in the LXX). The basic idea of keeping \na law, etc. from being broken (BAGD s.v. 1.f) yields the meaning \nobserve, follow, keep. Initially this refers to observance of the \nTorah, the law as a whole (nomon: Acts 7:53; 21:24; Gal. 6:13), the \ncommandments (entolas: Mark 10:19; Matt. 19:17; Luke 18:20), or \nindividual provisions among them (dikaiomata: Rom. 2:26). In the \nSynoptics as in Acts and Paul this usage is linked with criticism of \nJewish observance of the law (a significant exception is Acts 21:24, \nwhere Paul is presented as being in agreement with the Jewish \nChristians).20 \u0014\n\u0014\nPhulasso . . . serves esp. to express the divinely required attitude \nof man to the divine covenant, Exodus 19:5 etc., and to the cultic \nstatutes, laws, commandments, admonitions and warnings; in this sense \nit becomes a tt. [terminus technicus] in the legal traditions from \nExodus to Deuteronomy.21 \u0014\n\u0014\nPhulasso . . . to continue to keep a law or commandment from being \nbroken.22 \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Lukes use of covenant imageryzealous for the law, Moses, \ncircumcision, Nazirites, ritual purification, temple, sacrifice, \nPentecost season (when the law was given)adds to the \ncovenant-keeping connotation of phylasson ton nomon in Acts 21:24.23 \u0014\n3. The kai in alla stoicheis kai autos (Acts 21:24) is emphatic,24 as \nin the ESV (you yourself also [kai] live in observance of the law), \nand identifies Paul with the antecedentthe thousands of \nJesus-believing Jews in Jerusalem who are zealous for the law.25 \nPauls identification with frum Jews is also vividly expressed in the \npicture of him leading the four Nazirites (the most zealous of the \nzealous) into the temple (Then Paul took the men  he entered the \ntemple with them [21:26 nrsv]). Here Paul is numbered among the \nzealous for the law. James plan is for the Jewish world to know \nthat Paul, whom Luke describes as a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees in \nthe present tense, continues to observe the law like the zealous \nfor the law and teaches in a way consistent with these convictions \n(Acts 21:20, 24; 23:6).26 Lukes positive emphasis on Paul being \nzealous for the law may explain why the Muratorian Canon (ca. 170 \nce) comments that Paul had taken [Luke] with him as one zealous for \nthe law.27 \u0014\n4. The use of stoicheis in Acts 21:24 (see Rom. 4:12; Gal. 5:25) \nsuggests a consistency of lifestyle.28 It can be variously \ntranslated: live in (ESV) or live in conformity with (NET). \nJames point is that Paul walked the walk of a Torah-faithful Jew.\u0014\n5. Acts 21:1726 is the mirror text of Acts 15. James anticipates \nPauls concern that his public testimony may be misinterpreted by \ngentile believers to mean that they, too, should be fully Torah \nobservant. He reassures Paul that the gentile believers will not \nmisunderstand because as for the Gentiles who have become believers, \nwe have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from \nwhat has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is \nstrangled and from fornication (Acts 21:25 NRSV).\u0014\n \u0014\nHere James restates the Acts 15 Jerusalem Council decision that \nexempted Jesus-believing gentiles from circumcision and other \nJewish-specific requirements of the Torah: James parallels the \nnecessity of Jews keeping the law with the necessity of gentiles to \nkeep the Apostolic decree (21:25).30 This mirroring between the \nJerusalem Council decision and Acts 21:1726 is reinforced by Lukes \nreference to Moses in Acts 15:21 and 21:21. There is also a parallel \nuse of phylasso in Acts 16:4 and 21:24.31 Matthew Thiessen sums up \nthe significance of Acts 21:1726 in relation to Acts 15: While both \nPaul and the Jerusalem assembly believe that Jews ought to continue \nin their observance of the law, both agree that gentiles should not, \na decision of the Jerusalem Council that Luke reiterates here \n(21:25). . . . Not only does God not require Jewish Christ followers \nto abandon law observance,32 he actually requires them to continue in \nlaw observance.33 Pauls testimony in the temple in 21:26 confirms \nthat he is in accord with this view.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn sum, Lukes portrait of Paul in Acts 21:1726 makes clear that \nPaul remained a Torah-observant Jew after becoming a follower of \nJesus and taught in a way that was consistent with these convictions. \nThe text represents Lukes attempt to (1) resolve controversy over \nthis important matter in the ekklesia of his day and (2) provide a \nvital frame of reference for how Pauls teachings on the law in \nrelation to the Jewish people should be interpreted.34 There is no \nevidence that Acts 21:1726 is an example of Paul becoming a Jew to \nthe Jews to win the Jews, as some scholars suggest.35 Rather, Pauls \nactions were intended to set the record straight that he lived as a \nTorah-observant Jew and taught fellow Jews to remain faithful to \nJewish law and custom. His attempt to settle the matter once and for \nall was the equivalent of a sworn testimony given in the temple \ncourts, before God and altar, and before myriads of strictly \nTorah-observant Jews who understood the meaning of his actions.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo . . . what was Pauls view of the law?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate about Pauls view of the law has been going on since the \nfirst century. On the one hand, some have maintained that Paul viewed \nJewish law as something that was superseded, ended, and made \nsuperfluous in Christ. On the other hand, some have held that Paul \nregarded Jewish law as a matter of indifference, expediency, and \nfreedom in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis essay has argued for a third possibilitya Paul who regarded \nJewish identity and law observance as a matter of calling and \ncovenant fidelity. Moreover, I have proposed that this is the \nperspective of the three weightiest texts in the New Testament that \naddress the issue of Paul and Jewish law: 1 Corinthians 7:1724 \n(Pauls rule); Acts 15:2229 (the Jerusalem Council ruling); and Acts \n21:1726 (Pauls public testimony before God and witnesses in the \ntemple courts).\u0014\n\u0014\nThese passages cry out to set the record straight that Paul lived as \na Torah-observant Jew and taught fellow Jews to remain faithful to \nIsraels law and custom.\u0014",

    "words": "Powerful earthquake strikes Haiti    (Next door Dominican Republic \nnot touched)\u0014\nBy Maria Abi-Habib  Aug. 14, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti  A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti on \nSaturday morning, hitting the impoverished Caribbean country that is \nstill recovering from a disastrous quake more than 11 years ago. \nHeavy damage and people trapped in rubble were reported in at least \ntwo cities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States Geological Survey said the quake struck five miles \nfrom the town of Petit Trou de Nippes in the western part of the \ncountry, about 80 miles west of Port-au-Prince. Seismologists said it \nhad a depth of seven miles. It was felt as far away as 200 miles in \nJamaica.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe quake could hardly have come at a worse time for the nation of 11 \nmillion, which has been in the throes of a political crisis since \nPresident Jovenel Mose was assassinated on July 7.  \u0014\nwhich can cause enormous damage a\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were no immediate reports of fatalities, but pictures and video \nposted on social media showed collapsed structures and panicked \nresidents in their pajamas screaming the names of loved ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least two cities reported major devastation: Les Cayes and \nJeremie. Phone lines were down in Petit Trou de Nippes, the epicenter \nof the quake, and no news emerged immediately from that city, leaving \nHaitian officials to fear for the worst.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany houses fell. Many people are trapped under the rubble, said \nWidchell Augustin, 35, said from Les Cayes, where he lives. We can \nhear people screaming under the rubble. People are running \nback-and-forth to the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nVideos emerged with people still in their pajamas or bath towels, out \nin the street seeking refuge from their violently trembling homes, \nassessing the devastation, many screaming. Entire three-story \nbuildings were flattened to eye-level; another video showed a group \nof men sifting through rubble and trying to remove debris  to extract \nsomeone stuck underneath.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne video from Les Cayes showed residents, fearing tsunami warnings \ntriggered by the quake, fleeing a surge of seawater flooding a \nstreet. The U.S. Tsunami Warning Center had reported  a tsunami \nthreat for some coasts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother video from Les Cayes showed the sun blurred out by plumes of \ndust from the destruction. Houses were flattened, the bricks that \nonce served as their foundation now in a pile of rubble spilling out \nonto the street.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne man likened it to the cataclysmic earthquake that struck the \ncountry in January of 2010.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat earthquake, with a  magnitude of 7.0,  killed more than 220,000 \npeople and leveled much of the capital, Port-au-Prince.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaitis southern peninsula, the site of the Saturday quake, was hit \nhard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and, five years later, has still \nnot fully recovered. Remnants of the devastationstill linger, with \nHaitis broke government unable to fully restore all the houses, \nroads and government buildings destroyed.\u0014",

    "words": "Great was the turmoil and many the monstrous crimes committed in the \nname of Christ in the wake of the Reformation in Europe. Religious \npassions quickly passed into political conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Diet (a formal assembly of princes) of Worms in 1521, Emperor \nCharles V outlawed Lutheranism . But he was unable to stamp out the \nreform movement at the time because of other crises. Not until 1529 \nwas Charles able to follow up on the Lutheran issue. He sent word \nthat Catholicism was to be restored everywhere in Germany. Many \nGerman cities and princes protested. These were called the \n\"Protesting estates\" and from them we got the name \"Protestant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nConfession of Augsburg\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles saw that some sort of conciliation would be in order. In 1530 \nhe attended an assembly known as the Diet at Augsburg. Lutherans \npresented the Confession of Augsburg in an attempt to prove to Rome \nthat their views were Biblical. This confession remains the basis of \nthe Lutheran faith. However, reconciliation proved impossible and \nCharles ordered Lutherans to reunite with the Catholic church by \nApril 15, 1531. This had the effect of stiffening opposition against \nhim. A military alliance of Protestants, known as the Schmalkaldic \nLeague came into being. Charles crushed this, but Elector Maurice \nswitched sides and declared war on the emperor, forcing him to \nnegotiate with the Protestants. In 1552, at the Peace of Passau, \nCharles accepted the existence of the evangelical church and promised \nto hold a \"diet\" to settle the controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeace of Augsburg Created\u0014\n\u0014\nThe diet was not convened until 1555. Again it was held in Augsburg. \nPeace was arranged between the Lutherans and Catholics on this day, \nSeptember 25, 1555. In many respects it was imperfect. Although \nLutherans were given legal standing, Anabaptists and Calvinists were \nnot. \"[A]ll such as do not belong to the two above-named religions \nshall not be included in the present peace but be totally excluded \nfrom it.\" Each German territory must take the faith of its prince. \nThis inbuilt religious divisiveness crippled Germany's ability to \nunite as a nation. There was no toleration within a territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg did, however, permit people to transplant to a \nregion whose faith was more congenial to each. \"In case our subjects, \nwhether belonging to the old religion or to the Augsburg Confession, \nshould intend leaving their homes, with their wives and children, in \norder to settle in another place, they shall neither be hindered in \nthe sale of their estates after due pay, net of the local taxes nor \ninjured in their honor... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg offered the merest hint of toleration. Weak as \nwas the treaty, it brought increased stability. However, not until \nthe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 were Calvinists added to the list of \ntolerated religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Augsburg, Peace of.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

    "title": "POPE HONORIUS CONDEMNED FOR HERESY",
    "words": "WHY WAS POPE HONORIUS CONDEMNED FOR HERESY?\u0014\n \u0014\nOn  27 October 625, Honorius I began his reign as pope, which lasted \nuntil his death in 638. His thirteen-year pontificate created a \nlasting complication for proponents and defenders of papal \ninfallibility because he was condemned as a heretic by a major church \ncouncil. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt stake was the issue of Christs nature. The doctrine of \nMonothelitism, which Honorius held, taught that Christ had in effect \nonly a divine will, not both the divine and the human wills. Writing \nto patriarchs who questioned this teaching, Honorius spoke in favor \nof the heretical doctrine. Eleven years after Honoriuss death, Pope \nMartin and more than a hundred Italian bishops condemned \nMonothelitism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question became controversial enough that Emperor Constantine IV \ndecided to settle the matter by summoning a general council. This met \nin Constantinople in 680 and is known as Sixth Ecumenical Council or \nthe Third Council of Constantinople. The council condemned and \nanathematized all the leaders of the Monothelite heresyincluding \nHonorius I who was mentioned by name. The papal legates who were \npresent joined in the condemnation. Some of Honoriuss writings were \nburned as heretical. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Leo II endorsed the condemnation, as did later popes. Honoriuss \nname was struck from the diptychs (a list of names of living and dead \nChristians for whom special prayers are made during the liturgy in \nmany eastern and western churches). As Janus (probably church \nhistorian Johannes Joseph Ignaz von Dllinger) would later write, \nThis one factthat a Great Council, universally received afterwards \nwithout hesitation throughout the Church, and presided over by Papal \nlegates, pronounced the dogmatic decision of a Pope heretical, and \nanathematized him by name as a hereticis a proof, clear as the sun \nat noonday, that the notion of any peculiar enlightenment or \ninerrancy of the Popes was then utterly unknown to the whole Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefenders of Papal infallibility have fallen into three camps in \ndealing with this council. The first camp attacked the acts of the \nCouncil as spurious, and pretended they were a forgery. The evidence \nwas always against this position and most Catholics abandoned it in \nthe eighteenth century. A second tack was to rework Honoriuss words \ninto some sort of resemblance to orthodoxy. A recent position has \nbeen to say in effect, Yes, Honorius was wrong, but he was not \nanathematized for actually teaching error, but only for not taking a \nstrong stand against it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe councils sentence against Honorius says, according to the Labbe \nand Cossarts translation, [W]e define that there shall be expelled \nfrom the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius who was some \ntime Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to \nSergius, that in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his \nimpious doctrines.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Pope John XII: The Youngest and Worst Pope in History\u0014\nThe eighteen-year-old pope whose drinking, gambling, incest, and \nmurders marked the lowest point in two thousand years of the papacy\u0014\nJosh West MA\u0014\n\u0014\nA robber, a murderer, and incestuous person, unworthy to represent \nChrist upon the pontifical throne  This abominable priest soiled the \nchair of St. Peter for nine entire years and deserved to be called \nthe most wicked of popes.\u0014\n\u0014\nTThis was how the French historian and pamphleteer Louis Marie \nDeCormenin described Pope John XII, who served as Supreme Pontiff and \nruler of the Papal States from 955 to 964 and who has gone down as \none of, if not the, worst popes in history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Papal Pornocracy\u0014\n\u0014\nJohns pontificate came at the end of what catholic historians call \nthe Saeculum Obscurum, the dark century, and others call the Papal \nPornocracy meaning rule of prostitutes. The Carolingian Empire, \nwhich acted as the greatest defender and supporter of the integrity \nand independence of the papacy had collapsed long ago. Since then, \nRome and the papacy had been controlled by powerful rival Italian \nfamilies.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the election of Pope Sergius III in 904, the papacy was firmly \nin the hands of the Theophylacti family, beginning with \nTheophylactus, Count of Tusculum, who had placed Sergius on the papal \nthrone. For much of the early tenth century though, it was \nTheophylactuss daughter, Marozia, who was the real power in Rome, \nearning the epithet Senatrix of Rome. Marozia was the mistress of \none pope (Sergius III), and personally appointed two more (Anastasius \nIII and Lando) before murdering a third (John X) to have her and \nSergiuss illegitimate son elected Pope John XI in 931. She then \nmarried her close relative, Hugh of Provence, King of Italy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut whilst Marozia was busy ruling Rome and selecting popes, she was \nignoring her other son, Alberic, Duke of Spoleto and Pope Johns \nhalf-brother. Alberic was incensed at his mother for overlooking him \nin favour of John, and absolutely despised Hugh for punching him in \nthe face during a party at the Castel SantAngelo, the papal fortress.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 932, Alberic led a mob to storm the Castel and remove his mother \nand step-father from power. Hugh escaped through a window but Marozia \nand pope John were captured and imprisoned in the fortress. Marozia \nwas never heard of again but John was later released, becoming a \npuppet for his half-brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlberic remained the master of Rome for twenty years. He successfully \ndefeated numerous attempts by Hugh to return to power and appointed \nfour popes, one of which, Stephen VIII, he had mutilated to death for \nnot following his instructions. In 937, Alberic had a son by a \nmistress, which he named Octavianus after the great Emperor Augustus, \na testament to the high hopes he had for his son.\u0014\nIn 954, aged barely forty, Alberic fell ill with a deadly fever. He \nwas carried to the tomb of St Peter on Vatican Hill (the basilica and \nVatican would not be built for another 500 years) where he assembled \nthe leading Romans, politicians, lawyers, bishops, etc. In a period \nbefore the College of Cardinals, it was these, the people of Rome, \nwho formally elected the pope. Over the bones of St Peter, Alberic \nhad them swear that when the current pope, Agapetus II, died, they \nwould elect Octavianus as his successor. He died a few days later.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Pope Agapetus died the following year, the leaders of Rome kept \ntheir promise and, on 16 December 955, elected Octavianus, son of \nAlberic and grandson of Marozia, as Supreme Pontiff and ruler of the \nPapal States, who took the papal name John XII. It was a grave \nmistake that many would bitterly regret.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Young Pope\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem was that John was only eighteen when he was elected pope, \nthe youngest in history. Like most rich and privileged teenagers, the \nlast thing on his mind were spiritual and ecumenical matters; far \nmore interesting to the young pope was drinking, gambling, and, of \ncourse, sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn allowed, practically encouraged, Rome to slide into decay whilst \nhe used its wealth to fund his wild gambling and lavish lifestyle. \nThe Lateran Palace was turned into one enormous brothel where John \nwould openly have sex with married women. He had numerous mistresses; \nhe made one of them governor of one of the Papal cities and loaded \nher with church treasures, another one he inherited from his father \nand impregnated. There were even reports that he invited (or rather \nkidnapped) female pilgrims who had journeyed to Rome to the Lateran \nPalace to have sex with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut whilst John was busy gambling, whoring, and generally degrading \nthe papacy in any way he could, his enemies were closing in. By far \nthe greatest threat was Berengar of Ivrea. Berengar was the nephew of \nJohns step-grandfather, Hugh of Provence, and had succeeded him as \nKing of Italy. Johns lavish lifestyle had left him bankrupt and the \nPapal army was no match for Berengars; so when King Berengar began \ninvading the northern Papal States in 960, John had no option but to \nfall at the feet of Otto of Saxony, King of the Germans, and invite \nhim to Rome as his protector.\u0014\n\u0014\nDealing with the Devil\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto of Saxony was the polar opposite of the debauched young pope. \nThirty years Johns senior, he had spent years welding Germany into a \nsingle state and gallantly defeating all his enemies; he was widely \nlauded as the very image of Christian piety and chivalry. Ottos \nprime goal was to resurrect the glorious empire of Charlemagne, so \nwhen John offered him Charlemagnes imperial crown and to become Holy \nRoman Emperor in exchange for protecting him against Berengar, Otto \nhappily took the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 2 February 962, Otto and his wife knelt before the young pope in \nSt Peters Basilica and received the imperial crown of the Holy Roman \nEmpire. In exchange, he promised to protect and defend the \nindependence of the Papal States, stretching from Naples to Venice, \nand that any papal land he reclaimed from Berengar would be returned \nto John. Remarkably, the Holy Roman Empire that John restored as a \nsimple matter of convenience in 962 would last another 850 years, \ndisbanded only by Napoleon in 1805.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto remained in Rome for two weeks and his relationship with John \nquickly deteriorated. Now Holy Roman Emperor, Otto began lecturing \nJohn on his scandalous ways and spoke to him like the little \nschoolboy he really was. John was understandably relieved when, in \nMarch 962, Otto left to fight Berengar in northern Italy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the pope, still only twenty-four at this point, chose not to \nremember a single word of Ottos lectures or any of his promises to \nthe new Emperor. A report sent to Otto whilst he was fighting \nBerengar in the Apennines spoke of his continued mistresses, \ngambling, and whoring of female pilgrims. It stated:\u0014\nThe Palace of the Lateran which had once sheltered saints, was now a \nharlots brothel.\u0014\n\u0014\nOtto was initially blas about the situation, saying to the reports \nauthors He is only a boy, and will soon alter if good men set him an \nexample. His attitude soon changed, however, when he heard of Johns \nnew friendship with Aldabert, son of King Berengar, the very man Otto \nwas fighting a war against for John.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope John had become wary of Ottos increasing power since making him \nEmperor and nervously watched as he had won battles and gained \nterritory. So, like the nave and arrogant boy he was, he entered \nnegotiations with the Byzantine Emperor in Constantinople, Aldabert, \nand even King Berengar about joining forces against Otto. Furious at \nthe rumour that John was about to give his coveted and heard-earned \nimperial crown to Aldabert, Otto set off once again for Rome, this \ntime at the head of an army.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn did not hang around. As Otto approached the city, he grabbed \nwhatever drink, riches, and women he could and ran off to Tivoli with \nAldabert.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Apostate\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce in control of the city, Otto called a synod (a council of \nbishops, cardinals, deacons, and other clergymen) of over one hundred \nchurchmen to discuss Johns crimes. After eight years, these had \nstacked up monumentally:\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter, Bishop of Narni, said he had seen John ordain a deacon in a \nstable;\u0014\nCardinal Benedict said John had received money from people to make \nthem bishops, including making a ten-year-old boy Bishop of Todi;\u0014\nHe had publicly hunted;\u0014\nHe had blinded his confessor, Benedict;\u0014\nHe had killed Cardinal John after castrating him;\u0014\nHe had set houses on fire and ridden around Rome in armour;\u0014\nHe made toasts to the Devil;\u0014\nWhilst gambling, he asked for the assistance of pagan gods like \nJupiter and Venus instead of the Christian God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter hearing all this, Otto wrote a letter to John asking him to \nreturn to Rome and answer to these crimes, promising no harm would \ncome to him. But the scorned pope had other ideas, writing to Otto \nand the bishops of the synod:\u0014\n\u0014\nWe hear you wish to make another pope. If you do, I excommunicate \nyou by almighty God, and you have no power to ordain no one, or \ncelebrate mass.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishops, intoxicated with the security Ottos presence in Rome \nhad given them, rebuked Johns threats, even criticizing his letters \nappalling grammar with we always thought that two negatives made a \npositive. Once John had refused for a second time to appear before \nthem (he was too busy hunting), the synod duly excommunicated the \nApostate John and, on 1 December 963, elected Leo VIII, surprisingly \nEmperor Ottos candidate, as pope.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut remember that it was the people of Rome that made a pope, not a \ncluster of disgruntled bishops and certainly not the Emperor. John \nmay have been a lascivious apostate, but he was Romes lascivious \napostate; they had elected him and were not prepared to accept the \npuppet of some German barbarian.\u0014\n\u0014\nRomes citizens duly rebelled against Leos election and were \nbloodily suppressed by Ottos occupying forces. But Otto could not \nstay in Rome forever. He had his puppet pope in place, he still had \nBerengar to contend to, and his feudal lords were requesting his \npresence back in Germany. Therefore, in January 964, Otto left Rome. \nBarely had Ottos army left the Eternal City when the vengeful and \nvolatile John returned to take back his papacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBloody Revenge and Death\u0014\n\u0014\nJohns revenge against the bishops and other enemies was swift and \nterrifying. Some had their tongues cut out, others had their hands or \nfingers removed, and some even had their noses sawn off. He set up \nhis own synod on 26 February that annulled all the decisions of the \nformer synod and excommunicated the now-Antipope Leo, who had quickly \nfled to his master Ottos side as soon as John returned to Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was once again Supreme Pontiff and master of Rome, but it was a \nrestoration he would only enjoy for a few months. Stories differ as \nto how Pope John XII died on 14 May 964; one states that he died of a \nstroke caused by exerting himself too much whilst having sex with a \nmarried woman, another says he died of internal bleeding after being \nbeaten up by the said womans husband after he had found them in bed \ntogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither way, Pope John XII died as he had lived, smothered in \ndebauchery, sin, blood, and sex; defaming the papal office and chair \nof St Peter, and reducing the papacy to its lowest nadir in its two \nmillennia history. He was just twenty-seven.\u0014",

    "words": "Puritans Attempted to Abolish Christmas\u0014\n \u0014\nPURITANS gave the church many profound writings and called believers \nto holiness. However, Christmas was not a hit with Puritans on either \nside of the Atlantic. Their objections were religious. Not only were \nthere no grounds for believing Christ was born on December 25th, they \nsaid, but the Bible had also not established the practice. Further, \nthey objected that for many people Christmas observance was a \nsacrilegea time of heavy drinking and pagan customs. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas day, 25 December 1621, William Bradford called the \ncolonists of Plymouth Plantation to work. Some new arrivals said it \nwent against their consciences to work on the day, so he said he \nwould spare them until they were better informed. When the workers \nreturned at noon, they found the newcomers bowling and tossing the \nbar.* Bradford confiscated their playthings and told them that it was \nagainst his conscience that they should play while others worked. If \nthey made keeping Christmas a matter of devotion, let them stay in \ntheir houses, but there would be no games. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Puritans came to power in England, they began issuing laws \nagainst Christmas beginning in 1642. In 1647, Parliament passed a law \nthat the feast of the Nativity of Christ should be no longer \nobserved. Some English folk protested through pamphlets, others by \nholding celebrations in defiance of the law, still others by refusing \nto open their shops. At Oxford, Ipswich, and Canterbury, people \nrioted. A mob beat the Mayor of Canterbury senseless, breaking his \nwindows as well as his bones. Thousands vowed that if they could not \nhave Christmas, they would bring the king back to his throne. \u0014\n\u0014\nFive years later, Parliament was still issuing unpopular rules. One \ndated Christmas Eve, 1652, directed, That no observation shall be \nhad of the five and twentieth day of December, commonly called \nChristmas Day; nor any solemnity used or exercised in churches upon \nthat day in respect thereof. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Day 1657, John Evelyn defied the law and attended a \nChristmas sermon at Exeter Chapel in London. Soldiers arrested \neveryone, including him. He was questioned why he disobeyed the law \nbut was not taken to prison as some were, so I got home late the \nnext day, blessed be God! he wrote. \u0014\n\u0014\nAcross the Atlantic on this day, 25 December 1659, the Massachusetts \nGeneral Court banned the observance of Christmas under penalty of \nstiff fines. The law stood for over twenty years.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "PHILLIPS BROOKS INTRODUCTED HIS MOST FAMOUS CAROL",
    "words": "PHILLIPS BROOKS INTRODUCED HIS MOST FAMOUS CHRISTMAS CAROL\u0014\n \u0014\n[Phillips Brooks from John Henry Barrows, editor The Worlds \nParliament of Religions Chicago: Parliament Publishing co. 1893]\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a speech that he published, Phillips Brooks said, ...In all best \nbiographies, two values of a marked and well depicted life appear. It \nis of value, first, because it is exceptional, and also because it is \nrepresentative. Every life is at once like and unlike every other. \nEvery good story of a life, therefore, sets before those who read it \nsomething which is imitable and something which is incapable of \nimitation....\u0014\n\u0014\nHis own life was no exception. It combined the unique elements of \nbirth and opportunity that cannot be exactly duplicated with a \npurpose that could and should be imitated: to use life to spread the \ngospel and do good deeds. Born in 1835 into one of the old Puritan \nfamilies of Boston, he obtained his university education at Harvard \nand became first a teacher and then an Episcopal minister. Tall, \nhandsome, and impressive as an orator and writer, he filled some of \nthe most prestigious American pulpits along the Eastern seaboard, \neventually becoming bishop of Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a pastor, he pointed people to Christ, saying that Christians \nshould live by Christ, and be his, not our own. At a time when \nUnitarianism was sweeping New England and had become dominant at \nHarvard, Brooks staunchly preached Trinitarian Christianity. Of his \never-increasing renown he might have applied his own words: It does \nnot take great men to do great things; it only takes consecrated men.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was an abolitionist, a temperance man, and a supporter of the \nUnion cause during the Civil War. When Lincoln was assassinated, his \ngrief was intense. Out of his anguish, he preached a eulogy on the \npresident. I charge his murder where it belongson Slavery. I bid \nyou to remember where the charge belongs ...  to give it to the \nhistory of these times, that all times to come may hate and dread the \nsin that killed our noblest President. \u0014\n\u0014\nFond of hymns since childhood, he wrote several himself. The best \nknown is the Christmas carol O Little Town of Bethlehem. Inspired \nby a tour of Israel in 1866, he wrote to the children of his \ncongregation, I remember especially on Christmas Eve, when I was \nstanding in the old church in Bethlehem, close to the spot where \nJesus was born, when the whole church was ringing hour after hour \nwith the splendid hymns of praise to God, how again and again it \nseemed as if I could hear voices I knew well, telling each other of \nthe wonderful night of the Saviors birth. The carols closing \nverse encapsulates the sum of his Christian aspiration: \u0014\n\u0014\n            O holy child of Bethlehem,\u0014\n            descend to us, we pray;\u0014\n            cast out our sin and enter in;\u0014\n            be born in us today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe now-famous carol was first sung publicly on this day, 27 December \n1868, at the Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia, where he was \nrector. A choir of thirty-six children sang it from freshly-printed \nleaflets to a perfectly-suited tune composed the night before by the \nchurchs organist, Lewis Redner.      \u0014\n \u0014\nBrooks lived until 1891. In addition to his hymns, he published \nlectures and sermons. But the work that has outlived him the longest \nis O Little Town of Bethlehem.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS:It is pure speculation where Jesus ws born, even in the church \nthat claims it. The church was built 300 years after the death of \nChrist, The Church of the Nativity\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "PHILIP YANCEY AS FEW COULD HAVE IMAGINED HIM",
    "words": "Philip Yancey, as Few Could Have Imagined Him\u0014\nThe writers new memoir sheds light on an upbringing steeped in \nbigotry and a lifetime of useful pain.\u0014\nLESLIE LEYLAND FIELDS   CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n|\u0014\nSEPTEMBER 20, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Yancey knew he would write a memoir the day he lay strapped to \na backboard, not knowing if he would live or die. This was in 2007, \nafter he had already written numerous books and won global acclaim as \na journalist spotlighting issues of faith in the stories of other \npeople. Yet it took a careening Jeep, five rolls down an embankment, \nand a broken neck to persuade him irrevocably to write the full \ntruths of his own story.\u0014\n\u0014\nI saw Yancey four years ago as he was writing it. We sat over lunch \nin an earthy caf in Colorado sharing the challenges of writing \nmemoir. How do we account for the span of our life? When do we break \nour silence? How much truth is enough?\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, Ive been anxiously awaiting how Yancey would answer \nthose questions for himself. Heres my report: Where the Light Fell \nis in many ways a classic spiritual autobiography tracing one mans \nconversion from cynic to believer. But its more. Its a searing \nfamily story as revelatory as gothic Southern fiction. Its an \nexpos. Its a social critique. Its a tragedy. Its a tale of \nredemption. More than anything, though, its a story few could have \nimagined.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnmaking and remaking\u0014\nNot everything in this memoir will come as a surprise, especially for \nreaders familiar with Yanceys prolific writings on matters of grace, \nthe problem of evil, and the authors Southern fundamentalist \nbackground, particularly its role in justifying racism and \nsegregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough such themes are recognizable in Yanceys memoir, the stories \nhave a different feel. No longer do they serve mainly as anecdotal \nramps onto larger explorations of doubt, grace, prejudice, and pain. \nInstead, we stay inside the authors own stories, letting him take us \nto places weve never been: inside his familys trailer on the church \nparking lot, into the schoolyard, the classroom, the church pews, \naround the kitchen table with his mother and brother. Not every \nchapter is equally fascinatingthere are long stretches of juvenilia \nthat a tighter editor might have omittedbut each sheds important \nlight on the unmaking and remaking of a human heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nYanceys account opens during his college years, when he discovers, \nby accident, how his father actually died at age 23, when Yancey was \none and his brother, Marshall, was three. As the story went, his \nfather and mother were bound for missionary work in the heart of \nAfrica. Then polio struck, leaving his father helpless in an iron \nlung and killing him soon thereafter.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Yancey learned the full truth when, while visiting a relative, a \nnewspaper clipping fell to the floor. It turns out his father had \nleft the iron lung against his doctors advice, believing and hoping \nGod would heal him and return him to the mission field. He lasted \nonly a few days. The revelation forced Yancey to reexamine everything \nhe knew about his father: This saintly giant who hovered over his \nlife was actually a holy fool. He writes, I feel like one of \nNoahs sons confronting his fathers nakedness. The faith that \nexalted my father and gained him thousands of supporters, I now \ngrasp, also killed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the greatest (and most tragic) influence on the course of the \nYancey brothers lives was a vow their grieving mother made on her \nhusbands grave. The widow dedicated her two sons to the Lord as \nreplacements for her and her husband in Africa. Ensuring this outcome \nbecame the goal of her parenting. Yancey recalls the moment the \nrealization hits: My brother and I are the atonement to compensate \nfor a fatal error in belief.  We alone can justify our fathers \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs children, teens, and young men, the Yancey brothers cannot live up \nto their mothers unyielding expectations. Eventually they give up \ntrying. When Marshall ditched the fundamentalist Bible college he \nattended to transfer to Wheaton College, their mother saw this as the \nultimate betrayal. In her view, Wheaton was a godless bastion of \nliberalism. Yancey recalls the caustic language she used to express \nher fury:\u0014\n\u0014\nIll do whatever it takes to stop you, young man. You listen to me. \nIf you find a way to pull off this plan, I guarantee you one thing. \nIll pray every day for the rest of your life that God will break \nyou. Maybe youll be in a terrible accident and die. Thatll teach \nyou. Or, better yet, maybe youll be paralyzed. Then youll have to \nlie on your back and stare at the ceiling and realize what a \nrebellious thing youve done, going against Gods will and everything \nyouve been brought up to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe never relented or apologized for any of her piercing words or \npunishments. All were rooted in a particular branch of fundamentalism \nthat suggested it was possible to reach a state of sinless \nperfection. At one point she told her sons she hadnt sinned in 12 \nyears, setting the brothers up for an irresolvable dissonance. After \nschool and on weekends, the boys accompanied their mother to her \nchildrens Bible classes, which were popular, winning her admiration \nas a saintly woman of God. At home, though, they suffered from her \nrage and harsh corporal punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth brothers developed survival skills at home and in religious \nsettings. At times they played the part of fervent believers giving \nheartfelt testimonies. On other occasions they rebelled, retreating \ninto apathy, cynicism, and (in Marshalls case) atheism.\u0014\n\u0014\nReaders from similar backgrounds will nod along at many of these \npassages. When, for instance, Yancey describes the atmosphere at the \nbrothers Bible college, with its altar calls and endless verses of \nJust As I Am, Im transported back to Missions Week at my own \nChristian college, where the speaker wept theatrically and shamed us \nfor putting plans to teach, nurse, and write ahead of the mission \nfield. When Marshall is nearly expelled just months before graduation \nfor downing a paper cup of wine (just to see if hell would indeed \nbreak loose), I remember my own near-expulsion story. My husband and \nI wrote a letter to the Missions Week speaker, challenging his use of \nshame and manipulation. Only a humble-pie apology before the college \npresident saved us.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot until over halfway through Yanceys narrative does light begin \ncracking through. Even amid a Bible college backdrop of rigidity and \nperformancism, God whispers and woos through music, through nature, \nand then through love, as Yancey meets his future wife, Janet. While \nthe elder brother chooses the drug and hippie culture, the younger \nbrother begins to discover a God he never knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nTestimonies of imitation\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the storys not over. This account is about more than personal \nredemption. Yancey not only comes to a genuine faith in Jesus Christ, \nbut his faith now leads him to return to those he harmed through the \ncallousness and racism he absorbed as a child. He undertakes and \nreports on an extended tour of amends.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere, I pause. I did not expect this. Yanceys own remarkable story, \nhis crooked and unlikely path to faith, is compelling on its own. But \nthese powerful final chapters transcend the usual bounds of memoir or \nspiritual autobiography. In the incisive book Looking Before and \nAfter: Testimony and the Christian Life, Alan Jacobs argues for \nenlarging our testimonies of conversion into testimonies of \nimitation and vocation that offer wisdom and build up the church. \nYancey does exactly this, not by sermonizing or issuing a call to \ncollective repentance, but through modeling a commitment to \nconfession and reparation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe memoir itself is an answer to the question that looms throughout: \nWhat do we do with the burdens, sins, and pain of our past?\u0014\n\u0014\nYancey invites us to gaze at the radically different pathways he and \nhis family have taken. Yanceys mother, still living at 97, has not \nread any of her sons books. Nor has she released her grip on \nlegalism or disavowed the vow that led to such relational wreckage. \nShe and her eldest son remain estranged, locked in what Yancey calls \nthe dark energy of wrong theology, resistance, and ungrace. But a \nthird way is possible, he writesto stitch together all the strands, \ngood and bad, healthy and unhealthy, believing that pain can be \nuseful, even redemptive.\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly Yanceys pain has been more than useful to the church at \nlarge. His books, selling more than 17 million copies in 50 \nlanguages, have reassured many that Christian faith leaves room for \ndoubt and suffering as well as hope. Where the Light Fell backlights \nevery one of these books, providing the chapter I hadnt known was \nmissing.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite all this great good, I anticipate some readers asking how \nYancey can give such an unflattering portrait of his church, his \nfamily, and the fundamentalist culture of his youth. Memoirists of \nfaith inhabit the tension between different scriptural commands. \nTheyre called to honor their parents, to forgive as theyve been \nforgiven, to love even their enemies. Yet theyre also enjoined to \npursue righteousness and justice, to defend the powerless, to speak \nthe truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen does this second set of imperatives overrule the first? In the \ncourse of writing and teaching memoir over the decades, Ive seen \ncountless writers paralyzed and silenced by these questions, \nincluding myself at times. There are no simple answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI might have drawn the lines differently in some places, but Im \nprofoundly grateful Yancey overcame his silence to finally write this \nmemoir. Where the Light Fell is a story for our time, for the church, \nfor all of us weary with unforgiveness, racism, division, and ungrace.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLeslie Leyland Fields is a writer living on Kodiak Island, Alaska.\u0014",

    "words": "PHOTIUS WAS AT THE HEART OF CONFLICT WITH ROME\u0014\n \u0014\nPhotius was twice patriarch of Constantinople. Two times he rose to \nthe position of prominence and two times fell from it. His ups and \ndowns mirrored the politics of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had a preliminary taste of exile as a child: his parents were \nordered out of Constantinople because they accepted the use of icons. \nAfter a political party came to power that endorsed icons, Photius \nwas able to return to the imperial city. He became a notable scholar \nand professor at the university in Constantinople. He was working for \nthe civil service and was not even a priest when Patriarch Ignatius \noffended Bardas, the real power behind Constantinoples throne. \nIgnatius refused Communion to Bardas for living in incest with his \nwidowed daughter-in-law. Under pressure, Ignatius resigned. At the \nrecommendation of courtiers, Bardas chose Photius to replace \nIgnatius. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders rushed Photius through all the ecclesiastical orders \nduring the first six days of 858 so he would meet the technical \nrequirements for patriarch. Ignatiuss adherents appealed to Rome for \njustice. Photius himself made representations to Rome. (Rome would \nlater claim Photius made false promises.) Pope Nicholas I sent \nlegates to investigate the deposition of Ignatius. The legates \naccepted Photius as the legitimate occupant of the important see.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Photius would not cooperate with Rome. Nicholas and Photius \ntangled over who should exercise authority in Bulgaria and other \nregions. Consequently Nicholas accused the legates of accepting \nbribes, punished them, and rejected Photius. Photius wrote an open \nletter to the bishops of the East denouncing theological and \nliturgical changes made in the West. In 867 he headed a council that \nexcommunicated Nicholas. This period of mutual non-acceptance by east \nand west is known as the Photian Schism. But in 867 Basil the \nMacedonian assassinated Emperor Michael III, seizing power. When \nPhotius protested, Basil exiled him and restored Ignatius. However, \nnine years later, the imperial court invited Photius back to \nConstantinople as a tutor. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ignatius was dying in c. 877, he urged the reappointment of \nPhotius. The court agreed and Photius resumed the patriarchy. Pope \nJohn VIII, in need of naval assistance from Constantinople, also \nendorsed the appointment. In 886, the rise of a new emperor led \nPhotius to resign; whether this was voluntary or forced is not known. \nHe went into exile. \u0014\n\u0014\nAssessments of Photius vary wildly. While all sides acknowledge his \ndeep learning, Latins denounce him as a monster because of his \nresistance to Rome, whereas the Eastern Orthodox Church considers him \none of its greatest defenders of truth. Among Balkan peoples he is \nhonored for sending Cyril and Methodius to evangelize them. Photiuss \nclashes with Rome prefigured the later divorce of the eastern and \nwestern churches in the Great Schism.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhotiuss two best-known works were the Myriobiblion and Mystagogy \nof the Holy Spirit. The first was a summary of hundreds of books he \nhad read, often including excerpts of works now lost to us. In the \nMystagogy, however, he denounced and refuted the Roman Catholic \nchurchs addition of the filoque clause to the Nicene Creed. Photius \ndenied that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son. Even \nif He does, he said, such a major change in doctrine should have been \nargued and decided by a council of the entire church, not introduced \nunilaterally by the West. Pope John VIII accepted the findings of the \nEighth Ecumenical Council against the filoque clause.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly for such a prominent figure, the date of Photiuss death \nwas not recorded. A date often suggested is today, 6 February 897. \nWhile the day is fairly certain, the year is disputed.\u0014",

    "title": "PHILIPP SPENER WANTED CHRISTIANS TO PRACTICE FAITH",
    "words": "PHILIPP SPENER WANTED CHRISTIANS TO PRACTICE HEART-FELT FAITH\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1666, the council of Frankfort-on-the-Main invited Philipp Spener \nto become their citys head pastor. In this position he would \nsupervise eleven other Lutheran ministers, some considerably older \nthan his thirty-one years. The city had decided that its church \nministries should be overseen by a doctor of theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nSpener faced a tough decision. Scholarly, reserved, and pious, he had \npreviously reneged on a promise to head a church because he shied \nfrom dealing with troubled souls. Subsequently, he had been content \nto act as an assistant pastor with few counseling \u0014\nresponsibilities. Moreover, he was reluctant to leave Strasbourg \nwhere he had a network of friends and family and where he hoped to \nteach at the university. Consequently, Spener advised Strasbourg of \nFrankforts offer, hinting that his alma mater should offer him a \njob. When it did not, he accepted the Frankfort call.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaking a low-key approach to overseeing the other pastors, Spener set \nout to inspire and transform lives through sound teaching and \npreaching. His first sermon took as its text I am not ashamed of the \nGospel of Christ. Unhappy that the Lutheran lectionary neglected \nmany Scripture passages, he prefixed its assigned lessons with an \nExordium in which he taught through Pauls Epistles. He catechized \nchildren. Soon adults were joining the classes, saying they learned \nmore in them than from a dozen sermons such as were preached in most \npulpits. Spener wrote a popular childrens book on Luthers \ncatechism. He revived confirmation as a means of encouraging youth to \nunderstand and commit themselves to the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years after coming to Frankfort, he preached on the text, \nExcept your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes \nand Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. \nSoon groups formed, seeking deeper life. Fearing factions and \ndoctrinal wrangles, Spener led the meetings himself. Later he formed \naccountability groups whose members confessed to each other. Other \npastors throughout Germany began to imitate Speners practices, \nimplementing the Pietist movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1675 Spener published Pia Desideria, or Pious Desires. The book \nwas aimed at reducing party spirit, the worldliness of princes, and \nthe spiritual ignorance of the common folk. Its principal remedy for \nthese ills was making church people more aware of the entire Bible. \nHe urged lay Christians to recognize their spiritual priesthood. He \nwanted all Christians to realize that faith is a matter of the heart, \nnot merely ritual and head knowledge. He advocated widespread prayer. \nTheological students, he said, should be better trained for the \npractical difficulties they would encounter. And sermons should edify \nhearers, not merely argue doctrine or flaunt learning.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis book was eagerly received, but, as his biographer Francis \nFrederick Walrond would write, many of those who applauded Spener at \nthe beginning of his work turned fiercely against him when they found \nhow much that work implied. Men may feel the grasp of God upon their \nhearts, and presently become all the more hardened to resist it. \nConsequently, Spener suffered opposition and slander. One of his \nbooks was censored. Despite his warnings one of his small groups \nbroke away from the Lutheran Church, saying they could not worship \nwith sinful, unconverted hypocrites. Spener was accused of promoting \nschism. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was also vilified because he accepted Calvinists as fellow \nChristians. Given Luthers well-known inflexibility when he had \nencountered the Swiss reformers, Spener was regarded as virtually a \nheretic. He did not ease his situation by advocating the reduction of \nprejudices and discrimination against another unpopular \ngroupFrankforts Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvited to become court preacher for the Elector of Saxony at \nDresden, he accepted, but there he found himself battered by godless \ntheologians. Against their powerful opposition, he could only preach \nthe truth, declaring he had nothing but the power of God to sustain \nhimself. Courtiers poisoned the elector against Spener and the \nelector tried to make him resign. Eventually Spener accepted a post \nin Berlin, whose Calvinist ruler treated Lutherans fairly. \u0014\n\u0014\nSpener spent the last fourteen years of his life in Berlin, \nfaithfully catechizing, overseeing churches, and training a new \ngeneration of pastors. He helped bring into existence the evangelical \nUniversity of Halle. Because the university promoted faith over \nformalism and did not dwell on Lutheran doctrinal disputes with \nCalvinists, the Theological Faculty of Wittenberg found Spener guilty \nof two hundred and eighty-three errors. Rigid Lutherans claimed that \nunder a pretense of devotion and holiness of life Spener and Halle \nwere destroying the church. They pointed to fanatics and visionaries \nwho emerged across Germany claiming revelations. Spener was not \nresponsible for them, but was blamed anyhow. Although Spener himself \nwas not legalistic, other Pietists could be, and he was blamed for \ntheir rigidity. Under all such attacks he was gentle.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the end of his life, he spent hours a day in intercessory prayer. \nHe was able to do this and accomplish his other duties because he did \nnot waste a moment. Ironically, he also became Germanys leading \ncounselor of souls, consulted in person and by mail. He penned so \nmany letters of spiritual advice that he had to request a \ngovernmental exemption from postage.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1704 Spener experienced faintness. He would live only a few more \nmonths. The evening before his death he had Christs high-priestly \nprayer (John 17) read to him three times. He died on this day, 5 \nFebruary 1705. His theological enemies claimed Spener had not entered \nthe rest of the Lord. Later generations have judged him more \ngenerously. He is often called the Father of Pietism.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "PETER DAMIAN WANTED A RETIRED LIFE; POPES SAID NO",
    "words": "PETER DAMIAN WANTED A RETIRED LIFE BUT POPES FORCED HIM INTO ACTION\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDisgusted with the scandals around him, Peter Damian abandoned a \npromising career as a teacher at Ravenna to enter a Benedictine \nhermitage. The year was around 1035 and he was probably not yet \nthirty years old. Impressed with the conversation of two hermits he \nmet by chance, Damian buried himself in isolation at Fonte Avellana \nin the lovely region of Gubbio, Italy. However, because he was an \nexpert in rhetoric, theology, and canon law, the church would not \nallow him to remain sequestered. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn c. 1007, five years after the death of the Emperor Otto III, \nhe was the youngest of at least six siblings. His mother for a time \nrefused to nurse him, so that he almost died. Orphaned young, he was \nraised by two older brothers, the first of whom abused him, fed him \nlittle, and employed him as a swineherd. Another brother, a priest, \nrecognized his intelligence, rescued him from this situation, and \narranged for his education. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a scholar Damian applied himself assiduously and was soon a \nwell-known teacher. After he entered the hermitage, he wrote at least \none hundred and eighty letters. Some of them, although couched in the \nform of epistles, were actually lengthy tracts. His first such tract, \nAgainst the Jews (c. 1040), suggested how to answer Jewish questions \nabout Christianity and their attacks on the Trinity. \u0014\n\u0014\nFonte Avellana had been founded by followers of St. Romuald, and \nDamian wrote the saints life (1042, one of seven such lives). The \nfollowing year he became prior of the hermitage and held the position \nthe remainder of his life. He promoted self-flagellation and applied \nit to himself, along with fasting and vigils, with such rigor that he \nseriously undermined his own health and gave himself insomnia. He \nreally seems to have believed that each blow to his own body would \nshave a specified amount of time off his stay in Purgatory.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe continued to write. In Liber Gomorrhianus (Book of Gomorrah, c. \n1050) he urged the ideal of celibacy and criticized clerical \nmarriages and homosexuality. Liber gratissimus (Most-Favoured Book, \nc. 1052) pushed back against simonythe buying and selling of church \npositions. His most famous letter, however, was the lengthy De divina \nomnipotentia (On Divine Omnipotence, 1065) in which he argued God can \ndo any good thing, but that Gods self-consistency keeps him from \nreversing the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Stephen IX made Damian a cardinal in 1057. Damian had just \nrecovered (miraculously, he believed) from a seven-week illness. He \nresisted the appointment but the pope overrode his objections. \nThereafter Damian would work closely with Cardinals Humbert, Silva \nCandida, and Hildebrand to reform the church. He helped prepare a \ndecree on papal elections, attended several synods, and carried out \nembassies for popes to arbitrate regional disputes. He met with Henry \nIV of Germany to urge him not to divorce his wife, Bertha.\u0014\n\u0014\nDamian died on this day, 22 February 1072,* at Fonte Avellana. He had \njust returned from Ravenna where he tried to settle a rift between \nhis home town and Rome. His writings and reform-minded labors helped \nset the tone of the medieval church. Seven and a half centuries \nlater, in 1823, Pope Leo XII pronounced him a doctor of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n----\u0014\n* Some say 23 February.\u0014\n\u0014\nFebruary 22, 1072\u0014\n(or the 23rd) Death of Peter Damian, in Faenza, Italy. A reforming \nmonk of the Benedictine order, he will be remembered chiefly for De \ndivina omnipotentia which questioned the limits of the omnipotence of \nGod (e.g.: can God change the past?) and will be declared a doctor of \nthe church in the nineteenth century.\u0014",

    "words": "Pope Felix III \nConfronted Heresy and Divided the Church\u0014\n \u0014\nWHEN FELIX III became pope on this day, March 13, 483, he faced a \ndaunting array of problems. Chief of these was the heresy preached by \na priest and monastic named Eutyches. Eutyches taught that Christ had \nonly one nature following the union of God and man in him. A church \ncouncil at Chalcedon had already determined that Christ had both a \nhuman nature and a divine one, and Eutyches defined Christs humanity \nin theological terms that contradicted Christs ability to redeem us. \nThe case against his teaching might have seemed a closed issue. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he had enough of a following that Emperor Zeno (who was \ninclined to the Eutychian position himself) felt that some kind of \naccommodation needed to be made. On the advice of an orthodox \nchurchman, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, Zeno issued the \nHenoticon (Compact of Union), a document that attempted to express \nChrist's nature in terms both Eutychians and orthodox believers could \naccept. \u0014\n\u0014\nFelix rejected this. He sent two emissaries to Constantinople with a \nletter of solemn protest against the Henoticon. He also commanded \nAcacius to report to Rome and give an account of his actions. Acacius \nrefused to comply citing his equality with Felix. Felixs emissaries \nthen switched sides, causing him to summon a council of bishops to \nexcommunicate them. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor good measure Felix and the council also excommunicated Peter \nMongus, the Eutychian patriarch of Alexandria. In this Felix went \nbeyond all precedent and against the rulings of church councils, such \nas Chalcedon, which had recognized the patriarchs as equals. His \nattempt to extend Roman rule eastward led to a 35-year schism between \nthe eastern and western churches, for when Mongus subscribed to the \nHenoticon, he won the favor of Zeno and Acacius. Since Acacius had \nrefused to make the journey to Rome, Felix and the council \nexcommunicated him too. In retaliation, Acacius struck the name of \nFelix from the diptychs of the church in Constantinople, showing he \nwas no longer in fellowship with them. (A diptych is a list of \nChristians for whom special prayers are made during the liturgy.) \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile some Christians in North Africa had betrayed their faith \nunder fear of persecution from the Vandal invaders, who practiced \nArian Christianity. North Africans who stood fast did not want to \nworship with their weaker brothers and sisters. Felix called a \ncouncil in 487 to deal with the issue. This was held at the Lateran \nPalace and issued instructions for readmitting lapsed Christians to \nthe church. Felix was pope for almost nine years and died in 492, \nhaving attempted boldly to extend the claims of the papacy.\u0014",

    "title": "POPE LEO X'S INFAMOUS INDULGENCE LED TO REFORMATION",
    "words": "Infamous Indulgence Led to Reformation\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010  28 Apr\u0014\n\u0014\nWarlike Pope Julius II died in 1513, and his successor, Giovanni de' \nMedici, took the name Pope Leo X. If Julius loved to fight, Leo \npreferred amusement. His self-indulgence destroyed the unity of the \nwestern church when he bartered sin for money in the most infamous \nindulgence of church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom birth, Leo had been earmarked for the church. At the age of \nseven, he was made a monk. By thirteen he was a cardinal. In between, \nthe boy had been abbot. He became pope before turning forty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis tastes were costly. He was only too happy to spend lavishly on \nhimself and voluptuous entertainment. Humanists with few morals \nswarmed at a papal court where wit mattered more than a witness. \nPlays and shows, ballets and games abounded. No chance for a hunt was \nturned down. The papal treasury funded preeminent artists such as \nRaphael. Julius left a full treasury. Leo drained it in eight short \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSelling \"Salvation\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Peter's Basilica was being rebuilt, but there was no money. Leo \ndecided to solve the problem in time-honored fashion. On this day \nMarch 15, 1517, he declared that anyone who contributed to the \ncathedral would be granted an indulgence. Although in theory, an \nindulgence was only a remission of penalties meted out in this world \nby the church, in practice, it was hawked as if it covered the actual \nguilt of sins and could release souls from Purgatory. The gist of the \nindulgence was as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...[I] absolve you ...from all thy sins, transgressions, and \nexcesses, how enormous soever they be...and remit to you all \npunishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account and I \nrestore you...to the innocence and purity which you possessed at \nbaptism; so that when you die the gates of punishment shall be \nshut... and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain \nin full force when you are at the point of death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent to preach the indulgence in Germany was a Dominican named \nTetzel. Tetzel got above himself in his promises, implying that the \nindulgence even covered the future sins which the buyer was now \nharboring in his heart. Frederick the Wise refused to allow the \nindulgence to be preached in his territory of Saxony, mostly because \nhe was reluctant to allow Saxon coin to leave his \nfinancially-depleted realm. Tetzel came as near the border of Saxony \nas he could. Folk from Wittenberg crossed over and bought the prized \npapers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSparking the Reformation\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward a few doubted the efficacy of the writs. They solicited the \nopinion of a middle-aged monk named Martin Luther. Luther refused to \nconfirm their value. Instead, in an accepted tradition, he posted \ntheses for debate on the door of Wittenberg castle church where a \nlarge crowd was expected. The sequel is well known.

    "title": "PATRICK THE SAINT",
    "words": "Patrick the Saint\u0014\nChristian History Institute\u0014\n\u0014\nA FLEET OF 50 CURRACHS (longboats) weaved its way toward the shore, \nwhere a young Roman Brit and his family walked. His name was \nPatricius, the 16-year-old son of a civil magistrate and tax \ncollector. He had heard stories of Irish raiders who captured slaves \nand took them to the ends of the world, and as he studied the \nlongboats, he no doubt began imagining the worst.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith no Roman army to protect them (Roman legions had long since \ndeserted Britain to protect Rome from barbarian invasions), Patricius \nand his town were unprepared for attack. The Irish warriors, wearing \nhelmets and armed with spears, descended on the pebbled beach. The \nbraying war horns struck terror into Patriciuss heart, and he \nstarted to run toward town.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe warriors quickly demolished the village, and as Patricius darted \namong burning houses and screaming women, he was caught. The \nbarbarians dragged him aboard a boat bound for the east coast of \nIreland.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatricius, better known as Patrick, is remembered today as the saint \nwho drove the snakes out of Ireland, the teacher who used the \nshamrock to explain the Trinity, and the namesake of annual parades \nin New York and Boston. What is less well-known is that Patrick was a \nhumble missionary (this saint regularly referred to himself as a \nsinner\") of enormous courage. When he evangelized Ireland, he set in \nmotion a series of events that impacted all of Europe. It all started \nwhen he was carried off into slavery around 430.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEscape from Sin and Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick was sold to a cruel warrior chief, whose opponents' heads sat \natop sharp poles around his palisade in Northern Ireland. While \nPatrick minded his masters pigs in the nearby hills, he lived like \nan animal himself, enduring long bouts of hunger and thirst. Worst of \nall, he was isolated from other human beings for months at a time. \nEarly missionaries to Britain had left a legacy of Christianity that \nyoung Patrick was exposed to and took with him into captivity. He had \nbeen a nominal Christian to this point; he now turned to the \nChristian God of his fathers for comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would pray constantly during the daylight hours, he later \nrecalled. The love of God and the fear of him surrounded me more and \nmore. And faith grew. And the spirit roused so that in one day I \nwould say as many as a hundred prayers, and at night only slightly \nless.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn The Mountain\u0014\n\u0014\nLegend holds that Patrick rang a large bell (held in a reliquary, at \nthe National Museum of Ireland) on the top of Eagle Mountain, now \ncalled Croagh Patrick. Depending on the legend, the bell scared away \neither Irelands snakes or its demons. Patricks other relic, a staff \nsupposedly given to him by Jesus, was burned as an object of \nsuperstition in 1538.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter six years of slavery, Patrick received a supernatural message. \nYou do well to fast, a mysterious voice said to him. Soon you will \nreturn to your homeland.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore long, the voice spoke again: Come and see, your ship is \nwaiting for you. So Patrick fled and ran 200 miles to a southeastern \nharbor. There he boarded a ship of traders, probably carrying Irish \nwolfhounds to the European continent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a three-day journey, the men landed in Gaul (modern France), \nwhere they found only devastation. Goths or Vandals had so decimated \nthe land that no food was to be found in the once fertile area.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat have you to say for yourself, Christian? the ships captain \ntaunted. You boast that your God is all powerful. We're starving to \ndeath, and we may not survive to see another soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick answered confidently. Nothing is impossible to God. Turn to \nhim and he will send us food for our journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that moment, a herd of pigs appeared, seeming to block our path. \nThough Patrick instantly became well regarded in their eyes, his \ncompanions offered their new-found food in sacrifice to their pagan \ngods.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick did not partake.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Prodigious Son Returns\u0014\n\u0014\nMany scholars believe Patrick then spent a period training for \nministry in Lerins, an island off the south of France near Cannes. \nBut his autobiographical Confession includes a huge gap after his \nescape from Ireland. When it picks up again after a few years, he \nis back in Britain with his family.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was there that Patrick received his call to evangelize Irelanda \nvision like the apostle Pauls at Troas, when a Macedonian man \npleaded, Help us!\u0014\n\u0014\nI had a vision in my dreams of a man who seemed to come from \nIreland, Patrick wrote. His name was Victoricius, and he carried \ncountless letters, one of which he handed over to me. I read aloud \nwhere it began: 'The Voice of the Irish.' And as I began to read \nthese words, I seemed to hear the voice of the same men who lived \nbeside the forest of Foclut . . . and they cried out as with one \nvoice, 'We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among \nus.' I was deeply moved in heart and I could read no further, so I \nawoke.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his reputation, Patrick wasnt really the first to bring \nChristianity to Ireland. Pope Celestine I sent a bishop named \nPalladius to the island in 431 (about the time Patrick was captured \nas a slave). Some scholars believe that Palladius and Patrick are one \nand the same individual, but most believe Palladius was unsuccessful \n(possibly martyred) and Patrick was sent in his place.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn any event, paganism was still dominant when Patrick arrived on the \nother side of the Irish Sea. I dwell among gentiles, he wrote, in \nthe midst of pagan barbarians, worshipers of idols, and of unclean \nthings.\u0014\n\u0014\nDemons and Druids\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick did not require the native Irish to surrender their belief in \nsupernatural beings. They were only to regard these beings in a new \nlight as demons. The fear of the old deities was transformed into \nhatred of demons. If Christianity had come to Ireland with only \ntheological doctrines, the hope of immortal life, and ethical \nideaswithout miracles, mysteries, and ritesit could have never \nwooed the Celtic heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nPredictably, Patrick faced the most opposition from the druids, who \npracticed magic, were skilled in secular learning (especially law and \nhistory) and advised Irish kings. Biographies of the saint are \nreplete with stories of druids who wished to kill holy Patrick.\u0014\n\u0014\nPilgrims\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the last Sunday of each July, between 25,000 and 30,000 pilgrims \npass the saints statue and climb to the top of Croagh Patrick, \ncommemorating the saints fasting there for 40 days and nights. \nCarbon dating of church ruins at the 2,710-foot summit has shown it \ndates from Patricks day, supporting the legend that says Patrick \nclimbed it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDaily I expect murder, fraud or captivity, Patrick wrote, but I \nfear none of these things because of the promises of heaven. I have \ncast myself into the hands of God almighty who rules everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Patrick almost delighted in taking risks for the gospel. I \nmust take this decision disregarding risks involved and make known \nthe gifts of God and his everlasting consolation. Neither must we \nfear any such risk in faithfully preaching Gods name boldly in every \nplace, so that even after my death, a spiritual legacy may be left \nfor my brethren and my children.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Patrick periodically avoided such confrontations by paying \nprotection money: Patrick paid the price of 15 souls in gold and \nsilver so that no evil persons should impede them as they traveled \nstraight across the whole of Ireland, wrote one biographer.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick was as fully convinced as the Celts that the power of the \ndruids was real, but he brought news of a stronger power. The famous \nLorica (or Patricks Breastplate\"see I Rise Today), a prayer of \nprotection, may not have been written by Patrick (at least in its \ncurrent form), but it expresses perfectly Patricks confidence in God \nto protect him from every fierce merciless force that may come upon \nmy body and soul; against incantations of false prophets, against \nblack laws of paganism, against false laws of heresy, against deceit \nof idolatry, against spells of women and smiths and druids.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to legend, it worked. The King, Loiguire, set up a trap to \nkill Patrick, but as the bishop came near, all the king could see was \na deer. (Thus the Breastplate has also been known as the Deers Cry.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was probably a confrontation between Patrick and the druids, \nbut scholars wonder if it was as dramatic and magical as later \nstories recounted. One biographer from the late 600s, Muirch, \ndescribed Patrick challenging druids to contests at Tara, in which \neach party tried to outdo the other in working wonders before the \naudience:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe custom was that whoever lit a fire before the king on that night \nof the year [Easter vigil] would be put to death. Patrick lit the \npaschal fire before the king on the hill of Slane. The people saw \nPatricks fire throughout the plain, and the king ordered 27 chariots \nto go and seize Patrick . . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeing that the impious heathen were about to attack him, Patrick \nrose and said clearly and loudly, 'May God come up to scatter his \nenemies, and may those who hate him flee from his face.' By this \ndisaster, caused by Patricks curse in the kings presence because of \nthe kings order, seven times seven men fell. . . . And the king, \ndriven by fear, came and bent his knees before the holy man . . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n[The next day], in a display of magic, a druid invoked demons and \nbrought about a dark fog over the land. Patrick said to the druid, \n'Cause the fog to disperse.' But he was unable to do it. Patrick \nprayed and gave his blessing, and suddenly the fog cleared and the \nsun shone. . . . And through the prayers of Patrick the flames of \nfire consumed the druid.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the king was greatly enraged at Patrick because of the death of \nhis druid. Patrick said to the king, 'If you do not believe now, you \nwill die on the spot for the wrath of God descends on your head.'\u0014\n\u0014\nThe king summoned his council and said, 'It is better for me to \nbelieve than to die.' And he believed as did many others that day.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet to Patrick, the greatest enemy was one he had been intimately \nfamiliar withslavery. He was, in fact, the first Christian to speak \nout strongly against the practice. Scholars agree he is the genuine \nauthor of a letter excommunicating a British tyrant, Coroticus, who \nhad carried off some of Patricks converts into slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nRavenous wolves have gulped down the Lords own flock which was \nflourishing in Ireland, he wrote, and the whole church cries out \nand laments for its sons and daughters. He called Coroticuss deed \nwicked, so horrible, so unutterable, and told him to repent and to \nfree the converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt remains unknown if he was successful in freeing Coroticuss \nslaves, but within his lifetime (or shortly thereafter), Patrick \nended the entire Irish slave trade.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoyal Missionary\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick concentrated the bulk of his missionary efforts on the \ncountrys one hundred or so tribal kings. If the king became a \nChristian, he reasoned, the people would too. This strategy was a \nsuccess.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs kings converted, they gave their sons to Patrick in an old Irish \ncustom for educating and fostering (Patrick, for his part, held up \nhis end by distributing gifts to these kings). Eventually, the sons \nand daughters of the Irish were persuaded to become monks and nuns.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom kingdom to kingdom (Ireland did not yet have towns), Patrick \nworked much the same way. Once he converted a number of pagans, he \nbuilt a church. One of his new disciples would be ordained as a \ndeacon, priest, or bishop, and left in charge. If the chieftain had \nbeen gracious enough to grant a site for a monastery as well as a \nchurch, it was built too and functioned as a missionary station.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore departing, Patrick gave the new converts (or their pastors) a \ncompendium of Christian doctrine and the canons (rules).\u0014\n\u0014\nSelf Doubt\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his success as a missionary, Patrick was self-conscious, \nespecially about his educational background. I still blush and fear \nmore than anything to have my lack of learning brought out into the \nopen, he wrote in his Confession. For I am unable to explain my \nmind to learned people.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, he gives thanks to God, who stirred up me, a fool, \nfrom the midst of those who are considered wise and learned in the \npractice of the law as well as persuasive in their speech and in \nevery other way and ahead of these others, inspired me who is so \ndespised by the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver and over again, Patrick wrote that he was not worthy to be a \nbishop. He wasnt the only one with doubts. At one point, his \necclesiastical elders in Britain sent a deputation to investigate his \nmission. A number of concerns were brought up, including a rash \nmoment of (unspecified) sin from his youth.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Confession, in fact, was written in response to this \ninvestigation. Reeling from accusations, Patrick drew strength from \nGod: Indeed he bore me up, though I was trampled underfoot in such a \nway. For although I was put down and shamed, not too much harm came \nto me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Patrick was not confident about his own shortcomings, he held a \ndeep sense of Gods intimate involvement in his life. I have known \nGod as my authority, for he knows all things even before they are \ndone, he wrote. He would frequently forewarn me of many things by \nhis divine response.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Patrick recorded eight dreams he regarded as personal \nmessages from God. And scattered throughout his Confession are \ntributes to Gods goodness to him: Tirelessly, I thank my God, who \nkept me faithful on the day I was tried, so that today I might offer \nto him, the Lord Jesus Christ, the sacrifice of my soul. He saved me \nin all dangers and perils . . . . So, whatever may come my way, good \nor bad, I equally tackle it, always giving thanks to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Irish annals, Patrick died in 493, when he would \nhave been in his seventies. But we do not know for sure when, where, \nor how he died. Monasteries at Armagh, Downpatrick, and Saul have all \nclaimed his remains. His feast day is recorded as early as March 17, \n797, with the annotation; The flame of a splendid sun, the apostle \nof virginal Erin [Ireland], may Patrick with many thousands be the \nshelter of our wickedness.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimate Model\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is difficult to separate fact from fiction in the stories of \nPatricks biographers. It is historically clear, however, that \nPatrick was one of the first great missionaries who brought the \ngospel beyond the boundaries of Roman civilization. According to \ntradition, he had established bishops throughout northern, central, \nand eastern Ireland. Only Munster, in the south, was to remain pagan \nuntil a century after Patricks death.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick was the ultimate model for Celtic Christians. He engaged in \ncontinuous prayer. He was enraptured by God and loved sacred \nScripture. He also had a rich poetic imagination with the openness to \nhear God in dreams and visions and a love of nature and the created.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe is, then, most worthy of the appellation saint, as one set apart \nfor a divine mission. As such, he became an inspiring example. \nHundreds of Celtic monks, in emulation of Patrick, left their \nhomeland to spread the gospel to Scotland, England, and continental \nEurope.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a legacy Patrick was proud of: For God gave me such grace, \nthat many people through me were reborn to God and afterward \nconfirmed and brought to perfection. And so then a clergy was \nordained for them everywhere.\u0014",

    "title": "POCAHONTAS ENTERED A MARRIAGE OF RACES",
    "words": "Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL     2010,  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From \nthe Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since \nher baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter \nand gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for \nher. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a \nperiod of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or \nPocahontas, \"Princess,\" the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended \nthe invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown \nsettlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on \ntheir own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed \nthat Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during \nhis captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted \nto tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then \nLady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, \nplanning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. \nTaken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and \nbaptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she \nmarried John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience \nwhether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping \nto convert her, \"which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son \nChrist Jesus' sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has \nfalsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit \n(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning \ncartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film \nabout her perpetrated many distortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would \nhave chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed \nonly painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas \nrunning the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would \nhave ground corn and worked hides. Leisure for women and girls \n(except among the noble classes) was almost non-existent until two \ncenturies ago. Pocahontas is shown at peace with nature. Although \nIndian animism contained elements placating nature, peace it had not. \nIn one version, Pocahontas is given a pet raccoon. A raccoon would \nnot have been a cuddly pet but would have been destined for the pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian \nideals upon a pseudo-historical event. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFocus on the Family Newsletter.

    "title": "PAUL AND HOMOSEXUALS",
    "words": "(4/5/22 ) 1 Cor. 6:9.   About homosexuals. The Greek word here is a \ncombination from two roots ARSEN (male) and KOITE (bed) with derived \nmeaning 'male bedding' (male coitus).  Paul was indeed talking about \nhomosexuality.  But Paul did not know about human physiology, about \nwhat is 'common knowledge' today. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring human gestation from fertilized stem cell through cellular \nspecialization to birth, human reproductive organs are determined by \nthe XX/XY genetic coding, but gender identification is determined by \npituitary gland 'wiring.'  Ovaries and testes are part of the body's \nglandular system and the pituitary gland is the master gland which \ncontrols the functioning of the glandular system.  It is estimated \nthat in something up to 10% of human births, during the trillions of \ncellular specializations that occur in gestation, a 'different' \ngender identification takes places in the pituitary gland so that \nsexual attraction is to the 'homo' gender instead of the 'hetero' \ngender.\u0014\n\u0014\n  This is sheer physiological chance and 'while different' it is \nmorally neutral.  Gender identification and sexual activity are \ndifferent things, and only sexual activity falls in the category of \nmoral choice. Now about homosexuality in the Bible. First, Sodom was \nnot about homosexuality (Gen.19:1-11). The demand 'Bring them out \nthat we may know them' (v.5) was about 'knowing' their \nidentification, not about having sex with them.  The men of Sodom \nconsidered Lot a 'foreigner' (sojourner, alien) among them (v.9) and \nthey wanted to make sure he had not welcomed more 'foreigners' to \n'play the judge' among them.  The only sexual reference in this \npassage is Lot's offer of his daughters to the men of Sodom in order \nto protect the guests to whom he had offered hospitality.  \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Mosaic law, both homosexuality and bestiality are prohibited as \nabominations (Lev. 18:22-23).  The subject  of homosexuality is \nrarely mentioned in the Bible, and by Jesus not at all. It seems to \nme the attitude expressed is more a sense of 'human abhorrence' than \nof any authentic evil.  I write about it from a moral perspective.  \u0014\n\u0014\nAs an ethicist I believe that morality applies only to motives and \nactions that are chosen or avoided on he basis of whether they were \ngood or bad, whether they enhance or degrade life, whether they \nbenefit or devalue any other person(s). Gender identification is \ndetermined by gestational cell specialization so it is morally \nneutral.  Sexual activity is chosen so it will be moral or immoral.  \u0014\n\u0014\nMy personal concern  is that culturally we have come to accept \nheterosexual \"barnyard' behavior as normal and to be expected and \naccepted, but homosexual relations of any kind are perverse and \nabominable even though they are for many lifetime devoted, \nmonogamous, and deeply loving.

    "title": "PHILADELPHIAS FREE AFRICAN SOCIETY",
    "words": "On this day April 12, 1787, Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, African \nAmerican Christians, took steps to establish a society in which \nmembers of their race could help one another. The Preamble of the \nresulting Free African Society explained their objectives:\u0014\n(12th, 4th mo., 1778 [sic]) \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Whereas, Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, two men of the African \nrace, who, for their religious life and conversation have obtained a \ngood report among men, these persons, from a love to the people of \ntheir complexion whom they beheld with sorrow, because of their \nirreligious and uncivilized state, often communed together upon this \npainful and important subject in order to form some kind of religious \nsociety, but there being too few to be found under the like concern, \nand those who were, differed in their religious sentiments; with \nthese circumstances they labored for some time, till it was proposed, \nafter a serious communication of sentiments, that a society should be \nformed, without regard to religious tenets, provided, the persons \nlived an orderly and sober life, in order to support one another in \nsickness, and for the benefit of their widows and fatherless \nchildren.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following month they adopted articles for their society. Dues \nwere one shilling a month. Assistance would be given to needy members \nas long as their plight was not owing to their own imprudence. No \ndrunkard was allowed membership. Anyone who failed to pay dues for \nthree months was ousted. Failure to attend meetings incurred a fine. \nBenefits were for sick members, widows, and children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe organization held religious services. Its principal architects, \nJones and Allen, had wanted to establish a church, but their \npotential members came from such diverse religious backgrounds they \ndecided it was impractical. A few years later, however, both would \nhead black churches in Philadelphia. Jones became Americas first \nblack Episcopal priest. Allen, already ordained as a Methodist \nminister, became bishop of Americas first black Methodist \ndenomination. Meanwhile, the society discouraged adultery, issued \nmarriage licenses, kept records of births, and taught thrift. It also \nengaged in medical care, issuing prepaid medical policies. During the \n1793 Yellow Fever epidemic, members of the Free African Society \nnursed the sick in Philadelphia. The society also purchased land for \na cemetery.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen membership became too numerous to meet in Allens home, the \nsociety gathered at a Quaker school. However, when the majority began \nto adopt Quaker forms of worship, Richard Allen and several Methodist \nmembers withdrew. Absalom Jones then became its leading voice. \nMembers of the group built the Episcopal Church that Jones would \npastor. He remained active in the society. \u0014\nThe Free African Society is notable for pioneering mutual aid for \nAfrican Americans and was imitated by many later organizations. It \ndemonstrated the power of religious organizations\u0014",

    "words": "Protestants 1st Called Protestants\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen someone asks what religion you are, what do you answer? There \nare a lot of different labels to describe the varieties of Christian \nfollowers, and the word \"Protestant\" is one. It was on this day, \nApril 19, 1529, that the designation \"Protestant\" might be said to \nhave come into existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther had been declared a heretic by both the pope and the \nemperor, but his followers continued to multiply rapidly. Emperor \nCharles V could not suppress the reformers as he wished, because the \nTurks were threatening his empire from the east, and the pope and he \nwere quarreling with each other. In 1521, at Worms, Germany, Charles \nsigned a document which outlawed Luther. Five years later at another \nimperial council, Charles agreed to postpone any settlement of \nreligious issues. He agreed that until an official policy could be \nestablished, every State within his territories would be governed as \nthe ruler thought most pleasing to God. In practice, this meant that \nthroughout Germany's many independent cities, principalities and \nelectorates, the religion of each prince or local ruler became the \nreligion of his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1529 a Diet (Congress) met at Speyer, Germany to consider action \nagainst the Turks and attempt again to come to terms with the \nReformation. The Diet forbade any extension of the Reformation until \na German council could meet the following year. Charles V declared he \nwould wipe out the Lutheran \"heresy.\" Five reforming princes and \nfourteen cities drafted a protest, a formal legal appeal, for \nthemselves, their subjects and all who then or in the future should \nbelieve in the Word of God. (It was not formally published until \nJuly.)\u0014\n\u0014\nEight years before, Martin Luther was a lone monk standing for the \nWord of God and liberty of conscience at the Diet of Worms. But by \n1529, the world had changed: there was an organized party of \ngovernment leaders with consciences bound by the Word of God against \ntyrannical authority. Not every protester was a Lutheran. The whole \nparty of the reformers needed a name. From the protest and appeal at \nthe Diet of Speyer, these breakaways from the Roman Church began to \nbe called Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday Protestants are one of three major branches of Christianity. \nWhile all three hold the same fundamental creed, other differences \nare many. Perhaps the key difference is that while the Eastern \nOrthodox and Roman traditions combine the Scripture with the \nauthority of church tradition or of a pope, Protestants claim to find \nthe sole authority for their faith in the Bible, the Word of God. \nMany can also be identified because they accept the priesthood of all \nbelievers and the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBezold, Friedrich von.

In these verses I believe Paul falls \ninto the 'trap' of elevating cultural practices to religious \nstanding.  I think it is an error.  He uses questionable 'scripture \ncitations' as a basis for his assertions. Man being made before woman \nand woman being made from man (vv.8,12) is based in the Genesis 2 \n'creation story'  which is different from the Genesis 1:27 'story' \nwhich has no such distinction. In the matter of 'man being head of \nwoman' (v.3), Paul cites it as a matter of 'divine established' \ngender hierarchy.  Evidence seems clearer to me that 'patriarchal \ngender priority' is far more a cultural development than a religious \nmatter. Genesis 1:27 (God created man/mankind/humanity in his own \nimage,  male and female he created them) sounds like 'gender \nequality' to me.  I am also persuaded that hair-styles and head \ncoverings are far more a matter of fashion and personal preference \nthan 'religious meaning.'  My 'life experiences' have  convinced me \nthat this writing by Paul has caused far more 'dispute and \ndissension' in churches than it has provided any helpful guidance.  \nIt may have been 'important' in Corinth of first century, but I have \nnot found it so in 20th century Baptist life.  And, about being \ncontentious (v.16), it seems to me that Paul was being a 'bit \ncontentious' himself.  \u0014\n\u0014\nSherrill G. Stevens\u0014",

    "words": "Pius V Excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Reformation, England broke away from the Roman Church. \nMary Tudor briefly reestablished the connection, but when Elizabeth \ncame to the throne, she saw that it was politically expedient (and \nperhaps morally preferable) to uphold the reformed church and did so. \nLike her father before her, she headed the English church through an \nact of Parliament, although her private chapel services remained more \nCatholic than Protestant.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 27, 1570, Pope Pius V issued a bull against her. \nHe claimed that there was no salvation outside the Roman Church and \nthat the pope alone was successor to Peter and head of the earthly \nchurch. The ungodly had grown in power and \"Elizabeth, the pretended \nqueen of England and the servant of crime, has assisted in this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope went on to excommunicate Elizabeth. \"...we do out of the \nfullness of our apostolic power declare the foresaid Elizabeth to be \na heretic and favorer of heretics, and her adherents in the matters \naforesaid to have incurred the sentence of excommunication and to be \ncut off from the unity of the body of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his fourth point, he said \"And moreover (we declare) her to be \ndeprived of her pretended title to the aforesaid crown and of all \nlordship, dignity and privilege whatsoever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe forbade all nobles, subjects and people to obey Elizabeth on pain \nof excommunication. This, of course, placed England's Catholics in a \ntrying position. While most were loyal to the throne, some used the \npapal statement as an excuse to plot against Elizabeth for the \npurpose of replacing her with a Catholic. Elizabeth cracked down on \nthese opponents with vigor. Innocent Catholics suffered alongside the \nguilty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bull concluded with the words, \"Given at St. Peter's at Rome, on \n27 April 1570 of the Incarnation; in the fifth year of our \npontificate.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth survived this blast and maintained high popular approval \nduring much of her reign.

Her sentencing hearing is set for August. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoi Miskel, the attorney for the widow, told NBC News that Evans, who \nis now facing a potential life sentence, understands there has to be \naccountability for her actions, and shes prepared to serve whatever \nsentence is handed down.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, she wants the court and the public to know the \nreasons behind her actions, Miskel said, adding that her client at \nleast now has some control and say so in her life that she didnt \nhave before  as twisted as that may sound.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that \njust after 1 a.m. on March 22, 2021, officers from the Ada Police \nDepartment responded to a 911 call in the 1400 block of Northcrest in \nAda. They found the 50-year-old David Evans severely wounded. \nParamedics would later pronounce him dead at the scene. His wife was \nalso in the home.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was later alleged in court documents that David Evans was a \nswinger and his widow confessed to plotting his murder with a man she \nspent three nights with while he was in Mexico on a mission trip. The \nman charged with the shooting was identified as 26-year-old Kahlil \nDeamie Square. A lawyer for Square said that his client is pleading \nnot guilty to the murder charge, according to NBC News. \u0014\n\u0014\nKristie Evans told investigators that she and her husband led a \nsecret life as swingers and met Square for sex at a Super 8 motel on \nmore than one occasion months before her husband was killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one of those occasions, Kristie secretly dropped her phone number \non the floor for Kahlil, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation \nagent reported in arresting documents obtained by The Oklahoman. \nKristie continued to communicate by phone daily with Kahlil without \nDavids knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe reportedly asked him to kill her husband and even provided him \nwith a gun and bullets. She also allegedly left the back door of \ntheir home open on the night of his murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent interview with NBC News from jail, Kristie Evans alleged \nthat her husband abused her for years and was the one that pressured \nher to have sex with other men.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrivate Facebook messages spanning four years between the late pastor \nand his wife reviewed by NBC News showed the pastor pushing his wife \nto engage in sex acts with other men.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point, the pastor reportedly accused his wife of being a \nfrigid b***h for not having sex with other swinger couples. \nChristie Evans painted her late husband as financially controlling \nand physically abusive in ways that didnt leave any marks, according \nto NBC News.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe claimed that they were planning for a divorce and that one month \nbefore her husband was killed, he held a gun to his chin as she spoke \nwith their daughter over the phone. The widow contends the action was \na tactic to control how she discussed their separation.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after the murder of the pastor last year, Harmony Freewill \nBaptist Churchs Executive Director Mike Wade told KXII that David \nEvans, who left behind three adult children, was a driven pastor who \nwould do anything he could for his ministry and the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was always a very outgoing guy, Wade said. He always had a \nsmile on his face, always looking out for the needs of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church did not immediately respond when contacted by The \nChristian Post for comment on the case on Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some relatives say they were aware of some of the abuse \nChristie Evans was facing, the pastors mother told NBC News that \nshe could have gone to a new city or a battered womens shelter.\u0014",

    "words": "PETER ABELARD PAID STEEP PENALTIES FOR HIS AUDACITY\u0014\n \u0014\nAbelard and Heloise. The two names are linked in romance like Caesar \nand Cleopatra or David and Bathsheba. Although Abelard was a \nbrilliant scholar, philosopher, and theologian, he is popularly \nremembered as the man who seduced his student Heloise, had a son by \nher, and secretly married her. An irate uncle of Heloise sent \nruffians to castrate Abelard, who then wrote a book lamenting his \ncalamities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe brash spirit that caused Abelard to risk his career for an affair \nalso caused him to out-argue his teachers, humiliate them, and turn \nthem into enemies. However, he was eagerly sought out by students who \nrecognized his ability as a teacher. He asserted a middle ground \nbetween realism (which says that a named quality such as redness is \na universal reality with existence independent of any objects that \nmay possess it) and nominalism (which says that a named quality is \njust a name; only individual things are real). His position was that \nuniversal ideas or forms are not realities, but necessary and useful \nmental constructs by which we can describe and understand similar \ncharacteristics in different objects.  \u0014\n\u0014\nHis desire to apply reason to our understanding of the Bible and \nfaith got him into trouble. Enemies claimed he was teaching heresy. \nHe saw Christs death as a moral example rather than the necessary \nprice of redemption. He argued that the culpability of a seemingly \nevil action depends on the intention behind it. Arguing that heathen \nphilosophers had glimpsed the existence of the Trinity, he was \naccused of watering down Christian doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost formidable of Abelards opponents was Bernard of Clairvaux. On \nthis day, 25 May 1141,* a church council opened at Sens. Bernard led \nthe assemblage in repudiating several of Abelards alleged teachings. \nThe council compiled a list of propositions to send to the pope, \nseeking their condemnation. However, many were drawn from a work \nAbelard fiercely spurned as not his own. Others distorted his actual \nwords or misunderstood his arguments. He wrote to Bernard of \nClairvaux, his main opponent, \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The devil, even if he does interpret Scripture badly, at least gives \nthe actual words of Scripture which he misinterprets. But you are so \nfar from both my words and my meaning and you labor over arguments \ntaken from your inventions rather than from my sayings. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Innocent II rightly condemned as errors the propositions he \nreceived. He had no way of knowing that only two or three of the \nthirteen accurately expressed Abelards views. Abelard himself wrote \nto Heloise after his condemnation, \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would not be an Aristotle if this were to separate me from Christ. \n. . . I have set my building on the cornerstone on which Christ has \nbuilt his Church. . . . I rest upon the rock that cannot be moved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his death in 1142, Abelard left behind educational centers that \neventually emerged as colleges within the University of Paris. A \ncompilation he made of statements by major theologians (often \ncontradictory) formed the basis for his pupil Peter Lombards famous \nSentences, a book that would dominate European education for three \ncenturies. His rational approach to scholarship and his glamorization \nof Aristotles writings profoundly influenced subsequent thought, \nreaching a high-water mark with Aquinas in the following century.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "JOHN PENRYS WRITINGS MADE POWERFUL ENEMIES IN THE CHURCH\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Penry was eating in prison on this day, 29 May 1593, when \nofficers from the sheriff arrived. A contemporary described what \nhappened next: He was taken while he was at dinner, carried secretly \nto his execution, and hastily bereaved of his life, without being \nsuffered to make a declaration of his faith towards God, or his \nallegiance to the queen, though he very much desired it. Between \nfour and five in the afternoon he dropped at the end of a rope.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday the big question about Penry is, what did he contribute to the \nsaucy Martin Mar-Prelate pamphlets? Theories are almost as plentiful \nas the scholars who examine the evidence. However, authorship of the \nMar-Prelate tracts and operation of a secret printing press were not \nincluded in the indictment against Penry. The charge was sedition. \nNotes in his handwriting included warnings for Queen Elizabeth. He \naccused her of neglecting the gospel and cautioned that such neglect \ncould lead to the downfall of her government: for the Lord may \ndestroy both you for denying, and us for slack seeking, of his will.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had made enemies in the established church by joining the \nnon-conformists (those who rejected Church of England forms). After \ncompleting his schooling at Cambridge, he refused to accept \nordination because he did not see it taught in Scripture. He preached \nwithout a license, flouting English law. He also wrote against \npractices he considered non-biblical. His first major publication was \nEquity of a Humble Supplication in Behalf of the Country of Wales \nthat Some Order May Be Taken for the Preaching of the Gospel Among \nThose People. It charged the Church of England with neglecting \nreligious instruction in his homeland. Later he added other \nnon-conformist publications. Evidence linking him to Mar-Prelate did \nnot endear him to his enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Mar-Prelate was a fictional character who ridiculed the \nEnglish church and its leaders: All our L. Bb. [lord bishops] I saye \n/ are pettie Popes / and pettie vsurping Antichristes / and I thinke \nif they will still continue to be so that they will breed yong Popes \n/ and Antichristes.... Written with rough humor, the pamphlets \nexposed unflattering personal details. For instance, the bishop of \nLondon got his hands on some stolen cloth and refused to return it to \nits rightful owners. Mar-Prelate jeered childishly at the same bishop \nfor a run-in with a spunky woman: Ha ha ha: Now good your grace you \nshall have small gains in meddling with Margaret Lawson I can tell \nyou. The same pamphlet charged the bishop of Rochester with having \nthe presentation of a benefice in his hand, presented himself \nthereunto, even of mere goodwill. (Benefices were church positions \nwith endowments.)\u0014\n\u0014\nMar-Prelate played gotcha! with one pompous writer. Queen Elizabeth \nwas head of the Church of England. Would your worships know how I \ncan show and convince my brother Bridges to have set down flat \ntreason in the former words? Then have at you Deane. 1. It is treason \nto affirm her majesty to be an infidel or not to be contained in the \nbody of the church. 2.

Now the university has begun the \nprocess of memorializing them and creating a community benefit \nprogram to comply with a state law. \u0014\n\u0014\nVCU is calling the effort Project Gabriel, and it's asking for \nfeedback from the community. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Project Gabriel is an opportunity to continue to acknowledge the \ninstitution's past, engage continuously with our community in a \ndialogue regarding actionable recommendations and make meaningful \nchanges that reflect the inclusive public university and health \nsystem that we are today,\" VCU president Michael Rao said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe name recognizes Gabriel, an enslaved resident of Henrico County \nwho in 1800 attempted a widespread uprising of enslaved people. But \nGabriel's plans were thwarted, and he was hanged. \u0014\n\u0014\nVCU fulfilled the first requirement last year when it commissioned a \nreport by a retired New York University professor, Peter J. Wosh. He \ndetermined that VCU's medical college was \"intimately connected\" to \nslavery in the mid-1800s. The college owned or rented enslaved people \nwho did various chores for the school, including cooking food and \ncleaning classrooms. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Whatever dreams and aspirations they had were never fulfilled \nbecause of their enslavement,\" said Dr. Clifton Peay, a VCU board \nmember and project leader. \u0014\n\u0014\nGarland said she expects VCU to implement a scholarship and some kind \nof community initiative. If a university awards a scholarship, the \nlaw requires it to operate the program for as many years as the \nuniversity depended on slavery or until there are as many scholarship \nrecipients as there were enslaved workers. \u0014\n\u0014\nDetermining the number of enslaved workers who built and maintained \nthe medical school might be impossible. The school opened in 1838 as \nan extension of Hampden-Sydney College. It became a state institution \nin 1854, when it was renamed the Medical College of Virginia. The \nschool owned or rented between four and eight slaves from its \nconstruction until 1864, according to tax records cited in Wosh's \nreport.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe records do not list names of the enslaved, making it difficult to \ndetermine how many people served the medical college.\u0014",

Other motives appear to have included concern over \nperceived heresy, assertion of French control over a weakened Papacy, \nand finally, the substitution of royal officials for officers of the \nTemple in the financial management of French government.[40]\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent studies emphasize the political and religious motivations of \nPhilip the Fair and his ministers (especially Guillaume de Nogaret). \nIt seems that, with the \"discovery\" and repression of the \"Templars' \nheresy\", the Capetian monarchy claimed for itself the mystic \nfoundations of the papal theocracy. The Temple case was the last step \nof a process of appropriating these foundations, which had begun with \nthe Franco-papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII. Being the \nultimate defender of the Catholic faith, the Capetian king was \ninvested with a Christ-like function that put him above the pope. \nWhat was at stake in the Templars' trial, then, was the establishment \nof a \"royal theocracy\".[41]\u0014\n\u0014\nAt daybreak on Friday, 13 October 1307, hundreds of Templars in \nFrance were simultaneously arrested by agents of Philip the Fair, to \nbe later tortured into admitting heresy in the Order.[42] The \nTemplars were supposedly answerable only to the Pope, but Philip used \nhis influence over Clement V, who was largely his pawn, to disband \nthe organization. Pope Clement did attempt to hold proper trials, but \nPhilip used the previously forced confessions to have 39 Templars \nburned at the stake before they could mount a proper defence.  (March \n18, 1314)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn March 1314, Philip had Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of \nthe Temple, and Geoffroi de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, burned at \nthe stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1314, the daughters-in-law of Philip IV, Margaret of Burgundy \n(wife of Louis X) and Blanche of Burgundy (wife of Charles IV) were \naccused of adultery, and their alleged lovers (Phillipe d'Aunay and \nGauthier d'Aunay) tortured, flayed and executed in what has come to \nbe known as the Tour de Nesle affair (French: Affaire de la tour de \nNesle).[46] A third daughter-in-law, Joan II, Countess of Burgundy \n(wife of Philip V), was accused of knowledge of the affairs.\u0014",

    "title": "POCAHONTAS ENTERED A MARRIAGE OF RACES",
    "words": "Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From \nthe Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since \nher baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter \nand gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for \nher. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a \nperiod of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or \nPocahontas, \"Princess,\" the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended \nthe invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown \nsettlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on \ntheir own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed \nthat Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during \nhis captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted \nto tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then \nLady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, \nplanning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. \nTaken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and \nbaptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she \nmarried John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience \nwhether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping \nto convert her, \"which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son \nChrist Jesus' sake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has \nfalsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit \n(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning \ncartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film \nabout her perpetrated many distortions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would \nhave chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed \nonly painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas \nrunning the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would \nhave ground corn and worked hides. Leisure for women and girls \n(except among the noble classes) was almost non-existent until two \ncenturies ago. Pocahontas is shown at peace with nature. Although \nIndian animism contained elements placating nature, peace it had not. \nIn one version, Pocahontas is given a pet raccoon. A raccoon would \nnot have been a cuddly pet but would have been destined for the pot.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian \nideals upon a pseudo-historical event. Christ changed the world so \ndrastically for women and animals that, even in imagination, we \ncannot remove the features contributed by faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFocus on the Family Newsletter.

    "title": "POSSIBLE DATE FOR CHRIST'S DEATH",
    "words": "Possible Date for Christ's Death\u0014\n(A somewhat fanciful handling of the what little we know about it.)\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL    2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo events within recorded human history tower like mountains over \nall others. One is the death of Jesus Christ. The other is his \nresurrection. That God would become man, allow his own subjects to \nkill him, and then translate that event into the gateway of their \nsalvation has to be the most astonishing story ever told.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pair of dates fit all the known facts for Christ's death, which \ntook place at Passover on a Friday (the gospels show that the next \nday was a Saturday--the Jewish Sabbath). This would mean Christ's \ndeath fell on the 14th or 15th of the Jewish month Nisan. (In Exodus \nGod commanded the lamb to be slain on the 14th of Nisan but the Jews \nin Jerusalem reckoned their days from sundown to sundown, making some \ndisagreement as to when the 14th ended and the 15th began). Jesus' \nministry commenced after John the Baptist had come. (Luke dates this \nin the 15th year of Caesar Tiberias). Jesus was then about thirty \nyears old and had probably taught for three and a half years. \nCombining all these factors, we can say that it is most likely that \nJesus went to the cross sometime between the years 27 and 34. \nPassover Friday fell on the 15th of Nisan in a.d 30 and 33. The first \nof those dates was on this day, April 7, 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetrayed by Judas, one of his disciples, Jesus was arrested at night \nin a garden called Gethsemane near Jerusalem. When the men who came \nto the garden said they were looking for Jesus, he replied, \"I am \nHe.\" The men fell to the ground, overwhelmed by that declaration. And \nno wonder, for \"I Am\" is the name by which God first declared himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcerned as always for others, Jesus urged his persecutors to let \nhis disciples go. He even healed the ear of Malchus, slashed by Peter \nin a reckless attempt to defend his master.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Jesus was led to the house of the High Priest. Charges were \nleveled at him, but none stuck. Finally the priest commanded Jesus, \nin the name of God, to declare whether or not he was the Son of God. \nWhen Jesus affirmed it, he was declared guilty of blasphemy. This was \ngrounds for execution under Jewish law, but Rome ruled Judea and the \nJews did not have authority to execute Jesus. They were forced to \nbring Jesus before the Roman governor, Pilate, and ask for the death \nsentence. They got it by suggesting that as a pretended king, Jesus \nwas setting himself against Rome. If Pilate freed Jesus, he was no \nfriend of Caesar, said the Jewish leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nPilate buckled. He had Jesus whipped and crucified. Darkness fell \nupon the land as Jesus hung on the cross--a mysterious darkness \nmentioned by at least two ancient writers. From the cross he forgave \nthose who crucified him and arranged his mother's care. He said he \nwas thirsty and groaned that God had forsaken him. At one point, he \npromised a thief eternal life. Six hours after the nails went in, \nJesus committed his soul to God and died. At that awful moment, when \nthe creator of worlds died, the earth shook and the ground broke \nopen. The stones recognized their master even if men did not.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBible.

    "title": "PAGAN THINKER ENDS UP A CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST--JUSTIN",
    "words": "FLAVIUS JUSTIN began as a pagan thinker and ended as a Christian \napologist and martyr. A Roman, he was born in Samaria around A.D. \n100. He was educated in the Greek and Latin classics and studied the \nphilosophies of Aristotle, the Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists. \nIt was Platos theories that most strongly captured his imagination \nbecause Plato and his mentor Socrates taught about a spiritual world \nthat cannot be seen. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Plato did not satisfy his soul. While walking by the sea lost \nin thought around 132, Justin met an old man. The old man, who turned \nout to be a Christian, began a conversation with Justin and showed \nhim weaknesses in Platos theories that Justin had never noticed. The \nold man explained that such errors were inevitable when philosophers \ntried to arrive at truth apart from God. By contrast, the prophets of \nIsrael, speaking for God, not only revealed moral truth but also were \nable to prophesy the coming of the Christ. \u0014\nAs Justin listened, he found himself believing. He became a student \nof the gospel and found its truths could stand up to and surpass the \nbest Greek thought. He donned the robe of a philosopher and lectured \non Christian philosophy, teaching first in Asia Minor and then in \nRome at the house of Martinus on the Via Tiburtine. Among thinkers he \nopposed were the heretic Marcion and the Cynic philosopher Crescens. \nThe gist of Justins philosophy was that all truth is Gods truth. \nAny truth found in pagan philosophies was owing to the Word of God, \nthe Logos, Christ, enlightening mankind. He saw Platos God as the \nGod of the Bible and believed Socrates was a Christian before Christ, \njust as Abraham was. He theorized that Greek philosophy derived its \ntruth from the older teachings of Moses and the Old Testament \nprophets. \u0014\n\u0014\nJustins mature thought found its way into an appeal to the Roman \nemperor Antoninus Pius on behalf of persecuted Christians and their \nbeliefs. His apology, as such writings were called, argued that \nChristians exceeded the normal expectations of citizenship. They paid \ntheir taxes willingly, prayed for the emperor, and did good. If they \nseemed stubborn it was because they would not allow anyone or \nanything to usurp Christs place. Ultimately tyranny and threats were \npowerless against them, he said, because death was their door to \neternal life. He declared, You can kill us, but you cannot hurt us. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Apology rejected accusations that Christians held cannibalistic \nrituals and engaged in gross immorality. Justin asserted that, on the \ncontrary, Christs teaching was filled with reasonableness and moral \npower, in strong contrast to the irrational and licentious details of \npagan myths. He warned the emperor that even he could not escape the \ncoming judgment of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nAround 165, a Roman prefect named Rusticus ordered Justin and six of \nhis students to sacrifice to the Roman gods. When they refused, he \nhad them scourged and beheaded. Thus Justin earned the epithet \nMartyr. He is considered the first notable Christian philosopher. \nIn 1882, Pope Leo XIII declared this day, 14 April, as Justin \nMartyrs memorial day in the church calendarhis feast day.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n-\u0014",

    "words": "Modern translations of the New Testament are usually based on a \nwidely accepted critical Greek text, such as the United Bible \nSocieties The Greek New Testament or the Nestle-Aland Novum \nTestamentum Graece. But the editors of these editions do not always \nagree on where breaks and punctuation marks should appear. And \ntranslators sometimes depart from the segmentation and punctuation \nfound in these critical texts based on their own understanding of the \nNew Testament writings. Their decisions can create real differences \nin meaning, as is shown by comparing several modern translations.\u0014\nLets look at some examples, punctuation mark by punctuation mark:\u0014\n\u0014\nAccent Marks\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most minute punctuation marks can have a surprisingly strong \nimpact on our understanding of the biblical world. For example, \nRomans 16:7 mentions a person named either ?????a? or ?????a?, whom \nPaul describes as prominent among the apostles. The difference in \nnames might not seem like much, but the shift in accent marks \ntransforms this name from Junias (RSV, NIV, NJB), a shortened form of \nthe mans name Junianus, to Junia (GNB, NRSV, REB), a womans name. \nIs this person a man or a woman?\u0014\nSome interpreters, considering it unlikely that a woman would be \namong those referred to as apostles, argue that the name must be \nJunias. However, the female name Junia occurs more than 250 times in \nGreek and Latin inscriptions found in Rome alone; the male name \nJunias never appears. Further, when the Greek manuscripts of the New \nTestament first began to be accented, copyists wrote the feminine \nJunia. Thus the extrabiblical evidence suggests that Paul was \nreferring to a woman. If the biblical name is Junia, then it provides \na direct challenge to the common assumption that women were not \nincluded among the apostles in the early church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(2004).

    "words": "YAD VASHEM HONORED PASTOR TROCM FOR HIS DARING DEFENSE OF JEWS\u0014\n\u0014\nON THIS DAY, 5 JANUARY 1971, the Jewish organization Yad Vashem \nrecognized Andr Trocm, former pastor of the Reformed Church of Le \nChambon sur Lignon, France, as Righteous among the Nations. In 1984 \nthey would similarly recognize Andrs wife, Magda. Many other \nresidents of Le Chambon were awarded recognition at various times, \nand in 1998 Yad Vashem presented a diploma of honor to the village as \na whole.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tributes were for humane conduct during World War II when Jews \nwere being deported and slaughtered by the Nazis and their \ncollaborators. The people of Le Chambon, and indeed of the entire \nPlateau Vivarais-Lignoninspired by the exhortations of pastors Marc \nBoegner, Andr Trocm, Edouard Theis, Roland Leenhart, Daniel Curtet, \nand pastor-turned-mayor Charles Guillon (all of whom actively \nparticipated in the rescue effort)risked their lives to save perhaps \nas many as 3,000 Jews as well as other refugees, including \nCommunists, who would otherwise have been sent to concentration \ncamps. \u0014\n\u0014\nGuillon prepared the way by advising Le Chambon, months before rescue \noperations were needed, to be ready to assist refugees. Andr, \npreaching pacifism, urged his flock to shelter the people of the \nBible and to make Le Chambon a city of refuge. He argued that The \nduty of Christians is to use the weapons of the Spirit to oppose the \nviolence that they [evil men] will try to put on our consciences. \nLeenhart published a religious paper that called the plateaus \nReformed Church believers to stand with the persecuted. \u0014\nThe French Reformed could identify with persecuted Jews because their \nown history had included much suffering during Catholic persecutions \nof Huguenots. The Darbyists and Ravenists, two small sects deeply \nsteeped in Old Testament studies, helped as well, as did Catholics \nand non-believers, although a small proportion of the Plateaus \npopulation. \u0014\n\u0014\nDeveloping a network, the villagers met fleeing Jews, fed, clothed, \nand housed them, and schooled their children. They helped hundreds \nescape to Switzerland and hid hundreds more in their homes, in public \ninstitutions, in barns, in caves, in country lodges, or in nearby \nforests. Among the active rescuersthere were too many to name \nherewere psychologist Madeleine Dreyfus, schoolteacher Gladys Maber, \nBoy Scout Pierre Piton, Doctor Le Forestier, and cafe owner Dorcas \nRobert. \u0014\n\u0014\nOscar Rosowsky, a medical student, became an expert forger, working \nnights to prepare false papers for Jews and their rescuers. Teenagers \ncarried out responsible roles as lookouts, couriers, and guides. \nHundreds of French people who did not live on the plateau also risked \ntheir lives in the rescue effort. However, it was Trocm who received \nthe lions share of attention immediately after the war because of \nhis pacifist preaching, although it was only part of the story. He \nclearly deserved recognition, though. For instance, Trocm defied \nVichy authorities when ordered to list the Jews who were being \nprotected locally, saying, We do not know what a Jew is. We only \nknow men.  \u0014\n\u0014\nTrocm, Edouard Theis, and schoolmaster Roger Darcissac were interned \nby Germans for a few weeks. Surprisingly, although two of them \nrefused to sign commitments to obey the government, they were \nreleased. The three had gotten out in the nick of time because their \ncamp was soon moved east where most of its prisoners perished. Warned \nof imminent re-arrest, Trocm and Theis went into hiding. A German \nofficer caught Trocm but failed to recognize him and, through \ninattention, allowed him to escape. He paid for his mistake by being \ndemoted and sent to the Eastern Front. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the residents of the plateau successfully hid most of the \nJews who came to them, not all rescuers escaped with their lives. \nAmong the dead was Andrs second cousin, Daniel. In ill health when \na raid captured the Jews hiding with him, he insisted on accompanying \nthem, and succumbed to disease in prison at age thirty-four. Le \nForestier was summarily executed by Germans.\u0014\nOthers were captured but lived to tell their stories. Madeleine \nDreyfus survived nearly a year in the concentration camp at Belsen. \nDorcas Robert returned after several months in Ravensbrck.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

Gager\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we look at Pauls letters, it is not difficult to pull out what on \nthe surface appear to be directly opposing views, anti- and \npro-Israel:\u0014\n\u0014\nI. Anti-Israel:\u0014\n All who rely on works of the law are under a curse (Galatians \n3:10).\u0014\n No one is justified before God by the law (Galatians 3:11).\u0014\n For [some manuscripts add in Christ Jesus] neither circumcision \ncounts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is \neverything! (Galatians 6:15).\u0014\n No human being will be justified in his [Gods] sight by works of \nthe law, since through the law comes knowledge of sin (Romans 3:20).\u0014\n Israel, who pursued righteousness based on the law, did not \nsucceed in fulfilling that law (Romans 9:31).\u0014\n But their minds were hardened. Indeed, for to this day, when they \nread the old covenant, that same veil is still there, because only \nthrough Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is \nread a veil lies over their minds (2 Corinthians 3:1415).\u0014\n\u0014\nII. Pro-Israel:\u0014\n What is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the value of \ncircumcision? Much in every way (Romans 3:1).\u0014\n Do we not overthrow the Law by this notion of faith? By no means. \nOn the contrary, we uphold the Law (Romans 3:31).\u0014\n What shall we say? That the Law is sin? By no means (Romans 7:7).\u0014\n Thus the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and \ngood (Romans 7:12).\u0014\n To the Israelites belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, \nthe giving of the Law, the Temple, and the promises. To them belong \nthe patriarchs and of their race, according to the flesh, is the \nChrist (Romans 9:4).\u0014\n Has God rejected his people? By no means (Romans 11:1).\u0014\n All Israel will be saved (Romans 11:26).\u0014\n Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God. Certainly not! \n(Galatians 3:21).\u0014",

    "title": "PAUL' S WORDS ON WOMEN AND CHILDBEARING",
    "words": "Pauls Words on Women and Childbearing\u0014\n\u0014\nThe closing paragraph of the second chapter of Pauls first letter to \nTimothy contains some of the more unsettling passages in Scripture, \nespecially as they relate to the place of women within both the \nchurch and Gods redemptive work as a whole. Take verse 11, for \ninstance: A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. Or \nverse 12: I do not permit a woman to teach or assume authority over \na man; she must be quiet.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most vexing language, however, comes a few verses later, \nwhen Paul, having noted Eves sin in the Garden, states that women \nwill be saved through childbearingif they continue in faith, love, \nand holiness with propriety.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome reassurance, you might say with a scoff. Arent women, like all \nbelievers, saved through the atoning blood of Christ, shed upon the \ncross? What does childbearing have to do with it, above and beyond \nfaith, love, and holiness? What if youre a woman who cant bear a \nchild? And what if youre a woman who can, but chafes at the notion \nof childbearing being so central to womanhood?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are good answers, of course, to these and related questions, \nand the author Wendy Alsup gave a thoughtful reflection on the \npertinent passage in a 2016 article for CT. Sandra Glahn, a professor \nat Dallas Theological Seminary, tackles Pauls words on women and \nchildbearing from another angle in her latest book, Nobodys Mother: \nArtemis of the Ephesians in Antiquity and the New Testament. Studying \nliterary, artistic, and archaeological representations of the Greek \ngoddess Artemisalternately regarded as symbol of fertility and \nchastityGlahn postulates that Paul had this context in mind as he \npenned his instructions to Timothy.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadison Pierce, a New Testament scholar based at Western Theological \nSeminary, reviewed the book for CT.\u0014\n\u0014\nGlahns final chapter, Saved Through Childbearing, explores how a \nmore accurate picture of Artemis aids our interpretation of 1 Timothy \nas a wholebut especially 1 Timothy 2, where misconceptions of \nArtemis have influenced Christian understandings about how women \nparticipate in the church, writes Pierce. Glahn understands 1 \nTimothy to be a (relatively subtle) polemic against Artemis. She \ndemonstrates how language applied to Artemis appears more often and \nin different ways in Pauls letters to Timothy and Titus, and she \nconnects various themes in those letters with evidence already noted \nthroughout the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut she also makes arguments that go well beyond this relationship. \nShe demonstrates why interpreters should consider 1 Timothy 2:1115 \nas instructions to wives, not all women. As she argues, the \nprohibition on women teach[ing] or assum[ing] authority over a man \nmeans only that a woman should not teach with a view to domineering \na husband. Though this is where Glahns arguments converge with \ntypical discussions of the passage, her presentation of the issues is \nclear and connects with the broader thesis.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the more interesting proposals in this chapter is the idea \nthat A woman is saved through childbearing was a saying or slogan \namong the Ephesians. If so, then Paul is repeating their assertion \nand then responding to it when he says, if they continue in faith \nand love and holiness, with self-control (1 Tim. 2:15, NRSVUE). \nInterpreters generally puzzle over the shift from the singular to the \nplural (i.e., a woman is saved if they continue), but as Glahn \nnotes, positing a shift from slogan to response could address this \nissue.\u0014",

Having said that, we \nhave pretty much exhausted our knowledge of his background.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe began his short term on this day, April 18, 309 or 310. He \nimmediately faced serious problems within the church, which was \nquarreling over whether on not to readmit brethren who had fallen \nfrom the faith during the recent persecutions. Eusebius sided with \nthose who argued for readmittance upon completion of a stiff penance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not everyone was buying this solution. The Novatians said there \nshould be no restoration at all. On the other hand, many of the \nlapsed demanded immediate readmittance to the church. One of these \ngroups elected a rival pope, Heraclius. The squabble erupted into \nviolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nExasperated, Emperor Maxentius exiled both the pope and the antipope. \nEusebius was ordered to Sicily, where he soon died.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a year, no pope was chosen. At the time, Galerius was persecuting \nthe eastern church with great ferocity. When Miltiades finally became \npope in 311, he brought Eusebius' bones back to Rome for an honorable \nburial in the Cemetary of Calixtus. Later, this tomb was damaged. \nHowever, copies of its inscription survived and they tell us almost \neverything that we know about this obscure bishop of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Eusebius defended the tradition of discipline that he had \ninherited, and because he died in banishment he was considered both a \nsaint and a martyr.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrusher, Joseph Stanislaus.

    "words": "Pope's Infallibility Declared, Old Catholics Split\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |   APR 28, 2010\u0014\n \u0014\nThere was no question how the vote would go. On this day, July 18, \n1870, the First Vatican Council declared by an overwhelming majority \nthat \"the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when in \ndischarge of the office of pastor and teacher of all Christians, by \nvirtue of his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine \nregarding faith or morals to be held by the universal Church is \npossessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer willed \nthat his church should be endowed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, the pope is \"infallible\" under certain conditions. \nThe decision was sent to the faithful in a letter titled Pastor \naeternus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe vote may have made sense to the Vatican Council but to others it \nwas not so obvious. Protestants world-wide denied its claim. So did a \nsmall percentage of Catholics. To political analysts, the doctrine \nseemed politically motivated. The ideas of the Roman Church were \nunder attack. Italy had confiscated lands long controlled by the \npopes. The pope had even fled from the Vatican for a time. To some \nanalysts it seemed that because the church could not assert its \nsupremacy in political matters, it was throwing down a gauntlet in \nthe spiritual realm.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the Roman Church's most gifted historians, Johann Joseph Ignaz \nvon Dollinger wrote a long letter in which he said that he could not \naccept the pope's infallibility \"as a Christian, a theologian, a \nhistorical student and a citizen.\" His strong opposition was echoed \nby several bishops, although all of these others yielded when the \nchurch put heavy pressure on them.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther scholars and about 60,000 Catholic lay-people did not yield. \nThey withdrew from the Roman Church, and called themselves Old \nCatholics. To them it was a matter of truth. They documented \ninstances when popes, speaking authoritatively, had made mistakes; a \ncouple popes had even been condemned by church councils as heretics.\u0014\n\u0014\nDollinger never joined the Old Catholics. Nor did he return to the \nRoman Church. He was urged to do so on his death bed but replied, \n\"Ought I (in obedience to your suggestion) to appear before the \nEternal Judge, my conscience burdened with a double perjury?\" He went \non to add, \"I think that what I have written so far will suffice to \nmake clear to you that with such convictions one may stand even on \nthe threshold of eternity in a condition of inner peace and spiritual \ncalm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Catholics made overtures of friendship toward the Church of \nEngland and Orthodox churches.

    "words": "Prison Reform Brutality Behind Bars Women's prisons were hellish \nplaces before Elizabeth Fry started working there. by Danny Day Today \nmany people worry that our society is too lenient on prisoners. In \nthe early 1800s, Elizabeth Fry worried about the oppositeand for \ngood reason. England's prisons were infamous for filth, brutality, \nand extreme suffering. The idea was to punish not to reform \nprisoners. In the women's division, where Fry would direct her \ngreatest reform efforts, inmates were usually crammed into one room: \nthose tried and those awaiting trial, those guilty of misdemeanors \nand those guilty of capital offenses. Typically a woman's children \nwould accompany her to prison. Thus a woman who, with her children, \nawaited her trial for stealing an apple lived in the same crammed \nspace as a woman who may have been convicted of murder. All basic \nhuman activitieseating, sleeping, defecationwere performed in the \nsame confined area. Women and children lived in destitute poverty and \nobtained clothes, alcohol, even food by begging or stealing. Many \nwomen simply sat around in a drunken stupor stark naked. Most \nprisoners who were not cared for by families or charities remained \nclothesless or starved to death. Children often remained in the \nprison until their mothers died or were executed. They clung to their \nmothers and watched as they were led to the gallows and hung. \nElizabeth Fry was one of the few who sought to do something about all \nthis.\u0014",

Such movements (also called \ntemperance movements) have occurred whenever significant numbers of \npeople have believed that the consumption of alcoholic beverages \npresented a serious threat to the integrity of their most vital \ninstitutions, especially the institution of the family. Drunkenness \nis considered an evil in most of the worlds major religious \ntraditions, and Islam has for centuries forbidden even the moderate \nuse of fermented drink. In the West, however, efforts to ban the \nconsumption of alcohol have been a relatively recent phenomenon. \nTheir origin can be traced to the apparently rapid spread of the \ntechnology of distillation and of alcohol abuse in 18th-century \nEurope, which alarmed those concerned with public health and morals.\u0014\n\u0014\nII  The Early Prohibition Movement in the U.S. \u0014\nPrint Preview of Section \u0014\n\u0014\nIn England and the American colonies, governments after 1750 made \nrepeated and futile efforts to discourage the excessive use of \ndistilled spirits. In the mid-19th century Abraham Lincoln said that \nintoxicating liquor was used by everybody, repudiated by nobody and \nthat it came forth in society like the Egyptian angel of death, \ncommissioned to slay if not the first, the fairest born in every \nfamily. By the 1820s people in the United States were drinking, on \nthe average, 27 liters (7 gallons) of pure alcohol per person each \nyear, and many religious and political leaders were beginning to see \ndrunkenness as a national curse.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people believed a close relationship existed between drunkenness \nand the rising incidence of crime, poverty, and violence, concluding \nthat the only way to protect society from this threat was to abolish \nthe drunkard-making business. The first state prohibition law, \npassed in Maine in 1851, prohibited the manufacture and sale of \nspiritous or intoxicating liquors not intended for medical or \nmechanical purposes, and 13 of the 31 states had such laws by 1855. \nBy that time the annual per capita consumption of absolute alcohol \nhad fallen to about 8 liters (about 2 gallons).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe political crisis that preceded the American Civil War distracted \nattention from Prohibition. Many of the early state laws were \nmodified, repealed, or ignored, and for years few restraints were \nplaced on manufacturing or selling anything alcoholic. The population \nincreased rapidly after the Civil War, and soon there were more than \n100,000 saloons in the country (about 1 for every 400 men, women, and \nchildren in 1870); these saloons became increasingly competitive for \nthe drinkers wages. Thus, many of them permitted gambling, \nprostitution, sales to minors, public drunkenness, and violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIII  The Anti-Saloon League \u0014\nPrint Preview of Section \u0014\n\u0014\nIn reaction to this, the extraordinary Womens War broke out across \nthe nation in 1873. Thousands of women marched from church meetings \nto saloons, where with prayer and song they demandedwith transitory \nresultsthat saloonkeepers give up their businesses. By 1900, \nmillions of men and women were beginning to share this hostility \ntoward the saloon and to regard it as the most dangerous social \ninstitution then threatening the family. The Anti-Saloon League of \nAmerica (ASL), organized in Ohio, effectively marshaled such people \ninto political action. State chapters of the ASL endorsed candidates \nfor public office and demanded of their state governments that the \npeople be allowed to vote yes or no on the question of continuing to \nlicense the saloons.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1916, no less than 23 of the 48 states had adopted antisaloon \nlaws, which in those states closed the saloons and prohibited the \nmanufacture of any alcoholic beverages. Even more significant, the \nnational elections of that year returned a U.S. Congress in which the \nASL-supported dry members (those who supported Prohibition) \noutnumbered the wet members (those who were against Prohibition) by \nmore than two to one. On December 22, 1917, with majorities well in \nexcess of the two-thirds requirement, Congress submitted to the \nstates the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibited the \nmanufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors. By \nJanuary 1919 ratification was complete, with 80 percent of the \nmembers of 46 state legislatures recorded in approval.\u0014\n\u0014\nIV  Prohibition in Other Countries \u0014\nPrint Preview of Section \u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point in history, most Protestant nations had come to regard \ndrinking as a social evil, and the Prohibition movement was being \naccelerated by the circumstances of World War I. While rallying \nBritish workers to increase their productivity in support of the war \neffort, Prime Minister David Lloyd George stated that we are \nfighting Germany, Austria, and drink; and, as far as I can see, the \ngreatest of these three deadly foes is drink. Soon the British \ngovernment limited the sale of alcoholic drink to a few early evening \nhours. In Scotland, the citizens of towns and villages had the right \n(local option) to vote out drinking establishments after 1920. In \nSweden, where the movement had been strong since the 1830s, the \ngovernment abolished both the profit motive and the competition from \nthe liquor traffic after 1922 by nationalizing it. An even harsher \nmeasure there restricted sales to 1 liter (about 1 qt) per family per \nweek. In Norway, voters outlawed the sale of drinks with an alcoholic \ncontent of more than 12 percent by referendum in 1919. That same year \nthe Finnish government banned the sale of any drink of more than 2 \npercent alcohol. Canada was then dry in all provinces.\u0014\n\u0014\nV  National Prohibition in the U.S \u0014\nPrint Preview of Section \u0014\n\u0014\nTo enforce the 18th Amendment, Congress passed the National \nProhibition Act, usually called the Volstead Act because Congressman \nAndrew Volstead of Minnesota introduced it in 1919. This law defined \nthe prohibited intoxicating liquors as those with an alcoholic \ncontent of more than 0.5 percent, although it made concessions for \nliquors sold for medicinal, sacramental, and industrial purposes, and \nfor fruit or grape beverages prepared for personal use in homes. \nBecause the Congress and the state legislatures, however, were \nreluctant to appropriate enough money for more than token \nenforcementand because the opportunities for disregarding the law \nthrough smuggling, distilling, fermenting, and brewing were \nlegionProhibition always represented more of an ideal than a \nreality. On this basis the Prohibition era began at midnight on \nJanuary 16, 1920.\u0014\n\u0014\nA  The Effects of Prohibition \u0014\n\u0014\nThe era inspired an extensive body of colorful literature, most of it \nalleging that the period was one of moral decay and social disorder \nprecisely because of Volsteadism, which came to mean the \nintolerable searches, seizures, and shootings by police who, with \ntheir token enforcement, seemed to threaten intrusion into the \nprivate lives of law-respecting persons. It also alleged that \nProhibition distorted the role of alcohol in American life, causing \npeople to drink more rather than less; that it promoted disrespect \nfor the law; that it generated a wave of organized criminal activity, \nduring which the bootlegger (one who sold liquor illegally), the \nspeakeasy (an illegal saloon), and the gangster became popular \ninstitutions; and that the profits available to criminals from \nillegal alcohol corrupted almost every level of government. \nHistorians, however, believe that in the beginning of the era, and at \nleast until the middle of the decade, most Americans respected the \nlaw, hoped that it would endure, and regarded its passage as directly \nresponsible for the reduced incidence of public drunkenness and of \nalcohol-related crime, imprisonments, and hospitalizations. \nStatistics show that Prohibition reduced the annual per capita \nconsumption from 9.8 liters (2.6 gallons) of absolute alcohol during \nthe period before state laws were effective (1906-1910) to 3.7 liters \n(0.97 gallons) after Prohibition (1934). Moreover, no striking \nstatistical evidence of a crime wave during the 1920s exists, \nalthough the crime rate did rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nB  Movement Toward Repeal \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 1920s, however, more and more Americans found the idea of \nrepeal increasingly attractive. The reasons for this were numerous \nand complex, the governments failure to enforce the law being only \none of them. Most Americans were happy that the old-time saloon had \nbeen abolished, but they felt that a new society was emerging in the \n1920sa primarily urban and industrial society of great geographic \nand social mobility and great ethnic and religious diversities, in \nwhich the protection of the family from alcohol was perhaps less \nsocially urgent than the expansion and protection of individual \nfreedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis disillusionment with Prohibition occurred in every country that \nhad earlier attempted it. In Canada, the dry laws of 1919 were soon \nrepealed because of economic pressures, not the least of which were \nthe opportunities to sell liquor to citizens of the dry U.S. \nProvincial laws after repeal did, however, provide for \ngovernment-owned stores and for local option. In Norway, a referendum \nin 1926 abolished the earlier restriction, but strict regulation of \nthe times and places liquor could be sold preserved a tight rein on \ndrunkenness. Sweden held to state monopoly and severe rationing. \nFinland repealed its prohibition law by referendum in 1932.\u0014\n\u0014\nVI  The End of Prohibition \u0014\nPrint Preview of Section \u0014\nAdvertisement \u0014\nIn the U.S., a major shift in public opinion occurred during the \nearly years of the Great Depression, when opponents could argue \npersuasively that Prohibition deprived people of jobs and governments \nof revenue and generally contributed to economic stagnation. The \nactual political campaign for repeal was largely the work of the \nAssociation Against the Prohibition Amendment (AAPA), a nonpartisan \norganization of wealthy and influential citizens in all states who \nwere wet in principle and who feared that through Prohibition the \nfederal government might permanently compromise the tradition of \nindividual freedom. Like the ASL, the AAPA actively endorsed and \nopposed candidates for state and federal offices. Its goal was that \nCongress should submit to the states the 21st Amendment to the \nConstitution, which would repeal the 18th, and submit it in such a \nway as to circumvent the various state legislatures in which, it \nfeared, dry legislators from rural districts, in opposition to \nmajority sentiment, might present a serious challenge to \nratification. To avoid this, Congressfor the first time since the \nConstitution itself was ratified and for much the same reasoncalled \nfor ratifying conventions in each of the states: Delegates would be \nelected by the people for the specific purpose of voting yes or no \nregarding the question of the 21st Amendment. The elections for \nconvention delegates in 1933 produced a repeal vote running almost 73 \npercent. In a remarkably coordinated effort by the states and the \nCongress, ratification was complete in December of that year.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing repeal, liquor control again became a state rather than a \nfederal problem. The annual per capita consumption of absolute \nalcohol in the country rose after the repeal from 4.5 liters (1.2 \ngallons) in 1935 to 10.2 liters (2.7 gallons) in 1975, but most \nstates still retain restrictions on the sale and consumption of \nalcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nContributed By:\u0014\nNorman H.

    "title": "PASSOVER WEEK AND THE PASSION OF CHRIST",
    "words": "Seven days changed the world. These seven days have been the topic of \na million of publications, countless debates, and thousands of films. \nThese seven days have inspired the greatest painters, the most \nskilled architects, and the most gifted musicians. To try and \ncalculate the cultural impact of these seven days is impossible. But \nharder still would be an attempt to account for the lives of men and \nwomen who have been transformed by them. And yet these seven days as \nthey played out in Jerusalem were of little significance to anyone \nbut a few people involved. What happened on those seven days? During \nthe next seven Sundays of Lent and Easter we will look at these seven \ndays in depth but for now let's summarize:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. On Sunday the first of the seven days, Jesus rode into Jerusalem \non a donkey to the shouts of Hosanna, fulfilling an old prophecy in \nZechariah 9:9. \u0014\n2. On Monday he walked into the Jerusalem Temple overturning tables \nwhere money exchange occurred, Roman drachmas were being exchanged \nfor Jewish shekels. Roman coins were not allowed. The image of Caesar \nwas a violation of the second commandment. But the Temple authorities \nwere using the Commandment as means to cheat the people and making \nthe Temple a place of profit rather than a place of prayer.\u0014\n 3. On Tuesday Jesus taught in parables, warned the people against \nthe Pharisees, and predicted the destruction of the Temple. \u0014\n4. On Wednesday, the fourth day, we know nothing. The Gospel writers \nare silent. Perhaps it was a day of rest for him and his weary and \nworried disciples. \u0014\n5. On Thursday, in an upper room, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal \nwith his disciples. But he gave it a new meaning. No longer would his \nfollowers remember the Exodus from Egypt in the breaking of bread. \nThey would remember his broken body and shed blood. Later that \nevening in the Garden of Gethsemane he agonized in prayer at what lay \nahead for him. \u0014\n6. On Friday, the fifth day, following betrayal, arrest, \nimprisonment, desertion, false trials, denial, condemnation, beatings \nand sentencing, Jesus carried his own cross to \"The Place of the \nSkull,\" where he was crucified with two other prisoners. \u0014\n7. On Saturday, Jesus lay dead in a tomb bought by a rich man named \nJoseph. \u0014\n8. On Sunday, his Passion was over, the stone had been rolled away. \nJesus was alive. He appeared to Mary, to Peter, to two disciples on \nthe road to Emmaus, and to the 11 disciples gathered in a locked \nroom. His resurrection was established as a fact.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack then these seven days were called Passover, as it is still \ncalled today by the Jews. Christians around the world know these \nseven days as Holy Week, the Passion of the Christ. This week Mel \nGibson's film was released. Let me tell you why I think this film is \nimportant. In our culture the emotion, pain, and passion of the \ncrucifixion of Jesus Christ has been lost.\u0014",

Burrough's \nfascination with his subject matter stems from a family \nconnectionhis paternal grandfather manned a roadblock in Arkansas \nduring the hunt for Bonnie and Clydeand he successfully translates \nyears of dogged research, which included thorough review of recently \ndisclosed FBI files, into a graceful narrative. This true crime \nhistory appropriately balances violent shootouts and schemes for \ndaring prison breaks with a detailed account of how the slew of \nrobberies and headlines helped an ambitious federal bureaucrat named \nJ. Edgar Hoover transform a small agency into the FBI we know today. \nWhile some of the details (e.g., that Dillinger got a traffic ticket) \nare trivial, this book compellingly brings back to life people and \ntimes distorted in the popular imagination by hagiographic bureau \nmemoirs and Hollywood.

He is a contributing editor to \nVanity Fair.\u0014\n\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\nAcclaimed Vanity Fair contributor Bryan Burrough brings to life the \nmost spectacular crime wave in American history: the two-year battle \nbetween J. Edgar Hoover's FBI and John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, \nBaby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1933, police jurisdictions ended at state lines, the FBI was in \nits infancy, the highway system was spreading, fast cars and machine \nguns were easily available, and a good number of the thirteen million \nAmericans who were out of work blamed the Great Depression on the \nbanks. In short, it was a wonderful time to be a bank robber. On hand \nto take full advantage was a motley assortment of criminal \nmasterminds, sociopaths, romantics, and cretins, some of whom, with a \nlittle help from J. Edgar Hoover, were to become some of the most \nfamous criminals in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nBryan Burrough's grandfather once set up roadblocks in Alma, \nArkansas, to capture Bonnie and Clyde. He didn't catch them. Burrough \nwas suckled on stories of the crime wave, and now, after years of \nwork, he succeeds where his grandfather failed, capturing the stories \nof Bonnie and Clyde, Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and the rest of the \nFBI's nemeses, weaving them into a single enthralling account. For \nmore than forty years, the great John Toland's Dillinger Days has \nstood as the only book that provides the entire big picture of this \nfabled moment in American history. But an extraordinary amount of new \nmaterial has come to light during those forty years, a good deal of \nit unearthed by Burrough in the course of his own research, and \nPublic Enemies reveals the extent to which Toland and others were fed \nthe story the FBI wanted them to tell. The circles in which the \n\"public enemies\" moved overlapped in countless fascinating ways, \nlarge and small, as Burrough details. The actual connections are one \nthing; but quite another is the sense of connectedness Hoover created \nin the American public's mind for his own purposes. Using the tools \nof an increasingly powerful mass media, Hoover waged an unprecedented \npropaganda campaign, working the press, creating \"America's Most \nWanted\" list, and marketing the mystique of the heroic \"G-men\" that \nsuccessfully obscured an appalling catalog of professional \nineptitude. When the FBI gunned down John Dillinger outside a Chicago \nmovie theater in the summer of 1934, Hoover's ascent to unchecked \npower was largely complete.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth a hugely satisfying entertainment and a groundbreaking work with \npowerful echoes in today's news, Public Enemies is the definitive \nhistory of America's first War on Crime.\u0014",

But \nwhen the electric preacher Fulk of Neuilly gained entrance to the \ncastle and publicly lamented the success of Saladin's Muslim forces \nin the Holy Land, frivolity left the hall. Wearing crosses of cloth \nacross their shoulders, Count Thibaut and a company of knights \nmarched to Pope Innocent III and pledged their lives to war.\u0014\n\u0014\nInnocent was delighted with Thibaut's offer. For over a year, he'd \nworked among the monastic orders to inflame crusader wrath over the \nlosses Saladin had inflictedto little effect. Finally, a new leader \nhad emerged to challenge the Muslims. Rome could now answer the \nfrantic calls for help coming from besieged crusaders in the coastal \ncity of Tyre. \u0014\n\u0014\nInnocent and Thibaut decided to strike first at Egypt, the vulnerable \nunderbelly of Saladin's forces. In 1201, Thibaut sent envoys to the \ndoge of Venice requesting ships for the voyage, since the Turks now \nmade land passage too dangerous. The doge agreed, setting a departure \ndate of June 1202. But he charged a hefty price of 85,000 silver \nmarks.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeals in the dark\u0014\n\u0014\nThen the unexpected happened. Thibaut fell ill and died, and another \nnobleman, Boniface of Montferrat, took his place as commander of the \nFourth Crusade. While visiting a friend in Germany, Boniface met \nAlexius Angelinus, son of Constantinople's dispossessed emperor, now \nseeking men and arms in his quest to regain the throne of \nChristianity's eastern empire. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlexius tried to persuade Boniface to redirect the crusaders away \nfrom Egypt and retake Constantinople for the Angelina family. In \nreturn, Alexius offered part of Constantinople and the Byzantine \nempire to Boniface as his personal fief. And, as a bone to the pope, \nhe promised to enforce the Eastern Church's submission to Rome as the \nsupreme head of the Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nReturning to Rome, Boniface asked Innocent for permission to direct \nthe crusade through Constantinople. The pope, concerned for East-West \nrelations, said no.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the time came for the crusaders to sail, the debt to Venice had \nnot yet been fully paid. The doge insisted that Boniface could sail \nonly if the army first captured Venice's rival Hungarian town of \nZara. Boniface agreed, and Zara fell to the crusaders in November \n1202. Innocent was aghasthe denounced the pillage of Zara and \nreproached Boniface for attacking fellow Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Innocent was no longer in control of his crusade. Boniface still \nowed the doge a substantial debt, and he decided to take Alexius up \non his offer. The pope received word that Boniface was now taking the \narmy to Constantinople. At first, he rationalized the move, hoping \nAlexius would help his cause in the Holy Land. Upon hearing that a \ncrusader army was marching on the Greek capital, Constantinople's \nemperor fled his throne, and city officials installed Alexius in his \nstead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conflagration begins\u0014\n\u0014\nAll had gone according to plan, or so Alexius thought. But when the \nnew emperorkeeping his promise to the papacycommanded his Orthodox \nbishops to submit to Rome, he was met with sullen silence. Further, \nseeing the French swagger down their streets angered many Greeks. \nTheir anger increased when Venetians acting out of \"piety\" set fire \nto a mosque visited by Muslim merchants, and it burned out of \ncontrol, sweeping the city in a massive conflagration.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon a mob of Greeks was storming the palace, and one of the \nleadersnow declared the new emperorthrew Alexius into the imperial \ndungeon and strangled him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing remained for the crusaders but war. Frankish bishops \ndenounced the new emperor as a murderer and the Greeks as schismatic, \nand declared that it was Rome's duty to subjugate Constantinople by \nforce. After a failed first attempt, on April 12, 1204 the army \nattacked from their Venetian ships. Crossing over on ladders thrown \nfrom the ships' masts, the crusaders took the city's towers, and with \nthe cry of \"Holy Sepulchre!\" they sent the Greek army into retreat. \nBy the end of the day, Constantinople had fallen.\u0014\n\u0014\nMassacre and mayhem\u0014\n\u0014\nThe starving, exhausted soldiers looted palaces and peasants alike, \nheedless of Boniface's attempts to control the pillaging.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot even the hallowed Sancta Sophia was safe. Historian Donald \nQueller describes the scene: \"Mules and other beasts of burden were \ndriven up to the altar to bear away the precious ornaments of the \nchurch, desecrating it with their droppings.\" While soldiers drank \nfrom the altar-vessels, writes Steven Runciman, \"a prostitute set \nherself on the Patriarch's throne and began to sing a ribald French \nsong.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the West, Innocent at first received the news of Constantinople's \nfall with enthusiasm. The pope thought he could now depend on the \ncity to fight the Muslims. The Sultan of Egypt, he had heard, was \nalready trembling, fearing he was next. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the details of crusader barbarism filtered back, Innocent \nwas devastated. How could he speak of unity with his Orthodox \nbrethren when such unspeakable acts had been committed against them \nby his own soldiers?\u0014\n\u0014\nInnocent's regret came too late. He had hoped to make Constantinople \nhis allyinstead, the Fourth Crusade sealed the schism between West \nand East. And it further weakened the city, now targeted by the \nrising power of the Ottoman Turks.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIssue 82, Spring 2004, Vol. XXIII, No. 2, Page 46\u0014",

    "title": "PREDICTIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT",
    "words": "Have you ever tried to make a prediction? Here are some predictions \nfrom the \u0014\npast. All from people who were trusted individuals: \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Watson, chairman of IBM, in 1943 said, \"I think there is a \nworld \u0014\nmarket for maybe five computers.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPopular Mechanics magazine in 1949 made this prediction: \"Where a \ncalculator \u0014\non the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, \u0014\ncomputers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh \nonly 1.5 \u0014\ntons.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was an inventor by the name of Lee DeForest. He claimed that \n\"While \u0014\ntheoretically and technically television may be feasible, \ncommercially and \u0014\nfinancially it is an impossibility.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Decca Recording Co. made a big mistake when they made this \nprediction: \u0014\n\"We don't like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.\" That \nwas \u0014\ntheir prediction in 1962 concerning a few lads form Liverpool. Their \nband \u0014\nwas called the Beatles. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the disciples walked out of the Temple in Jerusalem Jesus paused \nwith his \u0014\ndisciples, looked back at the Temple and predicted, \"Do you see all \nthese \u0014\ngreat buildings. Not one stone will be left on another.\" To the \ndisciples \u0014\nthis was bedrock. Nothing could bring down these walls. \"Look, \nteacher! What \u0014\nmassive stones! What magnificent buildings!\" they said to Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe smallest stones in the structure weighed 2 to 3 tons. Many of \nthem \u0014\nweighed 50 tons. The largest existing stone is 12 meters in length \nand 3 \u0014\nmeters high, and it weighed hundreds of tons! The stones were so \nimmense \u0014\nthat neither mortar nor any other binding material was used between \nthe \u0014\nstones. Their stability was attained by the great weight of the \nstones. The \u0014\nwalls towered over Jerusalem, over 400 feet in one area. Inside the \nfour \u0014\nwalls was 45 acres of bedrock mountain shaved flat and during Jesus' \nday a \u0014\nquarter of a million people could fit comfortably within the \nstructure. No \u0014\nsports structure in America today comes close. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou can then understand the disciples surprise. As they walked down \nthe \u0014\nKidron valley and up mount olive Peter James and John wanted to hear \nmore. \u0014\nJesus' prediction that a structure so immense would be leveled to the \nground \u0014\nseemed implausible. But they pressed Jesus for more information. They \nwanted \u0014\nto know when. What would be the sign that this was about to take \nplace? In \u0014\ntheir voice was fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear that their lives were \nabout \u0014\nto change forever. Jesus had not made any predictions like this one. \nThis \u0014\nwas different. This, they could understand. \u0014\n\u0014\nForty years later Jesus' prediction came true. In 70 AD the Temple \nwas \u0014\ndestroyed by Rome. What are we to learn from this prediction and its \u0014\nfulfillment? \u0014\nI \u0014\nFirst of all, bedrock of faith is not in Temples. Try to place \nyourself in \u0014\nfirst century Jerusalem. From anywhere in the city you can look up \nand catch \u0014\na glimpse of the Temple. The 45-year project of King Herod was the \nthird \u0014\nsuch Temple. It had been the center of their national life for a \nthousand \u0014\nyears. In the Temple the Jews sacrificed. Confessed their Sins. Gave \ntheir \u0014\nfirst fruits of the harvest. Yearly sacrificed a lamb for the \nnations sins. \u0014\nIt was here that Passover, Pentecost, Day of Atonement, Feasts of \u0014\nTabernacles, and Feast of Weeks was celebrated. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the Temple so central to their life and worship this major \nquestion \u0014\nthen arises: How would they worship God without the Temple? It was a \u0014\nquestion for which the Disciples had no answer. We understandably get \ntied \u0014\nto things. We can even develop sentimental attachments to them. But \nthe \u0014\nTemple was unique. God himself is said in Deuteronomy to be the \narchitect \u0014\ngiving the exact dimension of the Altar, the grounds, the Walls, the \ndoors, \u0014\ndown to the very size of the stones. This was Gods building. \u0014\n\u0014\nDid you know that the Christians continued to make sacrifices at the \ntemple \u0014\nafter Jesus death? Paul even makes an offering (Acts 21). It is the \nplace \u0014\nwhere Johns birth was announced, Jesus preeminence was recognized \nby \u0014\nSimeon and Anna, Jesus religious intelligence was recognized by the \nleaders \u0014\nat age 12, and where the money changers were driven out years later. \nIt was \u0014\nhere that Paul was arrested.\u0014",

    "words": "Jerry Sutton, a Nashville pastor, has written an excellent little \nbook  The Way Back Home (Broadman & Holman)  which can be \neffectively used to encourage people who need a second chance. He \nshares this story about the need to respond to God's warning signals:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The worst industrial accident in history occurred on April 26, 1986, \nin the town of Chernobyl in north central Ukraine of the former \nSoviet Union. It was caused by two electrical engineers who were \nplaying around with one of the nuclear reactors. They were conducting \nan unauthorized experiment trying to see how long a turbine would \nfreewheel (or keep spinning) when the power was turned off. To do \nthis, they had to manually override six separate computer-driven \nalarm systems. Each time the computer would warn, 'Stop! Dangerous! \nGo no further!' Each time the warning was foolishly disregarded. The \nend result was a major explosion, thirty-one immediate deaths, untold \neventual deaths, and the release of 100 million curies of \nradionuclides into the atmosphere that circulated worldwide. Only \ntime will determine the full extent and destruction of the accident.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Often, we  like those foolish engineers  fail to heed the warning \ngiven to us by the Holy Spirit: 'Stop! Dangerous! Go no further!' As \na result, there comes a point when our restlessness and refusal to \nlisten to the Spirit's warning leads us to cross the line from \nrestlessness to rebellion.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Experts Say Global \nPoverty Can Be Reduced by Half\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n01-19-05\u0014\n\u0014\nAn international team of experts on Monday unveiled a comprehensive \nstrategy to cut extreme poverty in half and improve the lives of at \nleast 1 billion people in developing countries by 2015.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report, put forward by the U.N. Millennium Project, an \nindependent advisory body to U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan, said \ngoals to reduce world poverty can still be achieved, if countries \ntake action immediately.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe plan calls for industrialized nations to double their aid to poor \ncountries, to 0.5 percent of their national incomes--about 50 cents \nof every hundred dollars. The United States currently allocates less \nthan 0.2 percent of its income to aid.\u0014\n \u0014\nWe are in a position to end extreme poverty within our generation, \nsaid Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia University economist who directed \nthe three-year U.N. Millennium Project. Not just cutting poverty in \nhalfif we want to eliminate extreme poverty, we can do that by 2025.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 74-page report, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to \nAchieve the Millennium Development Goals, was released as the Asian \ntsunami disaster focused global attention on the\u0014\nneed, scale and effectiveness of aid to the worlds poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecretary-General Annan has said the fight against extreme poverty \nshould be the top priority of the world community in 2005.\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 2000, world leaders met at the U.N. and agreed to cut extreme \npoverty in half by 2015. The research by 265 of the worlds leading \neconomists says not only that that this still can be done but also \ndescribes in detail how it can be achieved.\u0014\n\u0014\n Until now, we did not have a concrete plan for achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, Sachs said. The experts who \ncontributed to this huge undertaking have shown without a doubt that \nwe can still meet the goalsif we start putting this plan into action \nright now.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn absolute dollars, the authors urged wealthy nations to disburse \n$135 billion in development aid in 2006an increase over existing \ncommitments of $48 billion and equivalent to about 5 percent of \nglobal military spending. By 2015, annual aid levels should reach \n$195 billion, the repot says.\u0014\n\u0014\n The project leaders recommended that assistance be targeted \nimmediately to countries already recognized as both needy and able to \nuse aid effectively, starting with Fast Track countries already \ndeemed eligible for debt relief.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeeting the development goals is too big a project for governments \nalone, the experts concluded. Challenges of growth and job creation, \ncoupled with delivery of services to poor countries, will require a \nbroad partnership involving the public and private sector, the report \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn October evangelical Christians from around the world gathered in \nNew York City to pledge to hold governments accountable for keeping \ntheir commitments to cut poverty in half in the next decade.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Micah Challenge campaign, named after the biblical prophet, has \nbeen endorsed by groups including the Baptist World Alliance.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "PASTOR TO THE NATION",
    "words": "Pastor to the Nation\u0014\nNewton responded to thousands of requests for spiritual counsel with \nletters advising the lowly and the great.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Steven Gertz\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a cold December night in 1785, a young, fidgety man loitered \noutside a London clergyman's house in Charles Square, Hoxton. \nPassersby gave him little notice, but the rich, dashing, and \nwell-connected William Wilberforce took great care that no one would \nrecognize him here. For this was the home of John Newtonthe man \nslandered in some quarters as an \"enthusiast\"and hardly fit company \nfor a promising young Member of Parliament.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut \"enthusiast\" or no, Newton was the man Wilberforce wanted to see. \nAs a boy of eight years, he'd sat at the feet of the fascinating \nsea-captain, drinking in his colorful stories, jokes, songsand \nperhaps most importantly, lessons of faith. Yet Wilberforce's mother \ndisliked Newton's \"methodism\" and forbade her son to visit Newton in \nOlney. Newton feared he'd lost the boy. He wrote to his poet friend \nWilliam Cowper that religious sentiments in Wilberforce \"seem now \nentirely worn off, not a trace left behind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, in a moment of spiritual crisis, wondering whether his reborn \nfaith in God required him to leave politics, Wilberforce knew who \ncould help him most. Rounding the corner for the second time, he \nmustered his courage and strode to the front door to call on his old \nfriend.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all his hesitation, Wilberforce had good reason to confide in \nJohn Newton. A man both experienced in the world and now a minister \nof the gospel, Newton stood uniquely poised to advise men like \nWilberforce. He knew how to relate to and counsel many people, \nincluding politicians, clergy, middle-class bourgeoisie, and country \nartisans. How did Newton acquire such influence and ability? And what \ndistinguished him as a \"director of souls?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton understood the importance of spiritual accountability and \nfriendship. Early in his Christian life, he'd enjoyed the \nencouragement of men like Captain Alexander Clunie, who reinforced \nhis newfound belief in Christ and connected him to other evangelical \nChristians in London.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Liverpool, during his seven frustrating years of striving toward \nordination, Newton thrived in the company of Calvinist Baptists and \nother Dissenters, and organized a regular Sunday evening meeting for \na few select friends to discuss spiritual matters. He titled his \nfirst literary venture Thoughts on Religious Associations.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpportunities for spiritual counsel abounded in his parish at Olney. \nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, he hosted a continual stream of students, \nlaymen, and clergy from surrounding areas eager for spiritual \nconversation. Newton traveled extensively as well, once making a \nthree-month 650-mile circular tour preaching for old friends in \nYorkshire and the West Midlands.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he couldn't travel to visit friends, Newton wrote letters \ninstead. He wrote with personal warmth, often addressing specific \nissues in friends' lives and sharing tidbits from his own life as \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis thought-provoking letters advised friends on matters ranging from \nvocation to marriage to death. Occasionally he would address \ntheological issues, particularly the Calvinist-Arminian controversy \nthen troubling evangelical churches. These were often prompted by \nquestions correspondents struggled with. Though himself a moderate \nCalvinist, he tried, as he once said, to \"keep all shibboleths, and \nforms and terms of distinction out of sight, as we keep knives and \nrazors out of the way of children,\" opting rather to \"talk a good \ndeal about Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1790s, Newton was at any one time working from a stack of 50 \nor 60 unanswered letters, spending hours each week at his desk. The \npostal system at the time expected recipients of letters to pay the \npostage. Newton's friends prized his advice highly. Many of his \nlettersin fact, over 500 of themwere published for a wider \naudience, particularly in his 1780 book Cardiphonia, or The Utterance \nof the Heart (the title was suggested by his friend, the poet William \nCowper).\u0014\n\u0014\nCardiphonia did much to establish Newton's reputation as the \n\"spiritual director\" of England's evangelical community. Its letters \ndate from his curacy at Olney (1764-1780), beginning with 26 to a \nnobleman, Lord DartmouthNewton's ecclesiastical patron and secretary \nof the American coloniesand finishing with 23 to other friends, many \nof them clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Cardiphonia, Newton's counsel consistently returns to the \nimportance of experiencing Jesus over acquiring mere theological \nknowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is to be lamented,\" wrote Newton to Lord Dartmouth, \"that an \nincrease of knowledge  should be so generally attended with a \ndecline of fervor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo John Ryland, Jr., a young family friend just embarking on a \nministerial career, Newton wrote, \"I desire to grow in knowledge, but \nI want nothing which bears that name, that has not a direct tendency \nto make sin more hateful [and] Jesus more precious to my soul.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton worried especially that the fashionable Deism then popular in \nthe universities was leading young men astray, and that Christianity \nwas becoming more a religion of the head than of the heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nBattling sin and spiritual dullness\u0014\n\u0014\nThe power of sin and the believer's struggle with it permeates much \nof Newton's thought. A moderate Calvinist, Newton frequently sorrowed \nover his sinful state and his spiritual dullness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter to his friend J. Foster Barham, he notes that early in \nhis Christian walk, he imagined himself growing in sanctification, \nattaining \"everything which I then comprised in my idea of a saint.  \nBut alas! these, my golden expectations, have been like South Sea \ndreams; I have lived hitherto a poor sinner, and I believe I shall \ndie one.\" Yet, Newton points out, \"I have every reason to be thankful \n if I shall sink yet more in my own esteem, and He will be pleased \nto rise still more glorious to my eyes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton also happily gave counsel on personal matters. He advised John \nRyland, Jr., then contemplating marriage and starting a family, to \n\"think of money likewise.\" He wrote, \"though the love of money be a \ngreat evil, money itself, obtained in a fair and honorable way, is \ndesirable upon many accounts.  Meat, clothes, fire, and books cannot \neasily be had without it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also gave his opinion on the controversial and still risky \nsmallpox vaccine, siding with those who \"neither run intentionally \ninto the way of the small-pox, nor run out of the way, but leave it \nsimply with the Lord.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs curate, Newton spent hours with the sick, and his letters \nfrequently comment on the courage (or fear) of those facing death. As \nphysicians specialize in medicine, Newton wrote to Lord Dartmouth, so \n\"anatomy is my favorite branchI mean the study of the human heart.\"\u0014\nTo those who harbor grave doubts about faith and God, \"I know no \nbetter corroborating evidence for the relief of the mind under such \nassaults than the testimony of dying persons, especially of such as \nhave lived outside the noise of controversy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton goes on to describe one such woman, who lived out her days in \nrelative confinement, knowing little of the world around her but \nliving soberly, practicing common sense, and reading her Bible \nregularly.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn elite field of ministry\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1780, Newton left Olney for London, serving as rector of St. Mary \nWoolnoth, church to a prestigious parish. Joining a strong company of \nevangelical preachers in that city, Newton soon exerted a tremendous \namount of influence among clergy and politicians.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My connections have enlarged,\" he wrote, \"my name is spread.\" He \nreceived visitors twice a week at his home, and he founded the \nEclectic Society, a like-minded group of clergy, to discuss the \nissues of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also offered spiritual counsel to such wealthy individuals as the \nCountess of Huntingdon (who in turn arranged opportunities for Newton \nto speak to the aristocracy) and William Wilberforce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proof of Newton's high talent and deep labor as a spiritual \ndirector may be seen in the lives of the men and women he molded for \nthe kingdom of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1786, Newton wrote of Wilberforce, \"I hope the Lord will make him \na blessing both as a Christian and a statesman. How seldom do these \ncharacters coincide! But they are not incompatible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Newton's credit as a spiritual counselor and friend, few \npoliticians have ever done so much as Wilberforce for the cause of \nChrist or the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Gertz is editorial coordinator of Christian History.\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

    "words": "People Worth Knowing\u0014\nNo \"Little Women\" here\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not much of an exaggeration to say that women made revivalistic \nProtestantism happen in the nineteenth century. For example, as \nhistorian Mary Ryan has shown, Charles Finney's New York revival \nmeetings were organized, prepared, and prayed for by an extensive \nnetwork of Christian women. Moreover, these women often brought the \nmen in their liveshusbands, fathers, sons, and more distant \nrelativesto Finney's meetings.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen's influence soon reached far beyond the prayer meeting and the \nrevival, especially through their participation in social causes. It \nwas in the crusades for educational reform, abolition, and temperance \nthat three of nineteenth-century America's most prominent Christian \nwomen made their names and changed their nation: Catharine Beecher, \nSojourner Truth, and Frances Willard.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatharine Beecher (1800-1878)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of eight surviving children of the influential Connecticut \nminister and social reformer Lyman Beecher (1775-1863) and his wife, \nRoxana, Catharine Esther Beecher was trained from girlhood in the \ncustodianship of her nation. At 16, her mother died and she took on \nthe mothering role for her younger siblingsa training ground for her \nlater influence as a founder of schools and trainer of teachers.\u0014\n\u0014\nA woman described by one historian as \"plain of appearance, with \nheavy features, dark hair worn in lank ringlets, and a sallow \ncomplexion,\" Beecher was frail, suffering \"recurrent nervous \ncollapses and attacks of sciatica,\" which slowed but never stopped \nher indefatigable reforming efforts. But she had no time for the \n\"weaker sex\" philosophy that assumed women were less capable of \nlearning and leading than men.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatharine saw America's female seminaries (quasi-colleges or \nacademies focusing on subjects considered appropriate for women) as \nneglecting both physical education and the practical skills necessary \nto the middle-class Victorian woman who managed a complex household \nand provided the physical and moral care for the next generation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response, Catharine, herself a schoolteacher from early age, \nfounded several schools for women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe success of these schools was uneven, but Beecher placed her stamp \non women's education and the arts of home management. Her widely read \nbooks, Treatise on Domestic Economy (1841), Domestic Receipt Book \n(1846), and American Woman's Home (1869), penned with sister Harriet, \nlaunched home economics as a respected science.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more significant, Catharine picked up her father's crusade to \n\"Christianize\" the Westthrough education. (At odds with her father's \nstern Calvinism, she eventually transferred her membership from a \nCongregational to the Episcopal Church.) In the 1840s, she began \ntraveling and writing energetically in the urgent cause of sending \nwomen teachers to the frontier.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer Duty of American Women to Their Country (1845) caught the \nattention of, among others, the ex-governor of Vermont, William \nSlade, who founded the Board of National Popular Education.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith Beecher as head recruiter and trainer, the Board sent more than \n500 schoolteachers westward from New England. After Beecher divided \nthe Board over disagreements, she continued the crusade through her \nAmerican Woman's Educational Association.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the decades before her sister Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote \nUncle Tom's Cabin, and her brother Henry Ward Beecher began his Civil \nWar-era rise to pulpit stardom, Catharine was America's most renowned \nBeecher.\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourner Truth (c. 1797-1883)\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourner Truth's deep-toned speech, marked by a Dutch accent \nabsorbed during her youth as a slave in Ulster County, N.Y., \nchallenged and captivated anti-slavery audiences across the country. \nTruth was born Isabella, and in her early years took the name Van \nWagener in honor of a family that helped her escape slavery in 1827, \none year before emancipation was declared in New York State.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly an adherent of Methodism, Isabella's mystic personality made \nher susceptible to the magnetism of religious charlatans, and she \nspent several of her early years attached to the cultic New York \nministries of Elijah Pierson (self-styled \"The Tishbite\") and Robert \nMatthews (\"Matthias\").\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1843, Isabella took the name \"Sojourner Truth\" and began traveling \nEast, spreading a simple gospel message of a loving God. In \nNorthampton, Massachusetts, she joined a communal group and \nencountered abolitionism for the first time.\u0014\n\u0014\nA singer and raconteur known for her homey wisdom and sharp repartee, \nTruth spent the late 1840s as a featured speaker on many anti-slavery \nplatforms. In 1850 she traveled west again, attracting larger and \nlarger audiences, sharing stages with such renowned abolitionists as \nFrederick Douglass. She sustained herself by selling her \nautobiography and was often opposedsometimes violentlyby Southern \nsympathizers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth's tall frame and somewhat masculine features helped fuel rumors \nthat she was not, as she claimed, the mother of many children who had \nseen difficult years under slaverybut rather, a man masquerading as \na woman for his own political advantage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen one audience member at an Indiana woman's rights convention \nshouted out this charge against her, Truth put an exclamation point \nto her withering rejoinder by baring her breasts before the stunned \ncrowd.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War, she traveled throughout \nMichigan, gathering donations of supplies for regiments of black \nvolunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1864 she was received by Lincoln at the White House, and soon \nafter, she drew up a widely-signed petition for the founding of a \n\"Negro state\" in unsettled parts of the West. Though her proposal \nfell flat, many blacks did move west in the 1870s, likely under the \ninfluence of her encouragement.\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourner Truth's lasting influence has been as a symbol of woman's \nindomitable spirit and public achievements. She died in 1883 in \nBattle Creek, and her funeral there was said to have been the biggest \never seen in that area.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrances Willard (1839-1898)\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Sojourner Truth was a symbol and rallying figure for abolitionism \nand woman's suffrage, so was Frances Willarda fellow Methodistfor \nthe cause of temperance. Born in New York, Willard grew up on the \nfrontier, in the Wisconsin Territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom her earliest years, Willard coveted the educational \nopportunities that were given preferentially to males. When her \nfather grudgingly consented to her attending the Congregationalists' \nMilwaukee Female College, she began on the path that would lead to \nher graduation in 1859 as a \"Laureate of Science.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrances, who cut her hair short and preferred to be called \"Frank,\" \nsoon grew into Frances the self-assured leader, with the skills and \nconfidence necessary to pull together, in 1878, a petition asking \nthat the women of Illinois be given the vote on liquor issues. In the \nyears before the Civil War, drinking had risen to astronomical and \nsocially disruptive heights. America was drinking itself to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nWillard stood in solidarity with countless women who experienced in \ntheir own homes the negative impact of this largely male love affair \nwith alcohol. She gathered the names of more than 100,000 women on \nher petition, and though it failed in its goal, it gained her the \nleadership of a new organization dedicated to eradicating the curse \nof drunkenness from America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was born in 1874 out of \nthe momentum of a winter's campaign across New York and central Ohio \nin which women, professedly emboldened by the Holy Spirit, demanded \nthat saloons in those states be closed. Willard became WCTU's \npresident in 1879.\u0014\n\u0014\nCapitalizing on the Victorian assumption that the woman's sphere was \nthe home, Willard was able, under the slogan \"home protection,\" not \nonly to rally tremendous support on the issue of temperance, but to \nmake strides on female suffrage. Voting for measures against alcohol, \nWillard argued, was the only way women would succeed in keeping its \nscourge from destroying their husbands and their homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWillard proved a masterful power broker, gathering the support of \nmany constituencies. She built social networks and private \nrelationships with the consummate care of the diplomat. In her public \nand personal relations, she was unfailingly caring even as she was \nfirmthe iron fist in the kid glove.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder her expert leadership, the WCTU became and remained, through \nthe turn of the century, both the largest temperance organization and \nthe largest women's organization in the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Willard succeeded where more strident, less careful women \nfailed, because she deeply understood the role of gender images in \nnineteenth-century public life. The near-adulation her memory \ncontinued to receive after her death in 1898including the placing of \nher statue in the Capitol at Washington in 1905shows how effectively \nshe was able to use this knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Detailed, interesting critical biographies are available for each \nof these women:\u0014\n\u0014\n    Kathryn Kish Sklar, Catharine Beecher: A Study in American \nDomesticity (W.

Her first novel, Madeline, drawn from the life of a peasant \ngirl of Auvergne, established her reputation. Nineteen others would \nfollow, including Nathalie, Daisy Burns, and Rachel Gray.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Kavanagh was still a young woman, her father deserted their \nfamily, and she remained unmarried, caring for her mother, for the \nrest of her life. Nonetheless, she was able to travel across Europe, \nand her experiences drew her to the writing of historical biography. \nThis she began to do with Women in France During the Eighteenth \nCentury (1850), which, with her French Women of Letters and its \ncompanion English Women of Letters (1862), was noted for its literary \npower.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 400 pages of Women of Christianity, Kavanagh told the stories \nof women from Dorcas in the Acts of the Apostles to the English \nprison minister Sarah Martin (d. 1843). In the book's introduction, \nshe observed that while \"men have filled [history's] pages with their \nown deeds,\" their focus on wars and governments has given us \"the \nannals of nations, not the story of humanity.\" Her conclusion: It is \nin the untold stories of women, in their gentleness, courage, \ncharity, and holiness, that we may begin to find the latter.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames D.

    "title": "PEOPLE OF THE LIE: BY SCOTT PECK, A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Abdullah Z Jefri \"Aceous\" (Saudi Arabia)\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't even consider buying this book if you haven't read the author's \nfirst book \"The road less traveled.\" This is a sequel to that book \nand a lot of the notions and concepts discussed here were established \nin the first book. Besides, the author, M. Scott Peck, introduces \nmany controversial suggestions in this book, and most of his findings \nare either shocking or, at least, unusual. Only by reading the first \nbook you will establish the respect and admiration of the author's \nwisdom and intellect necessary to hear out his out of the ordinary \nideas.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The road less traveled\" is a psychological study of love and of \nhuman spiritual growth, or in other words, the good side of humanity. \nThis book is a follow up to that study. It is only logical that when \nyou study the light that you wonder about the darkness. However, \nhuman evil is a concept totally alien to the science of psychiatry. \nBesides, as the author himself admits, using the term \"Evil\" can be \nan act of evilness itself! It is also highly risky to approach the \nflames of evilness without catching up on its fires yourself! With \nthese precautions Dr. Peck begins a fantastic book in the study of \nhuman evil through the eyes of psychiatry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book begins by telling in detail the story of one of his patients \nwho seemed to be a happy man leading a very normal and healthy life. \nHowever, as he carries on, we start realizing along with Dr. Peck \nthat evil was staring the man in every corner of his life, hiding in \nhis problems and even among his family members! It is by the end of \nthe story we realize that this normal person literally did sell his \nsoul to the devil!\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did this happen? How can one sell his soul to the devil? Does the \ndevil even exist? With these questions Dr. Peck dives into the study \nof evil in human beings. Dr. Peck claims that evil does exist, but \nit's neither incurable nor unavoidable! And the only way to combat \nevil is to admit to its existence and to recognize its danger. How \ncan you fight something that you don't even believe is true, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Peck explains why scientists dismiss the idea of the existence of \nevil and how that is caused by their limited perception of what \nscience stands for. He then carries on by giving examples of some of \nthe cases he had to deal with where he allegedly met with the human \nevil. And in one chapter he dedicates it wholly to one story of one \nof his clients whom he failed to heal after more than 5 years of \ntherapy because he didn't have the knowledge or the courage to admit \nthat it was evil that she was suffering from. Later on he explains a \ndifferent manifestation of evil that he terms as \"The group evil.\" He \nexplains that evil can be present in a group even if all of its \nmembers were not individually evil!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe end of the book talks about the dangers and the hopes of creating \na science that studies evil. Once I finished the book, I had even \nmore respect for Dr. Peck than I ended up with after reading his \nfirst book. Dr. Peck's writing style is pleasant and easy to \ncomprehend. And his story telling techniques are exciting as well as \nthought provoking. By reading this book you will definitely have so \nmany thoughts to ponder on for many days whether you agree with the \nauthor's findings or not. By reading this book you will definitely \nadd intellectual, and possibly moral, value to yourself, and will \nprobably find it highly entertaining at the same time. I totally \nrecommend buying this book.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless I have one serious reservation about this book, and it's \nin Chapter 5, which is titled \"Of possession and exorcism.\" In that \nchapter the author takes one hell of a detour and starts talking \nabout his personal investigation of the myth of possession and the \nalleged healing practice of exorcism. The shocking finding he throws \nin your face is that both are true and that he personally witnessed \ntwo exorcism procedures, one of which was a possession by Satan \nhimself!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd even though I try my best to remain an open minded person by \nbeing receptive of every point of view out there, I can't accept such \nan outrageous claim if not accompanied with evidence and reason. The \nauthor's attitude in that particular chapter, surprisingly atypical \nof him, was very vague and unclear. He claims that the two exorcism \nexperiences he went through were intense and that to give them \njustice would require that a whole separate book be written about \nthem. Hence, he would only give us the impressions and resolutions he \ncame out with from those experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nI, in my humble opinion, find that argument fallible! I don't think \nthat anyone would've minded adding 200 more pages to that chapter \njust to hear those stories! Besides, if he truly thought that they \ndeserve a book of their own then how come he never wrote one? I am \nmostly surprised because he never failed to extend proof and reason \nwhenever he's presenting an unusual thought. This time it was very \ndifferent though. By the time I reached the end of that chapter I \nfelt that I was totally deceived by the author and that he did not \ndeserve the respect I had for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, once I started the following chapter, he gained back my \nrespect of him and more immediately! I don't know what to think of \nchapter 5 and whether I prefer that I didn't read it or not. But, as \nI said previously, this book including chapter 5 will leave you \nthinking whether you agree with its findings or not.\u0014\n\u0014\nReviewer:\tJohn S. Ryan \"Scott Ryan\" (Silver Lake, OH) - \u0014\n\u0014\nM. Scott Peck's _People of the Lie_ makes an interesting case that \n\"evil\" should be recognized as a scientific and psychotherapeutic \ncategory.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeck warns that his book is \"dangerous,\" I think in part because it \ncould lead casual readers to run around branding others as \"evil\" \nwithout clinical evidence. However, dangerous or not, his book \npresents some fine portraits of what do seem to be some genuinely \nevil patients.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not terribly impressed with his section on \"exorcism\" for various \nreasons, but the only reason I'll mention here is that I'm not sure \nwhat it's doing in this book. Peck leads into it with a chapter on \n\"Charlene,\" a former patient of his whom he was ultimately unable to \nhelp; he concludes this chapter by remarking that if he'd known then \nwhat he knows now, he might have been able to offer her \"salvation\" \nin the form of \"deliverance and exorcism.\" Yet within another dozen \npages or so, he's remarking that exorcism probably *wouldn't* have \nhelped her and that victims of \"possession\" aren't necessarily evil \nto any great degree themselves. Okay, but then why discuss the topic \nin this book?\u0014\n\u0014\nI'll refrain from comment on some of Peck's other conclusions and \nmerely remark that I think the book weakens toward the end. However, \nfor all that, it's still a fine volume on a very real phenomenon: the \nevil human being, understood (my paraphrase) as one who goes about \ndeliberately inhibiting or undermining the spiritual growth and \nwell-being of other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course therapists can be \"evil\" too, and Ellen Plasil's book \n_Therapist_ -- which gives a fascinating and horrifying account of \n\"Objectivist psychotherapist\" Lonnie Leonard -- makes a good \ncompanion to this book.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in fact, a great many of Peck's remarks apply surprisingly well \nto Ayn Rand herself -- one of the more spirit-killing people to have \nwandered freely about America in this century, and one who (according \nto a psychotherapist who \"knew her when\") seems to have suffered from \nsevere and chronic personality disorders. Readers interested in \nlearning more about this can read the two Rand biographies by her \nformer associates Barbara Branden (_The Passion of Ayn Rand_) and \nNathaniel Branden (_My Years With Ayn Rand_, a revised edition of his \nearlier _Judgment Day_). Also of interest: Jeff Walker's _The Ayn \nRand Cult_. (Or you can just drop me a line.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDisturbing, maybe over-dramatic, and definitely lacking, January 25, \n2005\u0014\nReviewer:\tShannon Gaw (Roswell, GA USA) - \u0014\n\u0014\nI read \"The Road Less Traveled\" over ten years ago and really was \nimpressed with Peck and his message. I read \"People of the Lie\" in \none sitting, which is something I rarely do. It was disturbing and \nfascinating as I read it, but seems uneven and flawed as I reflect on \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book was too short; it requires more than 270 pages to support \nsome of the claims he made, especially with his choice of case \nstudies. I think he was too liberal with the term \"evil\". Most of the \npeople in the case studies were just disgusting; identifying them as \nevil gives them too much credit. He did define \"evil\" much more \nbroadly and banal than its common interpretation (i.e., using power \nor coercion -covert or overt - to limit spiritual growth). Yet then \nhe proceeds to tie in this brand of evil with the Satanic, virtually \ninvalidating his previous definition.\u0014\n\u0014\nI do appreciate the emphasis on parenting and how poor parenting can \ndestroy lives; still there are much better treatments of the subject \nand really is worth much more coverage than it's given.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe chapter on Charlene was interesting but anti-climactic and \nlightweight. Surely, surely with all the bad people out there, he \ncould have found a better case-study for a potential candidate for \nexorcism.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis chapter on Mylai and the culpability of the Johnson \nadministration and the America public in general was right on the \nmoney. Still, this chapter did not really address the dynamic of \ngroup evil, just rather the political situation behind a particular \nevent. It was really a poor attempt of covering the subject, which \nreally could have been its own book.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book will help me to identify, fear, and be repulsed by the \npeople of the lie, but it is by far not an exhaustive or complete \nanalysis.\u0014",

    "title": "PERSONAL MEMOIRS-ULYSSES S. GRANT--A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "\u0014\nCompleted just days before his death in 1885, the Personal Memoirs of \nUlysses S. Grant ranks among the finest military autobiographies ever \npenned. Encouraged and edited by Mark Twain (a fascinating friendship \nand partnership well told in the remarkable book Grant and Twain), \nthis masterpiece has never gone out of print, providing successive \ngenerations with an unflinching look at the Civil Wars greatest \ngeneral.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresented here in an exclusive hardback version of the Modern Library \nWar Series edition, Grants memoirs, in the words of series editor \nCaleb Carr, contrast the remarkable humility of their author with \nthe overwhelmingly dramatic circumstances into which fate flung him. \nGeoffrey Perret, author of Lincolns War, writes in his introduction \nto this volume, the narrative has the directness and limpidity of \nthe purest English prose. Or as Gore Vidal once declared, it is \nsimply not possible to read Grants memoirs without realizing that \nthe author is a man of first-rate intelligence.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe fights\u0014\n\u0014\nI need this man, remarked Abraham Lincoln of the man who would win \nthe war. He fights. Grant, too, recognized the nature of their \nrelationship. Recalling their first meeting in 1864, where he was \npromoted to Lieutenant General and placed in command of all Union \nforces, Grant writes: all [Lincoln] wanted or had ever wanted was \nsome one who would take responsibility and act, and call on him for \nall the assistance needed, pledging himself to use all the power of \nthe government in rendering such assistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd fight he did. Grants siege of Vicksburg placed the Mississippi \nriver in Union hands, a victory achieved on the same dayJuly 4, \n1863as George Meades triumph over Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. In \nMay 1864 Grant commanded the Army of the Potomac against Lee at the \nWilderness. More desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this \ncontinent, Grant recalled of the bloody battles staggering losses.\u0014\n\u0014\nMagnanimous in victory\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many have focused on Grants brutal determination to win, even \nin the face of mounting and horrific casualties, his memoirs reveal a \ntremendous respect for his opponents. Describing Lees surrender at \nAppomattox, Grant writes, I felt like anything rather than rejoicing \nat the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly. He \npermitted Confederate officers to retain their side arms, horses, and \nother private property, a gesture Lee admitted would have a happy \neffect upon his army.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his frontier boyhood to his failure in business from which the \nwar rescued him, Grant narrates his mesmerizing life story in this \nhonest and moving work. A monumental achievement in American \nliterature, Grants Personal Memoirs truly belongs on every bookshelf.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Ulysses S. Grant, commander in chief of Union \nforces during the final years of the Civil War and eighteenth \npresident of the United States, was born on April 28, 1822, and died \non July 23, 1885, less than one week after completing work on this \nbook.\u0014",

    "words": "Politicizing Church Discipline\u0014\n\u0014\nBruce Prescott\u0014\n05-16-05 \u0014\nSouthern Seminary President Al Mohler has been cozying up to \npoliticians for so long that he is now confusing church discipline \nwith political-party discipline.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an article entitled Should a church discipline members over \npolitics? Mohler says:\u0014\nThe right form of the church requires a common commitment to certain \nshared convictions. These commitments are irreducibly theological, \nbut come with inevitable political consequences. \u0014\n\u0014\nUntil recently, our domestic political debates have failed to reach \na point of crisis with regard to these consequences, but crisis \ncannot be rejected as a possibility. In such cases, the church must \nmaintain its witness and convictional commitments. \u0014\n\u0014\nA church should exercise discipline against a member who, while \nclaiming to be a Christian, would vote for Adolf Hitler--or David \nDuke.\" \u0014\n[Editor's note: David Duke is a former Ku Klux Klan leader and \ntwo-time presidential candidate widely regarded as a white \nsupremacist].\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has long been a practice of political parties to discipline their \nmembers over how they vote. But until the recent sad events at East \nWaynesville Baptist Church, to my knowledge, it has never been the \npractice of Baptist churches to discipline members over how they \nvote. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the chief reason why when Baptists send representatives to \nassociational, state and national conventions we call them \nmessengers and not delegates. \u0014\nHistorically, Baptists have strongly advocated and respected the \nright of persons to vote in accord with their own conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, it is not out of the realm of possibility that some members \nof the church where I was pastor in Houston did vote for David Duke \nduring a presidential primary. While I strongly disagree with the way \nthey may have voted, they are not accountable to me or to their \nchurch for how they cast their ballot.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor people living in a democratic society, the voting booth is sacred \nspace. Each person must examine his or her own conscience and give an \naccount to God alone for the way they cast their ballot.\u0014\n\u0014\nMohler and others on the Religious Right need to learn to recognize \nthat, in a democracy, the right to vote is a sacred duty and a solemn \nresponsibility. Then both major political parties would surely be \nunited in demanding that every citizen have equal access to the \nballot box, that every vote be counted, and that every ballot be \ntabulated by accurate and publicly verifiable means.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts the democracy part that hangs them up. Their theocratic impulses \nblind them to the link between the inalienable rights of conscience \nand the sacredness of the ballot box. \u0014\n\u0014\nBruce Prescott is executive director of Mainstream Oklahoma Baptists \nand president of the Oklahoma Chapter of Americans United for \nSeparation of Church and State.

MacHarg\u0014\n\u0014\nPat Robertson's image was all over local television news in Latin \nAmerica yesterday (8/23/05).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Virginia-based TV evangelist was shown telling his \"700 Club\" \naudience that controversial Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ought to \nbe assassinated because he is making Venezuela \"a launching pad for \ncommunist infiltration and Muslim extremism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it,\" Robertson said. \n\"It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war  and I don't think any \noil shipments will stop.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUrging the U.S. government to kill Chavez, Robertson continued, \"We \nhave the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that \nwe exercise that ability. We don't need another $200 billion war to \nget rid of one, you know, strong-arm dictator. It's a whole lot \neasier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get \nit over with.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo much for the respect for life and pro-life positions that \nRobertson has espoused. How inconsistent to fight to protect the life \nof unborn babies and then call for the assassination of a foreign \nleader who holds opposing political views.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot that Robertson or anybody else shouldn't defend the right to \nlife. Robertson should be commended for his strong support of \nright-to-life issues. But it is difficult for any thinking person not \nto see the dichotomy between his two positions.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot that Chavez is a model leader or one that many would like to see \ncontinue in office. His fiery revolutionary brand of government has \ncaused concern among political and Christian leaders throughout the \nWestern Hemisphere as he has spread instability throughout the \nregion, initiated an arms buildup with neighboring countries, \nallegedly aided Colombian guerrillas and anti-government forces other \nneighboring countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru and driven \nmuch foreign investment from his country.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut to call for his assassination? What was Robertson thinking? \nChavez may be unstable and erratic, but he is no Hitler. The German \nchurch debated long and hard before some Christians such as Dietrich \nBonhoeffer began a movement to assassinate Hitler. But that movement \nwas in desperate times, and came from within Hitler's own country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese may be difficult times in Venezuela, but they are not desperate \nas were those dark days of World War II in Europe. And Robertson is \nnot a Venezuelan. He is a U.S. citizen with a powerful television \noutreach calling for the assassination of a foreign leader from the \ncomfort of his plush office in Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is another aspect to Robertson's misguided statement. That is \nthe impact on his own evangelical brothers and sisters in Venezuela \nand throughout Latin America of his careless words, and the \ndifficulty that he may cause many evangelical missionaries in \nVenezuela.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is already enough tension between Roman Catholic and Protestant \n(evangelical) leaders in Latin America. In some parts of the \ncontinent, particularly the Andean region of South America and \nisolated parts of Mexico, violence still erupts against evangelical \nchurches, pastors and congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is also a concern for Protestant Christian workers in the \nregion. \"We could see a backlash in Venezuela against U.S. \nmissionaries,\" one missionary with a number of years experience in \nVenezuela expressed following the news of Robertson's statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nUninformed non-evangelicals and skeptical non-believers often see \nprominent spokespersons such as Robertson as broadly representative \nof evangelicalism and the evangelical church that has moved into \ntheir formerly all-Catholic neighborhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, for most evangelical Latin Americans, Robertson is not their \nspokesman, nor do his sometimes radical, insensitive positions \nrepresent those of local churches, pastors or leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nLatin American churches are raising up their own pastors and leaders \nwho strongly speak prophetic words about politics and social \nconditions in their countries. They address concerns from their own \nexperience and knowledge of their culture with biblical understanding \nand the support of their own church members.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey don't need a foreign TV evangelist calling for the assassination \nof their own leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow embarrassing!\u0014\n\u0014\nKenneth D. MacHarg is a missionary with the Latin America Mission \nserving in Costa Rica.\u0014",

    "title": "PETER, PAUL AND MARY MAGDALENE - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "PETER, PAUL, & MARY MAGDALENE\u0014\nby Bart D. Ehrman\u0014\n\u0014\nReview by Thomas R. Martin  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe history of early Christianity can seem to reveal an unfamiliar \nworld when it encompasses texts that never made it into the biblical \ncanon. No one knows the complex landscape of early Christian texts \nbetter than Bart Ehrman, and his new book offers a provocative \ninterpretation of intriguing ancient works about Christianitys \nformative era.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcavating Christianity's foundations\u0014\n\u0014\nEhrman presents the disparate, if scanty, evidence for the lives of \nthe famous early Christian leaders Peter, Paul and Mary Magdalene, \nand analyzes the many stories that later admirers told about these \niconic figures. The order of the names in his title represents an \nimplicit crescendo of importance because, he argues, Marys role \nduring Jesus death and resurrection entitles her to be called the \nfounder of Christianity. Other scholars of early Christianity may not \nagree, but Ehrman makes a case that cannot be dismissed as merely \npolitical correctness.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe argues that Peter, Paul and Mary Magdalene were Jewish apocalyptic \nthinkers, envisioning the literal end of the world soon taking place. \nThe most perplexing texts that he analyzes come from Gnostic \nliterature. Gnostics produced an amazing variety of stories about \nJesus and other prominent figures in early Christianity. The most \nastounding tales come from the branch of Gnosticism called Docetism, \nwhose doctrines postulated that the Jesus who was crucified was \neither a phantasm or a dualistic creature consisting of a divine and \na human nature, with only the human part dying on the cross. In one \ndocetic story, Jesus divine part floated in the air smiling and \nlaughing above his human part nailed to the cross. This is just one \nexample of the mind-bending weirdness that can characterize \nnon-canonical texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nA wealth of stories\u0014\n\u0014\nEhrman is above all interested in the storiessome might call them \nlegendsthat sprang up about Peter, Paul and Mary Magdalene. He \nargues that understanding these tales is an important part of \nunderstanding early Christianity itself. I second his opinion that \nlearning more about everything we know early Christians said about \nthe foundation of their new religion is indeed a required assignment \nfor anyone who wants to reach an informed judgment on what it meant \nto be a Christian then and what it means now.\u0014\n\u0014\nEhrmans sprightly style is engaging, even if sometimes he does seem \nto go a bit over the top, especially with his references to the folk \nsinging trio Peter, Paul, and Mary (who will be known only to people \nlike myself old enough to remember, however dimly, popular music in \nthe 1960s). His quotations from their songs sound almost as bizarre \nas the early Christian texts that he cites, but perhaps that was \npartly his intention. They certainly reminded me of the saying that \nthe past can be a strange place to visit, and most of all when we \nperhaps too readily think of it as being in clear continuity with the \npresent, as in the history of Christianity. This book vividly and \nusefully underscores that unsettling truism. 288 pages  6 1/8\" x \n91?4\"  10 halftones\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Bart D. Ehrman is the Chair of the Department of \nReligious Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. \nHe is the author of many books, including Lost Christianities, Truth \nand Fiction in the Da Vinci Code, and, most recently, Misquoting \nJesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER: Thomas R. Martin is Jeremiah O'Connor Professor \nof Classics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, \nMassachusetts. He is the author of Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric \nto Hellenistic Times.\u0014\n----------------\u0014\nFrom Publishers Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\nStarred Review. There is a bit of irony in the subtitle of this \nterrific book. Ehrman, chair of the Department of Religious Studies \nat UNCChapel Hill and author of several well-received volumes \nincluding Lost Scriptures and Lost Christianities, struggles with the \nvery issue of how to separate history from legend, whether it can be \ndone at all and whether it matters. He contends \"it is often easier \nto know how the past was remembered than to decide what actually \nhappened.\" By shifting focus from the tales to the tellers, Ehrman \nenters the ongoing discussion of biblical literalism and reliability, \ninsisting that we're not arriving at satisfactory answers because \nwe're not asking the right questions. Drawing widely from history, \nscripture and extra-biblical writings, he studies the many stories of \nthe lives of the first-century \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" arguing that \ninclusion of some accounts in the canon should not elevate these \ntexts above the others, some of which were accepted early on by the \nchurch but later excluded from the canon. As with his other works, \nEhrman presents his case clearly and succinctly. So, are the biblical \nstories more reliable than those outside the canon? The answer, my \nfriend, is blowin' in the wind. (May)\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\n\u0014\nBart Ehrman, author of the highly popular Truth and Fiction in The Da \nVinci Code and Lost Christianities, here takes readers on another \nengaging tour of the early Christian church, illuminating the lives \nof three of Jesus' most intriguing followers: Simon Peter, Paul of \nTarsus, and Mary\u0014\nMagdalene.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do the writings of the New Testament tell us about each of these \nkey followers of Christ? What legends have sprung up about them in \nthe centuries after their deaths? Was Paul bow-legged and bald? Was \nPeter crucified upside down? Was Mary Magdalene a prostitute? In this \nlively work,\u0014\nEhrman separates fact from fiction, presenting complicated historical \nissues in a clear and informative way and relating vivid anecdotes \nculled from the traditions of these three followers. He notes, for \ninstance, that historians are able to say with virtual certainty that \nMary, the follower of Jesus, was from the fishing village of Magdala \non the shore of the Sea of Galilee (this is confirmed by her name, \nMary Magdalene, reported in numerous independent sources); but there \nis no evidence to suggest that she was a prostitute (this legend can \nbe traced to a sermon preached by Gregory the Great five centuries \nafter her death), and little reason to think that she was married to \nJesus. Similarly, there is no historical evidence for the well-known \ntale that Peter was crucified upside down. Ehrman also argues that \nthe stories of Paul's miracle working powers as an apostle are \nlegendary accounts that celebrate his importance.\u0014\n\u0014\nA serious book but vibrantly written and leavened with many colorful \nstories, Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene will appeal to anyone \ncurious about the early Christian church and the lives of these \nimportant figures.\u0014",

    "title": "PATTON: A GENIUS FOR WAR   -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Fifty years after his death, General George C. Patton Jr. remains one \nof the most colorful, charismatic, misunderstood and controversial \nfigures ever to set foot on the battlefields of World War II. And the \nimage of the man has been not a little influenced by the 1970 film \nPatton, starring George C. Scott, in which he is portrayed as a \nswashbuckling, brash, profane, impetuous general who wore \nivory-handled pistols into battle and slapped two hospitalized \nsoldiers in Sicily. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is one of the achievements of this riveting biography that it \nreveals the complex and contradictory personality that lay behind the \nfacade. With full access to Patton's private and public papers, and \nthe cooperation of the general's family, Carlo D'Este shows us not \nonly the extrovert Patton of public perception, but also the \nintensely private Patton -- the devoted student of history, the poet, \nthe humble man very unsure of his own abilities -- who could burst \ninto tears, be charming or insulting quite unexpectedly, and the \nPatton who trained himself for greatness with a determination matched \nby no other general in the twentieth century. D'Este describes \nPatton's patrician background with its strong military heritage in \nthe Civil War on the Confederate side; his struggle to overcome \ndyslexia to get through West Point; his lifelong doubts about his own \ncourage that forced him to take reckless chances; and the enduring \nand sometimes troubled marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Beatrice \nAyer, daughter of a wealthy Boston family, who proved to be a tower \nof strength and devotion to a soldier husband who was miserable in \npeacetime. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis book also covers Patton's military career from his dramatic role \nin the 1916 campaign against Pancho Villa in northern Mexico to his \nservice in France in World War I, where he organized and led the \nfirst U.S. tank corps at Saint-Mihiel and in the Meuse-Argonne \noffensive (where he was seriously wounded), to his frequently \nbrilliant and occasionally very controversial roles during World War \nII in the fighting in North Africa, Sicily, France and Germany, where \nhe earned the reputation of being the allied general the Germans most \nfeared and respected. \u0014\n\u0014\nPatton: A Genius for War is a full-fledged portrait of an \nextraordinary American.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author\u0014\n\u0014\nCarlo D'Este is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and a highly \nregarded military historian. He is the author of four books about \nWorld War II -- Decision in Normandy, Bitter Victory: The Battle for \nSicily, 1943, World War II in the Mediterranean, and Fatal Decision: \nAnzio and the Battle for Rome.\u0014",

    "title": "PRIEST ADMITS FONDLING BUT SAYS IT'S NOT ABUSE",
    "words": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) (11/29/06) -- A priest whom former Rep. Mark \nFoley reportedly accused of molestation almost four decades ago said \nThursday that he fondled the lawmaker as a teen, but the priest said \nit wasn't abuse because Foley \"seemed to like it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Once maybe I touched him or so, but didn't, it wasn't -- because \nit's not something you call, I mean, rape or penetration or anything \nlike that you know. We were just fondling,\" Father Anthony Mercieca, \n69, said in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WPTV from his home \non the Maltese island of Gozo in the Mediterranean.\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca earlier told The Associated Press that a Florida newspaper \n\"exaggerated\" the inappropriateness of his and Foley's relationship. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He seemed to like it, you know? So it was sort of more like a \nspontaneous thing,\" Mercieca told WPTV, a West Palm Beach, Florida, \nstation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca, however, rejected the idea that he sexually abused Foley, \nsaying, \"See abuse, it's a bad word, you know, because abuse, you \nabuse someone against his will. But it involved just spontaneousness, \nyou know?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe priest also questioned the timing of Foley's allegations against \nhim, suggesting the six-term congressman only recently became \nbothered by their relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let's say it was 40 years ago, almost 40 years ago, so why bring \nthis up at this late stage?\" Mercieca asked. \"Anyway, he will \novercome it, with a psychiatrist you know. Mark is a very intelligent \nman.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca said he and the teen Foley were friends, \"almost like \nbrothers,\" and they went on trips together to the beach, rodeo and \narcade. They also went out of town together to New York and \nWashington, where they visited museums. \u0014\n\u0014\nSources close to the investigation told CNN that Foley had named \nMercieca as his abuser. \u0014\n\u0014\n'Let bygones be bygones'\u0014\nMercieca apologized to Foley but implored the former lawmaker to \nremember the fun they had together. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would say that if I offended him, I am sorry, but to remember the \ngood time we had together, you know?\" he said. \"And how really we \nenjoyed each other's company. And to let bygones be bygones. Don't \nkeep dwelling on this thing, you know?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca worked at Sacred Heart Church in Lake Worth, Florida, in the \nmid-1960s, which is about the time Foley alleged the abuse occurred, \na source said. \u0014\n\u0014\nFoley, 52, has said through attorney David Roth that he was molested \nby a priest when he was between the ages of 13 and 15, which would \nhave been between 1967 and 1969. Foley was an altar boy at Sacred \nHeart, CNN has confirmed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe allegation came after Foley resigned on September 29 as details \nof his sexually explicit instant messages to teen congressional pages \nbecame public. \u0014\n\u0014\nRoth also told reporters at the time that Foley had entered a \nrehabilitation facility for alcoholism and that he was gay. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Florida, reported Wednesday that \nMercieca -- in an interview from his island home -- conceded there \nwere encounters that Foley could perceive to be sexually \ninappropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca recalled for the newspaper massaging Foley while the teen \nwas naked, skinny-dipping with Foley at a secluded lake in Lake Worth \nand being naked in the same room with him on overnight trips, \naccording to the Herald-Tribune. \u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca also told the newspaper about an incident he couldn't \nremember because he had been taking tranquilizers when he \"was going \nthrough a nervous breakdown.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I used to take them all the time. They affected my mind a little \nbit,\" he said, according to the newspaper.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe reiterated that claim during interviews with WPTV and CNN's \"Paula \nZahn Now.\" But he told the station, \"We didn't do anything dirty \nourselves, you know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the AP, which spoke to Mercieca by phone, the priest \ncalled the Herald-Tribune article \"exaggerated\" and said his and \nFoley's relationship was not sexual.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew Doig, the Herald-Tribune reporter who interviewed Mercieca, \ntold CNN's \"American Morning\" that Mercieca acknowledged having an \ninappropriate relationship with Foley, but said there was only one \nincident that would fit Foley's allegations. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"They went skinny-dipping together, the father talked about naked \nback massages, that type of thing,\" Doig said. \"But again, nothing \nbeyond that. But he said at some point there was an incident between \nthe two of them that he blamed on tranquilizers and alcohol that \nprobably led to the moment that Mark Foley is talking about.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMercieca told Doig that he was taking the tranquilizers because he \nwas going through a nervous breakdown after moving from Brazil to \nFlorida, Doig said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He said he was having a nervous breakdown. That was pretty much what \nhe was blaming it on,\" Doig said. \"He was adamant that this was a \none-time incident. In fact, our second source close to the Foley \nfamily had described it to us before that as a one-time incident.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Seminary First Lady Compares Pill to Abortion\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n02-22-07. EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wife of a Southern Baptist seminary president says women who \noppose abortion should think twice before using birth control pills.\u0014\n\u0014\nDorothy Patterson, professor of theology in woman's studies at \nSouthwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and wife of President Paige \nPatterson, says in an article on her Web site that many women who \nbelieve life begins at conception are unaware that oral \ncontraceptives are sometimes effective by preventing a fertilized \novum from implanting, \"resulting in what is actually an early \nabortion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"While taking an oral contraceptive is certainly not equal to \npurposely getting an abortion, the ethical considerations are \nsimilar,\" she writes. \"One function of oral contraceptives is to help \nprevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. If life begins at \nconception, this function of the pill is not contraceptive but \nabortive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the percentage of times the pill actually functions that way is \ncomparatively low, from 1 percent to 10 percent, she said, it is one \nof the designed functions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Many women who take oral contraceptives do not desire to have an \nabortion,\" she wrote.  \"However, a womans choice to use the pill \ndoes introduce the possibility of this occurrence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPatterson urged Christian women to consider if \"the use of oral \ncontraceptives truly compatible with a pro-life stance.\" For many \nwomen, she said, the issue of whether to use the pill revolves around \nthe issue of convenience. \"Is mere convenience a good enough reason \nto take a drug that may terminate human life, no matter how low the \nrisk is?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond that, Patterson said, is the \"responsibility of maternity\" \nthat women fulfill.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The basic moral question is not whether or not a baby is wanted but \nwhether or not the baby was willed,\" she wrote. \"The choice or \nconsent to have intercourse is the implicit consent to bear children \nby divine fiat (i.e., Gods way of continuing the generations). The \nwoman is not a baby-making machine, but she has by nature a \nbaby-making body. Only one woman can bear a particular child, and her \ntie to that child is personal and her bonding virtually unbreakable. \nIn the rearing of that child, she has the opportunity to impart \nwithin the privacy of her family circle her own values to the child. \nTo refuse that procreative role and to throw upon society that \nnurturing responsibility is to abdicate her highest calling and \ngreatest usefulness to the Creator and to His created order. Women \nare called upon to make sacrifices; they are challenged to live \nselflessly. These sacrifices and a selfless life are essential for \nthe continuation of the generations. Women cannot shun this greatest \nresponsibility of maternity without endangering all of civilization.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPatterson blamed \"selfish whims\" of individualism and materialism \nthat believes \"things are more important than children\" for the \ndecision of many modern women to delay childbearing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In Scripture, godly women were not concerned with whether or not \nthey would receive discrimination in the marketplace but rather with \nwhether or not their wombs were barren,\" she said. \"Childlessness was \nlooked upon as an affliction, an indication of worthlessness and \ninsignificance (Gen. 29:32; 30:1). Women were not pining away, \npleading with the Almighty that they might be priests or prophets. \nThey were praying for the privilege of bearing a child. In Israel \nevery Jewish mother hoped to become the mother of the Messiah, whose \ncoming had been promised to Eve, the first mother (Gen. 3:15). \nChildren were considered a direct gift from God (Gen. 4:1; 16:2; \n17:19; 29:31; 30:22; Ruth 4:13). God has always been actively \ninvolved in fashioning the child in the womb (Ps. 139:13-18).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone, she said, suggested that a couple weigh the \"risk\" of having \na child, which God calls a \"blessing\" against the possibility of \nkilling a child, \"an act that God calls an abomination, whether in or \nout of the womb.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God's gifts are not always timed according to your preferences and \nconvenience,\" she said. \"Some short-sighted mothers and fathers \ndecide that the family or baby or the world would be better off if \nconception or birth does not occur. They refuse the grace God offers \nto fulfill His challenges and validate His promises (Mk. 10:27).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if a child is unplanned by parents, she said, it doesn't mean he \nor she isn't planned by God. Even an unplanned child, she said, can \nbe a blessing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do not feel that it is my responsibility to convince people not to \nuse the Pill,\" she concluded. \"However, I do want to provide other \nwomen with the tools necessary to make an informed decision rather \nthan one based on disinformation or ignorance. The moral issues \nsurrounding use of the pill are difficult and are noticeably more \n'gray' than many issues concerning the sanctity of human life.  In \nmatters of conscience, one must allow others grace to make their own \ndecisions before God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPatterson isn't the first influential Southern Baptist to question \nthe denomination's traditional hands-off attitude toward birth \ncontrol. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary, in 2003 termed deliberate childlessness by married couples \n\"moral rebellion\" against God's design. In a radio broadcast last \nyear, Mohler lamented a \"contraceptive mentality\" that regards \npregnancy as \"equivalent to a disease.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist leaders including Timothy George, David Dockery, \nDavid Gushee and Rick Warren signed a document with Catholic leaders \nlast fall listing birth control in a consensus statement on building \na \"culture of life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[W]hile we are not agreed on the moral permissibility of artificial \ncontraception, we recognize the sad effects of a widespread \n'contraceptive mentality' that divorces sexual love from procreation \nand views children as a burden to be avoided rather than as a gift to \nbe cherished,\" says the statement by Evangelicals and Catholics \nTogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Baptists subscribe to a \"full quiver\" movement that leaves \nfamily planning up to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years ago, while at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, \nPaige and Dorothy Patterson complained about missionaries in training \nby the International Mission Board being asked to use a breast pump \nand allow nursery workers to give bottled milk to babies while their \nmothers finished a tight schedule of training. The issue, according \nto a blogging IMB trustee who doesn't identify the Patterson's by \nname, \"was not that the mothers were not allowed to feed their \nchildren naturally, but that 'artificial' means of feeding were being \nemployed at the IMB--a method not designed by God.\" EthicsDaily.com \nconfirmed their identity with another knowledgeable source.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "PRESIDENTIAL COURAGE",
    "words": "Review by Geoffrey Wawro\u0014\n\u0014\nPresidential historian Michael Beschloss is a familiar face on \ntelevision, but also a well-known historical voice. His studies of \nLyndon Johnson, Harry Truman, and F.D.R. have looked through the \nsurface pomp of the presidency and analyzed the decision-making of \nour chief executives. Beschloss is always looking for the interplay \nof politics, money, ego, personal foibles, and true statesmanship. \nEach of the presidents he studies distributes the virtues and vices \nin different measures.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his latest book, Presidential Courage: Brave Leaders and How they \nChanged America 1789-1989, Michael Beschloss argues that the real, \nultimate test of a president is not his organization, agenda, or \npoliciesevery president has those thingsbut the courage he \ndemonstrates in a crisis. Every president comes face to face with \nburning crises or tough decisions, and the great presidents, as \ndistinct from the merely ordinary, exhibit courage in the clinch.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo make his point, Beschloss writes 36 chapters, each of them \ntreating a case of presidential courage. The book is meant to be \nexhaustive. These are the cases of courage; presidents who are left \nout can be assumed not to have been severely tested, or simply not to \nhave revealed great courage in their careers.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington exhibited tremendous courage in agreeing to the Jay \nTreaty with Great Britain in 1795. At war with Revolutionary France, \nthe British threatened war with America as well if it continued to \ntrade with France and its Caribbean islands. American nationalists \n(like Thomas Jefferson) were all for war with Britain to assert \nAmerican independence, which America had won at Yorktown a decade \nearlier, but which the British had only winked at. Washington wisely \nbraved threats and slanders to enforce the treaty, which bought a \nweak, still fragmented America time to cohere and gather its \nstrength. Beschloss considers John Adams decision to avert war with \nFrance in 1798 to have been no less courageous. The French Directory \ngovernment had seized four American envoys sent to negotiate an end \nto French depredations on American shipping. Paris demanded a ransom \nfor their return. With most of America up in arms, Adams negotiated \ninstead of fighting, reasoning, like Washington, that America needed \ntime to build power, and that an American war with France would \nmerely strengthen Britain, which was assumed to be awaiting the right \nmoment to re-conquer its lost American colonies. Beschloss applauds \nAndrew Jackson for taking on the National Bank of the United States \nand breaking its considerable powers. F.D.R. displayed remarkable \ncourage in resisting isolationist sentiment and nudging America \ntoward support of Britain and the Soviet Union in their struggle with \nNazi Germany and Imperial Japan.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany will argue with Beschloss. Some see John Adams more quiescent \nthan courageous. Beschloss applause for Harry Trumans courageous \ndecision to recognize Israel in May 1948 can as easily be viewed as a \nrather craven sell-out to intense lobbying by American Zionists and a \ndesire to capture the electoral votes of key states with large Jewish \nvoting blocs in the 1948 presidential campaign. Overall, however, \nthis is a brisk, exciting read that brings to life the key turning \npoints in American political history. \u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u0014\nMichael Beschloss is the author of eight books on American \nPresidents, including Conquerors.\u0014",

    "title": "PONDERING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY",
    "words": "Pondering Religious Liberty on Independence Day\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Ruffin\u0014\n\u0014\nAs is my custom on the Sunday before Independence Day, I preached a \nsermon about religious liberty. This year, after reflecting on Jesus' \ninstruction that we \"render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's \nand to God the things that are God's,\" I offered three lists \npertaining to religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere they are.\u0014\n\u0014\nList #1--Reasons that religious liberty should be emphasized at \nchurch:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. It is one of the freedoms that have made this country great.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. It has established a \"free market\" for religions that has produced \na remarkable and perhaps unprecedented religious vitality.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. It is the legacy of our Baptist forebears who, as a religious \nminority, were persecuted by the established churches of colonial \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Unless everybody is free, nobody is free; therefore, all people, \nregardless of their religious commitments, must be free to exercise \nthem without governmental interference.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Christian grace and love require that we care about the freedoms \nof those who are of different faiths than we are.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Who else is going to do so?\u0014\n\u0014\nList #2--Problems with the maintenance and furthering of religious \nliberty:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. There are radical secularists who want religion completely \nexpunged from public discourse.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. There are Christian fundamentalists who want government to embrace \nChristianity in inappropriate ways. There are even some Christian \nReconstructionists who seriously want to turn America into a \ntheocracy.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. There are Christian moderates who seem to think that if they just \nturn their heads everything will be OK.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. There are untold numbers of professing Christians who fail to take \nadvantage of our guaranteed freedom to worship by actually doing so \non a consistent basis.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. There are also untold numbers of professing Christians who get all \nupset about posting the Ten Commandments but who don't fret too much \nabout whether or not they are following the teachings of the Sermon \non the Mount, which offers the greatest summary of the ethics of the \nChristian life.\u0014\n\u0014\nList #3--Possibilities for the future of religious liberty:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. It is possible that Christians will press for the potentially \nidolatrous use of the Bible and prayer in public venues such as \ncourthouses and schools; such use reduces the Bible and prayer to at \nbest cultural icons and at worst good luck charms. Such trivializes \nChristian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. It is possible that improper entanglement will be avoided so that \nthe possibility will be increased that people's religious expressions \nwill be lived out in integrity and not hypocrisy.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. It is possible that Christians will work to influence our \ngovernment leaders to promote such universally helpful biblical \nprinciples as peace, liberty, and justice for all rather than to seek \nthe government's help in doing the work that is proper to the church \nand not the government, such as our work of evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. It is possible that Christians will get out into our communities, \nas we have the freedom to do, and spread the word of our Lord through \ndeed and speech, as we have the freedom to do.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Finally, it is just possible that you will exercise your God-given \nfreedom to accept Christ as your Savior today!\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Ruffin is pastor of The Hill Baptist Church in Augusta, Ga. \nThis column appeared previously on his blog.\u0014",

Tradition \nhas it that he was personally discipled by the apostle John and that \nhe was appointed as bishop of Smyrna (in modern Izmir in Turkey) by \nsome of the original apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his later years, he tried to settle disputes about the date to \ncelebrate Easter, and he confronted one of the church's most \ntroublesome heretics, the Gnostic Marcion, calling him \"the first \nborn of Satan,\" when he ran into him in Rome. Polycarp was also \nresponsible for converting many from Gnosticism. His only existing \nwriting, a pastoral letter to the church at Philippi, shows he had \nlittle formal education, and was unpretentious, humble, and direct.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch traits are especially evident in the account of his martyrdom, \nwhich was written within a year of his death. It is not clear exactly \nwhy he was suddenly, at age 86, subject to arrest, but when he heard \nRoman officials were intent on arresting him, he decided to wait for \nthem at home. Panic-stricken friends pleaded with him to flee, so to \ncalm them, he finally agreed to withdraw to a small estate outside of \ntown. But while in prayer there, he received some sort of vision. \nWhatever he saw or heard, we don't know. He simply reported to his \nfriends that he now understood, \"I must be burned alive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman soldiers eventually discovered Polycarp's whereabouts and came \nto his door. When his friends urged him to run, Polycarp replied, \n\"God's will be done,\" and he let the soldiers in.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was escorted to the local proconsul, Statius Quadratus, who \ninterrogated him in front of a crowd of curious onlookers. Polycarp \nseemed unfazed by the interrogation; he carried on a witty dialogue \nwith Quadratus until Quadratus lost his temper and threatened \nPolycarp: he'd be thrown to wild beasts, he'd be burned at the stake, \nand so on. Polycarp just told Quadratus that while the proconsul's \nfire lasts but a little while, the fires of judgment (\"reserved for \nthe ungodly,\" he slyly added) cannot be quenched. Polycarp concluded, \n\"But why do you delay? Come, do what you will.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSoldiers then grabbed him to nail him to a stake, but Polycarp \nstopped them: \"Leave me as I am. For he who grants me to endure the \nfire will enable me also to remain on the pyre unmoved, without the \nsecurity you desire from nails.\" He prayed aloud, the fire was lit, \nand his flesh was consumed. The chronicler of this martyrdom said it \nwas \"not as burning flesh but as bread baking or as gold and silver \nrefined in a furnace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe account concluded by saying that Polycarp's death was remembered \nby \"everyone\"\"he is even spoken of by the heathen in every place.\"\u0014",

    "title": "PREACHERS ARE WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR WORLD",
    "words": "THE FOLLOWING HAS MANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE \nCOMMONLY AGREED UPON BY ALL CHRISTIANS\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry Wilson 10-04-07\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Preachers,\" said Lewis Perkins, \"are what's wrong with the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI confess I have very few close friends whose vocation is the same as \nmine. Growing up, I did not like many preachers. They seemed to me \nless than genuine. When I read the Bible, I found it to be much less \nabout the afterlife and much more about the challenges and demands of \nliving life on earth than many preachers portrayed it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know about the pressures placed on ministers. Every parishioner has \nhis or her own definition of what a minister should be, and no one \ncan live up to them all. Most preachers are nice people who are, \naccording to William Willimon, \"quivering masses of availability.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the gospel demands more--the proclamation of the Kingdom of God \nthat runs counter to the world presented to us by the rich and \npowerful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church in the United States seems more concerned with success \nthan faithfulness. Following Jesus can be harmful to business. It can \nsplit a church or separate families. So pastors often cower when \nfaced with the possibility of costly discipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany pastors felt helpless when faced with the force of patriotism \nbefore the Iraq war. They knew that Jesus taught nonviolence, but \nfear and excitement caused by 9/11 made it very difficult to speak up \nfor peace. Considering their own jobs and comfort zones rather than \nthe call of the gospel or the consequences to others, many preachers \nremained silent, while others used our Lord's name in calling people \nto arms.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe consequences of this failure of faith are huge. It has been \nreported that more than 1 million people have been killed in Iraq and \nat least 4 million have been made refugees. Seventy percent of Iraqi \npeople do not have clean drinking water, and in Baghdad, a city the \nsize of Chicago where temperatures reach 120-plus degrees, there is \nalmost no electricity.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly 4,000 American soldiers have died, with many more injured \nphysically and psychologically. High divorce rates (75 percent of \nreturning soldiers) and high suicide rates are evidence of the \npainful repercussions of the inactions of people of faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the founder of our faith, does not call us to arms. He calls \nus to love for both neighbor and enemy, to radical forgiveness and to \nthe turning of our cheek. The enormous damage done to America's image \nin the world is an awful testament to the evil that is war. But the \ndamage done to the church, which remained silent while \"evil\" was \ncalled \"good,\" is much greater.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen our youth go off to college they are challenged with questions \nsuch as, \"How can you be part of a church that has been responsible \nfor so much evil--the crusades, the burning of witches, racism, \nsexism and nationalism--that leaves the deeds of one's nation \nunexamined while dehumanizing people of other nations so one feels \njustified in hurting or killing them?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the most casual reader of the gospel would realize that all \nthese actions are contrary to the Kingdom of God proclaimed by Jesus. \nWhy do we so easily fall into behaviors that are abhorrent to Jesus \nwhile declaring our undying faith in his lordship?\u0014\n\u0014\nWill Campbell said \"all institutions, every last one of them--no \nmatter the claim, no matter the purpose, no matter the stated \ngoals--exist sooner or later for their own selves, are self-loving, \nself-concerned, self-regarding, self-preserving, and are lusting for \nthe soul of all who come near them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church's institutionalization is seen in pastors saying: \"I \ncannot speak against war, because I might offend some people who are \nsoldiers. I might upset donors, and it would be wrong to hurt our \nfellowship. And don't we love the closeness of our bonds to our \nnation, our denomination and our community?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA church that offends nobody lives contrary to its Lord, who offended \nso many people that they crucified him. If Jesus is Lord of Lords and \nKing of Kings, then the church's failure to proclaim his teachings is \nrobbing people of the ultimate truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps truthful preaching could have prevented the war in Iraq, and \nthere would be money to take care of the uninsured and for education. \nIf there were more truthful preaching, maybe tax breaks that favor \nthe rich would have not passed and our society would be more \nequitable with adequate funding for Social Security and Medicare.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus walked the earth, preachers (Pharisees and Sadducees) were \nhis enemies. Times have changed, but the truth is the same--the world \ncan only be saved by love.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Those who live by the sword die by the sword.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't say that. Jesus did.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry Wilson is pastor of First Baptist Church in Biscoe, N.C\u0014",

Republicans, \nthese articles\u0014\nsay, need to return to their roots.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Well, I dont know what true conservatism is, but while \ndoing research for my forthcoming \u0014\nbook I spent a lot of time studying the history of the American \npolitical movement that calls        itself conservatism  and Bush \nhasnt strayed from the path at all. On the contrary, hes the very \nmodel of a modern movement conservative.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           For example, people claim to be shocked that Bush cut \ntaxes while waging an expensive war. But Ronald Reagan also cut taxes \nwhile embarking on a huge military buildup.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           People claim to be shocked by Bushs general fiscal \nirresponsibility. But conservative intellectuals, by their own \naccount, abandoned fiscal responsibility 30 years ago. Heres \nhow        Irving Kristol, then the editor of The Public Interest, \nexplained his embrace of supply-side        economics in the 1970s: \nHe had a rather cavalier attitude toward the budget deficit and \nother monetary or fiscal problems because the task, as I saw it, \nwas to create a new majority, which evidently would mean a \nconservative majority, which came to mean, in turn, a Republican \nmajority  so political effectiveness was the priority, not the \naccounting deficiencies of government. so thinned that the putative \ngains of contracting out have evaporated. Agencies have been left \nwith the worst of both worlds  demoralized and disorganized public \nofficials and unaccountable private contractors.\u0014\n                            \u0014\n         People claim to be shocked by the Bush administrations \ngeneral incompetence. But disinterest in good government has long \nbeen a principle of modern conservatism. In The Con        science of \na Conservative, published in 1960, Barry Goldwater wrote that I have \nlittle interest in streamlining government or making it more \nefficient, for I mean to reduce its size.\u0014\n\u0014\n         People claim to be shocked that the Bush Justice Department, \nmaking a mockery of the     Constitution, issued a secret opinion \nauthorizing torture despite instructions by Congress and the courts \nthat the practice should stop.\u0014\n                                  \u0014\n         But remember Iran/Contra? The Reagan administration secretly \nsold weapons to Iran, violating a legal embargo, and used the \nproceeds to support the Nicaraguan contras, defying an    explicit \ncongressional ban on such support. Oh, and if you think Iran/Contra \nwas a rogue  operation, rather than something done with the full \nknowledge and approval of people at the top  who were then protected \nby a careful cover-up, including convenient presidential pardonsIve \ngot a letter from Niger you might want to buy.\u0014\n           \u0014\n         People claim to be shocked at the Bush admininistrations \nefforts to disenfranchise minority groups, under the pretense of \ncombating voting fraud. But Reagan opposed the Voting Rights Act, and \nas late as 1980 he described it as humiliating to the South.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         PEOPLE CLAIM to be shocked by the way the Bush \nadministration outsourced key government functions to private \ncontractors yet refused to exert effective oversight over these \ncontractors, a process exemplified by the failed reconstruction of \nIraq and the Blackwater affair.\u0014\n          \u0014\n         But back in 1993, Jonathan Cohn, writing in The American \nProspect, explained that under Reagan and Bush, the ranks of public \nofficials necessary to supervise contractors have been\u0014\n                                \u0014\n        PEOPLE CLAIM to be shocked at the Bush administrations \nattempts  which, for a time, were all too successful  to intimidate \nthe press. But this administrations media tactics, and to a large \nextent the people implementing  those tactics, come straight out of \nthe Nixon administration. Dick Cheney wanted to search Seymour \nHershs apartment  not last week, but in 1975. Roger Ailes, the \npresident of Fox  News, was Nixons media adviser.\u0014\n        \u0014\n        People claim to be shocked by the Bush administrations \nauthoritarianism.... But their movement is\u0014\nthe same as it ever was.\u0014\n\u0014\n        People claim to be shocked at the Bush administration's \nattempts to equate dissent with treason. But Goldwater  who, like \nReagan, has been reinvented as an icon of conservative purity but was \na much less attractive figure in real life  staunchly supported \nJoseph McCarthy, and was one of only 22 senators who voted against a \nmotion censuring the demagogue.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Above all, people claim to be shocked by the Bush \nadministrations authoritarianism, its disdain for the rule of law. \nBut a full half-century has passed since National Review proclaimed \nthat the White community in the South is entitled to take such \nmeasures as are necessary to prevail, and dismissed as irrelevant \nobjections that might be raised after consulting a catalog of the \nrights of American citizens, born Equal presumably a reference to \nthe document known as the Constitution of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Now, as they survey the wreckage of their cause, \nconservatives may ask themselves:  Well, how did we get here? They \nmay tell themselves: This is not my beautiful Right.  They may ask \nthemselves: My God, what have we done?  But their movement is the \nsame as it ever was. And Bush is movement conservatisms true, loyal \nheir.\u0014\n                            \u0014\n\u0014\n     The New York Times\u0014",

    "words": "Robert Parham\u0014\n09-17-07 \u0014\n\u0014\nZainabu Sesay will die in pain in Sierra Leone from breast cancer \nthat has spread into her lymph glands. A tumor has \"burst through her \nskin, looking like a putrid head of cauliflower weeping small amounts \nof blood at its edges,\" reported the \"New York Times.\"\u0014\nShe has no access to the one cheap, legal painkiller--morphine.\u0014\n \u0014\nAn estimated 4.8 million people with cancer and 1.4 million with \n\"late-stage AIDS\" have no treatment for pain. Those suffering from \nburns, sickle-cell diseases and traffic accidents have no pain \ntreatment, either.\u0014\n\u0014\nResidents of wealthy nations--the United States, Canada, France, \nGermany, Britain and Australia--\"consume 79 percent of the world's \nmorphine,\" reported the Times. Residents in poor countries, where 80 \npercent of the global population live, consume about 6 percent of the \nmorphine. A resident in the U.S. is 17,000 times more likely to \nconsume morphine for pain treatment that a resident in Sierra Leone.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was one of those wealthy Americans. During treatment for acute \nleukemia in March 2005, I had my own morphine pump, clipped to the \nright-hand side of the bed in easy reach. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Vanderbilt Medical Center staff told me about my morphine \npump, I recall questioning that decision, raising concerns about the \naddictive nature of the medicine. The staff told me not to worry \nabout it, that I would not be able over-medicate myself. I have no \nmemory of ever using the morphine pump. I do remember telling nurses \nthat I had no pain when they asked me to rate my pain level, perhaps \nan answer with evidence that indeed the pump was in use. At some \npoint, Betsy, my wife, insisted that the staff take me off the \nmorphine.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had pain treatment. The poor in Africa do not. That reality creates \na moral conundrum, certainly for those of us who confess the \nuniversality of divinely given human worth. We can hardly utter a \nbelief in the image of God embedded in every human being and remain \ninactive about the disparity in the treatment for pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nPain is so bad among impoverished Africans, according to the Times \narticle, that some sufferers without pharmaceutical remedies take \nother remedies--\"hanging themselves or throwing themselves in front \nof trucks.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYet opium, the base ingredient for morphine, is widely available. \nMorphine is relatively inexpensive. In fact, the Times said that a \nUgandan hospice \"mixes its own liquid morphine so cheaply that a \nthree-week supply cost less than a loaf of bread.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStill morphine isn't widely used in poor nations due to the fear of \ndrug addiction and the reality of poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich nations, on the other hand, have both a drug addiction problem \nand a banquet table of pharmaceuticals. We are bombarded with drug \noptions on television and in magazines. Our email boxes fill up with \nspam promises resulting from pill popping. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe are promised solutions to every ailment--real or \nimaginary--restless-leg syndrome, acid reflux, sleep troubles, bad \nbreath, stomach aches, erectile dysfunction, male urinary problems, \ngenital herpes, cholesterol, ADHD, bipolar disorder, allergies, \nasthma, headaches, backaches. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of God's children are awash in necessary and unnecessary drugs. \nOther children of God are awash in real pain.\u0014",

I don't agree withDarwin, but I \ndidn't go out and hire a lawyer when my high school teacher taught \nhis Theory of Evolution \u0014\n\u0014\nLife, liberty or your pursuit of happiness will not be endangered \nbecause someone says a 30-second prayer before a football game. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo what' s the big deal? It's not like somebody is up there reading \nthe entire book of Acts. They're just talking to a God they believe \nin and asking him to grant safety to the players on the field and the \nfans going home from the game. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it's a Christian prayer, some will argue. \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, and this is the United States of America , a country founded on \nChristian principles. According to our very own phone book, Christian \nchurches outnumber all others better than 200-to-1. So what would you \nexpect -- somebody chanting Hare Krishna? \u0014\n\u0014\nIf I went to a football game in Jerusalem , I would expect to hear a \nJewish prayer.\u0014\nIf I went to a soccer game in Baghdad , I would expect to hear a \nMuslim prayer.\u0014\nIf I went to a ping pong match in China , I would expect to hear \nsomeone pray to Buddha.\u0014\nAnd I wouldn't be offended. \u0014\nIt wouldn't bother me one bit. \u0014\nWhen in Rome . \u0014\n\u0014\nBut what about the atheists?

One or two will tell \nthousands what they can and cannot do. I don't think a short prayer \nat a football game is going to shake the world's foundations. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristians are just sick and tired of turning the other cheek while \nour courts strip us of all our rights. Our parents and grandparents \ntaught us to pray before eating; to pray before we go to sleep. \u0014\n\u0014\nOur Bible tells us to pray without ceasing.

Passport To Life is particularly vital in that it \ndeconstructs mythologies that have arisen about the Holocaust. For \nexample, the author was personally present in Warsaw at the time the \nUprising began, and warns against characterizing it as a true \nrebellion, since it claimed the lives of very few German soldiers and \nhad zero military impact upon the course of the war. Rather, he \ncharacterizes it as a mass suicide of Jews who preferred to die from \nGerman guns rather than be sent to Treblinka. Since World War II \nthere has been a tendency to overdramatize or exaggerate Christian \nrescues of Jewish people; Tanay respects the nobility of those who \ndid so but also carefully delineates examples in which the truth is \nlost to the need to mythologize history and a few make good men into \nsaints rather than confront the overall horror of what really \nhappened. Tanay further dissects with clinical expertise the nature \nof hared itself, demonstrating that the most virulent hatreds are \nperpetrated against individuals or groups the hater knows nothing \nabout, or believes fantasies about; hatred is not borne of logic or \nreason, and therefore rationality is no defense against it. \u0014\n\u0014\nEmphasizing the critical importance of broadcasting a counter-message \nto the many widespread propaganda of hate today, including but not \nlimited to hatred against unbelievers spread within specific Islamic \nstates, Passport To Life offers the key to understanding and \nhopefully preventing worse geneocidal deprevations in the future. \nThough it deals with complex psychological issues, Passport To Life \nis written in plain terms that invite no confusion regardless of the \nreaders' level of familiarity with history or psychology. Passport To \nLife is far, far more than an autobiographical memoir. It is more \nthan a record of Holocaust atrocities. It is quite literally the \nembodiment of its title, an indispensible contribution to Holocaust \nliterature shelves and psychology shelves, and bears the absolute \nhighest recommendation to school libraries, public libraries, \nHolocaust literature collections, scholars and lay readers alike. Do \nnot pass up this book.\u0014",

    "title": "PRESIDENT LINCOLN  --  BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "One of the most insightful and illuminating books on the 16th \nPresident to appear in decades was William Lee Millers Lincolns \nVirtues, an imaginative and penetrating examination of where and how \nAbraham Lincoln developed his internal moral compass and ethics. \nMiller opened the door to the nature and origins of Lincolns own set \nof values, to what he believed and why he believed it, to his \ncharacter.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving opened that door, now in President Lincoln, The Duty of a \nStatesman, he takes us through that door and into the space where \nLincoln the man applied his virtues as Lincoln the president. How, \nMiller asks, did Lincoln perform morally as a leader, on the stage of \nstatecraft where moral challenges appear at every turn?  \u0014\n\u0014\nNaturally we would expect Miller to deal with Lincolns approach to \nthe problem of slavery, and so he does, and ably. But there were so \nmany more moral and ethical choices for him to make, instances where \nhis system of ethics equipped him to make the decisions he made. The \nLincoln who would not back down before a bully in youth became the \npresident who would not back down before the raised fists of the \nseceded states. Then in the face of humiliating defeat after the \nFirst Battle of Bull Run, he took the responsibility on himself, and \ndid so as future defeats came in train. Courage and tenacity gave him \nexactly the weapons he needed to meet the crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo did humility, or what appeared as humility. Lincoln genuinely had \nno conceit. He must have had an ego, but he also had the maturity to \nsubordinate it to his greater purposes. Thus he tolerated the slights \nand rebuffs of men like General George B. McClellan in the interest \nof getting from them their best efforts to save the Union. His \ncharity and humanity are the stuff of legend, and yet they were \ngenuine, as Miller shows in exploring Lincolns acts of amnesty among \nhis own soldiers. Just as compelling is what Lincoln felt about his \nfoemen, and his plans for pardon and amnesty for them to ease the \nburden of defeat when it came.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Miller also addresses Lincolns moments of weakness, most notably \nhis descent into doubt in the summer of 1864 when he feared that he \nwould not be re-elected and that as a result the Union might fail. \nYet even in his dark mood, Lincoln summoned the reserves of moral \nstrength to only redouble efforts to end the war before he finished \nhis first term, and in fact it would effectively end six weeks after \nthat term expired.\u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Lincoln has a few new things to say, but what is much more \nimportant is the altogether novel manner by which Miller has tied \nLincolns ethical and moral development to the execution of the task \nfor which his life had been preparation. This book should be required \nreading for every one of the presidential hopefuls now placing \nthemselves before the country in the hope of walking where Lincoln \nwalked.\u0014",

Tradition \nhas it that he was personally discipled by the apostle John and that \nhe was appointed as bishop of Smyrna (in modern Izmir in Turkey) by \nsome of the original apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his later years, he tried to settle disputes about the date to \ncelebrate Easter, and he confronted one of the church's most \ntroublesome heretics, the Gnostic Marcion, calling him \"the first \nborn of Satan,\" when he ran into him in Rome. Polycarp was also \nresponsible for converting many from Gnosticism. His only existing \nwriting, a pastoral letter to the church at Philippi, shows he had \nlittle formal education, and was unpretentious, humble, and direct.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch traits are especially evident in the account of his martyrdom, \nwhich was written within a year of his death. It is not clear exactly \nwhy he was suddenly, at age 86, subject to arrest, but when he heard \nRoman officials were intent on arresting him, he decided to wait for \nthem at home. Panic-stricken friends pleaded with him to flee, so to \ncalm them, he finally agreed to withdraw to a small estate outside of \ntown. But while in prayer there, he received some sort of vision. \nWhatever he saw or heard, we don't know. He simply reported to his \nfriends that he now understood, \"I must be burned alive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman soldiers eventually discovered Polycarp's whereabouts and came \nto his door. When his friends urged him to run, Polycarp replied, \n\"God's will be done,\" and he let the soldiers in.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was escorted to the local proconsul, Statius Quadratus, who \ninterrogated him in front of a crowd of curious onlookers. Polycarp \nseemed unfazed by the interrogation; he carried on a witty dialogue \nwith Quadratus until Quadratus lost his temper and threatened \nPolycarp: he'd be thrown to wild beasts, he'd be burned at the stake, \nand so on. Polycarp just told Quadratus that while the proconsul's \nfire lasts but a little while, the fires of judgment (\"reserved for \nthe ungodly,\" he slyly added) cannot be quenched. Polycarp concluded, \n\"But why do you delay? Come, do what you will.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSoldiers then grabbed him to nail him to a stake, but Polycarp \nstopped them: \"Leave me as I am. For he who grants me to endure the \nfire will enable me also to remain on the pyre unmoved, without the \nsecurity you desire from nails.\" He prayed aloud, the fire was lit, \nand his flesh was consumed. The chronicler of this martyrdom said it \nwas \"not as burning flesh but as bread baking or as gold and silver \nrefined in a furnace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe account concluded by saying that Polycarp's death was remembered \nby \"everyone\"\"he is even spoken of by the heathen in every place.\"\u0014",

As the passengers were filing in \nand taking their seats she called a member of the cabin crew to ask \nabout her seating. \"What seems to be the matter, madam?\" asked the \nattendant. Can't you see?\" the woman responded. \"You have assigned me \na seat next to a kaffir (a pejorative word referring to a native \nblack African). I cannot possibly sit next to this disgusting human \nbeing. Please find me another seat as soon as possible!\" The cabin \nattendant, hearing the words and observing the commotion that was \nclearly stirring among other passengers, commented, \"Please calm \ndown, madam. The flight is very full today but I will do what I can. \nI will go and check on availability of seats in business or first \nclasses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile the woman, with a scowl on her face, looked at the outraged \nblack man beside her, not to mention many of the surrounding \npassengers. A few minutes later the stewardess returned with good \nnews that she delivered to the woman, who continued to look at her \nfellow passengers with a smug and self-satisfied grin. The flight \nattendant told the woman, \"Madam, unfortunately, as I suspected \neconomy is full. I have spoken to the cabin services director and \nbusiness class is also full. However, we do have one seat in first \nclass.\" Before the woman had a chance to answer, the flight attendant \ncontinued, \"It is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade; I \nneeded to receive special permission from the captain. But, given the \ncircumstances, the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone \nbe forced to sit next to such an obnoxious person.\" With that the \nflight attendant turned to the black man sitting next to the woman \nand said, \"So if you would like to gather your things, sir, I have \nyour seat ready for you.\" At that point, the surrounding passengers \nstood and gave a standing ovation as the black man walked \ntriumphantly into first class.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis little story depicts how arrogance places one in darkness, in \nthis case the darkness of ignorance, but light is found in the \nability to humble oneself.\u0014",

It's not likely that a pithy quote like this \nwould have been missed by his earliest disciples.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, in his day, Francis was known as much for his preaching as \nfor his lifestyle.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe began preaching early in his ministry, first in the Assisi church \nof Saint George, in which he had gone to school as a child, and later \nin the cathedral of Saint Rufinus.

In 1932 the times were hard for \nDorsey. Just trying to survive the depression years as a working \nmusician meant tough sledding. On top of that, his music was not \naccepted by many people. Some said it was much too worldlythe \ndevil's music, they called it. Many years later Dorsey could laugh \nabout it. He said, I got kicked out of some of the best churches in \nthe land. But the real kick in the teeth came one night in St. Louis \nwhen he received a telegram informing him that his pregnant wife had \ndied suddenly. Dorsey was so filled with grief that his faith was \nshaken to the roots, but instead of wallowing in self-pity, he turned \nto the discipline he knew bestmusic. In the midst of agony he wrote \nthe following lyrics:\u0014\n\u0014\nPrecious Lord, take my hand,\u0014\nLead me on, let me stand.\u0014\nI am tired, I am weak, I am worn.\u0014\nThrough the storm, through the night,\u0014\nLead me on to the light;\u0014\nTake my hand precious Lord, lead me home.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you live long enough, you will experience heartache, \ndisappointment, and sheer helplessness. The Lord is our most precious \nresource in those hours of trauma. ?The Lord is a refuge for the \noppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble (Ps. 9:9). Tom Dorsey \nunderstood that. His song was originally written as a way of coping \nwith his personal pain, but even today it continues to bless \nthousands of others when they pass through times of hardship.\u0014",

On July 29, \n1836, Phoebe rocked her beloved 11-month-old daughter Eliza to sleep \nand placed her in her crib before retiring to her own room. Soon \nafter, Phoebe heard screaming from the nursery and came running. A \ncareless helper had tried to refill an oil lamp without putting it \nout. When the flames shot up, she had thrown the lamp away from her. \nIt had landed in the crib, splashing burning oil all over the child. \nStricken, Phoebe cradled the infant in her arms. Within hours, Eliza \nwas dead. \u0014\n\u0014\nPhoebe paced the floor, filled with anger and grief. This was the \nthird of her children to die in infancy. She cried out in anguish to \nGod and heard an answer that, though it seems harsh, brought her \ncomfort: God had taken her children because she had loved them too \nmuch and was spending too much time on them. \"No other gods before \nme\" was his command. At that moment, she resolved that she would \nsurrender to God everything she held dear. She wrote in her diary: \n\"Never before have I felt such a deadness to the world, and my \naffections so fixed on things above.

    "title": "PASTOR'S VIDEO INSINUATES OBAMA IS THE ANTICHRIST",
    "words": "What's harder than finding a needle in a haystack? \u0014\n\u0014\nProving there isn't one.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1997 Michael Drosnin created a sensation with \"The Bible Code.\" \nThe book claimed that evenly spaced letter sequences in the part of \nthe Hebrew Scripture known as the Torah  the books of Genesis \nthrough Deuteronomy  predicted future events like World War II and \nthe Kennedy assassination. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few years later, a team of statisticians produced a definitive \nrefutation of \"The Bible Code\" in a dense journal article. The Torah \nwas Drosnin's haystack; his purported code was the needle. To prove \nthere was no hidden code took a long time and a lot of work.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pastor named Carl Gallups of Hickory Hammock Baptist Church in \nMilton, Fla., has produced a video claiming that Barack Obama is the \nAntichrist. The end product of his chain of reasoning is that when \nJesus said in Luke 10:18, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from the \nheavens,\" the phrase \"lightning from the heavens\" in Aramaic would \nhave been the sound of \"Barack Obama.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe video uses a smattering of Hebrew hocus pocus, with references to \nStrong's Hebrew Concordance to make it sound official. Its \ninaccuracies are numerous. Even if Jesus' words, translated back into \nAramaic, did sound anything like \"Barack Obama,\" I would take this as \na meaningless coincidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most obvious non-linguistic mistake is the confusion of the \n\"antichrist\" with Satan. The only references in the Bible to \n\"antichrist\" are in the epistles of 1 John and 2 John. These texts \ndescribe a human being, not a supernatural being. In the New \nTestament, Satan is consistently treated as a supernatural being. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe linguistic argument takes advantage of a point of potential \nconfusion. The Hebrew and Aramaic word for \"lightning\" would \ntypically be transliterated as \"baraq.\" It is pronounced just like \nBarack Obama says his first name. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Barack Obama's first name is actually related to a different \nHebrew word, which would be transliterated as \"barak\" and means \n\"bless.\" This root word is common to many Semitic languages, \nincluding Arabic, which is why Barack Obama's Muslim grandfather gave \nthe name to his son, Barack Obama's father, who passed it on to him. \nThe problem with this word in this form is that it does not sound \nlike his first name. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe letter represented by the \"k\" in this form of the word would \nproduce more of a soft, scraping \"k\" sound, rather than the hard \"k\" \nwith which Barack Obama pronounces his name. While his first name \nmeans \"bless,\" not \"lightning,\" the word for lightning is closer in \nsound to the pronunciation of his name. One of the few things the \nvideo gets right is that if Jesus said this particular Aramaic word \nfor \"lightning,\" then it would have sounded like Barack Obama's first \nname, but this is a coincidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe argument concerning Barack Obama's last name does not even have \nthis thin veneer of truth. It makes use of the Hebrew word \"bamah,\" \nwhich means \"height\" or \"hill\" or \"mound.\" This is where the video's \ndeceptive shift away from Aramaic to Hebrew is most important. \u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in the narration, it rightly claims that Jesus probably spoke \nin Aramaic, but half a minute into the four-minute video, Aramaic is \nmentioned for the last time. The argument is entirely about Hebrew \nafter that. This was necessary because, while Hebrew and Aramaic are \nclosely related languages, Aramaic does not use the word \"bamah\" in \nthe same way that Hebrew does. \u0014\n\u0014\nAramaic occasionally uses the word \"bamah\" for a \"high place,\" but it \nis not the word that the Aramaic translation of Isaiah, from around \nthe time of Jesus, uses for \"heights\" in Isaiah 14:14. In Hebrew, \nIsaiah 14:14 does refer to the \"heights of a cloud,\" using \"bamah,\" \nbut the most logical interpretation of this phrase is that clouds \nappear to have mounds or hills just like the earth does, and this \nrefers to a high spot on a cloud. \u0014\n\u0014\nWorse yet, the Greek word that Luke 10:18 uses for \"heaven\" is the \ncommon \"ouranos.\" If there was a Hebrew saying of Jesus in the \nbackground of this, it would have used the word \"shamayim\" for \n\"heaven(s).\" An Aramaic saying would most likely have used the \nrelated word \"shemayin,\" or possibly \"rum.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe video's use of the Hebrew conjunction to produce the first \nsyllable in Barack Obama's last name is pure hocus pocus. The Hebrew \nand Aramaic conjunction \"from\" is \"min.\" The saying in Luke 10:18 \nuses the consistent Greek equivalent \"ek.\" Replacing this with the \nHebrew conjunction, which can be pronounced on the front of a word as \n\"u\" but never \"o,\" makes no sense whatsoever.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one further theological problem with this reconstruction of \nJesus' saying in Luke 10:18. All 21 uses of the word \"baraq,\" or \n\"lightning,\" in the Hebrew Scripture associate it with God: as part \nof a theophanic vision (Exodus 19:16 and Ezekiel 1:13), as a tool \nused in creation (Psalm 77:19 and Job 38:35) or as God's flaming \nsword of judgment against enemies (Deuteronomy 32:14 and Ezekiel \n21:15). \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not surprising that ancient people, who had no concept of \nelectrical charges, would have seen lightning as the flashing sword \nof a god. For Jesus to have used this word to talk about Satan seems \nunlikely. This would have been an attribution of godlike power to \nSatan, not a description of his downfall.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus had said the words that sound like \"Barack Obama\" or \"Barack \nUbama,\" his listeners who understood Hebrew would have understood him \nto be saying something like \"I saw Satan fall like lightning and a \nhill.\" Those who understood Aramaic, but not Hebrew, might have heard \nsomething close to the same thing, or they might not have understood \nhim at all. If Jesus said something in Hebrew or Aramaic that meant \n\"lightning from the heavens,\" it would have sounded more like \"Baraq \nmin hashamayim (or hashamayin),\" but even this is problematic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis video ends with an insidious lie: \"Disclaimer: This film is not \nto declare that BHO is the antichrist. It is only a statement of fact \nconcerning the use of certain Hebrew words in relation to the words \nof Jesus. The correlations are striking. Thus, the production of the \nfilm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe video has presented one or two facts, combined with many \nfalsehoods and half-truths. Those involved in making it are guilty of \nbearing false witness against their neighbors. I suspect these people \ndo not like Barack Obama and they disagree with some or all of his \npolicies, which is fine. Perhaps they can use this disagreement as a \njustification to violate one of the Ten Commandments and bear false \nwitness against him, as they have done by claiming Luke 10:18 \nidentifies him as Satan or the Antichrist. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut claiming that somebody said something they did not say is also \nbearing false witness, so those who made this video, and anyone who \nuses or distributes it without naming it as a lie, is bearing false \nwitness against Jesus, too. I might also add that only cowards build \nan argument, claim the absolute truth of all its premises and its \nreasoning, then refuse to stand by its conclusions.\u0014\n\u0014\nReturning to haystacks that may or may not contain needles, I cannot \nprove that Jesus never said anything bad about Barack Obama. I can \nonly refute one false claim at a time, as I have done with this one. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I do know is that Jesus said things like \"Love your enemies,\" \n\"Love your neighbor as yourself\" and \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\" \nThis is the \"hay\" of what Jesus taught us. Why don't we make some \nprogress on those things before we start looking for imaginary \nneedles?\u0014\n\u0014\nMark McEntire is associate professor in the School of Religion at \nBelmont University in Nashville, Tenn.\u0014",

    "words": "Polycarp - A Father of the Christian Church\u0014\n\u0014\nPolycarp is a celebrated figure in the history of Christianity. A \ndirect pupil of the apostle John, Polycarp lived between 70 and 155 \nA.D., connecting him to both the biblical apostles and the age of the \nearly church fathers. Several ancient sources document the \ncontributions of Polycarp to Christianity, including his letters \nwritten to the church at Philippi, in which he encourages the members \nto remain strong in their faith and to flee from materialism. He also \ninstructs the members in the proper handling of financial dishonesty \nthat was creeping into the church. Polycarp served as the bishop of \nthe church at Smyrna (modern day Izmir), and was recognized as one of \nthe early combatants of Christian heresies. He rejected the teachings \nof Marcion, an influential heretic who tried to create a \"new brand\" \nof Christianity by redefining God and rejecting Old Testament \nteachings. In his well-known thesis, Polycarp combats Gnostic \nheresies that were beginning to spread throughout the Christian \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolycarp - A Martyr for Truth\u0014\nPolycarp's greatest contribution to Christianity may be his martyred \ndeath. His martyrdom stands as one of the most well documented events \nof antiquity. The emperors of Rome had unleashed bitter attacks \nagainst the Christians during this period, and members of the early \nchurch recorded many of the persecutions and deaths. Polycarp was \narrested on the charge of being a Christian -- a member of a \npolitically dangerous cult whose rapid growth needed to be stopped. \nAmidst an angry mob, the Roman proconsul took pity on such a gentle \nold man and urged Polycarp to proclaim, \"Caesar is Lord\". If only \nPolycarp would make this declaration and offer a small pinch of \nincense to Caesar's statue he would escape torture and death. To this \nPolycarp responded, \"Eighty-six years I have served Christ, and He \nnever did me any wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?\" \nSteadfast in his stand for Christ, Polycarp refused to compromise his \nbeliefs, and thus, was burned alive at the stake.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nThis is the rejection portion of the acclaim and rejection drama \ncomposed by the Lukan writer to present the principal motifs of the \nThird Gospel and of Acts. The violent reaction of the men of the \nsynagogue in Jesus' hometown is almost certainly somewhat of an \nexaggeration and of an anachronism. This story about the vicious \nwrath of all of the men of the synagogue and their abortive attempts \nto lynch and to kill Jesus (and on the Sabbath!) is much more likely \na Lukan composition late in the first century CE than it is the \nreporting of an historical occurrence from the time of the Jesus of \nhistory. After the atrocities committed by Christians against Jews \nduring the Christian Crusades, after the abuse and execution of Jews \nordered by the Christian Inquisition courts, after the horrendous \npogroms in Eastern Europe during which over a period of several \ncenturies more than six million Jews were killed, and after the death \nof an additional more than six million Jews in lands dominated by \nChristians during the Holocaust, as inspired people within the Church \ntoday it is unconscionable for us to include Luke 4:28-30 in our \nlectionaries and to read these three verses during our worship \nservices.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who included Luke 4:28-30 in the Roman Catholic three year \nlectionary commissioned by Vatican II and used within the Lutheran \nand Common lectionaries derived from the Roman Catholic lectionary, \nand those who continued to include verses 28-30 in The Revised Common \nLectionary were inexcusably insensitive. Those during the first few \ncenturies of the early Church who through usage and decree accepted \nLuke 4:28-30 and similar materials into the New Testament canon were \ncallous. The Lukan writer who composed Luke 4:28-30 was guided by \nthat writer's own anti-Jewish bias and prejudice and as a result \nperpetrated much greater violence against the Jesus of history than \ndid the fictitious people of the synagogue in Nazareth created to be \ncharacters in this story. As inspired people in the Church today, we \nmust not perpetuate the destructive polemic of texts such as Luke \n4:28-30 by continuing to include them in our lectionary. We are well \naware that when we speak out against the reading of texts such as \nLuke 4:28-30 within our congregations we will be attacked and \ncondemned by well-meaning traditionalists within the Church who will \nsay that we must not object to these verses, because what is written \nin Luke 4:28-30 \"is what those Jews did to our Jesus.\" We are fully \naware that we are speaking against material that has been perceived \nas a part of the \"Word of God\" within our Christian tradition for \nmany centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, we speak because, like Jeremiah, we are called and \ncompelled by God to do so; we cannot be silent. We speak for the sake \nof our children and for the sake of the children of others. We cannot \ncontinue to be silent bystanders and spectators. We, along with the \nwriter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, consider the Word of God to be \nliving and active, sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing to the \nevery essence of our being. The Word of God is an excellent sword, \nbut we are aware that there are serious \"nicks\" in that sword. We \nmust, therefore, appeal beyond canonical scripture and tradition \ndirectly to God. We must appeal because we believe in God, not in the \nBible as if it were God, and not in the Church as if it were God, and \nbecause we perceive that God is \"a consuming fire\" to whom we are \nultimately accountable.\u0014",

    "title": "PANDITA RAMABAI, INDIAN REFORMER",
    "words": "Pandita Ramabai (23 April 1858, Maharashtra- 5 April 1922) was an \neminent Indian Christian social reformer and activist.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a poet, a scholar, and a champion of improvement in the \nplight of Indian women. As a social reformer, she championed the \ncause of emancipation of Indian women. A widely traveled lady, she \nvisited most parts of India, and even went to England (1883) and the \nU.S. (1886-88). She wrote many books including her widely popular \nwork titled The High Caste Hindu Woman, which showed the darkest of \nsubject matter relating to the life of Hindu women, including child \nbrides and the treatment they receive by the government. She had a \nstrong view of what should be accomplished so women would be able to \nhave more freedom, including protection of widowed women and child \nbrides and she was also against the practice of suttee.\u0014\n\u0014\nPandita Ramabai was born into an intellectual Brahmin family. Her \nfather believed that women should have an education and against \ntraditional Hindu social structure he taught Ramabai as well as his \nsecond wife, Ramambais mother Puranic and how to read and write \nSanskrit. As well as how to interpret vedic texts. She was raised by \nher father Anant Shastri Dongre and her mother Lakshmibai. Her father \nwas a scholar of Sanskrit, and her mother was educated as well. They \nwere a Chitpawan Brahmin couple. Through her childhood Ramabai proved \nto be a dedicated student and a good learner. In her book \"The \nHigh-Caste Hindu Women\" she writes that less than one percent of \nHindu women were educated and able to read or write. Her education \nwas of such importance to her father that he went against tradition \nand didnt arrange her marriage at a young age like most Hindu girls. \nHer father, mother and sister died of starvation during the famine of \n1874-76, and her brother and she traveled around and eventually ended \nup in Calcutta. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter her brother's death in 1880, even though it was considered \ninappropriate for a Hindu to marry into a lower caste, she married, \non November 13, 1880, Babu Bipin Behari Medhavi, a Bengali lawyer at \nBankipore (Patna, Bihar), who was not a Brahmin. Six months after the \nbirth of their daughter, Babu died, and Pandita was once again left \nwith just one family member.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe received a scholarship to study in England, although she waited \nuntil she sold her first book Stree Dharma-Neeti to pay her way \nthere. Many believed that Ramabai being in England instead of in \nIndia jeopardized her power as an Indian reformer. However, Ramabai \nrefused to do anything that was not satisfactory to her mind. She \nbelieved that it was important that Indians remain recalcitrant \ntowards the British colonization in the sub-continent in order to \nmaintain their rich culture. During her time in England, she \nconverted to Christianity and interestingly did not ever lose sight \nof her goals for the social system in India. She clung to her roots \nand when she returned to India she helped put up Christian Churches \nwhich had Sanskrit writing instead of traditional Latin which was \nused in England. Ramabai attempted to combine her new Christian \nideals with her old Indian Culture and used this mix to promote \nchange in India. Being raised as in the Brahman caste made her \nuniquely able to bring both men and women to Christianity due to the \ncastes image as social leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to her writing she founded the Arya Mahila Sabha in 1881, \nthe very first Indian feminist organization. She studied as well as \ntaught about the issues which surround Indian women especially those \ninvolved in the Hindu traditions. She spoke against women who were \nforced to marry young and/or widowed young and wrote about the \nstruggle involved in their lives; The widow must wear a single \ncoarse garment, white, red, or brown. She must eat only one meal \nduring the twenty-four hours of a day. She must never take part in \nfamily feasts and jubilees, with others. She must not show herself to \npeople on auspicious occasions. A man or woman thinks it unlucky to \nbehold a widows face before seeing any other object in the morning. \nA man will postpone his journey if his path happens to be crossed by \na widow(Hazard p22)\u0014",

His \nsuperior, Prelate Josef Obermaier, resigned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was three days after the church acknowledged that the Pope, then \nArchbishop Joseph Ratzinger, had responded to early accusations of \nmolestation by letting the priest move to Munich for therapy in 1980.\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of victims have come forward in recent months in Germany \nwith accounts of sexual and other physical abuse from decades past. \nBut no case has captured public attention like that of Father \nHullermann, not only because of the involvement of the future pope \nbut also because the child molester was allowed to continue to work \nwith altar boys and girls for decades after his conviction.\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Benedict not only served as the archbishop of the diocese where \nthe priest worked, but also later as the cardinal in charge of \nreviewing sex-abuse cases for the Vatican. Yet until the archdiocese \nof Munich and Freising said that Father Hullermann had been \nsuspended, he continued to serve in a series of Bavarian parishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1980 the future pope reviewed the case of Father Hullermann, who \nwas accused of abusing boys in the diocese of Essen, including \nforcing an 11-year-old boy to perform oral sex.

    "words": "WE LEARN THROUGH \nOUR SENSES\u0014\n\u0014\nInvolving our senses is not only important in worship but also in \npreaching. Studies about how\u0014\npeople learn and studies about how people communicate have both \nconfirmed that there are basically three groups ofpeople, with ranges \nof intensity within each group. The first group learns primarily \nthrough sight. Their communication will often include such words or \nphrases as: show, look, see, picture this, watch, observe, perceive. \nThey want God's vision for their life. About 60% of the population is \nvisually oriented in both learning and communication\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second group learns primarily through hearing. Their \ncommunication will often include such words or phrases as: tell, \nknow, hear, harmony, listen, clear as a bell, sounds good to me, \nrings true. They are concerned about hearing God's call, hearing \nGod's word for their life. About 30% ofthe population is aurally \noriented in both their learning and communication.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third group learns primarily through feeling, both kinesthetic \nand emotionaL Their communication will often include such kinesthetic \nwords or phrases as: feel, grasp, point out, sense, and words that \nexpress emotions such as: joy, anger, fear, annoyance, gladness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are concerned with sensing God's presence, feeling God's peace \nin their hearts. About 10%\u0014\nof the population is kinesthetically and emotionally oriented in both \ntheir learning and communication. A reading specialist was able to \nhelp a highly kinesthetic child learn to read by having her first \nlearn her letters by tracing them in a tray of sand and later learn \nwords by tracing the words in the sand. Learning through the sense of \ntouch in her hands broke open the symbolism and mystery of reading \nfor this child.\u0014\n\u0014\nRepresentatives of each ofthese groups are present in our \ncongregations. The good preacher will include allusions in each \nsermon to \"seeing,\" to \"hearing,\" and to \"experiencing.\" But what is \nmore, the good preacher will use descriptive adjectives for seeing, \nfor hearing, and for feeling in the imaginative retelling of the \nscriptural text or in the illustrative material.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe preacher, using his or her imagination, may ask these \nrepresentative questions:\u0014\n\u0014\n1) What do I see? What colors? What shapes? What plays of light, \nshadow and bright? What is the speed of the action? Is it slow and \ndeliberate or fastand quick?\u0014\n\u0014\n2) What do I hear? What sounds? What is their volume? How loud, how \nsoft? Are the sounds pleasant, harmonious or are they a grating \ncacophony?\u0014\n\u0014\n3) What do I feel? What are the textures? Are they rough or smooth? \nAre they hard or soft? What is the weight? Is it light or heavy? Is \nit flexible or stiff?\u0014\n\u0014\nMarian Y.

They shared a \ncommon language and, in large degree, a common culturebut not a \ncommon name. They were called Keltoi or Galatians by the Greeks and \nGauls or the Galli by the Romans, who thought of them as a brutal, \nmilitaristic people.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe that's because Rome, and Julius Caesar in particular, spent a \nlot of money and men repelling their incessant attacks (recorded in \none of the most famous Latin works, Caesar's commentary on the Gallic \nWars).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Romans finally proved victorious, the Celts retreated to \nwhat was then considered the edge of civilization: areas we now \u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick, the Catholic patron saint of the Irish, was so designated as \na result of popular devotion and long-standing custom, not an \nofficial canonization process. (The Roman Catholic church has made \nofficial designation of relatively few patrons.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, Patrick wasn't Irish but came to Celtic Ireland as a British \nmissionary. He so loved the Irish, though, by the end of his life, he \noften made himself one, saying \"We have been born in Ireland.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, did Patrick really use the shamrock to explain the Trinity \nto the Irish? It is impossible to know historically if he did or \ndidn't.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoston Keltics? \u0014\n\u0014\nToday Celtic language and culture are still alive in such places as \nWales, Ireland, and Scotland.

    "words": "No longer is John 3:16  \"For God so loved the world that he gave his \none and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but \nhave eternal life\"  the most quoted Bible verse.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's been replaced by Jeremiah 29:11  \"'For I know the plans I have \nfor you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm \nyou, plans to give you hope and a future.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis notion that God desires us to be wealthy is not new. \"It has \nbeen the warp and woof of the American soul since the Puritans came \nover with their divine enlightenment and Calvinistic work ethic,\" \nsaid Michael Spencer, a biblical scholar and the author behind \nInternetMonk.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpencer is one of the prosperity gospel's most vocal critics. The \nprosperity gospel maintains that God wants us to have bigger homes, \nbetter cars, that job promotion and better health. It is most often \nlinked to the Word of Faith movement and to its leaders: Kenneth \nHagin, Kenneth Copeland, Oral Roberts and now America's most popular \npreacher, Joel Osteen. Osteen urges his followers to \"expect God's \nfavor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSpencer says the prosperity gospel takes its purest form here in \nAmerica: \"It is deeply wound up in who we are and far more mainstream \nthan Joel Osteen. I grew up hearing my entire life that if you tithe, \nGod will pay all your bills.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLike most TV evangelists, Robertson preaches the \"law of \nreciprocity\": give money to God and he's going to give it back to you \n10 times over. Embedded in this theology, however, is the misguided \nbelief that material goodies come our way because we've been faithful \nto God. And if bad things are happening? Then, we need to straighten \nup, fly right and return to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Robertson has done in the name of Jesus is deplorable. But \nperhaps even more troubling is the insidious ways in which all of us \ncontinue to buy into this notion that God loves Americans best and \nthat we are the people who honor him most, which is why we are so \nrich, so beautiful, so smart and so immune to the sorts of disasters \ndecimating other \"pagan\" people.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it's true that having money can inoculate a people and a nation \nagainst some diseases and some disasters, wealth should never be \nconsidered proof of God's love or favor toward a people or a country. \nNor should it be the standard by which we judge  or misjudge  a \npeople or a nation's devotion toward God.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we would all do well to remember the one thing Jesus did \npromise us: \"In this world, there will be trouble\" (John 16:33).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question for believers and unbelievers alike is not why there is \ntrouble, but what are we doing to help alleviate the suffering it \ncreates?\u0014",

    "title": "PAINFUL COUNCIL MET AT EPHESUS",
    "words": "The Third Ecumenical Council opened on this day June 22, 431 in the \ncity of Ephesus in Asia Minor. It was called to resolve a dogmatic \ncontroversy that had divided the church into two main camps. Theodore \nof Mopsuestia, supported by Nestorius, Archbishop of Constantinople, \nheld to what has become known as the Nestorian heresy. The opposite \ncamp was represented by Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, the pope, \nand emperor Theodosius the Younger. Theodosius, who called the \nCouncil, believed that the strength of his empire depended upon true \nworship of God without the intermingling of falsehood. Two hundred \nfathers attended.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nestorian teaching originated in the school of Antioch, and was \ntaught by Diodorus and by Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia. What was \nthe heresy? These men did not accept the Orthodox belief that the \nhuman and divine natures of Christ were united from the instant of \nthe Word's conception in the womb of Mary. A symbol of this \ncontroversy was the acceptance or non-acceptance of the title, \n\"Theotokos,\" or \"God Bearer,\" translated in the West to \"Mother of \nGod,\" for the Virgin Mary. Of course that did not mean that Mary was \nthe Mother of the eternal and indivisible Trinity, but that she was \nthe mother, not just of the man Christ, but of the complete God-man. \nIt was and remains in the Orthodox world as a title intended to \nemphasize the union of the two natures. But the term \"God-bearer\" is \nalso used for saints in the Orthodox church, such as the \"God-bearing \nFathers,\" meaning those who lived Christ-like lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius verbally and in writing refused to accept the title \nTheotokos (God-bearer) for Mary, the mother of Jesus. In doing so, \nthe rest of the church felt he he was proclaiming his refusal to \naccept the two natures of Christ. He was embittered by the refusal of \nthe \"other side\" to agree with his teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has been pointed out many times that there was competition -- \nsometimes fierce -- between Alexandria and Constantinople. Alexandria \nwanted a Patriarch who would understand the needs of the African \nChurch and listen to her theologians. They were very unhappy with \nNestorius. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council opened under Cyril, a thoroughly unsympathetic figure, \nand a master of political intrigue. He had the agreement of Pope \nCelestine (who was deceased by the time the council began). Cyril was \nno believer in fair play. He opened the proceedings before Nestorius \nand his supporters arrived. For this and other actions, historians \ncriticize Cyril of high-handedness; and of serving as both accuser \nand judge. But Cyril seems to have truly believed Nestorius was \nteaching heresy. In response he adopted a position of his own which \nwas close to the monophysite heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nA careful reading of Nestorius has led some scholars to say he was no \nheretic. Certainly he set out to ensure that the manhood of Christ \nwas not lost in his deity, and eventually, grudgingly allowed the \nterm \"Theotokos\" to be used as long as it was understood Mary did not \nthereby become a deity. Whatever the faults of Cyril's approach, he \nand his camp believed that Nestorianism attacked a basic dogma of the \nChurch -- the very nature of Christ himself. They reacted fiercely, \nin the strongest way they knew how.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S. Lives of the Saints.

Truett (1867-1944)\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Truett grew up on a farm in the North Carolina highlands, \nsplitting rails, cutting logs, and sharing the other hard work with \nhis father and brothers. One day while taking salt to cattle in a \npasture, he barely escaped the fangs of a huge rattlesnake coiled in \nhis path. In 1885 he graduated from Hayesville Academy and began \nteaching in a one-room school in Towns County, Georgia. At 19, in \nresponse to an evangelistic appeal in a Baptist church near his home, \nhe came forward and accepted Christ as his personal savior. \u0014\n\u0014\nTruett founded Hiawassee Academy in Georgia. He was only 32 when the \nGeorgia Baptist Convention listened to his plea for support of \nmountain schools. In 1889 he moved to Whitewright, Texas, where the \nBaptists convinced him he should accept ordination to pastoral \nministry. He graduated from Baylor University in 1897 and became the \npastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas. His ministry led the church \nin significant growth. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in 1902, he held an annual gospel roundup among the \nmountain cowboys of West Texas. Many made commitments to Christ. \nDuring Truett's ministry to American soldiers in World War I, he \nconcluded strenuous days by resting in barns and abandoned trenches. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 16, 1920, Truett stood on the steps of the United States \nCapitol and memorably described the Baptist stand on religious \nliberty, both enlightening and inspiring the large crowd. Southern \nBaptists elected him three times to lead their convention. In 1934 he \nwas elected president of the Baptist World Alliance. This Baptist \nleader is remembered for his stirring declaration of the freedom of \nthe individual before God and support for separation of church and \nstate: \"Each one must believe for himself, repent for himself, be \nbaptized for himself, answer to God for himself.\"\u0014",

    "title": "PUTTING THE SERMON IN TERMS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND",
    "words": "Sometimes a preacher merely translates the principle into terms that \na congregation understands.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn our American frontier days, there was a settlement in the west \nwhose citizens were engaged in the lumber business. The town felt \nthey wanted a church. They built a building and called a minister. \nThe preacher moved into the settlement and initially was \nwell-received. Then one afternoon he happened to see some of his \nparishioners dragging some logs, which had been floated down the \nriver from another village upstream, onto the bank. Each log was \nmarked with the owner's stamp on one end. To his great distress, the \nminister saw his members pulling in the logs and sawing off the end \nwhere the telltale stamp appeared. The following Sunday he preached a \nstrong sermon on the commandment \"Thou shalt not steal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the close of the service, his people lined up and offered \nenthusiastic congratulations. \"Wonderful message, Pastor.\" \"Mighty \nfine preaching.\" The response bothered him a great deal. So he went \nhome to prepare his sermon for the following Sunday. He preached the \nsame sermon but gave it a different ending: \"And thou shalt not cut \noff the end of thy neighbor's logs.\" When he got through, the \ncongregation ran him out of town.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's possible to state the principle in terms the audience clearly \nunderstands.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the final analysis, effective application does not rely on \ntechniques. It is more a stance than a method. Life-changing \npreaching does not talk to the people about the Bible. Instead, it \ntalks to the people about themselvestheir questions, hurts, fears \nand strugglesfrom the Bible. When we approach the sermon with that \nphilosophy, flint strikes steel. The flint of someone's problem \nstrikes the steel of the Word of God, and a spark emerges that can \nset that person on fire for God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHaddon Robinson is Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Pastor of \nPreaching at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, \nMassachesetts\u0014",

    "title": "PROBLEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CANON",
    "words": "It is important to note that the Council of Carthage did not settle \nall the issues of the canon for Christendom, because different \nopinions on the status of certain books continued to exist in both \nthe Eastern and Western churches. Some manuscripts appear which \neither lack one or more of the twenty-seven books (e.g., Hebrews) or \nadd some books that originally were not included (e.g., The Epistle \nto the Laodiceans). Codex Sinaiticus (fourth century) includes The \nEpistle of Barnabas and The Shepherd of Hermas on its list; \nAlexandrinus (fifth century) has 1 Clement and 2 Clement 1:112:5; \nand the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus mentions The Epistle of \nBarnabas, The Shepherd of Hermas, The Acts of Paul and The Apocalypse \nof Peter in its list. We do well to listen to Bruce Metzger, for whom \nit would be a mistake to represent the question of the canon as \nfinally settled in all Christian communities by the beginning of the \nfifth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nSignificant debates on the New Testament canon also took place during \nthe Renaissance and the Reformation. Martin Luther questioned the \napostolic and canonical status of Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation \nand relegated them to the end of his 1522 edition of the New \nTestament (he called James an epistle of straw). Calvin, on the \nother hand, accepted the traditional form of the New Testament canon. \nThe Roman Catholic Church made its final decision on the canon of \nScripture, including the Apocrypha, at the Council of Trent in 1546. \nThe important fact, however, is that all of these confessions \nacknowledge the same twenty-seven books of the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestions about the canon of the New Testament continue to be raised \ntoday.?\\10? Which form of the text is canonical? Is the canon open or \nclosed? Is there a canon within the canon? Responses to these \nquestions, however, go beyond the purpose of this study. For our \nhistorical survey on the making of the New Testament it seems wise to \nend this section with the judicious words of F. F. Bruce, a scholar \nwho devoted much of his life to a study of the canon:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That the New Testament consists of the twenty-seven books which have \nbeen recognized as belonging to it since the fourth century is not a \nvalue judgment; it is a statement of fact. Individuals or communities \nmay consider that it is too restricted or too comprehensive; but \ntheir opinion does not affect the identity of the canon. The canon is \nnot going to be diminished or increased because of what they think or \nsay: it is a literary, historical and theological datum.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Making of the New Testament, Arthur Patzia\u0014",

All are experiencing significant decline. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe latest dismal news on the leadership front comes from the College \nBoard, which tells us that the U.S., once the world's leader in the \npercentage of young people with college degrees, has fallen to 12th \namong 36 developed nations. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt a time when a college education is needed more than ever to \nestablish and maintain a middle-class standard of living, America's \nyoung people are moving in exactly the wrong direction. A \nwell-educated population also is crucially important if the U.S. is \nto succeed in an increasingly competitive global environment. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut instead of exercising the appropriate mental muscles, we're \nallowing ourselves to become a nation of nitwits, obsessed with the \ncomings and goings of Lindsay Lohan and increasingly oblivious to \ncrucially important societal issues that are all but screaming for \nattention. What should we be doing about the legions of jobless \nAmericans, the deteriorating public schools, the debilitating wars, \nthe scandalous economic inequality, the corporate hold on \ngovernmental affairs, the commercialization of the arts, the \ndeficits? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is there not serious and widespread public engagement with these \nissues  and many others that could easily come to mind? That kind of \nengagement would lead to creative new ideas and would serve to enrich \nthe lives of individual Americans and the nation as a whole. But it \nwould require a heavy social and intellectual lift. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a new report from the College Board, the U.S. is 12th \namong developed nations in the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds with \ncollege degrees. The report said, As America's aging and highly \neducated work force moves into retirement, the nation will rely on \nyoung Americans to increase our standing in the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that today's young Americans are not coming close to \nacquiring the education and training needed to carry out that \nmission. They're not even in the ballpark. In that key group, 25- to \n34-year-olds with a college degree, the U.S. ranks behind Canada, \nSouth Korea, Russia, Japan, New Zealand, Ireland, Norway, Israel, \nFrance, Belgium and Australia. That is beyond pathetic. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the nation struggles to strengthen the economy, the report \nsaid, the educational capacity of our country continues to decline.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nAugust 24, 1683 \u0014\nPuritan John Owen Focused on Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Owen's later years were hard. As a young man, he had been \nmajestic in appearance; but long hours of study, the many troubles of \nhis life, and disease wasted him. He died on this day, August 24, \n1683 at Ealing (a few miles from London). But his funeral showed how \nhighly he was regarded, for throngs attended, including many notable \nmen.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Oxford University, which he entered in 1628 at twelve years of \nage, John pored over books so much that he undermined his health by \nsleeping only four hours a night. In old age he deeply regretted this \nmisuse of his body, and said he would give up all the additional \nlearning it brought him if only he might have his health back. \nNaturally, he studied the classics of the western world, but also \nHebrew, the literature of the Jewish rabbis, mathematics and \nphilosophy. His beliefs at that time were Presbyterian, however, his \nambition, although fixed on the church, was worldly.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was driven from Oxford in 1637 when Archbishop Laud issued rules \nthat many of England's more democratically-minded or \"low\" church \nministers could not accept. After this, John was in deep depression. \nHe struggled to resolve religious issues to his satisfaction. While \nin this state, he heard a sermon on the text \"Why are you fearful, O \nyou of little faith?\" which fired him with new decisiveness.\u0014\nAfter that, John wrote a rebuke of Arminianism (a theology which \nteaches that man has some say in his own salvation or damnation \nalthough God is still sovereign). Ordained shortly before his \nexpulsion from Oxford, he was given work at Fordham in Essex. After \nthat he rose steadily in public affairs. Before all was over, he \nwould become one of the top administrators of the university which \nexpelled him and he even sat in Parliament.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe became a Congregationalist (Puritan) and took Parliament's side in \nthe English Civil Wars. Oliver Cromwell employed him in positions of \ninfluence and trust, but John would not go along when Cromwell became \n\"Protector.\" In spite of this, many of Parliament's leaders attended \nJohn's church.\u0014\nJohn's reputation was so great that he was offered many churches. One \nwas in Boston, Massachusetts. John turned that down, but he once \nscolded the Puritans of New England for persecuting people who \ndisagreed with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also engaged in controversy with such contemporaries as Richard \nBaxter and Jeremy Taylor. Through it all, John focused his teaching \non the person of Christ. \"If Christ had not died,\" he said, \"sin had \nnever died in any sinner unto eternity.\" In another place he noted \nthat \"Christ did not die for any upon condition, if they do believe; \nbut he died for all God's elect, that they should believe.\"\u0014\nJohn wrote many books including a masterpiece on the Holy Spirit. \nKidney stones and asthma tormented him in his last years. But he died \npeacefully in the end, eyes and hands lifted up as if in prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nJohn Owen. http://www.theocentric.com/johnowen/\u0014\n\"Owen, John.\" Dictionary of National Biography.

    "title": "PIERRE VIRET ORDERED OUT OF FRANCE",
    "words": "August 27, 1565 \u0014\nPierre Viret Ordered Out of France\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre Viret was the most popular preacher in sixteenth century \nFrance. Among the cities which invited him to preach were Paris, \nOrleans, Avignon, Montauban, and Montpellier. He was established at \nNimes at the time. Pierre accepted Montpellier's offer, believing \nChrist wanted him there; and he converted almost the whole faculty of \nthe city's medical college to Reformation Christianity. But unlike \nCalvin, Knox and other reformers, Pierre Viret's name gets almost no \nrecognition today.\u0014\n\u0014\nCuriously enough, he was not even a Frenchman. He was born in the \nlittle Swiss town of Orbe in 1511. His parents were poor, but Pierre \ntook advantage of a free education to begin his life of scholarship. \nEventually he attended the University of Paris. As in Switzerland, \nsome of his teachers were Lutheran sympathizers and he became a \nconvert to Reformation faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Farel, the same man who later convinced John Calvin to become \na preacher, convinced Pierre too. From then on, his whole life was \ndedicated to godliness and spreading the gospel. He was so effective \nthat Catholic enemies tried to stab him to death; he was severely \nwounded. Later, Catholics poisoned his spinach. He survived, but he \nsuffered stomach problems ever afterward.\u0014\n\u0014\nA beautiful thing about Pierre was that these ugly attacks and the \nriots that accompanied his sermons, did not warp his spirit. To the \ncontrary, he preached just as lovingly to his enemies as ever. \nAlthough he was staunchly Protestant, he labored to bring about \nreconciliation between Catholics and Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many years he worked in Lausanne and Geneva before beginning his \nwork in France. Thousands attended his sermons. Whole regions came to \nChrist under his teaching. Although we often describe the Huguenots \nas French Calvinists, many were actually converts to Pierre's \nslightly different teachings. (For instance, he viewed the Lord's \nSupper as more symbolic than Calvin did.) When Pierre was at Lyons in \nSouthern France, Catholics regained control of that region. On this \nday, August 27, 1565 Pierre received a notice telling him to get out. \nHe went to Navarre which was ruled by the Protestant queen, Jeanne \nd'Albret.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years later, Pierre and eleven other ministers were captured by \nthe Catholics. Seven were executed. Pierre, however, was allowed to \nlive because the commander had heard so much good about him from \nother Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre suffered many things in his life. His first wife and his \nchildren by her died of plague. His second wife and two children also \ndied of plague. These griefs made him a sympathetic figure to those \nwith similar sufferings. Despite ill health, Pierre preached \ncountless sermons and wrote about fifty books. He died at the age of \nsixty, worn out with hard work and suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nLinder, Robert D. \"Forgotten Reformer.\" Christian History. \u0014\n\"Viret, Pierre.\" Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation. \u0014\nVarious internet articles.\u0014",

    "title": "PETER VERMIGLI NAMES FOR A MARTYR",
    "words": "September 8, 1499 \u0014\nPeter Vermigli Named for a Martyr\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Vermigli shocked sixteenth-century England. Archbishop Thomas \nCranmer had invited the reformer to England and offered him a \nposition at Oxford. The Italian was considered a significant catch \nbecause he was known as one of the greatest scholars of the age. \nHowever, not everyone favored this appointment, because Peter, who \nhad once sworn to be celibate had accepted Reformation ideas, changed \nhis mind and married; what is more, his wife had been a nun.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Florence on this day, September 8, 1499, Peter's father named \nhim after the Dominican saint Pietro Martire (Peter Martyr). Peter \njoined the Augustinian monks when he was sixteen. By the age of 30 he \nhad become an abbot and in 1533 the prior of Naples. There he became \nfriends with the Spanish reformer Juan de Valdes. Perhaps some of \nJuan's ideas rubbed off. At any rate, Peter began to study the Bible \nseriously and was suspended from preaching for denying purgatory. \nCardinal Pole and other influential friends bailed him out and got \nhim a job teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the inquisition became active in Italy, Peter fled to \nSwitzerland. Martin Bucer, one of the big names in the Reformation, \ninvited him to teach at Strasbourg and he accepted. While in \nSwitzerland, he \"stole\" a nun named Catherine out of her cloister one \nnight and married her. Sometime after that, Thomas Cranmer invited \nhim to England. But to the English, who had not yet begun to break \ntheir vows of priestly celibacy and marry, Peter's marriage seemed \noutrageous. \"They have professed virginity to the Lord,\" growled \nRichard Smith, a Catholic, \"and afterward being stirred by the lusts \nor pleasures of the flesh, would cover their whoredom with the name \nof marriage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in England, Peter took part in many significant debates. He was \noften consulted by English reformers. In public, he taught in Latin, \nbut in private, in Italian. His private views were more liberal than \nhis public statements until he made a strong declaration of what he \nbelieved on the Lord's Supper. Since he claimed it was largely \nsymbolic, he angered many people.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatherine, his wife, died in 1553. Not long afterward, the Catholic \nqueen, Mary, came to the throne and Peter found himself under house \narrest. As soon as he was allowed to, he hurried back to Switzerland. \nThere he taught at Strasbourg again until he was driven out because \nhis doctrine of the Lord's Supper disagreed with the Calvinist \nteaching. Peter's views were nearer to Zwingli's.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter then moved on to Zurich (where Zwingli had introduced the \nReformation many years before) and taught Hebrew. He was still there \nwhen he died in 1562. The longest he stayed at any place in his adult \nlife was eight years. Usually he had to leave because of opposition \nto his ideas. Some thought he earned his name \"martyr\" because of \nthat. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nMcLelland, Joseph C.

    "words": "September 25, 1555 \u0014\nPeace at Augsburg\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat was the turmoil and many the monstrous crimes committed in the \nname of Christ in the wake of the Reformation in Europe. Religious \npassions quickly passed into political conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the Diet (a formal assembly of princes) of Worms in 1521, Emperor \nCharles V outlawed Lutheranism . But he was unable to stamp out the \nreform movement at the time because of other crises. Not until 1529 \nwas Charles able to follow up on the Lutheran issue. He sent word \nthat Catholicism was to be restored everywhere in Germany. Many \nGerman cities and princes protested. These were called the \n\"Protesting estates\" and from them we got the name \"Protestant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles saw that some sort of conciliation would be in order. In 1530 \nhe attended an assembly known as the Diet at Augsburg. Lutherans \npresented the Confession of Augsburg in an attempt to prove to Rome \nthat their views were Biblical. This confession remains the basis of \nthe Lutheran faith. However, reconciliation proved impossible and \nCharles ordered Lutherans to reunite with the Catholic church by \nApril 15, 1531. This had the effect of stiffening opposition against \nhim. A military alliance of Protestants, known as the Schmalkaldic \nLeague came into being. Charles crushed this, but Elector Maurice \nswitched sides and declared war on the emperor, forcing him to \nnegotiate with the Protestants. In 1552, at the Peace of Passau, \nCharles accepted the existence of the evangelical church and promised \nto hold a \"diet\" to settle the controversy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe diet was not convened until 1555. Again it was held in Augsburg. \nPeace was arranged between the Lutherans and Catholics on this day, \nSeptember 25, 1555. In many respects it was imperfect. Although \nLutherans were given legal standing, Anabaptists and Calvinists were \nnot. \"[A]ll such as do not belong to the two above-named religions \nshall not be included in the present peace but be totally excluded \nfrom it.\" Each German territory must take the faith of its prince. \nThis inbuilt religious divisiveness crippled Germany's ability to \nunite as a nation. There was no toleration within a territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg did, however, permit people to transplant to a \nregion whose faith was more congenial to each. \"In case our subjects, \nwhether belonging to the old religion or to the Augsburg Confession, \nshould intend leaving their homes, with their wives and children, in \norder to settle in another place, they shall neither be hindered in \nthe sale of their estates after due pay, net of the local taxes nor \ninjured in their honor... \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Peace of Augsburg offered the merest hint of toleration. Weak as \nwas the treaty, it brought increased stability. However, not until \nthe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 were Calvinists added to the list of \ntolerated religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\"Augsburg, Peace of.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

Your incense is detestable to \nme. I cannot bear your evil assemblies\" (Isaiah 1:13).\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Should you not know justice, you who hate good and love evil; who \ntear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones; who eat \nmy people's flesh, strip off their skin, break their bones in pieces, \nchop them up like meat for the pan?\" (Micah 3:1b-3).\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't the prophets strike you as kind of cranky? Not only do they use \nangry words, prophets resort to shock tactics that often look \ndownright bizarre:\u0014\n\u0014\nHosea marries a prostitute to show how unfaithful the people have \nbecome;\u0014\n\u0014\nEzekiel eats food cooked over excrement to show people how defiled \nthey've become,\u0014\n\u0014\nJeremiah digs up a filthy, buried, unwashed undergarment to show \npeople how repulsive their behavior was.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophets are filled with this stuff. No wonder those of us who \npreach often avoid them. Our listeners don't always like it. We don't \nlike it. (Does anyone really want to encourage such prophet-like \nbehavior in their congregation?)\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nThere are three rules for great preaching.

No doubt \nyou have recited it many times. I believe in God the Father, \nAlmighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus Christ, his only \nbegotten Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of \nthe Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead \nand buried: He descended into hell: The third day he rose again from \nthe dead: He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God \nthe Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and \nthe dead: I believe in the Holy Ghost: I believe in the holy catholic \nchurch: the communion of saints: The forgiveness of sins: The \nresurrection of the body: And the life everlasting. Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil the seventeenth century, it was thought that this fundamental \nstatement of Christian doctrine was written by the apostles \nthemselves on the day of Pentecost. Now it is known that the \nPentecost tale was a fiction that appeared in the sixth century. When \nwas the creed written? Who wrote it? Can we trust it?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will probably never know who wrote it. But we know that even in \nBible times the church used a creed. Converts had to confess the name \nof Christ before they were baptized. Probably this confession was in \na standard form because Paul wrote about the \"form of doctrine\" \n(Romans 6:17).\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, a creed was firmly established by the second century. \nIraneaus and Tertullian-- the one writing in Gaul (France) the other \nin North Africa-- quoted chunks of the creed. Their versions agree \nclosely with the Old Latin Text. A fourth century version appeared in \nthe Near East. All of these versions are shorter than the Apostle's \nCreed the church accepts today. For example, none of them say that \nJesus \"descended into hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all of this, the creed is completely trustworthy. Every statement \nin it is based on the Bible. Even its most controversial line, that \nJesus descended into hell, (which should read \"Hades,\" the abode of \nthe dead) can be defended from scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't know when the exact words we now use came into being. But we \nknow they were in use by the seventh century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest manuscript with the exact words we now have was written by \nan abbot named Pirminius. He lived during the time of Charlemagne. In \n711, he rebuilt an abbey in Switzerland that had been destroyed in an \ninvasion. Later he became the first abbot of a Benedictine monastery \nat Reichenau (in modern Germany).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an abbot, Pirminius wrote a book to train the monks under him. \nThis book, Scarapsus, is the earliest writing known to contain the \ncomplete Latin version of the Apostles' Creed as we know it, the \n\"Received Form.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to tradition, the man who first recorded the Apostles' \nCreed died on this day, November 3, ca. 753. Pirminius, merely doing \nhis duty, probably never thought of himself as a \"first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBettenson, Henry. Documents of the Christian Church.

    "words": "Matthew 3:1-12\u0014\nEven a simple comparison of the Synoptic texts that include this \npericope indicates that the Matthean redactors did considerable \nrearranging of Mark 1:2-6 in forming Matthew 3:1-12. They did not use \nthe Malachi 3:1 portion of Mark's quotation. In their use of \"Q\" \nmaterials or of other composition in Matthew 3:7-10 (Luke 3:7-9), the \nMatthean writers characteristically specified the Pharisees and, in \nthis instance, also the Sadducees for vilification where Luke has \nsimply the multitudes. It is regrettable that both Matthew and Luke \nused the vulgar epithet, \"You offspring of snakes!\" This expression \nin our English idiom would be \"You sons-of-bitches!\" The word of John \nthe Baptist and the Word of God in Scripture would speak with greater \nauthority without the use of this epithet.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe message of Matthew 3:1-12 for Jews, for Christians, and for all \npeople is \"Change! Change your minds, your attitudes, your actions, \nyour lifestyle!\" \"Prepare the way for the Lord!\" Perhaps we become \noverly complacent as we hear this text, thinking that somehow this \nmessage is not for us but for others, for Pharisees and for \nSadducees, so that we do not have to deal with it ourselves. This \nmessage, however, is for us, especially for those of us who are \npastors and teachers. We are expected, even commanded, to change and \nto prepare the way of the Lord. Then it is for all people, for Jews, \nfor Christians, and for all others as well. This text, particularly \nin relation to the other texts appointed for this occasion, has its \nmessage directed straight at us.

Every generation \nknows that war devastates families, property, people and nations. \nThere is virtually nothing good that comes from war.

    "words": "Matthew 3:1-12\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is discouraging that so many Christian evangelists have \npopularized meaningless, and actually a detrimental theology. To the \nextreme we have Tim LaHaye promoting the decrepit nature of man, \nscandalized by humanism. Discussing how he came to write the Left \nBehind book series, in which only \"believers\" will know eternal \npeace, LaHaye relates, \"This is an idea that the Lord gave me when I \nwas on a plane. The airline captain came out of his cave and he \nstarted flirting with the head stewardess. I noticed that he had a \nwedding ring on. She did not. I began to see the sparks flying \nbetween these two and as he went back into the cockpit, I got to \nthinking, 'What if the Rapture occurred right now? On this plane, a \nthird of these people would be gone. It would be pandemonium.' I \nimagined this guy, married to I assumed, a Christian, and all of the \nsudden it would dawn on him, 'When I get home, my wife will be gone, \nand I have been left behind.' That is where the title came from.\" \nBut, as LyHaye sits in judgment, does he know the trials and \ntribulations of the captain and his need to be directed to counseling \nrather than into the fires of hell?\u0014\n\u0014\nLiterally, LaHaye collects and spends millions of dollars on himself \nfrom his enterprise of eschatological preaching. With his sell of \nbooks, accompanied by a movie proceeds, computer mouse pads, and all \nimaginable gimmicks in between he has amassed a fortune of personal \nfinancial wealth. When Christ returns mysteriously on the clouds of \nheaven to claim only his own, as LaHaye prophesies, I would like to \nbe privy to this eschatologists' self-justification and \nrationalization for his unwarranted wealth. It is money that could \nhave been spent on evangelistic programs exemplifying his message of \nthe urgency to save souls; then, treasures on earth are difficult to \nsurrender. In the accountability of life, one must ponder, would Tim \nbe the only one left seated on that 747?\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn the Baptist said, \"Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.\" If \nwe truly believe in the message that we preach, then it must be \nreflected in our lifestyles, actions, and the words we speak. \nProclaiming the message of judgment does not coincide with filling \nour coffers with gold coins from our endeavors. We may not have taken \nthe vow of poverty, but when we joined the church we did make a \npledge to be good stewards. And proper stewardship is a very clear \nindicator of the seriousness in which we entertain repentance.\u0014",

    "words": "Pastor's Website Lists Naughty, Nice Businesses \u0014\nKaren Spears Zacharias\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, December 16, 2010 5:23 am\u0014\n\u0014\nBest Buy, Kirkland's and Alaska Airlines all made the nice list, but \nNordstrom, Macy's and Barnes & Noble had better watch out. They've \nbeen tagged on the naughty side of Christmas. But don't blame Santa; \nhe's not the one keeping this list of who's been naughty and who's \nbeen nice. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis idea originated with Robert Jeffress, pastor at First Baptist \nChurch in Dallas. Jeffress came up with the website, GrinchAlert.com, \nbecause he wanted to make a point about keeping Christ in Christmas. \nGrinchAlert.com allows people to create their own lists of businesses \nthat promote the Christ in Christmas and shame those who don't.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's an attempt to do something positive,\" Jeffress says.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, Jeffress has some warped notions about what it means to \nplay nicely with others. This is the same fellow who during the \ndebate over the placement of a mosque three blocks from Ground Zero \nwarned his people Islam is an evil religion, one that promotes \npedophilia.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The deep, dark, dirty secret of Islam: It is a religion that \npromotes pedophilia  sex with children. This so-called prophet \nMuhammad raped a 9-year-old girl  had sex with her,\" Jeffress said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be clear, it's not Islam that Jeffress is fed up with so much as \nit is a namby-pamby propensity toward political correctness that our \nculture has cultivated. Jeffress is a man who says what he thinks, \neven when he probably hasn't given as much thought to it as he should \nhave.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the executives at Nordstrom and Macy's storm the offices at \nFirst Baptist Church in Dallas, Jeffress wants them to know he's not \nthe one keeping track of who is naughty and nice. The website is a \npublic forum, like letters to the editor, Jeffress told a Fox News \nreporter. \"In a pluralist society like ours everyone ought to be able \nto share their views,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou have to hand it to Jeffress for adopting the language of the \npolitically correct and finessing it to suit his purposes. What those \npurposes are, however, is downright disturbing. If Jeffress is trying \nto put the Christ back into Christmas, he's sure picked an ugly, \nun-Christlike way to do that.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe says the website is simply a positive way to reward those \nbusinesses that promote the spirit of having a Merry Christmas. It is \nnot, he insists, meant to be a boycott of businesses that fail to do \nthat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's true that the comments praising the businesses that meet some \nnebulous standard of what constitutes a Christian Christmas far \noutnumber the comments on the naughty list. But it's also true that \nthose on the naughty list are getting a public spanking for their \nholiday, not Christmas, spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a shopping experience at Target, one person wrote: \"I was \nlooking for an ornament that reflected the reason for the season, and \nI could not find anything that said Merry Christmas. I'm tired of \nseeing ONLY snowmen, Santa Clauses, snowflakes, birds, glitter ... I \ncould not find a gift bag, an ornament, or a gift box with a manger \nor the Holy Family on it. My husband & I will make a conscious effort \nto support stores like Mardel's, Hobby Lobby, LifeWay or church \nbookstores that support Christmas wholeheartedly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother said of Barnes & Noble: \"Employees will not say 'Merry \nChristmas' because they have been instructed to say 'Happy Holidays.' \nThis has been going on for years and I quit buying from them years \nago.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJeffress can deny it all he wants, but the message that comes across \nis loud and clear: Good Christians will only shop at the stores that \ngive lip service to Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, Jeffress and his followers never address the question of \nhow the babe in the manger became the poster child for capitalism to \nbegin with. If Jeffress and his Grinch Alert crew are so all-fired \nconcerned about keeping Christ in Christmas, they might want to begin \nby spending less time in the shopping malls and more time at the \nhomeless shelters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the most likely place Jesus would hang any time of the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nKaren Spears Zacharias is the author of \"Will Jesus Buy Me a \nDoublewide? 'Cause I Need More Room for My Plasma TV.\"\u0014",

    "title": "PAUL REVERE'S RIDE NOT ABOUT REVOLUTIONARY WAR",
    "words": "HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW published his best-known poem, Paul \nReveres Ride, 150 years ago tomorrow  the same day that South \nCarolina seceded from the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nListen, my children, and you shall hear/ Of the midnight ride of \nPaul Revere. Before Longfellow published those lines, Revere was \nnever known for his ride, and Longfellow got almost every detail of \nwhat happened in 1775 wrong. But Longfellow didnt care: he was \nwriting as much about the coming war as about the one that had come \nbefore. Paul Reveres Ride is less a poem about the Revolutionary \nWar than about the impending Civil War  and about the conflict over \nslavery that caused it. That meaning, though, has been almost \nentirely forgotten. \u0014\n\u0014\nLongfellow, a passionately private man, was, just as passionately and \nprivately, an abolitionist. His best friend was Charles Sumner, for \nwhom he wrote, in 1842, a slim volume called Poems on Slavery. \nSumner, a brash and aggressive politician, delivered stirring \nspeeches attacking slave owners; Longfellow, a gentler soul, wrote \nverses mourning the plight of slaves, poems so mild, he wrote, \nthat even a slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite \nfor breakfast. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, publishing those poems cost Longfellow something: a piece of \nhis privacy, with pressure from fellow abolitionists to enter \npolitics. I should be found but a weak and unworthy champion in \npublic debate, he demurred. Asked to write once more about slavery, \nhe refused: I think no one who cares about the matter will be at any \nloss to discover my opinion on that subject. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet Longfellows abolitionist zeal didnt abate. He secretly spent \nmoney he earned from his best-selling poems, like The Song of \nHiawatha, to buy slaves their freedom. In 1856, when Sumner gave his \nfamous Crime Against Kansas speech in the Senate, Longfellow \ncongratulated him: At last the spirit of the North is aroused. That \nspeech nearly cost Sumner his life  it so incensed a South Carolina \nrepresentative, Preston Brooks, that he beat Sumner with a cane on \nthe Senate floor. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe next year, Longfellow wrote to Sumner calling the Dred Scott \ndecision heart-breaking, and wishing he could find a way to write \nabout it: I long to say some vibrant word, that should have vitality \nin it, and force. Be sure if it comes to me I will not be slow in \nuttering it. On Dec. 2, 1859, the day John Brown was hanged, \nLongfellow wrote in his diary, This will be a great day in our \nhistory, the date of a new Revolution quite as much needed as the old \none. \u0014\n\u0014\nPondering that new Revolution, Longfellow got to thinking about the \nold one. In April 1860, he began writing Paul Reveres Ride. While \nhe worked on the poem, he worried about the fate of the nation. \nAround the same time he went to see Frederick Douglass speak and read \nSumners latest speech, which predicted that the sacred animosity \nbetween Freedom and Slavery can end only with the triumph of \nFreedom. In November, weeks after finishing Paul Reveres Ride, \nLongfellow rejoiced in his diary that Lincoln had won the presidency; \nechoing Sumner, he wrote: Freedom is triumphant. \u0014\n\u0014\nPaul Reveres Ride was published in the January 1861 issue of The \nAtlantic, which appeared on newsstands on Dec. 20. It was read as a \nrallying cry for the Union. It is a poem about waking the sleeping, \nand waking the dead: Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,/ In \ntheir night encampment on the hill. The dead are Northerners, \nawakened, at last aroused. But the dead are also the enslaved, \nentombed in slavery  an image that was, at the time, a common \nconceit: Douglass called his escape a resurrection from the dark and \npestiferous tomb of slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the poem echoes stanzas in Longfellows earlier abolitionist \nverses, including The Witnesses: \u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the bones of Slaves; \u0014\n\u0014\nThey gleam from the abyss; \u0014\n\u0014\nThey cry, from yawning waves, \u0014\n\u0014\nWe are the Witnesses! \u0014\n\u0014\nThanks to poems like Paul Reveres Ride, Longfellow was once the \ncountrys most respected and beloved poet. But, beginning with the \nrise of New Criticism in the early 20th century, literary scholars \nhave dismissed his poetry as cloying, drippy and even childish. \nGenerations of schoolchildren have memorized Paul Reveres Ride; \ncritics have barely read it. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet neglecting Longfellow, taking the politics out of Longfellow, \nthinking of Longfellow as childish, have both occluded the poems \nmeaning and made it exceptionally serviceable as a piece of political \npropaganda. It is, after all, a rousing call to action:\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need, \u0014\n\u0014\nThe people will waken and listen to hear \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hurrying hoofbeats of that steed, \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the midnight message of Paul Revere. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the history of the poem forgotten, this became all-purpose \nstuff. We still need some Paul Revere of conscience to alert every \nhamlet and every village of America that revolution is still at \nhand, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1967. In 1971, the \nVietnam Veterans against the War marched Reveres ride in reverse; \nfour years later, Gerald Ford quoted Longfellow to call for renewed \npride in America. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis year George Pataki came to Boston to unveil an organization \ncalled Revere America: Were here today to tell the people of \nAmerica, he declared, that once again our freedom is in danger ... \nfrom health care. \u0014\n\u0014\nA century and a half ago, there was quite a bit more at stake. The \ndissolution of the Union goes slowly on, Longfellow wrote in his \ndiary in January 1861. Behind it all I hear the low murmur of the \nslaves, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy. They cry, from the \nabyss. \u0014\n\u0014\nJill Lepore is a professor of history at Harvard and the author, most \nrecently, of The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Partys Revolution \nand the Battle Over American History.\u0014",

    "words": "In her book, Unbroken, Laura Hildenbrand (author of Seabiscuit) \nrecounts the amazing true story of World War II veteran and \nprisoner-of-war survivor Louis (or Louie) Zamperini. On May 27, 1943, \nZamperini's bomber left Oahu in search of survivors from a downed \nplane. About 800 miles from the base one of the engines cut out and \nthe bomber plunged into the ocean. Zamperini and another soldier \nwould stay afloat on a tiny life raft for 47 daysa world record for \nsurvival at sea. After confronting sharks, starvation, and dementia, \ntheir real battle would begin. Zamperini spent the next two years as \na Japanese POW in the notorious Sugamo Prison. In particular, a guard \nnamed Watanabe (nicknamed \"the Bird\") ensured that Louis endured \nconstant physical torture and verbal humiliationall in an attempt to \nshatter the spirit of the American soldiers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1944, after Louis had been declared dead, he returned to America \nto a rush of publicity. Unfortunately, his life quickly descended \ninto a new self-made prison of alcoholism and bitterness. In \nparticular, Louis now endured constant nightmares about his past and \nan obsessive drive to murder \"the Bird.\" But the walls of addiction \nand hatred started to crumble in 1949 when Louis attended a Billy \nGraham crusade and heard the gospel and trusted Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter receiving Christ, in the words of Laura Hildenbrand:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen [Louie] thought of his history, what resonated with him now was \nnot all that he had suffered but the divine love that he believed had \nintervened to save him. He was not the worthless, broken, forsaken \nman that the Bird had striven to make him. In a single, silent \nmoment, his rage, his fear, his humiliation and helplessness, had \nfallen away. That morning, he believed, he was a new creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year after trusting Christ, Zamperini returned to the Sugamo Prison \nin Japan where he met with his former captors, except the Bird. When \nLouis was told that the Bird had committed suicide, in Hildebrand's \nwords,\u0014\n\u0014\n[Louie] felt something he had never felt for his captor before. With \na shiver of amazement, he realized it was compassion. At that moment, \nsomething shifted sweetly inside him. It was forgiveness, beautiful \nand effortless and complete. For Louie Zamperini, the war was over.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nSubmitted by Van Morris, Mt. Washington, Kentucky; source: Laura \nHildenbrand, Unbroken (Random House, 2010), pp. 376-379\u0014",

    "title": "PALESTINIANS AWAIT ANGELS HERALD OF \"PEACE ON EARTH\"",
    "words": "Palestinians Await Angels Herald of 'Peace on Earth' \u0014\nAlex Awad\u0014\n Friday, December 24, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nEmbedded in the Christmas story is God's desire for peace on our \nplanet. Luke announced that \"peace on earth\" was the theme that the \nangels heralded over the skies of Bethlehem on the night that the \nSavior was born. We can conclude from their celestial anthem that God \nyearns for peace on earth. \u0014\nBut can we also be in agreement that God longs for the peace of \nPalestine and of Israel  for serenity in Jerusalem and Bethlehem?\u0014\n\u0014\nMany give biblical or political reasons for the absence of peace in \nthe Middle East.\u0014\nSome people point to verses in the Old Testament that reflect the \nfrustrations of ancient Hebrew prophets with prevailing injustice and \nquote these verses to prove that peace is unattainable. They cling to \nthe words of Isaiah. \"There is no peace,\" says the Lord, \"for the \nwicked\" (Isaiah 48:22).\u0014\n\u0014\nYet they ignore Isaiah's commitment to peace and the significance he \nplaces on the subject in much of his book. He wrote, \"How beautiful \non the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who \nproclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who \nsay to Zion, 'Your God reigns!'\" (Isaiah 52:7).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apocalyptical perspective of some Christians regarding the \"end \nof the world\" causes them to shy away from serving the cause of \npeace. By their apathy, they declare, perhaps without making a public \nconfession, that he that is in the world is greater than he that is \nwithin them. They sit with their hands folded while the enemies of \npeace work relentlessly.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill others misunderstand one or two of Jesus' statements relating \nto the subject of peace. They interpret them out of context and use \nthese passages to undermine God's deep longing for peace. They forget \nthat the Gospel message is God's \"good news of peace\" (Acts 10:36).\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians have given up on the possibility of peace in the land \nof the Bible for political reasons. They reference the timeline of \nfailed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over the last 25 years as \nevidence that peace in the region is impossible. They claim that \nPalestinians and their leaders serve as the chief obstacle to peace. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, most people who make such claims have not spent time in \nPalestine and know very little about the Palestinian position. For \nexample, if they visit Bethlehem, they may hear the story of Mark*, a \nprofessor at Bethlehem Bible College who is not able to develop his \nfamily's land because it is located next to an area that Israeli \nsettlers are planning to develop for the exclusive use of Jewish \nsettlers. \u0014\nOr you may meet Nancy* who also serves at our college and whose \nfamily has been struggling for years to keep their land from \nconfiscation by Israeli settlers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are just two of thousands of examples of injustices inflicted \nagainst the Palestinians. As people invest time in learning the \nrealities on the ground, they will discover that the group most \nhurting due to lack of peace and that made the greatest compromises \nto settle the conflict is the Palestinian people. \u0014\nThey will also discover that Palestinians are the ones who lost more \nthan 80 percent of their homeland in the last 60 years and are the \nones who are about to lose what little is left. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, despite continued expulsion from their land, daily \nharassment by Israeli settlers, and a number of oppressive measures, \nthe Palestinian leadership in the West Bank has opted to follow the \npath of nonviolence and engage in negotiations to achieve peace with \nIsrael.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSome would say that the United States is the primary obstacle to \npeace in the Middle East. Certainly, U.S. unconditional and \nuncritical economic, military and political support for Israel is not \nhelpful. Nevertheless, we must not forget that half a dozen U.S. \npresidents and scores of U.S. envoys have invested much time and \neffort in resolving the conflict. It would be remiss to interpret \ntheir failure as signs that the U.S. has not put forth an effort.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome say Muslims and Arabs charged with Islamic fundamentalism and \nradical fanaticism are the chief hindrance to peace. Surely there are \nArabs and Islamist minorities who resist the current peace process. \u0014\nHowever, it must be noted that all Arab states and most Islamic \ncountries endorsed the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002. If Israel had \napproved this initiative, it could have resulted in peace between \nIsrael and her neighbors. For certain, Arabs and Muslims are not the \nobstacle.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho, then, is standing in the face of justice and obstructing peace \nbetween Israel and her neighbors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Advent, while millions around the world are praying for peace \nand many governments are exerting genuine efforts to end the \nconflict, Israeli right-wing settlers and ultranationalists continue \nto thwart all possibilities of reconciliation. \u0014\n\u0014\nCome and see what they are doing around Bethlehem. Look at the land \nthey have stolen from Palestinians, and how, in spite of \ninternational law, they continue to build Jewish settlements on \nPalestinian lands within the West Bank with the full backing of the \nIsraeli army. These settlements have become the mother of all \nobstacles. \u0014\n\u0014\nCan Palestinians sign a peace agreement with those who continue to \nforcefully take their lands and build on them segregated settlements? \nDiscovering the prime obstacle to peace is helpful but addressing it \nis the greater challenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we consider this challenge, let us remember that the angels in \nskies over the fields near Bethlehem did not proclaim the message of \npeace to kings, rulers and politicians. Their anthems did not address \nthe religious hierarchy. They came to shepherds  average, humble, \nhard-working people who became the bearers of the message of peace. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we should not wait on presidents or prominent religious \nauthorities to serve the cause of peace. Rather, every one of us who \nreceives the message, regardless of his or her status, can discover \nways to contribute to the cause of peace on earth without the \nexclusion of peace for Israel, Palestine and the birthplace of the \nPrince of Peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlex Awad is pastor of East Jerusalem Baptist Church and professor at \nBethlehem Bible College in Palestine. \u0014\n\u0014\n*Names have been changed.\u0014",

    "title": "PEOPLE LIKE TO BE ASKED",
    "words": "The late Speaker of the House Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill once told of a \nvaluable lesson he learned early in his career. In 1935, during his \nvery first political campaign, a neighbor told him: \"I am going to \nvote for you tomorrow even though you didn't ask me to!\" A shocked \nO'Neill replied: \"Why, Mrs. O'Brien, I have lived across from you for \neighteen years, I cut your grass in the summer, I shoveled your walk \nin the winter, I didn't think I had to ask for your vote.\" Mrs. \nO'Brien replied: \"Tom, let me tell you something: people like to be \nasked!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI found that out for myself just a few short months ago. I had \nattended the death of a patient here at Sisters Hospital, and the \nfamily asked that I preside at the funeral. The patient belonged to \nSt. Ambrose Parish where I had been the associate pastor for some \nseven years and where I still help out on various occasions. The \npastor is one of my closest friends. So I told the family that I'd \ntake care of the arrangements with the church. I merely called St. \nAmbrose and told the secretary to tell the pastor that I would be \npresiding at the funeral.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I arrived that morning at the church, the pastor was there to \nhelp me set up. He said to me: \"You know I don't care about your \ntaking a funeral here at any time. You can do anything you want in \nthis parish, but it would be nice that instead of telling me, you \nasked me.\" I discovered then and there that Mrs. O'Brien was indeed \nright: people like to be asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you give it a thought, there's much truth in that statement. \nBeing asked is often heartwarming and often very uplifting. It's a \nsign of respect as well as one of courtesy. In many cases, being \nasked means being affirmed and recognized as someone of value and \nworth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my work as a priest, I have occasion to talk with people who have \nlost a husband or wife. They often tell me that one of the things \nthat hurts the most is the fact that many of the couples, with whom \nthey once associated, don't ask them out anymore. Maybe it's because \nthey feel awkward asking or maybe they feel he or she will feel \nawkward being asked. But the fact is that by not asking they are \nsending a message that he or she doesn't belong, that he or she is \nsomeone no one wants to associate with anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe elderly often experience much the same problem. As they get \nolder, fewer people ask them to do things. Many times it's because \npeople honestly feel that it might be too much for them, it might be \nmore than they can handle, an honest concern. Unfortunately, however, \nnot being asked sends a message that they are not needed anymore, not \nimportant anymore, not useful anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly enough, a similar case can be made for the very young. \nOne of my favorite stories concerns a grandmother, a mother, and a \nlittle boy who walked into a restaurant and sat down to order. The \nwaitress took the grandmother's order, then the mother's order, and \nthen she turned to the little boy and asked: \"What would you like?\" \nThe mother immediately said: \"Oh, I will order for him.\" The \nwaitress, without being overly rude, ignored the mother and again \nasked the little boy: \"What would you like?\" The mother once again \nspoke up: \"I will order for him!\" The waitress ignored her yet again \nand asked the little boy one more time: \"What would you like?\" \"I \nwould like a hamburger!\" he stammered. \"How would you like your \nhamburger?\" asked the waitress. \"Would you like it with onion, \nmustard, and the works?\" His mouth now open in amazement, the boy \nsaid: \"Yes, I would like the works!\" The waitress went over to the \nwindow and she howled the grandmother's order, then the mother's \norder, and then in a loud voice she said: \"And a hamburger with the \nworks!\" The little boy turned to his mother in utter astonishment and \nsaid: \"Gee, Mommy! She thinks I am real!\" That waitress, by asking \nthe little boy what he wanted, provided him with status. The asking \ngave him recognition; it gave him a feeling of importance that he had \nnever had before. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo whether it be a widow or widower, an elderly man or woman, a \nlittle boy or a little girl, they all bear out the truth of Mrs. \nO'Brien's remark to Tip O'Neill: \"People like to be asked!\" And, in \ntheir case, the asking is a matter of letting them know that they are \nnot out of the mainstream of life, that they are not useless or \nirrelevant or unimportant. Asking them out, asking them to do \nsomething, personally asking them what their desires may be, carries \nsignificance often overlooked.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there's the matter of opening up doors to experiences of great \nenrichment, opening up doors of opportunity for excitement\u0014",

He draws on date from Gregg \nEasterbrook's new book The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better \nWhile People Feel Worse. \u0014\n\u0014\nWill says, \"Easterbrook, a Washington journalist and fellow of the \nBrookings Institution, assaults readers with good news.

In 2003, we spent much wealth on things unavailable in \n1953 -- a cleaner environment, reduced mortality through new medical \nmarvels ($5.2 billion a year just for artificial knees, which did not \nexist a generation ago), the ability to fly anywhere or talk to \nanyone anywhere.

But Eusebius could not \nhave put together his valuable work if it had not been for his \nmentor, Pamphilius. Pamphilius collected the library that Eusebius \nlater mined for ecclesiastical detail.\u0014\n\u0014\nPamphilius was born in the third century in Berytus (now known as \nBeirut). He studied in Alexandria under a Christian teacher named \nPierius and became an ardent fan of the writings of the theologian \nOrigen. Later, as a priest in Caesarea, Palestine, Pamphilius trained \nnumbers of students and amassed a great number of documents in his \nschool library. Many of these he copied with his own hand. He did not \nmerely lecture on Christianity, but practiced its teachings of \nbrotherly love, treating slaves and servants as sons and brothers. He \ndevoted himself to producing accurate copies of the scriptures and \ngave them to students and pious women.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong his pupils was the young man who would become famed as the \nfirst notable church historian--Eusebius. Eusebius was so fond of \nPamphilius that he wrote his life (now lost). When Pamphilius died a \nmartyr, Eusebius renamed himself \"Eusebius of Pamphilius.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 306 one of Pamphilius' pupils challenged the idol worship of the \nlocal governor, Urbanus. This aggravated local persecution against \nChristians; not only was the youth tortured and executed but so were \nother Christians. In November 307, the governer arrested Pamphilius. \nWhen he refused to sacrifice to idols, Urbanus tortured the godly \nscholar and threw him into prison. Despite the risks involved, \nEusebius visited him often. The two co-authored a defense of Origen, \nshowing that the Alexandrian scholar's views on the Trinity and \nincarnation were sound, even if other teachings were not (the church \nwould later condemn Origen's works as heretical). Only volume one of \nthis defense of Origen has survived and only in a bad Latin \ntranslation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he came to write his church history, Eusebius consulted the \nworks Pamphilius had collected. These included early editions of the \nscriptures and an original Hebrew version of Matthew's gospel. Sad to \nsay, this irreplaceable resource was destroyed by invading Muslims in \nthe seventh century.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirminius replaced Urbanus as governor. He ordered Pamphilius killed. \nAfter languishing in prison for more than two years, Pamphilius was \nbeheaded on this day, February 16, 309.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBacchus, F.

Too soon the Corinthians forgot who they were and whose they \nwere. Too quickly they devolved into splintered factions and \nchallenged his apostolic authority. It's like the story someone told \nof two men on a cross-country bike trip. They were traveling together \non a tandem bike. For the first short while the land is level, and \nthey pump along with energy and style, enjoying this teamwork. Then \nthe horizon began to rise, and they found themselves fighting a steep \nclimb. Panting and puffing, they slowly worked their way to the top.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally they reached the summit and stopped to catch their breaths. \n\"Whew!\" said one, wiping the sweat off his face, \"that was some hard \nclimb!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yeah!\" replied the other, \"and if I hadn't kept the brake on, we \nprobably would have slid back to the bottom!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the picture in these opening verses of 1 Corinthians 4, isn't \nit? The one fellow (who could be Paul) had his mind on the heights. \nHe was going to make it to the top if it took all of his energies and \nstrength. Meanwhile his partner (certainly an echo of the \nCorinthians) had his mind on the bottom. He was worried about sliding \nback and about being sucked down the hill. They're both doing the \nsame thing, riding the same bike on the same road up the same hill, \nbut their values are at different places. Their worries set them \napart. Only the end times would reveal their diverse focuses. Paul \npleads with his friends in Corinth and in our congregations to get \nour faith connected to the Creator and thus find again our truest \nselves.\u0014",

Two weeks later, 3500 marched across the \nbridge on their way to state capitol Montgomery, where they rallied \nand listened to MLK. The crowd was very large by the time it got to \nMontgomery. I was a part of that crowd, because the Alabama MSM \n(Methodist Student Movement) had asked the Indiana MSM to come down \nto march with them.

People marched so that black folks could vote, so that young \nmen who were sent off to die in foreign wars had the right to vote, \ntoo. Students led the way in demanding those rights. People in power \npushed back against the students. As a campus minister, I found that \nof all adults, it was old people who were most sympathetic to the \ncause. The youngest and the oldest marched together across the bridge \nto freedom. Old people had nothing to gain, and perhaps they were \nfree to cross the bridge because they had nothing to lose, either, \nbut they knew what was right.\u0014",

    "words": "March 7, 202 \u0014\n\u0014\nPerpetua and Felicitas in the Carthage Arena\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 202, Christians who refused to sacrifice to Roman gods were \nconsidered traitors. Emperor Septimus Severus was cracking down on \nanti-state elements. As he saw it, the sacrifice was simply a \npatriotic gesture, not much more than our salute of the flag. But the \nChristians saw it as a denial of Christ. Among those swept into the \nemperor's dragnet in Carthage were two young women, Perpetua and \nFelicitas. The choice before them was clear: sacrifice or die.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor both women, the situation was complicated by motherhood. \nFelicitas was pregnant and Perpetua had a newborn son.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerpetua's pagan father tried to manipulate her motherly instincts. \n\"Please, Perpetua, think of me, your aging father. But most of all, \nthink of your little baby!\" Because he could not convince the \nnewly-converted 22-year-old to go perform her \"duty,\" he was flogged. \nA man should have better control of his daughter! Perpetua was \nbaptized while in prison. Felicitas, her slave girl, gave birth there.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore her trial, Perpetua received visions from the Lord, reassuring \nher of his strength and presence. She wrote up her prison experience, \nbecoming the first Christian authoress on record. She was condemned \nto die. On this day, March 7, 202, Perpetua and Felicitas left the \nprison for the arena \"joyfully as though they were on their way to \nheaven.\" Before a raging crowd, they were thrown to wild beasts.\u0014\n\u0014\nA mad heifer charged the women and tossed them, but Perpetua rose and \nhelped Felicitas to her feet. She was ready, even eager, to die for \nthe Lord. When she was thrown to the ground, Perpetua's clothing \nripped. She modestly covered herself and asked if she could have a \nhairpin. She fixed her hair to avoid an unkempt appearance that might \nsuggest she was in mourning.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerpetua even spurred the other martyrs on. \"You must all stand fast \nin the faith and love one another,\" she called to them. \"Do not be \nweakened by what we have gone through!\" When the beasts failed to \nfinish them off, soldiers came to do the job. The soldier who \napproached Perpetua was trembling so much that she had to guide the \nsword to her own throat.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese two young women, new in faith, were instant heroines among \nfellow Christians. Joined together, their Latin names mean \n\"everlasting happiness,\" which is what they expected to receive.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Perpetua and Felicitas; Two Young Mothers in Carthage Choose Death \nRather Than Deny Christ.\" Glimpses #1.

    "title": "PATRICK HENRY MAKES\"LIBERTY OR DEATH\" SPEECH",
    "words": "March 23, 1775 \u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry Makes \"Liberty or Death\" Speech\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American colonies were in an uproar in the spring of 1775. The \nBritish crown seemed to be depriving the colonists of their English \nrights; the governor of the Virginia colony had even dissolved the \nlegislature because of its constant discussions about the King's \nactions against them. The assembly met anyway -- in St. John's \nChurch, Richmond, Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the debates, Patrick Henry delivered a speech on this day \nMarch 23, 1775 that electrified the assembly. Saying that if he kept \nback his opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, he \nwould consider himself guilty of treason to his country and \n\"disloyalty toward the majesty of heaven, which I revere above all \nearthly kings.\" Then, like the prophet Isaiah centuries before, \nPatrick warned of those who cried, \"Peace, peace\" when there was no \npeace. Insisting that war with Britain was inevitable, he called on \nVirginia to arm its militia. He rallied his countrymen to trust the \nGod of Hosts and use all the means that the God of nature had placed \nin their power:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Three million of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in \nsuch a country as that we possess, are invincible by any force which \nour enemy can send us. Besides,...we shall not fight our battles \nalone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of \nnations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick concluded his argument with a passionate cry, \"I know not \nwhat course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give \nme death!\" A man listening at the window was so moved by the words, \nthat he asked to be buried on that spot when he died--a wish that was \ngranted. \u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick had given significant speeches before. Thomas Jefferson said \nabout one, \"He appeared to me to speak as Homer wrote.\" Where had \nPatrick Henry learned such eloquence? Many speculate it was from \nSamuel Davies, Presbyterian minister in Virginia. Though Henry was \nreared an Anglican, his mother embraced Presbyterianism during the \nGreat Awakening. As a teenager Henry often accompanied her to the \nmeeting house in Hanover County where Samuel Davies was a pastor. \nDavies was an eloquent, powerful speaker as well as a strong advocate \nof religious liberty. No doubt Christian influences such as Davies \nhelped shape the thoughts and oratorical skills of Patrick Henry.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry served several times as governor of Virginia. Sometimes \nhe was hopelessly out of touch with the times. For instance, he tried \nto keep the Church of England as the established church of Virginia. \nAgain, although he sought liberty for himself, he was content to \nleave blacks in slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, he was a committed Christian throughout his life. His \nwill concluded with these words: \"This is all the inheritance I can \ngive to my dear family. The religion of Christ can give them one \nwhich will make them rich indeed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance Ph.D.\u0014\nCopeland, Lewis.

One is the death of Jesus Christ. The other is his \nresurrection. That God would become man, allow his own subjects to \nkill him, and then translate that event into the gateway of their \nsalvation has to be the most astonishing story ever told.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pair of dates fit all the known facts for Christ's death, which \ntook place at Passover on a Friday (the gospels show that the next \nday was a Saturday--the Jewish Sabbath). This would mean Christ's \ndeath fell on the 14th or 15th of the Jewish month Nisan. (In Exodus \nGod commanded the lamb to be slain on the 14th of Nisan but the Jews \nin Jerusalem reckoned their days from sundown to sundown, making some \ndisagreement as to when the 14th ended and the 15th began). Jesus' \nministry commenced after John the Baptist had come. (Luke dates this \nin the 15th year of Caesar Tiberias). Jesus was then about thirty \nyears old and had probably taught for three and a half years. \nCombining all these factors, we can say that it is most likely that \nJesus went to the cross sometime between the years 27 and 34. \nPassover Friday fell on the 15th of Nisan in a.d 30 and 33. The first \nof those dates was on this day, April 7, 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetrayed by Judas, one of his disciples, Jesus was arrested at night \nin a garden called Gethsemane near Jerusalem. When the men who came \nto the garden said they were looking for Jesus, he replied, \"I am \nHe.\" The men fell to the ground, overwhelmed by that declaration. And \nno wonder, for \"I Am\" is the name by which God first declared himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcerned as always for others, Jesus urged his persecutors to let \nhis disciples go. He even healed the ear of Malchus, slashed by Peter \nin a reckless attempt to defend his master.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Jesus was led to the house of the High Priest. Charges were \nleveled at him, but none stuck. Finally the priest commanded Jesus, \nin the name of God, to declare whether or not he was the Son of God. \nWhen Jesus affirmed it, he was declared guilty of blasphemy. This was \ngrounds for execution under Jewish law, but Rome ruled Judea and the \nJews did not have authority to execute Jesus. They were forced to \nbring Jesus before the Roman governor, Pilate, and ask for the death \nsentence. They got it by suggesting that as a pretended king, Jesus \nwas setting himself against Rome. If Pilate freed Jesus, he was no \nfriend of Caesar, said the Jewish leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nPilate buckled. He had Jesus whipped and crucified. Darkness fell \nupon the land as Jesus hung on the cross--a mysterious darkness \nmentioned by at least two ancient writers. From the cross he forgave \nthose who crucified him and arranged his mother's care. He said he \nwas thirsty and groaned that God had forsaken him. At one point, he \npromised a thief eternal life. Six hours after the nails went in, \nJesus committed his soul to God and died. At that awful moment, when \nthe creator of worlds died, the earth shook and the ground broke \nopen. The stones recognized their master even if men did not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBible.

    "words": "Published May 16, 2011  FoxNews.com\u0014\n\u0014\nStephen Hawking -- the world-renowned theoretical physicist -- finds \nno room for heaven in his vision of the cosmos.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview published Monday in The Guardian newspaper, the \n69-year-old says the human brain is like a \\computer that will stop \nworking when its components fail.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers; that is a \nfairy story for people afraid of the dark,\" Hawking told the paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not the first time the world-renowned thinker has made \ncontroversial statements about religion and the existence of God. In \n\"Grand Design,\" a book Hawking published last year, the \\physicist \ndeclared that it was \"not necessary to invoke God ... to get the \nuniverse going.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Hawking, the concept of religion is in constant conflict with his \nlife's work -- science, and understanding the most basic ways in \nwhich the universe works -- and it's almost impossible to reconcile \nthe two.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview with Diane Sawyer last June, Hawking noted that \n\"there is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based \non authority, and science, which is based on observation and reason. \nScience will win, because it works.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has maintained this position since very early in his career, \ntelling German newsmagazine Der Speigel in 1988 that \"what I have \ndone is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to \nbe determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be \nnecessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not \nnecessary,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot that the existence of a happy after-life wouldn't suit the man -- \ndiagnosed with a motor neuron disease at the age of 21, Hawking has \nbeen almost completely paralyzed for the majority of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis hasn't stopped him from producing key scientific works such as \nhis work with general relativity as well as a theoretical prediction \nthat black holes should emit radiation, which is now often referred \nto as \\Hawking radiation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it's his work that keeps him going -- even if there isn't a \nheaven. \"I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, Hawking has also made headlines in recent years over \nthe existence of aliens -- and what interactions between our races \nwould be like.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when \nChristopher \\Columbus first landed in America, which didnt turn out \nvery well for the Native Americans, he said.\u0014",

But you shall receive \npower when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be \nwitnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and \nto the end of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Now when he had spoken these things, while they watched, He was \ntaken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight...\" (Acts 1: 4-9 \nNew King James Version).\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause the date of Easter varies from year to year, the celebration \nof the Ascension moves with it. It always falls on the fortieth day \nfrom Easter and, since Easter always falls on a Sunday, Ascension Day \nalways falls on a Thursday; it is frequently called \"Holy Thursday.\" \nWhenever Easter falls on April 5th, Ascension Day falls on this day, \nMay 14. The last time that happened was in 1953 and the next time \nwill be in 2015.\u0014\n\u0014\nAscension Day celebrates Christ's exaltation. While on earth, he was \na servant. Now in heaven, he is the ruler and Lord of all. By \nentering heaven as the representative of mankind, he completed the \nwork of our salvation and guarantees the eventual glorification of \nall who love Him. \u0014\n\u0014\nJust as Jesus went up in the clouds, he will return the same way. \nAgain Luke described the scene:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, \nbehold two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, 'Men of \nGalilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who \nwas taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you \nsaw Him go into heaven.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the great hope of all Christians. For just as Jesus went into \nheaven, so will all Christians. Those who are dead will rise first; \nthose who are living will be caught up to meet him in the air, \naccording to Paul, writing to the church at Thessalonica. This is \ncalled the rapture (by some Christian groups). With this hope in \nmind, Christians sometimes conclude their meetings with the words, \n\"Come Lord Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Easter Sunday Dates.\" \nhttp://users.chariot.net.au/~gmarts/eastcalc.htm\u0014\nGibson, George M.

There \nare a lot of different labels to describe the varieties of Christian \nfollowers, and the word \"Protestant\" is one. It was on this day, \nApril 19, 1529, that the designation \"Protestant\" might be said to \nhave come into existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther had been declared a heretic by both the pope and the \nemperor, but his followers continued to multiply rapidly. Emperor \nCharles V could not suppress the reformers as he wished, because the \nTurks were threatening his empire from the east, and the pope and he \nwere quarreling with each other. In 1521, at Worms, Germany, Charles \nsigned a document which outlawed Luther. Five years later at another \nimperial council, Charles agreed to postpone any settlement of \nreligious issues. He agreed that until an official policy could be \nestablished, every State within his territories would be governed as \nthe ruler thought most pleasing to God. In practice, this meant that \nthroughout Germany's many independent cities, principalities and \nelectorates, the religion of each prince or local ruler became the \nreligion of his subjects.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1529 a Diet (Congress) met at Speyer, Germany to consider action \nagainst the Turks and attempt again to come to terms with the \nReformation. The Diet forbade any extension of the Reformation until \na German council could meet the following year. Charles V declared he \nwould wipe out the Lutheran \"heresy.\" Five reforming princes and \nfourteen cities drafted a protest, a formal legal appeal, for \nthemselves, their subjects and all who then or in the future should \nbelieve in the Word of God. (It was not formally published until \nJuly.) \u0014\n\u0014\nEight years before, Martin Luther was a lone monk standing for the \nWord of God and liberty of conscience at the Diet of Worms. But by \n1529, the world had changed: there was an organized party of \ngovernment leaders with consciences bound by the Word of God against \ntyrannical authority. Not every protester was a Lutheran. The whole \nparty of the reformers needed a name. From the protest and appeal at \nthe Diet of Speyer, these breakaways from the Roman Church began to \nbe called Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday Protestants are one of three major branches of Christianity. \nWhile all three hold the same fundamental creed, other differences \nare many. Perhaps the key difference is that while the Eastern \nOrthodox and Roman traditions combine the Scripture with the \nauthority of church tradition or of a pope, Protestants claim to find \nthe sole authority for their faith in the Bible, the Word of God. \nMany can also be identified because they accept the priesthood of all \nbelievers and the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBezold, Friedrich von.

It was \nissuedon this day, June 15, 1520.\u0014\n\u0014\nA bull is a solemn letter from the pope, stamped with a red seal \ncalled a bullae.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bull compared Martin Luther to a wild boar from the forest that \nsought to destroy the church. It is named Exsurge Dominebecause those \nare its first two words in Latin. The bull condemned 41 things taught \nby Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1517, Luther, as was the custom of the day, had posted some theses \nwhich he felt needed to be debated. These had sprung out of his sense \nthat it was wrong for the church to sell indulgences (pardons for \nsins). Luther had recently made a study of justification--the process \nby which God makes us righteous--and come to the conclusion that \npopes and priests cannot forgive sins. A man is made righteous \ninstead by faith in God through Jesus Christ. Luther had no thought \nof breaking from the Roman Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, events took a life of their own. His points were seized by \nthe humanists of the day and became the hot topic of discussion. In \nthe controversy that raged, Luther became more certain than ever that \nhe was right. He based his arguments on the scriptures, which the \ninvention of the printing press had recently made more generally \navailable, and he declared many things that went contrary to Catholic \ndoctrine, such as that there is no purgatory, that it is wrong to \nburn heretics, and that the pope is not really the Vicar of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nRome burned Luther's writings.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took three months for a copy of the bull to reach the reformer. \nThen Luther read, \"Moreover, because the preceding errors and many \nothers are contained in the books or writings of Martin Luther, we \nlikewise condemn, reprobate, and reject completely the books and all \nthe writings and sermons of the said Martin, whether in Latin or any \nother language, containing the said errors or any one of them; and we \nwish them to be regarded as utterly condemned, reprobated, and \nrejected. We forbid each and every one of the faithful of either sex, \nin virtue of holy obedience and under the above penalties to be \nincurred automatically, to read, assert, preach, praise, print, \npublish, or defend them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther showed his disdain for the pope's decision by burning the bull \nalong with several books by popes. He also took time to reply to some \nof the charges leveled against him, and stuck by his opinions. As a \nconsequence, the pope excommunicated Luther early the next year.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland.

It was called to resolve a dogmatic \ncontroversy that had divided the church into two main camps. Theodore \nof Mopsuestia, supported by Nestorius, Archbishop of Constantinople, \nheld to what has become known as the Nestorian heresy. The opposite \ncamp was represented by Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, the pope, \nand emperor Theodosius the Younger. Theodosius, who called the \nCouncil, believed that the strength of his empire depended upon true \nworship of God without the intermingling of falsehood. Two hundred \nfathers attended.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nestorian teaching originated in the school of Antioch, and was \ntaught by Diodorus and by Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia. What was \nthe heresy? These men did not accept the Orthodox belief that the \nhuman and divine natures of Christ were united from the instant of \nthe Word's conception in the womb of Mary. A symbol of this \ncontroversy was the acceptance or non-acceptance of the title, \n\"Theotokos,\" or \"God Bearer,\" translated in the West to \"Mother of \nGod,\" for the Virgin Mary. Of course that did not mean that Mary was \nthe Mother of the eternal and indivisible Trinity, but that she was \nthe mother, not just of the man Christ, but of the complete God-man. \nIt was and remains in the Orthodox world as a title intended to \nemphasize the union of the two natures. But the term \"God-bearer\" is \nalso used for saints in the Orthodox church, such as the \"God-bearing \nFathers,\" meaning those who lived Christ-like lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius verbally and in writing refused to accept the title \nTheotokos (God-bearer) for Mary, the mother of Jesus. In doing so, \nthe rest of the church felt he he was proclaiming his refusal to \naccept the two natures of Christ. He was embittered by the refusal of \nthe \"other side\" to agree with his teaching.\u0014\nIt has been pointed out many times that there was competition -- \nsometimes fierce -- between Alexandria and Constantinople. Alexandria \nwanted a Patriarch who would understand the needs of the African \nChurch and listen to her theologians. They were very unhappy with \nNestorius. \u0014\nThe Council opened under Cyril, a thoroughly unsympathetic figure, \nand a master of political intrigue. He had the agreement of Pope \nCelestine (who was deceased by the time the council began). Cyril was \nno believer in fair play. He opened the proceedings before Nestorius \nand his supporters arrived. For this and other actions, historians \ncriticize Cyril of high-handedness; and of serving as both accuser \nand judge. But Cyril seems to have truly believed Nestorius was \nteaching heresy. In response he adopted a position of his own which \nwas close to the monophysite heresy.\u0014\nA careful reading of Nestorius has led some scholars to say he was no \nheretic. Certainly he set out to ensure that the manhood of Christ \nwas not lost in his deity, and eventually, grudgingly allowed the \nterm \"Theotokos\" to be used as long as it was understood Mary did not \nthereby become a deity. Whatever the faults of Cyril's approach, he \nand his camp believed that Nestorianism attacked a basic dogma of the \nChurch -- the very nature of Christ himself. They reacted fiercely, \nin the strongest way they knew how.\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S. Lives of the Saints.

For it understands that there is one \nGod, one essence, one principle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTrinity was just one issue that Peter Lombard dealt with. Medieval \nscholarship relied heavily on authority. To make the task of students \nand professors easier, the well-read teacher gathered crucial quotes \nfrom the main authorities into one work. The result was his Four \nBooks of Sentences.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter arranged quotes from the Bible and from the church Fathers by \ntopics in divisions called books. He subdivided all this material \nunderquestions. Since the authorities often did not agree, he \nanalyzed their language and gave his own resolution between them. But \nwhen it suited him, he made no attempt to resolve the differences. On \nthe whole, little in the work was original with him--which was as he \nintended.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of this, the Sentences became the foremost theology textbook \nof the thirteenth century, admired for their superb organization. \nLong after Peter died, which is sometimes given as this day, July 20, \n1164,** his work was the standard text in universities. In fact, it \nheld a prominent place until the sixteenth century. It was more \npopular than Thomas Aquinas' writings.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reason for their popularity was that he left many questions open, \ngiving later scholars opportunity to suggest their own answers. \nScholars who wanted to make a name for themselves wrote commentaries \non Peter'sSentences. Among those who did were such famous names as \nAquinas, Bonaventura, Scotus and Ockham.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis popularity brought Peter's work under attack. But the fourth \nLateran council (1215) upheld his orthodoxy. One complaint against \nhim was that he stressed the divinity of Christ over his humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of his influence as the author of the Sentences,Peter Lombard \nalso influenced church doctrine. He wrote that a sacrament is both a \nsymbol of grace and a means to grace. He decided that seven church \nfunctions fulfilled his conditions--baptism, confirmation, Eucharist \n(Protestants call it communion, or the Lord's Supper) Penance \n(confessing a sin and receiving a discipline for it), Extreme Unction \n(anointing with oil as a symbol of repentance and healing, usually \nwhen a person is at death's door), Holy Orders and Matrimony. The \nCouncil of Trent adopted Peter's position as the official doctrine of \nthe Roman Church. (For the most part, Protestants limit the \nsacraments to Baptism and the Lord's Supper.)\u0014\n\u0014\n*The quotes on the Trinity are adapted into modern English from \nRunes' Treasury of Philosophy.\u0014\n**Although most authorities do not suggest a date for Peter's death, \nEncyclopedia Americana, 1956, gives this as the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Will.

This principle acknowledges that God is the \nlandowner and Master, and we are the stewards or managers of what has \nbeen entrusted to our\u0014\ncare. Good stewardship requires spiritual detachment, contentment and \ngenerosity, as well as wisdom and skill.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine-human partnership.

    "words": "Pastor James MacDonald Disguises Himself as Homeless Man to Measure \nChurch's Compassion\u0014\nKayla Koslosky | ChristianHeadlines.com Editor | Wednesday, October \n17, 2018 \u0014\n\u0014\nIllinois megachurch Pastor James MacDonald recently performed a \nsocial experiment with his church and the results blew him away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe founder of the seven-campus Harvest Bible Chapel posted a video \nof an experiment where he dressed as a bearded homeless man and sat \noutside of two Harvest Bible Chapel campuses before Sunday services, \nobserving the churchgoers reactions to him. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian Post reports that MacDonald did the experiment to test \nhis congregations willingness to love their neighbor as themselves \nlike the bible commands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe video that MacDonald posted to his Facebook page on Monday, first \nshows MacDonald sitting in front of the church buildings with a cup \nfor change, a sign and a shopping cart. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen slowly, congregants begin to show up, and one by one they all \nwalk by the disguised pastor, without a single person offering help.  \u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point, the video shows one man contemplating what he should \ndo. The man walks toward and then away from MacDonald several times \nbefore finally deciding to just go inside the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The closer a person is to us and the less common the struggle, the \neasier it is to love,\" MacDonald says in the video. \"God forbid I \nfind out my wife has three months to live. I would quit my job and \nquit everything, right? What if it's just an acquaintance of yours \nand what if the problem is recurring How common is homelessness? How \nfrequently is the homeless person someone dear to us personally? \nNever,\" MacDonald proclaims.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe video then shows MacDonald, still in his disguise, walk through \nthe middle of the church sanctuary with his shopping cart and walk up \non stage. MacDonald then takes off his disguise layer by layer \nrevealing who was underneath the beard and ripped clothes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said to the congregation, \"So I took a few moments a couple of \nweeks ago and camped outside of a couple of our campuses and I wanted \nto see how we were doing when it is hardest to love.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDo you know that your father in Heaven is giving the same graces to \nthe person that is hardest for you to love? He is giving it. He \ndoesn't play favorites. He is giving the grace to everyone. If we are \ngoing to love like our father in Heaven loves, we don't get to play \nfavorites. By favorites I mean, so often we love the people when \nthere is some benefit in it for us,\" he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nMacDonald used the experiment in his sermon to illustrate that \"it's \nhardest to love when the problem is most common and the people are \nleast known.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So how did our church do in the video?\" he asked. \"I am going to \ntell you now  awesome.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMacDonald said, I was crying inside that beard. I cannot believe the \npeople at this church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite what the first few seconds of the video showed, that was only \na small number of people compared to the numerous church members who \napproached MacDonald. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of people that prayed with me and brought me food, \nMacDonald said while getting emotional. \u0014\nThe next clips in the video show dozens of people offering MacDonald \ncoffee, water, food, money, prayer, and even the Word of God. Several \npeople also invited the seemingly homeless man into the church to \njoin the service and to see the love of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I dressed up as a homeless man and sat outside our church. What I \nwitnessed blew me away,\" MacDonald wrote on Facebook.\u0014",

    "words": "What it means to be desperately poor as told to C. E. Jackson, Jr.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third horseman mentioned by John in Revela- \u0014\nttion 6 is economic distress. In our affluent \u0014\nsociety, we seldom think in terms of poverty and \u0014\nfamine-though we know very well thai more than \u0014\nhalf the earth's population goes to bed hungry \u0014\nevery night. Even in the prosperous United States, \u0014\nnot all people escape the hoofs of the third rider's \u0014\nhorse. In our city ghettos and in our rural slums \u0014\nthere are thousands of cases of the most abject \u0014\npoverty. \u0014\n\u0014\nC. E. Jackson, Jr., director of public relations \u0014\nfor the Elk & Duck Rivers Community Association \u0014\nin Tennessee, records a first-person report from a \u0014\nwoman victim of poverty. This mother tells in her \u0014\nown words, edited only for clarity and to conform \u0014\nto good grammar and good taste, what it is like to \u0014\nbe poor. Here is her story.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere I am, dirty, smelly, with no proper under- \u0014\nwear beneath this rotting dress. The stench of \u0014\nmy teeth makes me half sick. They're decaying, \u0014\nbut they'll never be fixed. That takes money. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is poverty? Poverty is getting up every \u0014\nmorning from a dirty and illness-stained mattress \u0014\n-a hard, lumpy mattress. Sheets? There are no \u0014\nsheets. They have long since been used for dia- \u0014\npers, for there are no real diapers, either. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe're like dogs in that we live in a world of \u0014\nsmells. There is the smell of young children woo \u0014\ncan't make it down that long path at night. \u0014\nThere is the smell of the filthy mattress. There is \u0014\nthe smell of food gone sour because the re- \u0014\nfrigerator doesn't work-it takes money to get \u0014\nit fixed. \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is being tired-dog tired-all the time. \u0014\nI can't remember when I wasn't tired. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me explain housekeeping with no money. \u0014\nFor breakfast, I give my children grits with no \u0014\nmargarine, or cornbread made without eggs or \u0014\noleo. For one thing, that kind of food doesn't \u0014\nuse up many dishes. What dishes there are, I \u0014\nwash in cold water. Why don't I use hot water? \u0014\nIt takes money to get something with which you \u0014\ncan heat it. Hot water is a luxury. We don't have \u0014\nluxuries. I use no soap, of course. Even the \u0014\ncheapest soap has to be saved for washing the old \u0014\nsheets I use for the baby's diapers. \u0014\n\u0014\nLook at these cracked red hands. Once I saved \u0014\nup for two months to buy ajar of Vaseline for my \u0014\nhands and for the baby's diaper rash. When I had \u0014\nthe money and went to buy the Vaseline, the \u0014\nprice had gone up two cents, and I didn't have \u0014\nanother two cents. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the summer, poverty is watching gnats and \u0014\nflies devour my baby's tears when he cries, which \u0014\nis much of the time. Our screens are torn, but we \u0014\npay so little rent that I know it's foolish even to \u0014\ntalk about getting them fixed. Poverty means \u0014\ninsects in your food, in your nose, in your eyes, \u0014\nand crawling over you while you sleep. Poverty is \u0014\nchildren with runny noses, even in the summer. \u0014\nAntihistamines are for the rich. \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is asking for help. I'll tell you how \u0014\nasking for help feels. You find out where the \u0014\noffice is, the one from which paupers are sup- \u0014\nposed to get help. When you find it, everybody \u0014\nis very busy and official. After an eternity, a \u0014\nwoman comes out to you and you tell her you \u0014\n.need help. She isn't the one you need to see. The \u0014\nfirst one never is. She sends you to see someone \u0014\nelse and, after spilling your poverty and shame all \u0014\nover her desk, you find out this isn't the right \u0014\noffice. Then you repeat the whole performance. \u0014\n\u0014\nwe were happy once \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is remembering-remembering quitting \u0014\nschool in junior high because the nice children \u0014\nfrom nice homes were so cruel about your clothes \u0014\nand your smell. \u0014\n\u0014\nI remember mostly being married. I was so \u0014\nyoung. I'm still young, but you can't tell it. In \u0014\nanother town, for a little while, we had most of \u0014\nthe things you have-a little house with lights, \u0014\nhot water, and everything. Then my husband \u0014\nlost his job. For a little while there was some un- \u0014\nemployment insurance, but soon all our nice \u0014\nthings were repossessed and we moved back here. \u0014\nI was pregnant at the time. This house didn't \u0014\nlook so bad when we first moved in. Every week \u0014\nit got worse, though. Nothing was ever fixed. \u0014\nSoon we didn't have any money at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy husband got a few odd jobs, but every- \u0014\nthing went for food-just as it does now. I'll \u0014\nnever know how we lived through three years \u0014\nand three babies, but we did. After that last baby, \u0014\nI just plain destroyed my marriage. Would you \u0014\nwant to bring another baby into this filth? I \u0014\ndidn't, and birth-control measures take money. \u0014\n\u0014\nI hope my husband has been able to climb out \u0014\nof this mess somewhere. He never could hope to \u0014\ndo it here, with us to drag him down. \u0014\nIt was after he left that I first asked for help. \u0014\nI finally got it-$78 a month for the four of us. \u0014\nThat's why there is no soap, no medicine, no \u0014\nneedles, no hot water, no aspirin, no hand cream, \u0014\nno shampoo-none ~f these things, ever. And \u0014\nforever. I pay $20 a month rent. The rest goes \u0014\nfor food-grits, cornmeal, rice, beans, and milk. \u0014\n\u0014\nbetter off in prison \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is looking into a future colored only the \u0014\nblackest black. There is no hope. My boys will \u0014\nsomeday turn into boys who steal to get what \u0014\nthey need. I can already see them behind prison \u0014\nbars, but it doesn't bother me as it would you. \u0014\nThey'll be better off behind prison bars than they \u0014\nwould be behind the bars of my poverty and \u0014\ndespair. They'll find the freedom of alcohol and \u0014\ndrugs-the only freedom they'll ever know. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy daughter? She'll have a life just like mine, \u0014\nunless she's pretty enough to become a prostitute. \u0014\nI'd be smart to wish her dead already. \u0014\nMy children have worms, pinkeye, infections \u0014\nof all sorts all the time. The health clinics are in \u0014\nthe towns, and I live eight miles from any town. \u0014\nI can walk that far, but my little children can't, \u0014\nand I can't carry-them. \u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is an acid that eats into pride until \u0014\npride is burned out. It is a chisel that chips at \u0014\nhonor until honor is pulverized. You might do \u0014\nsomething, if you were in my situation, for a \u0014\nweek or a month. Would you do it year after \u0014\nyear, getting nowhere? \u0014\n\u0014\nEven I can dream, though. I dream of a time \u0014\nwhen there will be money-money for the right \u0014\nkind of food, for medicine, for vitamins, for a \u0014\ntoothbrush, for hand cream, for a hammer and \u0014\nnails, for screens, for needles and thread. and ... \u0014\nbut I know it's only a dream! \u0014",

    "words": "Pamphilius Beheaded for Faith\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost everyone who has read church history is familiar with the name \nof Eusebius of Caesaria, the man who gave us a priceless pastiche of \nthe first three centuries of Christianity. But Eusebius could not \nhave put together his valuable work if it had not been for his \nmentor, Pamphilius. Pamphilius collected the library that Eusebius \nlater mined for ecclesiastical detail.\u0014\n\u0014\nPamphilius was born in the third century in Berytus (now known as \nBeirut). He studied in Alexandria under a Christian teacher named \nPierius and became an ardent fan of the writings of the theologian \nOrigen. Later, as a priest in Caesarea, Palestine, Pamphilius trained \nnumbers of students and amassed a great number of documents in his \nschool library. Many of these he copied with his own hand. He did not \nmerely lecture on Christianity, but practiced its teachings of \nbrotherly love, treating slaves and servants as sons and brothers. He \ndevoted himself to producing accurate copies of the scriptures and \ngave them to students and pious women.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong his pupils was the young man who would become famed as the \nfirst notable church historian--Eusebius. Eusebius was so fond of \nPamphilius that he wrote his life (now lost). When Pamphilius died a \nmartyr, Eusebius renamed himself \"Eusebius of Pamphilius.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 306 one of Pamphilius' pupils challenged the idol worship of the \nlocal governor, Urbanus. This aggravated local persecution against \nChristians; not only was the youth tortured and executed but so were \nother Christians. In November 307, the governer arrested Pamphilius. \nWhen he refused to sacrifice to idols, Urbanus tortured the godly \nscholar and threw him into prison. Despite the risks involved, \nEusebius visited him often. The two co-authored a defense of Origen, \nshowing that the Alexandrian scholar's views on the Trinity and \nincarnation were sound, even if other teachings were not (the church \nwould later condemn Origen's works as heretical). Only volume one of \nthis defense of Origen has survived and only in a bad Latin \ntranslation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he came to write his church history, Eusebius consulted the \nworks Pamphilius had collected. These included early editions of the \nscriptures and an original Hebrew version of Matthew's gospel. Sad to \nsay, this irreplaceable resource was destroyed by invading Muslims in \nthe seventh century.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirminius replaced Urbanus as governor. He ordered Pamphilius killed. \nAfter languishing in prison for more than two years, Pamphilius was \nbeheaded on this day, February 16, 309.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBacchus, F.

    "title": "POST-EXILIC PROPHETS",
    "words": "POST-EXILIC PROPHETS \u0014\n\u0014\nThere can be no doubt that a change came over \u0014\nHebrew prophecy at the exile. This change can be \u0014\nseen in the book of Ezekiel. Chapters one to \u0014\ntwenty-four are filled with condemnation and warning, \u0014\nwhile chapters twenty-five through forty-eight are \u0014\nconcerned largely with the future fortunes of \u0014\nIsrael \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, as we move farther into the post- \u0014\nexilic period fewer and fewer prophets arise. More \u0014\nemphasis is put on keeping the law. Many of the \u0014\npeople believed that the Babylonian Captivity had \u0014\ncome upon them because of their failure to keep \u0014\nthe law. Therefore, they were determined not to \u0014\noffend at this point again. They became very rigid \u0014\nin their interpretation of the law. No new idea \u0014\ncould be accepted in such an atmosphere. The times \u0014\nwere legalistic and priestly rather than free and \u0014\nprophetic.\u0014\n \u0014\nTherefore, we should not be surprised when the \u0014\nprophets who did arise (Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) \u0014\nwere not so well known or so well received as were \u0014\nthe pre-exilic prophets. These post-exilic prophets \u0014\nwere less original than their earlier predecessors. \u0014\nThey repeated the great truths which had been \u0014\nenunciated earlier. They appealed to their earlier \u0014\ncounterparts for their authority (Zech. 1:4; 7:7, 12). \u0014\nPost-exilic prophets were more legalistic. Haggai \u0014\nand Zechariah were much more interested in rebuilding \u0014\nthe temple than Jeremiah was in saving it. Malachi \u0014\nwas greatly alarmed because the people were offer- \u0014\ning improper sacrifices and were failing to tithe. \u0014\n\u0014\nPost-exilic prophets put less emphasis on the \u0014\nmoral, ethical, and the spiritual. When men put \u0014\nmore stress on the institutions or the ritual of \u0014\nreligion, by necessity less emphasis is put on the \u0014\nidea or the application of religion. This happened \u0014\nin the post-exilic period. \u0014\n\u0014\nPost-exilic prophecy is more apocalyptic. Apo- \u0014\ncalyptic literature has been described as \"good news \u0014\nfor bad times.\" Apocalyptic literature was an out \u0014\ngrowth of the Prophetic movement. After long periods \u0014\nof suffering and disappointments, many of the people \u0014\nof God began to despair of any better life under their \u0014\nown power. A better world could only come by the \u0014\ndirect and personal intervention of God Himself on \u0014\nbehalf of his people. Apocalyptic literature was \u0014\nproduced to comfort and assure such people. It is \u0014\nmarked by Visions, angels, anonymity, and God's inter- \u0014\nvention in history. All of these traits are found \u0014\nin the these prophets.\u0014\n\u0014\nPost-exilic prophecy is more Messianic. Closely \u0014\nrelated to the\" fourth characteristic is this emphasis \u0014\non the com1ng Messianic age. This does not mean \u0014\nthat the pre-exilic prophets were not interested in \u0014\nthe coming of the Messiah. That certainly would \u0014\nnot be true of Isaiah--the Prince of Old Testament \u0014\nprophets. But it is generally recognized that not \u0014\nmuch that is Messianic is found in such books as Amos, \u0014\nHosea, Obadiah, Nahum, Habakkuk and even Jeremiah. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Paterson says that the Messianic hope \u0014\nbecomes more concrete and definite in the post- \u0014\nexilic period. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was perhaps inevitable that when the vision \u0014\ntarried too long men should seek to hasten the \u0014\npurpose of God. Hope deferred makes the heart \u0014\nsick, and prophecies unfulfilled gave rise to \u0014\nvisionary apocalypticists, on one hand, or to men \u0014\nlike the Zealots, on the other, who were will- \u0014\ning to force the hand of God and bring about \u0014\nspiritual ends by physical means (p. 217).\"\u0014\n \u0014\nH. W. Robinson says, \"It was, in fact, the Messianic \u0014\nhope that built the second temple\". \u0014\nAlthough the post-exilic prophets did not rise \u0014\nto the heights of their predecessors we must not \u0014\nleave the impression they were of little or no \u0014\nimportance. These prophets stood in a day when \u0014\nfaith in God and his purposes were being challenged \u0014\nboth from within and without the covenant commu- \u0014\nnity, Although they were not too original they did \u0014\nnot have to be. The faith had been \"once delivered \u0014\nto the Saints,\" and their task was not to conjure \u0014\nup some new idea, but to call men back to the God \u0014\nof their fathers. Their emphasis was largely put \u0014\nupon the legalistic and the ritual, and although \u0014\nthat is not of ultimate importance it is primary, \u0014\nThat was the great need in their day. The temple \u0014\nwas in ruins and men needed a tangible institution \u0014\nthrough which they could confess their faith. \u0014\nNeither were these. post-exilic prophets wholly \u0014\nlacking in moral and spiritual emphasis. Zechariah \u0014\nsays that the real sins for which Israel was suffering \u0014\nwere social ones such as injustice, falsehood, and \u0014\noppression (cf. 7:8-14). Malachi indicated that in \u0014\njudgment God would purge his land of sorcerers, \u0014\nadulterers, false swearers, and those who oppress \u0014\nthe hirelings, widows, and orphans (3:5). It was \u0014\nZechariah who noted, that the brighter day could only \u0014\ncome through a spiritual revival and not social \u0014\nreform or political revolution, \"Not by might nor \u0014\nby power\" but by my spirit, saith Yahweh\" (4:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most important thing about these \u0014\nprophets is the fact that they were post-exilic. \u0014\nThey survived the exile with the loss of the land, \u0014\ntheir people, and their temple; yet they were not \u0014\ndefeated. They were among those who built their \u0014\nhope on something more than brick or stone or polit- \u0014\nical and religious institutions. They believed \u0014\nthey were still God's people and He was their God~ \u0014\ntherefore they refused to sit down and be defeated. \u0014\ninstead they called the people back and challenged \u0014\nthem to begin a new. \u0014\n\u0014\nA. C. Welch said: \u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of sitting down to lament over what \u0014\nwas gone and could never come back, it rall~ \u0014\nied on that which it could never lose except \u0014\nby its own choiceo It's religion, which had \u0014\nbeen the nerve of its first beginning, gave \u0014\nit hope and strength to begin anew~ History \u0014\nhas many dramatic scenes and contrasts in \u0014\nits look of remembrance, but in all its \u0014\nlong gallery there is no contrast so vivid \u0014\nas that between the fall of Nineveh and the \u0014\nfall of Israel. Assyria passed out of \u0014\nhistory in one swift hour of collapse, \u0014\nbecause it had nothing on which it could \u0014\nrally, for in this unstable world it is \u0014\nthe unseen things which abide and sustain. \u0014\nThese came to the rescue of Israel which \u0014\nNineveh had beaten to its knees (Post- \u0014\nExilic Judaism, p. 10).\"\u0014\n \u0014\nIsrael survived the exile partially because \u0014\nshe realized that which had befallen her was just \u0014\nchastisement for her sin. \u0014\n\u0014\nMen who face defeat after this fashion \u0014\nare unbroken in spirit: so long as they \u0014\nretain temper, they are indomitable. \u0014\nWhen a nation faces the shattering blows\u0014\nof fate with brave self-discipline, and \u0014\nhas humility and courage enough to confess \u0014\nthat its failure has been largely due to \u0014\nits own perversity, it reveals its native \u0014\nsincerity of outlook and toughness of \u0014\nfibre. And when it unites with this the \u0014\nconviction that even defeat has a meaning, \u0014\nsince it does not come from blind chance \u0014\nbut from One who has the world in His \u0014\nkeeping, it has not surrendered its soul \u0014\ninto the power of things, To remember \u0014\nthe past after this wholesome fashion is \u0014\nat once to believe in a future and to \u0014\nprepare for it.\u0014",

    "words": "Pierre Poiret's Sober Mysticism\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n Pierre Poiret's Sober Mysticism \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many ways to approach the Scriptures. One of the common \nmethods of interpretation today is called Dispensationalism. This is \na fancy word which means that God deals with mankind using different \nsystems during different eras.\u0014\n\u0014\nDispensationalism is often traced back to John Darby, who made it \npopular. However, the first man to develop a fully worked out \ndispensationalist system was Pierre Poiret. His system said that God \nhas dealt with or will deal with people on earth under seven \ndispensations (or economies) between creation and the end of the \nMillennium (the thousand year rule of Christ).\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre's parents died when he was young. To support himself, the \nyoung Frenchman learned engraving. Meanwhile, he studied theology. \nFor a while, he fell under the spell of Rene Descartes philosophy. \nBut when he saw that it led thinkers like Spinoza into Deism, he \nrebelled against it, becoming a mystic and studying the works of men \nlike Tauler, Thomas  Kempis and the Dutchman Jansz van Barneveldt. A \nmystic is a person who believes that one can know God intimately and \npowerfully, directly with his or her inner spirit. Unlike many \nmystics, who tend to go astray under the spell of their own mental or \nspiritual impressions, Pierre never wavered from the doctrine of the \ntrinity and always appealed to Scripture as his final authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis advice was often very practical. For example, he wrote that to \nsuccessfully renounce ourselves and no longer follow our sensual \nnature, we must pray continually. But prayer must be more than \nmouthing words. People who do that insult God:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...Such men will say God is their father, without wishing to obey \nHim like children. Hallowed be thy name, they will say, when in \nreality they despise and dishonor Him, preferring their own honor and \nwill to that of God...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre pastored several churches. Later he left the pulpit in order \nto follow Antoinette Bourignon, another mystic; he spent years \nstudying with her and after her death, wrote a defense of her. His \nbooks collecting the lives and writings of mystics showed that \nmysticism was defensible. Some of his arguments in favor of it caused \nhis contemporaries to revise their theologies.\u0014\n\u0014\nPierre died on this day, May 21, 1719. His influence lived on through \nhis disciple Gerhard Tersteegen and in the Pietistic movement which \nattempted to give Christian life more feeling and make it less formal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Fremantle, Anne.

For example, we thank God for \u0014\ncreating us, for preserving our lives to this \u0014\nday, for loving us, for sending Jesus to our \u0014\nworld, for forgiving our sins, for giving us \u0014\nhope for the future, for our homes, for our \u0014\nfamilies, for our friends, for the church, \u0014\nfor giving the Spirit to the church, for our \u0014\ncountry, for meaningful work and for many \u0014\nother things. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, we offer worship to God. \u0014\nWorship is similar to thanksgiving, but \u0014\nthe two differ in that thanksgiving is about \u0014\nthings God has done and worship tends to \u0014\nbe about who God is and what God is like. \u0014\nSo in worship we say things such \u0014\nas \"We worship you, 0 God of love and \u0014\nkindness\" and \"We adore you, our Creator, \u0014\nfor your goodness and mercy\" and \"We bow \u0014\nbefore you, Lord of the universe, God of \u0014\npower and wisdom.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThird, we confess our sins. We may do \u0014\nthis in a very general way. For example, \u0014\n\"We have not loved you with all our hearts, \u0014\nand we have not loved our neighbors as \u0014\nourselves.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes, though, in private, we \u0014\nwill want to confess very specific sins. For \u0014\nexample, \"Lord, I lost my temper and hurt \u0014\nsomeone I love.\" Often our prayers of \u0014\nconfession are accompanied with a request \u0014\nfor forgiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Lord, have mercy on me, for I have \u0014\ndone things I ought not to have done, and \u0014\nI have left undone things I ought to have \u0014\ndone.\" John wrote, \"If we confess our sins, \u0014\nhe who is faithful and just will forgive us\" \u0014\n(1 John 1:9). \u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, we make requests. Requests for \u0014\nourselves are called petitions, and requests \u0014\nfor other people are called intercessions. \u0014\nSome Christians think it is immature or \u0014\neven naive to ask God for things, but many \u0014\nof the prayers in the Bible are requests. The \u0014\nLord's Prayer contains six requests. \u0014\nOf course, we must not be greedy \u0014\nwhen we pray, but it certainly is all right to \u0014\nask God for the things we and others need. \u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, in prayer we offer ourselves to God.\u0014\nWe pray, as Isaiah did centuries ago, \"Here \u0014\nam I; send me!\" (Isa. 6:8). \u0014\n\u0014\nWe Christians commit ourselves to \u0014\nlive as God's people and to follow the way \u0014\nof Jesus with the help of the Spirit in the \u0014\nfellowship of the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese five kinds of prayer can be \u0014\nbriefly stated this way: \"Thank you. We \u0014\nworship you. We have sinned. Help us. We \u0014\ngive ourselves to you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not necessary while we are praying \u0014\nto distinguish these kinds of prayer from \u0014\neach other. Still, it can be instructive to be \u0014\naware that there are several kinds of prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------\u0014\nIs prayer the same thing as meditation \u0014\nand contemplation? \u0014\n\u0014\nOften these three words are used inter- \u0014\nchangeably. However, these are three distinct \u0014\npractices, and some writers use each word to \u0014\nspeak of just one of the three practices. \u0014\n\u0014\nContemplation is silence. \"Be still and \u0014\nknow that I am God\" (Ps. 46:10). You \u0014\nremain quiet in the confidence that the \u0014\nSpirit of God always lives in your heart. You \u0014\nallow the chatter in your mind to fade away, \u0014\ncontent to sit calmly in the presence of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeditation is repetition. \"On his law \u0014\nthey meditate day and night\" (Ps. 1:2). You \u0014\nquietly repeat over and over in your mind \u0014\na Bible passage such as \"I will fear no evil\" \u0014\n(Ps.23:4). \u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer is talking to God. Jesus said, \u0014\n\"When you pray, say, 'Our Father ... '\" \u0014\n(Matt. 6:9). Think of yourself as God's \u0014\nchild, and talk to God as children talk to \u0014\ntheir parents.\u0014",

    "words": "Pastor and Mental Health Advocate Jarrid Wilson Dies by Suicide \u0014\nBefore his death, he tweeted, Loving Jesus doesnt always cure \nsuicidal thoughts.\u0014\nROXANNE STONE, EMILY MCFARLAND MILLER, ALEJANDRA MOLINA - RELIGION \nNEWS SERVICE\u0014\n\u0014\nSEPTEMBER 10, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nJarrid Wilson, a California church leader, author, and mental health \nadvocate, died by suicide Monday evening (Sept. 9, 2019) at age 30 on \n\"Suicide Prevention Day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson, known as a passionate preacher, most recently was an \nassociate pastor at megachurch Harvest Christian Fellowship in \nRiverside, California. A co-founder of the mental health nonprofit \nAnthem of Hope, Wilson was open about his own depression, often \nposting on his social media accounts about his battles with the \nmental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a time like this, there are just no words, said Harvest senior \npastor Greg Laurie.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes people may think that as pastors or spiritual leaders we \nare somehow above the pain and struggles of everyday people. We are \nthe ones who are supposed to have all the answers. But we do not, \nLaurie said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the day, pastors are just people who need to reach out \nto God for his help and strength, each and every day, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis wife, Julianne Wilson, posted a photo tribute of her husband on \nInstagram. The photo slideshow shows him fishing in his happy \nplace. She described her husband as loving, giving, kind-hearted, \nencouraging, handsome, hilarious.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo more pain, my jerry, no more struggle. You are made complete and \nyou are finally free, she wrote in the caption.\u0014\nSuicide doesnt get the last word. I wont let it. You always said \nHope Gets the last word. Jesus does, she added.\u0014\n\u0014\nNews of Wilsons passing followed a series of tweets the young pastor \nposted throughout the day Monday that dealt with suicide, including a \npost encouraging followers to remember that even though loving Jesus \ndoesnt cure illnesses such as depression, PTSD or anxiety, Jesus \ndoes offer companionship and comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving Jesus doesnt always cure suicidal thoughts.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving Jesus doesnt always cure depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving Jesus doesnt always cure PTSD.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving Jesus doesnt always cure anxiety.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that doesnt mean Jesus doesnt offer us companionship and \ncomfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe ALWAYS does that.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson also posted on the same day that he was officiating a funeral \nfor a woman who had died by suicide. Kay Warren  who along with her \nhusband, Saddleback Church pastor Rick Warren, lost their son to \nsuicide in 2013  responded to Wilsons tweet with encouragement. \nPraying, Jarrid. Her devastated family needs so much tenderness and \ncompassion right now. Grateful for your willingness to be the arms of \nJesus to them, Warren wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe news of Wilsons death comes on Suicide Awareness Day, September \n10, and follows a number of high profile suicides among pastors and \nthe mental health community, including by 30-year-old Andrew \nStoecklein, a pastor in Chino, California, who often preached about \nmental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson shared openly about his own mental health challenges in his \nmost recent book, Love Is Oxygen: How God Can Give You Life and \nChange Your World, and blog posts. He blogged earlier this summer \nthat he had dealt with severe depression throughout most of my life \nand contemplated suicide on multiple occasions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn social media, he regularly encouraged others dealing with similar \nchallenges with messages like, Im a Christian who also struggles \nwith depression. This exists, and its okay to admit it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBreaking down the stigma of mental illness is one of the goals of \nAnthem of Hope, the nonprofit the pastor founded with his wife, Juli, \nin 2016. Anthem of Hope creates resources for the church to assist \nthose dealing with depression, anxiety, self-harm, addiction and \nsuicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaurie said Wilson wanted to especially help those who were dealing \nwith suicidal thoughts.\u0014\n\u0014\nTragically, Jarrid took his own life, Laurie said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years, I have found that people speak out about what they \nstruggle with the most, Laurie added.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his summer blog post, Wilson challenged the idea some Christians \nhave that those who die by suicide are condemned to hell.\u0014\nChristians wouldnt tell someone with a physical illness like cancer \nthey are going to hell because of their diagnosis, he noted. Neither \nshould they assume it of people with mental illnesses, which can \nlead many people to do things they wouldnt otherwise do if they \ndidnt struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who say suicide automatically leads to hell obviously dont \nunderstand the totality of mental health issues in todays world, let \nalone understand the basic theology behind compassion and Gods \nall-consuming grace, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must do better at educating people on things they have a hard \ntime wrapping their heads around. And mental health is definitely (a) \ntopic Christians around the world must yearn to better understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustin Herman said he knew Wilson from working as a pastor in \nRiverside. They would cross paths and talk about mental health and \nabortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know the guy loved Jesus and I know that he loved what he was \ndoing, loved his family, Herman said.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Herman, Wilson was not just going with the program of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was counter to culture and shaped culture in a lot of ways, \nHerman said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to his wife, Wilson is survived by two sons, Finch and \nDenham; and his mother, father, and siblings\u0014",

She said her \nconscience had made her miserable and then added, \"Daddy, when you \ntold us about the peanut brittle, I knew I had to tell about the \ncake!\"  The next morning at breakfast Ruth acknowledged her \nwrongdoing, and this brought about confessions from her brothers.

He was distressed to read that the depression gripping the \nnation was causing fear and panic among the people. Factories were \nstopping production and thousands were unemployed.  Although Lanthier \nwas not a big industrialist, but only a clerk, he had one important \ndistinction.  He was a man who had great faith in God!\u0014\n\u0014\n     Concerned with the grim economic situation, he sent a note to \nall his business acquaintances, telling them that each day at noon a \nprayer meeting would be held in his office.  With high hopes he \narranged 20 chairs in a circle, but the first day no one came.  All \nalone he prayed fervently that God would bring about a change in him \nand in America.  The second day he was encouraged, for a few friends \njoined him.  It wasn't long before all 20 chairs were occupied.  A \nshort time later a similar gathering was started on Wall Street, \nanother on Williams Street, and finally a fourth on Broadway.  Then \nlike wildfire the movement spread to all parts of the country, The \nmoral tone of the nation was affected, and there was a great upsurge \nin the spiritual life of the people.

Without a vision the people perish (Pro. 29:18).\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"This is what happened in the Korean War. The majority of our men \nwho were taken captive never tried to escape.

    "words": "Bill Hybels writes:  \"The Anthropic Principle, which is very \nprevalent in the world of secular science and philosophy, didn't \noriginate with Christian scholars.  Simply stated, the Anthropic \nPrinciple implies that when we look at the world around us, it would \nseem that the universe was somehow designed to support and nourish \nhuman life.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"For example, if the ratio of carbon to oxygen had been slightly \ndifferent than it is, none of us would have been here to breathe the \nair. Change the title of the earth's axis slightly in one direction, \nand we would freeze.  Change it the other direction, and we'd burn \nup.  The lesson we can draw from the Anthropic Principle is this: \nSomeone must have gone to a lot of effort to make things just right \nso that you and I could be here to enjoy life.  We must really matter \nto God!\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"In the world of business, there's been a radical transformation \nduring the last few years. Cutting-edge management experts have been \ntalking about these developments in grandiose terms.  Tom Peters \nrefers to a 'customer revolution,' and Ken Blanchard talks about the \n'upside-down pyramid.'\u0014\n\"It's time to turn over the corporate pyramid, these experts say, and \nget back to serving the person 'at the top'--and that's the customer, \nNOT the boss.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"So if the lesson from science is that people matter to God, then \nthe lesson from business is they'd better matter to US, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Becoming a Contagious Christian by Bill Hybels and Mark \nMittelberg.

One day Dan noticed a bad rash on Billy's arms and he asked \nhim about it.  \"Oh, that's just something I get whenever I'm all \nknotted up inside.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dan asked what he was so worried about.  Billy explained that 100 \npeople were coming for summer camp the following week.  Because of \nheavy rains that spring, the grass on the campground was knee high.  \nHe couldn't get it mowed because his power mower had quit working and \nhis tractor was broken down and wouldn't be fixed for two weeks.  He \nwas at wit's end about it.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dan suggested he ask God to help him figure out something.  \"I \nhadn't thought about that,\" said Billy.  \"I've always handled \neverything on my own.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Well, it can't hurt to ask,\" Dan said. \"Maybe God can help you \nout.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The next week when Dan ran into Billy in town, he asked the \nrancher how things were going.  Billy said, \"Great!  The day after I \ntalked to you, I was sitting up there looking at that huge field of \ngrass, and I said, `OK, God, if You exist, please help me out.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few minutes later, Billy had gotten the idea to go over to his \nneighbor's place and see if he wanted to graze any horses in that \npasture.  Come to find out, the neighbor had been looking for a place \nto graze six of his horses.  Billy's acre of high grass was the \nperfect solution--to both their problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"He brought the horses over that afternoon,\" said Billy, \"and by \nthe time camp started yesterday, that field looked like it had been \nmowed and trimmed by professionals!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Wonderful,\" Dan exclaimed and commented that Billy's arm rash \nseemed to have cleared up.\u0014\n    \"Yeah,\" said Billy rubbing the smooth skin on his tanned arms.  \n\"I finally got some peace of mind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Pursuit, Vol 70, No 2, 1996.
