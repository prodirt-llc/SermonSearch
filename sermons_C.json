    "words": "A charismatic revival continues to sweep across South Africa. \nHundreds of charismatic churches have been started since 1979 and are \nbridging the racial gap better than other groups seem to be able to. \nAlong with the political change that has begun, observers detect a \nprocess of cultural change in which charismatics are in the \nforefront. Through these churches blacks and whites both are being \nshown a new vision of the lordship of Christ.  Research has shown \nthat South African charismatics are surprisingly open and sincerely \ndesire to bring apartheid to an end.\u0014\n\u0014\n    About 5 to 10% of whites in South Africa belong to independent \ncharismatic churches.  If traditional Pentecostals and black \nindependent churches are included, it may be that 35% of the nation's \npeople are involved in charismatic churches. These churches attract \n20 to 60% blacks, reflecting a level of integration found in no other \norganization.  When 130 people in these churches were surveyed about \nthe South African law that keeps people living in separate areas \nbased on skin color, all but three said that it was sinful.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Charismatics and apartheid\" by Irving Hexham and Karla \nPoewe-Hexham.

    "words": "\"Cambridge is an unlikely place for a spiritual rebirth, since \nthe city is dominated by a great secular university and high-tech \neconomics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Britain has become increasingly secular in recent years, and \nchurch attendance has dwindled, but renewal seems to be sprouting in \na most unlikely place--Cambridge.  Though heavily influenced by the \npresence of a large secular university and high-tech business \nconcerns, there are a dozen or more flourishing evangelical and \ncharismatic congregations in the city.  Churches like St. Andrew's \nStreet Baptist and Holy Trinity(Anglican) attract thousands of \ncollege students as well as townspeople (most from a high-church \nbackground).\u0014\n\u0014\n   One observer attributes the effectiveness of these churches to \nfour factors.  (1) In contrast to the liberal clergy who often seem \nmore concerned about politics than spirituality, the pastors of these \nchurches concentrate on preaching expositorily through entire books \nof Scripture. (2) Programs and services are informal but well- \norganized.  The fact that they are not liturgical appeals to younger \npeople.  (3) Parishioners and attenders are given many opportunities \nto serve-- in the church and in the community.  One of the \ncongregations, for example, operates a restaurant, homeless shelter, \njob center, and bookstore. Another has an extensive food ministry.  \n(4) They are reaching out to students and the unchurched. Some of the \nchurches have started new churches in outlying areas.\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Cambridge, England, is seeing....\" National & International \nReligion Report, Aug 9, 1993. Page 1.

    "words": "\"The media rarely pay attention to Angola, where death from \nmalnutrition is routine and war is constant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Countries in Africa receive $60 billion in aid from the \nindustrialized world each year, but since one-third of those \ncountries (16 of them) are at war, the same nations that send aid \nmake profits of $125 billion annually on the weapons they sell in \nAfrica.  Worse yet, the industrialized nations seem totally \nindifferent to what is going on in Africa.\u0014\n   Angola, rarely mentioned by the media, is a prime example. Death \nfrom malnutrition is commonplace there, and civil war has been raging \never since Portugal withdrew as a colonial power in 1975.\u0014\n   The United States, as the world's only superpower, has an \nobligation to deal with situations like this.  If we would devote the \nsame sort of energy and motivation to them as we did to Operation \nDesert Storm, many world problems would be solvable. However, current \nU.S. foreign policy is driven by domestic politics rather than a \ncoherent moral vision concerning long-range humanitarian needs.  In \nthe past, the United States used African countries as pawns in the \ncold war, but now that the Soviet Union is no longer an influence in \nthe region, U.S. policy ignores Africa except when the fights and \nfamines get bad enough to attract media attention.\u0014\n   Even though Angola is a potentially rich nation, world \nindifference has left it standing today on the brink of mass \nstarvation.  The ongoing civil war is between the elected government \nof President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.  \nFor years the United States backed Savimbi while Dos Santos had the \nsupport of the Soviets.  Both sides have tapped other sources of \nfunds in recent years in order to continue the conflict.  Meanwhile, \nan estimated three million of Angola's 11 million people need \nemergency food assistance.\u0014\n \u0014\n      \"Countering indifference\" by James Wall.

It is an English \nhorn because all the other good names for instruments had all ready \nbeen taken.\u0014\n\u0014\n      The trombone is so long that if it was stretched out end to\u0014\nend, it would surprise many people.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      A bassoon looks like nothing I have ever heard.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      By shortening and lengthening tubing filled with air, high and \nlow\u0014\nsounds can be made. Only wind instruments can understand this well \nenough to make it work for them.\u0014\n\u0014\n      When electric currents go through them guitars start making \nsounds. So would anybody.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Many things about electronic instruments that were once thought \nto be science fiction now actually are.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Reeds are little pieces of wood. They are found mostly in \nplants and clarinets.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      When we blow into a whistle, the air is pushed together is \nsome  places and pulled apart in others.

Their skin can be stretched to have them make high or \nlow sounds.\u0014\n\u0014\n      A virtuoso is a musician with real high morals.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      A singer's repertoire is the music he actually thought he could\u0014\nsing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      He was a great viali -  vyalia -  vilia -  fidler.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      Minnesingers traveled from town to town. They didn't sing too \ngood, which is one reason they kept traveling.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The concertmaster of an orchestra is always the person who sits \nin the first chair of the first violins. This means that when a \nperson is\u0014\nelected concertmaster, he has to hurry up and learn how to play the\u0014\nviolin real good.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Anyone who can read all the instrument notes at the same time \ngets to be the conductor.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Podiums are somethings for conductors to step on.

Answer: God. \nQuestion: who composed the Hallelujah Chorus?\u0014\n      Answer: George Fredric Doorknob.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      My very best liked piece is the Bronze Lullaby.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      My favorite carol is Old Cumalye Faithful. Old Cumalye Faithful \nwas Jesus' dog.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Brahm's Lullaby has such velvety fingers.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Although Rossini was once considered a great composer of \noperas, we now know of operas he failed to compose.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      It is not known for certain who wrote the Third Symphony. some \nsay Brahms and some say Baithoven and some say let them both.\u0014\n\u0014\n      I like to listen to the Sorcerer's Appendix.\u0014\n\u0014\n     *****Our Mortal composers:\u0014\n     Chopin had many fast friends. Among the fastest was Miss Sand. \nBach died from 1750 to the present.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      Bach wasn't believing in smoking and drinking or hardly living \nat\u0014\nall.\u0014\n     Johann Christian Bach was Johann Sebastian Bach's son. Otherwise \nthey were unrelationed.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Haydn and Mozart were friends at first but later became\u0014\ncontemporaries. Haydn got married when he was 28 years old and\u0014\nbecame the father of classical music.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Handel was a deeply religious man because in some of his music \nhe talks about Ye and Thee and people like that.\u0014\n\u0014\n      When they asked Handel if he would like to come to England, he \nrolled his eyes and flashed his teeth and said sure.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Question: What was the soundest reason for Handel staying in\u0014\nEngland?\u0014\n      Answer:  The sound of everyone shouting Bravo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English; he was\u0014\nrather large.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Mozart was a great musician because he practiced without having \nsomeone having to be there to hit him over the head with a\u0014\nhangernade.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      He never forgot to practice and even when he did he was sorry. \nBy the time Wolfgang Mozart was 10 years old, he had reached the\u0014\npinocle of success. When Mozart couldn't get a job in a royal court,\u0014\nhis bread and butter was cut right out from under his feet.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Ludwig van Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He \nwas so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest \neven when everybody was calling him. I guess he couldn't hear so \ngood. He was a very wise man, even a genius so he never got married.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Beethoven was a perfectionist. In fact he tore up and in other \nways decomposed many of his compositions.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died from this.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Felix Mendelssohn seems to have been happy, honest and \nwell-liked,although a musician.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Richard Wagner was born in 1813, supposably on his birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Franz Schubert was always poor. His life teaches us the \nadvantage of enjoying what we have, even if there isn't any.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Schubert didn't make much money and we would hardly have heard \nhim if he hadn't written some music.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Then Tchaikovsky did something he had never done before. He \ndied.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      They had a wonderful funeral for him. It took six men to carry \nthe aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein.\u0014\n\u0014\n      When it came to writing music for operas, Wagner proved he had \na smart head up his sleeve. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n     \u0014\n      Berlioz proved he was a wonderful composer by going insane. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Brahms is one of our most immoral composers.\u0014\n\u0014\n      One of Puccini's most famous operas is \"Fillet Mignon>> \u0014\n\u0014\n      Angus Dei was a woman composer famous for her church music.\u0014\n\u0014\n      My favorite composer is Opus.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      Leonard Bernstein is one of our most famous contemporary \ncomposers. It is unusual to be contemporary. Most composers don't \nlive until they are dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n      All the old time composers lived in Europe. Even today, it is \nalways a few hours later in Europe than it is here in America because \npeople haven't lived here as long.\u0014\n\u0014\n     *****Afterthoughts:\u0014\n      Music is one of our most anesthetic arts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n      I have decided music is my ninth favorite thing in the universe.\u0014\n\u0014\n      My mother is one of the starchest supports of music  \u0014\n\u0014\n      One of my idiot-friends (that I will remain nameless) does not \nlike music. In spite of that people like her, most concerts these \ndays stay tightly populated.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Everything would not be anything without music.\u0014",

    "title": "CHARLTON HESTON SPEAKS HIS MIND",
    "words": "By Charlton Heston\u0014\nCNS Commentary\u0014\n\u0014\n(Editor's Note: The following remarks were delivered February 16, \n1999 at the Harvard Law School Forum and are reprinted here with \npermission.)\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember my son when he was five, explaining to his kindergarten \nclass what his father did for a living. \"My Daddy,\" he said, \n\"pretends to be people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere have been quite a few of them. Prophets from the Old and New \nTestaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various \nnationalities and different centuries, several kings, three American \npresidents, a French cardinal and two geniuses, including \nMichelangelo. If you want the ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. \nThere always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here. I'm never \nsure which one of them gets to\u0014\ntalk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my Creator gave me \nthe gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, \nthen I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you with your own \nsense of liberty ... your own freedom of thought ... your own compass \nfor what is right.\u0014\n\u0014\nDedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of \nAmerica, \"We are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether \nthis nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long \nendure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose words are true again. I believe that we are again engaged in a \ngreat civil war, a cultural war that's about to hijack your \nbirthright to think and say what resides in your heart. I fear you no \nlonger trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you ... the \nstuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle \nthat it is.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National \nRifle Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. I \nran for office,  I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a \nmoving target for the media who've called me everything from \n\"ridiculous\" and \"duped\" to a  \"brain-injured, senile, crazy old \nman.\" I know ... I'm pretty old but I sure Lord ain't senile.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second \nAmendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only \nissue. No, it's much, much bigger than that.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our \nland, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts \nand speech are mandated.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --long \nbefore Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an audience \nlast year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red \npride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But \nwhen I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than \nyour rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.\u0014\n\u0014\nI served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a \nspeech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and \nsingling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my \ncountry. But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural \npersecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.\u0014\n\u0014\n>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially \nsaying, \"Chuck, how dare you speak your mind! You are using language \nnot authorized for public consumption!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political correctness, \nwe'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the British crown.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book, \"The End of Sanity,\" Martin Gross writes that \"blatantly \nirrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in \nalmost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new customs, \nnew rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us \nfrom every direction.   Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans \nknow something without a name is undermining the nation, turning the \nmind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right \nfrom wrong. And they don't like it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men \nseeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step \nof the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ... all \nclearly spelled out in a printed college directive.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn New Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who \nhad been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDs --- the \nstate commissioner announced that health providers who are \nHIV-positive need not .. need not ... tell their patients that they \nare infected.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the school \nteam \"The Tribe\" because it was supposedly insulting to local \nIndians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the \nname.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the \nrights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for \ntranssexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex \nchange surgery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been \nplaced in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish \nsolely because their last names sound Hispanic.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died at \nGettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college officially \nset up segregated dormitory space for black students.\u0014\n\u0014\nYeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said \"Negroes.\"  \nJimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said \"black.\" But it's a \nno-no now.  For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... \nparticularly  \"Native-American.\" I'm a Native American, for God's \nsake. I also happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou \nSioux. On my wife's side,  my grandson is a thirteenth generation \nnative American ... with a\u0014\ncapital letter on  \"American.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, just last month ... David Howard, head of the Washington \nD.C. Office of Public Advocate, used the word \"niggardly\" while \ntalking to colleagues about budgetary matters. Of course, \"niggardly\" \nmeans stingy or scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly \napologize and resign.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs columnist Tony Snow wrote: \"David Howard got fired because some  \npeople in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning \nof  niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover \nthe meaning, and (c) actually demanded that he apologize for their \nignorance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does all of this mean? It means that telling us what to think \nhas evolved into telling us what to say , so telling us what to do \ncan't be far behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did \npolitical correctness originate on America's campuses? And why do you \ncontinue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed to debate ideas, \nsurrender to their suppression?\u0014\n\u0014\nLet's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they \nreally believe? It scares me to death, and should scare you too, that \nthe superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle \nof American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles \nRiver, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your \ncounterparts across the land, are the most socially conformed and \npolitically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by your \ngrandfathers' standards-cowards.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's another example. Right now at more than one major university, \nSecond Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up \nabout their findings or they'll lose their jobs. Why? Because their \nresearch findings would undermine big-city mayor's pending lawsuits \nthat seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm \nmanufacturers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked at \nthat, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw material of \nunfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core value of \nacademia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay \ndown your arms and plead, \"Don't shoot me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you see \ndistinctions between the genders, it does not make you a sexist. If \nyou think critically about a denomination, it does not make you \nanti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate homosexuality, it \ndoes not make you a homophobe.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators for \nthis rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism.\u0014\n \u0014\nBut what can you do? How can anyone prevail against such pervasive \nsocial subjugation?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the \nsteps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., standing with Dr. \nMartin Luther King and two hundred thousand people.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of course. \nNonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or what to say \nor how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol that stifles \nand stigmatizes personal freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nI learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who \nlearned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau, and Jesus, and every other great \nman who led those in the right against those with the might.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that \ndisobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent \nThoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that \nprotested a war in Viet Nam.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness \nwith massive disobedience of rogue authority, social directives and \nonerous law that weaken personal freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put \nyourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou must be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day \nequivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water cannons at \nSelma.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not complaining, \nbut my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me. \nLet me tell you a story.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling a \nCD called \"Cop Killer\" celebrating ambushing and murdering police \nofficers.  It was being marketed by none other than Time/Warner, the \nbiggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.\u0014\nPolice across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one \nhad been murdered. But Time/Warner was stonewalling because the CD \nwas a cash cow for them, and the media were tiptoeing around it \nbecause the rapper was black. I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders \nmeeting scheduled in Beverly Hills. I owned some shares at the time, \nso I decided to attend.\u0014\n\u0014\n What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues. \nI asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a thousand average \nAmerican stockholders, I simply read the full lyrics of \"Cop \nKiller\"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF\u0014\nI GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF\u0014\nI'M ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF\u0014\nI'M ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But \ntrust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces. The \nTime/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their \nshoes. They hated me for that.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist \nfilth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old nieces \nof Al and Tipper Gore.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....\"\u0014\nWell, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I \nleft the room in echoing silence. When I read the lyrics to the \nwaiting press corps, one of them said \"We can't print that.\" \"I \nknow,\" I replied, \"but Time/Warner's selling it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll never \nbe offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from Time \nmagazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act, not just \ntalk.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam \nthe switchboard of the district attorney's office.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen your university is pressured to lower standards until 80% of the \nstudents graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of \nregents.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and \ngets hauled into court for sexual harassment ... march on that school \nand block its doorways.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays \nyou ...petition them, oust them, banish them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, \ncrazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott \ntheir magazine and the products it advertises.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the \nhallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed \nexiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the hands of \nan aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by God's grace, built \nthis country.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.\u0014\n\u0014\nThank you.\u0014",

    "words": "Are you ready for a surprise? You blink twenty five times every \nminute. Each blink\u0014\ntakes you about one-fifth of a second. Therefore, if you take a \nten-hour automobile\u0014\ntrip, averaging forty miles per hour, you will drive twenty miles \nwith your eyes\u0014\nCLOSED.\u0014\n\u0014\nI know a fact far more surprising than that. Some people go through \nLIFE with their\u0014\neyes closed. They look but don't really \"see\" . . .they observe the \nsurface but omit\u0014\nthe underneath. . .they focus on images but not issues. . .vision is \npresent but\u0014\nperception is absent. If life were a painting, they would see colors \nbut no genius in\u0014\nthe strokes of the brush. If it were a journey, they would notice a \nroad but no\u0014\nmajestic, awesome scenery. If it were a meal, they would eat and \ndrink but they would\u0014\noverlook the exquisite beauty of the china and the delicate touch of \nwine in the\u0014\nsauce. If it were a poem, they would read print on the page but miss \naltogether the\u0014\npassion of the poet.. Remove insight and suddenly reduce life to \nexistence with\u0014\nfrequent flashes of boredom and indifference.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose without insight dwell mainly in the realm of the obvious. . \n.the expected. .\u0014\n.the essentials. The dimensions that interest them are length and \nwidth, not depth.\u0014\nPlease understand, I do not mean to be critical of those who CANNOT \ngo deeper . . .\u0014\nbut of those who can but WILL NOT. I'm not pointing my finger at \ninability but rather\u0014\nrefusal.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a concrete illustration, take the boatload of disciples in Mark, \nChapter 6.\u0014\nImmediately after Jesus had miraculously fed thousands of people with \na few loaves\u0014\nand fish, He sent His men away in a boat as He slipped off to a quiet \nplace on the\u0014\nmountain to pray. A storm later broke upon the sea and they were \nfilled with panic.\u0014\nHe came to their rescue shortly thereafter and calmed the sea as He \nstilled the wind\u0014\nand assured them there was no reason to be afraid. Mark makes a \ncomment worth\u0014\nremembering: . . . they were greatly astonished, for they had not \ngained any insight\u0014\nfrom the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened (vv. \n51-52).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't that they were unable to understand. That was the root \nproblem. Those men\u0014\nwere insensitive, dull, blunt-brained. They weren't ding-a-lings by \nnature but by\u0014\nchoice--and therein rested not the tragedy but the blame. Had they \napplied what they\u0014\nhad observed earlier that day when the thousands were feed, their \nresponse to the\u0014\nstorm would have been insightful.\u0014\n\u0014\nPractically then, parents with insight usually raise kids that are \nsecure, fulfilled,\u0014\nrelaxed, free to forge out ideas and to think. Single adults with \ninsight won't feel\u0014\nthey MUST marry--the sooner the better. Teachers with insight create \nan atmosphere\u0014\nconducive to learning. Bosses with insight develop employees and \nremain sensitive to\u0014\nsurrounding needs. Students with insight learn far more that the \nrequired\u0014\nsubject--they indeed glean an education.\u0014\n\u0014\nI challenge you: Open your eyes! Think! Apply! Dig! Listen! There's a \nlot of\u0014\ndifference between necessary blinking and unnecessary blindness.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles R. Swindoll, Growing Strong In The Seasons Of Life\u0014",

    "words": "When Honorius was emperor of Rome, about the year A.D. 400, the\u0014\ngreat Coliseum of Rome was often filled to overflowing with\u0014\nspectators. These had come from far and near to view the state\u0014\ngames. Part of the sport consisted in watching as human beings\u0014\nbattled with wild beast or against one another until one or the\u0014\nother was killed. The assembled multitude made Roman holiday of\u0014\nsuch sport and found its highest delight in the death of a human\u0014\nbeing. It was on such a day when the vast crowd was watching the\u0014\ncontest that a Syrian monk by the name of Telemachus stood up in\u0014\nthe vast arena.\u0014\n\u0014\n Telemachus was torn by the utter disregard for the value of human \nlife and so he leaped into the arena in the midst of the gladiatorial \nshow and cried out, \"This thing is not right! This thing must stop!\" \nBecause he was interfering with their pleasure, the authorities gave \nthe command for Telemachus\u0014\nto be run through with a sword, which was done. Thus he died, but \ndying he kindled a flame in the hearts and consciences of thinking \npersons. History records that because of this within a\u0014\nfew months the gladiatorial combats began to decline and not long \nafter they passed from history altogether. Why? Because one man dared \nto speak out against what was wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames S. Hewett, Illustrations Unlimited, Tyndale, 1988, p. 127\u0014",

It does not matter if he\u0014\nalready has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to \ncomplain. As a\u0014\nman, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #2:\u0014\nIf you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word\u0014\nratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. \"Hey George,\u0014\ncan I borrow your ratchet?\" \"OK. By-the-way, are you through with my\u0014\n3/8-inch socket yet?\" Again, no one knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #3:\u0014\nIf you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car. A \n99-cent\u0014\nice scraper, a small bottle of deicer or something to hang from his \nrear\u0014\nview mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #4:\u0014\nDo not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men \nbathrobes.\u0014\nI was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, He wouldn't \nhave\u0014\ninvented Jockey shorts.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #5:\u0014\nYou can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn\u0014\nout. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the \nlittle\u0014\npicture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and \nflips.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #6:\u0014\nDo not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit \nin\u0014\na cupboard for 23 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #7:\u0014\nDo not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or\u0014\ndeodorant. I'm told they think they do not stink - they are earthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #8:\u0014\nBuy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a \ncouple\u0014\nof weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. Socks. Shorts. \nCups.\u0014\nSaucers. Door. Lock. Sink. You get the idea. No one knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #9:\u0014\nNever buy a man anything that says \"some assembly required\" on the \nbox.\u0014\nIt will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #10:\u0014\nGood places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber,\u0014\nHome Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. (NAPA \nAuto\u0014\nParts and Sears' Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. \nIt doesn't\u0014\nmatter if he doesn't know what it is. \"From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be\u0014\nsomething I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? \nWow! Thanks.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #11:\u0014\nMen enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue.\u0014\nGet him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him \nthe gas\u0014\nline leaks. \"Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #12:\u0014\nTickets to a professional sports game are a smart gift. However,\u0014\nhe will not appreciate tickets to \"A Retrospective of 19th Century \nQuilts.\"\u0014\nEveryone knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #13:\u0014\nMen love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you\u0014\ndon't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets\u0014\na label maker.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #14:\u0014\nIt's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension\u0014\nladder. Never buy a real man a step ladder. It must be an extension\u0014\nladder. No one knows why.\u0014\n\u0014\nRule #15:\u0014\nRope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at \nleast\u0014\nthe Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8\" manila\u0014\nrope. No one knows why.\u0014",

The couple was freed on bail \nTuesday after a night in jail.  \"It's clearly not a matter of money,\" \nsaid NewCastle County police Lt. Vincent Kowal, adding the Kelsos \nleft in matching BMWs parked outside the station following their \narrest.  Calls to the couple's home went unanswered.  Police said the \nKelsos left their son, Steven, in his wheelchair Sunday at the Alfred \nI. duPont Hospital for Children, which has been treating him for many \nyears.  The boy's mother \"turned to the desk clerk to say she wanted \nher son admitted and left his clothes, toys,medical supplies and \nequipment before she left,\" said hospital spokeswoman Terri Volker \nGreenley.  Court documents filed Monday say the couple left a note \nsaying they could not care for the boy.\u0014",

    "title": "CASTING OUT THE DEMONS",
    "words": "Some will remember William Golding's book, \"Lord of the Flies.\" A \u0014\nnumber of small boys are the sole survivors of a shipwreck on a \u0014\nremote island. In their effort to survive, they develop a society, \u0014\nrather primitive in form. Evil soon becomes an experienced reality. \u0014\nAn old decaying pig's head, surrounded with worms and flies, \u0014\nbecomes for them a deity, a god, a \"Lord of the Flies,\" which being \u0014\nre-translated means \"Beelzebub,\" the \"Prince of Darkness and \u0014\nDecay.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn their fear and perverted imagination, the stranded boys began to \u0014\nbelieve the Lord of the Flies was demanding a sacrifice--a sacrifice \nof one of the \u0014\nboys whom they regarded as a troublemaker, because he was not a \u0014\nbeliever in their god of the underworld. The boys projected their \u0014\nfears to Piggy, the plump, freckled boy who tried to keep a balance \u0014\nhead and common sense. \u0014\n\u0014\nThus in their fear and obsession, they start their hunt for Piggy \u0014\nto sacrifice him to their demon-god. The frightening chase finally \u0014\nleads out to the beach. Running for his life, and losing, Piggy \u0014\nruns abruptly into a strong, clean, will-built man. The rescue \u0014\nparty had arrived, and the demons were halted. Order and love and \u0014\nsensibility had arrived just in time. By the authority of sanity \u0014\nand civilization, the demons were repelled, and Piggy was saved, as \u0014\nwere the other boys. \u0014\nHumankind has done its share of sacrificing to demons--the demons \u0014\nof war, hate, revenge, perverted sex, unbridled lust for power, \u0014\nuncontrolled greed, distorted ambition. Like Piggy, many of us have \u0014\nbeen running desperately along the beaches of the world, hoping \u0014\nagainst hope for the arrival of a rescue party. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians, we now can announce that the rescue party has \u0014\narrived in the person of the strong man, Jesus. Balanced, \u0014\nintegrated, imbued with power, he calls the demons by name, thwarts \u0014\ntheir power, cast them out, bringing peace out of our demonic \u0014\nfrenzy.\u0014",

Feliz Manz was placed in a boat and taken \nto the middle of the river.  He was asked to recant his view of \nbaptism only for believers, not babies.  Because he did not, he was \nbound hand and foot in a fetal position and dropped into the black \nwaters of the Limmat. And who was his principle complaintant?  None \nother than the famous preacher Ulrich Zwingli.\u0014\n\u0014\n     On May 21, 1527, a suffering figure was carried by cart throught \nthe streets of the city of Rottenburg while portions of his flesh \nwere torn away with white-hot iron tongs.  Reaching the chosen \nlocation and having failed to recant his views about believer's \nbaptism, Michael Sattler was burned at the stake BY CHURCHMEN.  As \nSattler caught fire, he prayed, \"Almighty, eternal God. You are the \nway and the truth; since no one has been able to prove this as error, \nI shall with your help on this day testify to the truth and seal it \nwith my blood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     On March 10, 1528, a man who in two years time had baptized more \nthan 6,000 converts in Nicholsburg, Moravia, was literally pulled \napart on the rack in Vienna, Austria.  Failing to illict the \nrecantation they desired, he was tied to a stake and burned BY CLERGY \nin the heart of Vienna.  Thus ended the life of Dr, Bathasar \nHubmaier, the most erudite of our Anabaptist forefathers.\u0014\n     \u0014\n     And what was the crime of which each of these was guilty?

Every major character has an\u0014\n         unrequited love--Charlie Brown and the little red-\u0014\n         haired girl, Lucy and Schroeder, Linus and Miss\u0014\n         Othmar. Even Snoopy got dumped at the altar.\u0014\n         Happiness may be a warm puppy, but as Schulz once\u0014\n         said, \"Happiness is not very funny.\" Schulz infused\u0014\n         the strips with his lifelong feelings of depression\u0014\n         and insecurity--he had his heart broken by a real-\u0014\n         life red-haired girl--and they showed, Camus-like,\u0014\n         how one could feel lonely even in a crowd.

    "title": "CONSUMERISM CHANGES A CHURCH'S GOALS",
    "words": "Another set of \"money-changers\" in the church is consumerism. Church\u0014\nmembers have bought into the concept of consumerism. They don't see\u0014\nthemselves as servants, but as customers to be waited upon. Complaints\u0014\nabout the church are frequently followed with the expression: \"I do \npay\u0014\nmy money.\" That is consumerism. It is a way of saying: I am the one \nwho\u0014\nis to be served.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a church buys into consumerism, they go about meeting the defined\u0014\nneeds of the customers, rather than meeting God's need for a redeemed\u0014\nworld. Too often people treat church membership as though they are\u0014\nselecting a supermarket rather than a relationship. The call of Christ\u0014\nis not for consumers; it is for disciples. If we treat church members \nas\u0014\nconsumers, then at what point do they quit becoming customers and \nstart\u0014\nbecoming missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo make matters worse too many churches attempt to market themselves \nand\u0014\nin the process of developing a market strategy the subtle message is\u0014\nreleased: discipleship and missions are optional. Friends, they are \nnot\u0014\noptional. The call of Christ is: You must loose your life in order to\u0014\nsave your life. We dare not fall down before the idol of institutional\u0014\nsuccess.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen consumerism gets into the church, more time is spent on \nmembership\u0014\nand expenditures than God's dream of the Good News proclaimed, justice\u0014\nadministered, and inclusiveness and healing accomplished. Discipleship\u0014\ncannot be seen as a church option, alongside volleyball and \njazzercise.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, worship cannot be viewed as a weekly variety show, but an\u0014\nopportunity for us to get in touch with the Transcendent God. And yes,\u0014\nclergy are guilty as well. Too much time is spent encouraging people \nto\u0014\nthink positive about their sin.\u0014",

    "words": "Crucifixion - Medical Description\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is crucifixion? A medical doctor provides a physical description:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cross is placed on the ground and the exhausted man is quickly\u0014\nthrown backwards with his shoulders against the wood. The legionnaire\u0014\nfeels for the depression at the front of the wrist. He drives a heavy,\u0014\nsquare wrought-iron nail through the wrist and deep into the wood.\u0014\nQuickly he moves to the other side and repeats the action, being \ncareful\u0014\nnot to pull the arms too tightly, but to allow some flex and movement.\u0014\nThe cross is then lifted into place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe left foot is pressed backward against the right foot, and with \nboth\u0014\nfeet extended, toes down, a nail is driven through the arch of each,\u0014\nleaving the knees flexed. The victim is now crucified. As he slowly \nsags\u0014\ndown with more weight on the nails in the wrists, excruciating, fiery\u0014\npain shoots along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the\u0014\nbrain--the nails in the wrists are putting pressure on the median\u0014\nnerves. As he pushes himself upward to avoid this stretching torment, \nhe\u0014\nplaces the full weight on the nail through his feet. Again he feels \nthe\u0014\nsearing agony of the nail tearing through the nerves between the bones\u0014\nof his feet. As the arms fatigue, cramps sweep through the muscles,\u0014\nknotting them in deep, relentless, throbbing pain. With these cramps\u0014\ncomes the inability to push himself upward to breathe. Air can be \ndrawn\u0014\ninto the lungs but not exhaled. He fights to raise himself in order to\u0014\nget even one small breath. Finally carbon dioxide builds up in the \nlungs\u0014\nand in the blood stream, and the cramps partially subside. \nSpasmodically\u0014\nhe is able to push himself upward to exhale and bring in life-giving\u0014\noxygen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHours of this limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending \ncramps,\u0014\nintermittent partial asphyxiation, searing pain as tissue is torn from\u0014\nhis lacerated back as he moves up and down against the rough timber.\u0014\nThen another agony begins: a deep, crushing pain deep in the chest as\u0014\nthe pericardium slowly fills with serum and begins to compress the\u0014\nheart. It is now almost over--the loss of tissue fluids has reached a\u0014\ncritical level--the compressed heart is struggling to pump heavy, \nthick,\u0014\nsluggish blood into the tissues--the tortured lungs are making a \nfrantic\u0014\neffort to gasp in small gulps of air. He can feel the chill of death\u0014\ncreeping through his tissues. . .Finally he can allow his body to die.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll this the Bible records with the simple words, \"And they crucified\u0014\nHim.\" (Mark 15:24). What wondrous love is this?\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from C. Truman Davis, M.D. in The Expositor's Bible\u0014\nCommentary,Vol. 8\u0014",

    "title": "CORNELIUS' STORY: A BEACON OF HOPE",
    "words": "Cornelius' Story: A Beacon of Hope\u0014\nBob Greene, Columnist\u0014\nCHICAGO\u0014\n\u0014\nThe phone message caught me by surprise.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe caller, the message said, had been a Cornelius Abraham. He had \nleft his number.\u0014\nI returned the call. A young man answered.\u0014\nI don't know if you remember me, he said.\u0014\nI remember you, Cornelius, I said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a sweltering August day in 1987, paramedics and Chicago police \nofficers arrived at an apartment where a 4-year~old boy was said to \nbe unconscious.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere they found Lattie McGee. Officer Roberto Garay, his voice \nbreaking, said, I have never seen anything like that in my life.. \nThere were these terrible burns on his ankles. It didn't make sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater we found out that the burns were rope burns from where they \nwould hang him upside down in the closet. We lifted his shirt up, and \nhis chest... it was totally raw. All of the flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would turn out that this 4-year-old child had been tortured \nconstantly over the summer by his mother, Alicia Abraham, and her \nboyfriend, Johnny Campbell. Because Lattie had a high-pitched voice, \nCampbell accused him of being effeminate. He beat Lattie with fists \nand sticks, he burned him with cigarettes and a clothing iron, he \nrepeatedly stuck him with sewing needles, he dunked him in scalding \nwater.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt night, Campbell would leave Lattie hanging tied upside down from a \nrod in a darkened closet. On the night before Lattie died-- by this \ntime the child had pneumonia and a broken collarbone and broken \npelvis, and was complaining that he could not swallow--  Campbell \nstuffed a rag in the boy's mouth, taped potato peelings over his eyes \nso that be could not see, and hung him as usual in the closet.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the morning, the mother watched The Incredible Hulk on \ntelevision and did not check on her son in the closet. When Johnny \nCampbell eventually took him down from the rod, Lattie begged for \nwater. Campbell told him to be a man and get it for himself. Lattie, \nwho weighed only 26 pounds, tried to walk, but did not have the \nstrength. Campbell, angered by the boy's weakness, slugged him on the \near. Lattie collapsed and died.\u0014\n\u0014\nCook County assistant state's attorney James Bigoness prosecuted \nJohnny Campbell and Alicia Abraham. This is the worst case \nimaginable, he said at the time. There's a special place in hell \nfor them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key witness was only 8 years old during the trial in 1990. He was \nLattie's brother: Cornelius Abraham.\u0014\n\u0014\nCornelius underwent some of the same torture that Lattie did, but \nsomehow be survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith enormous courage, he took the witness stand at the Cook County \nCriminal Courts building in Chicago, and-- facing down the killers -- \nhe told what had happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nCornelius, who had been 6 that terrible summer, had not been able to \nstop Johnny Campbell and Alicia Abraham from murdering his little \nbrother; there had been no one to hear the boys' cries and help them \nduring the long months of torment. But because of his bravery in \ncourt, the truth came out. The murderers were sentenced to life in \nprison.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of the columns I wrote about the case, I mentioned that the \ngreat loves of Cornelius' life were reading and basketball.\u0014\n\u0014\nI received a call from the Chicago Bulls after that column ran; a \nteam official said that if Cornelius would like to see a game, the \nBulls would provide tickets.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had been in Chicago for 20 years at the time. I had never seen a \nBulls game; I had never been to the Chicago Stadium.\t\u0014\n\u0014\n But on an April Sunday afternoon in 1990, prosecutor Bigoness  and 1 \ntook Cornelius to see the Bulls play the Miami Heat.\t\u0014\n\u0014\n Cornelius was a thin, extremely quiet boy; he had the wide, \nall-seeing eyes of a frightened doe. He seemed almost unable to \nbelieve that he was in the Stadium. He had been locked up and \ntormented and hurt, with no one to save him; the adults in his\t\u0014\nlife had wanted only to belittle and  humiliate him  and now here he \nwas. He said nothing. He just looked around.\u0014\n\u0014\nBigoness and I took Cornelius down a flight of stairs to the basement \nlevel. A door opened and a man came out. Cornelius looked up, and his \neyes filled with a combination of wonder and awe and total disbelief.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe tried to say something, but the words would not come out. So the \nman helped him out by speaking first.\u0014\n\u0014\nHi, Cornelius, the man said. I'm Michael Jordan.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had never met Jordan before that day; he had heard about the case, \nand had volunteered to do this He knelt down and spoke quietly with \nCornelius; he did not rush. He said, Are you going to cheer for us \ntoday? We're going to need it.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the game that day, Cornelius sat with the Bulls. When Jordan \nwas on the court, Cornelius saved his seat on the bench for him; when \nJordan was out resting, Cornelius would sit right next to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe killers were in prison, and the rest of Cornelius' life was \nbeginning. I was looking at him at one point during the game, as \nJordan took a pass and sailed into the air and slammed home a basket. \nThere was Cornelius, laughing out loud with joy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I worried about what would come next, as did everyone who knew \nhim. If ever there were a child who could be excused for failing in \nlife, it was Cornelius.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter what he had been through, after what he had seen and endured....\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd even after the trial was over, be went through some very hard \ntimes. There was turmoil in the home of a relative with whom he \noriginally was sent to live; he ended up having to leave that home. \nHis next placement did not last, either.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe politicians and government officials who talked solemnly about \ntheir concern for Lattie and Cornelius moved on to other things. The \nState of Illinois -- which paid, and is still paying, to feed and \nshelter Lattie's killers during their prison terms --- did not see \nfit to pay for a proper resting place for Lattie. He was buried in an \nunmarked grave; there were no public funds for a headstone.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the people who read about Lattie here bought him one. And two \nstonecutters who read about Lattie --Tom and James Gast -- carved the \ninscription. The words, on the headstone above Lattie's burial place \nin the children's portion of the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, \nIllinois, south of Chicago, are simple. There is Lattie's name. There \nis the date he was born: December 29, 1982. There is the date he \ndied: August 14, 1987.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd there are three additional words, words that Lattie may never \nhave heard, as gentle as a whisper: \"You Are Loved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, all these years later, here was this telephone call, from \nCornelius Abraham.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe told me that he was being honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had graduated from high school -- Thornton Township High School, \nin Harvey, Illinois, where last spring his fellow students elected \nhim as prom king --and he had applied to and been accepted at \nNorthern Illinois University in DeKalb, where he planned to study \ncomputer sciences. He was 18 now, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of his healing had come with the help of the YMCA Network for \nCounseling and Youth Development of Greater Chicagoland. That \norganization was initiating an  award to be given annually to a child \nwhose determination and drive to overcome formidable obstacles is \nespecially inspiring.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe award, the organization had decided, would be called the \nCornelius S. Abraham Award. The first recipient would be Cornelius.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason, YMCA counseling officials said, was Cornelius' brilliant \nspirit and refusal to give up. His example, they said, was the finest \npossible to emblemize what they attempt to instill in the children \nthey counsel: Wish. Hope. Believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nCornelius said that he would be coming home from college to accept \nthe award.\u0014\nHe asked me if I would present it to him.\t\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a recent Friday night in a banquet room in Alsip--not far from the \ncemetery where Lattie rests--Cornelius arrived with his foster \nparents, Dwayne and Ingra Cooper, a family he says he loves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not a large event; fewer than 100 people were present. No \nblood relatives of Cornelius had shown up. I looked across the room \nand saw Jim Bigoness, the man who had prosecuted the case against \nLattie's killers and Cornelius' tormenters; now an attorney in \nprivate practice, he had come to be present on Cornelius' big night.\u0014\n\u0014\nCornelius had bought a suit that afternoon, to wear to the ceremony. \nHe was happy, nervous, proud.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom bad things, good can come, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe is a college student with career goals, and a desire to do good \nthings with his life. Nothing is ever guaranteed to anyone but \nagainst every odd, he has made it this far. He's on his way.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe and I talked for a while, and when it was time to present him with \nthe award that has been named for him, I said to those hundred people \nwhat I will say right here, to many more of you:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Cornelius has had a much more profound effect on my life than I \nhave had on his.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat he has inspired me from the first moment I met him, and that in \nmany ways he is, the reason that, on my better days at work, I try to \ndo what I do. That his courage in venturing out, into a world that \nconspired to hurt him and hold him down since he was a little boy, \nand his determination not to let that hurt stop him from endeavoring \nto lead a worthy life, are as impressive as I have ever been \nprivileged to witness  and that he is his little brother's finest \nlegacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat for anyone who thinks there is no hope in the world  for anyone \nwho thinks that giving up is sometimes the only option  Cornelius is \nthe proof that they are wrong. Cornelius is the proof that hope can \novercome anything.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I told him this:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat of all the things that have ever happened to me, the fact that \nhe would ask me to be by his side on this night is the highest honor \nI can ever hope to receive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe award in Cornelius name is meant to serve as a beacon of hope for \nchildren who think there is none--as a sign that even in the darkest \nnights, they must not forget that the morning will come.\t\u0014\n\u0014\nI am so proud of him.\u0014\n\u0014\n-(C) Tribune MediaServices.\u0014",

    "title": "COMMUNION AND SPIRITUAL REFRESHMENT",
    "words": "A small boy was overheard saying that he preferred to go to the \nChristian Church down the street because they served refreshments \nevery Sunday. He was referring to the fact that the Lord's Supper was \na part of every Sunday morning service.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren often lead us to profound truths, for, indeed, Communion \nshould be a time of refreshment  spiritual refreshment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord's Supper should be a time when people examine themselves, \nremember the death of Christ, reaffirm their faith in him, and offer \nthemselves for service to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wesley and H. Orton Wiley agree that the Lord's Supper is a \nmeans of grace whereby God can do something for the participant. God \ncan and will refresh and renew a person's spiritual experience if he \nhumbly approaches the Lord's Supper as a means of grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord's Supper is also a commemorative act for Christian \nbelievers. It was not an accident that the institution of this \nsacrament took place on an evening when Jesus had completed observing \nthe Passover meal with his disciples. In such a setting the minds and \nhearts of the disciples had already been directed back to an \nimportant event in the religious life of their forefathers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Passover season reminded them of the deliverance of their \nfathers from Egypt. It also recalled the covenant relationship with \nGod which was instituted at Mount Sinai during the Exodus. In the \nsame manner, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper brings to mind the \nnew covenant, sealed by Christ's atoning blood.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe see in I Corinthians 11:26 that the Supper also points to the \nfuture. Chris-finns are admonished to observe the sacrament till he \ncome. The Lord's Supper has past, present, and future relevance.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Eucharist the person participating should experience a \ntime of self-examination and meditation before, during, and after the \nobservance. He should commune with God during this sacrament. The \nindividual should remember what God accomplished for him in the death \nof his Son. The bread and the cup are reminders of the body and the \nblood of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul wrote to the Corinthians to let them know of his concern for the \nsacredness of this sacrament. Paul said it ought to be observed with \ndignity and in an attitude of worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis divine ordinance should not be tacked on as an appendage to the \nmain service. It should be an act of worship itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy remembering exactly what the sacrament represents, the highest \nexpression of God's love, and by expecting God to do something for us \nas we participate, the Lord's Supper can be for us, too, a \nrefreshment.\u0014",

    "title": "CLARK PINNOCK'S VIEW OF SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "In The Scripture Principle (1984) and again in Tracking the Maze \n(1990) readers can see the expanded results of Pinnocks commitment \nto accepting biblical texts as what they appear to be. He comments, \nI felt I ought to be more willing to respect the Bibles right to \nteach me in ways which it determines rather than in ways I impose. \nPinnocks conclusions are at times at variance with traditional \nevangelical opinion. It is apparent why the conservative wing of \nevangelicalism is uncomfortable. For example, Pinnock is now open to \nunderstanding the opening chapters of Genesis as saga and certain \nother texts as legend (Elishas axhead and the fate of Lots wife), \nto viewing Jonah as didactic fiction, to dating Daniels final form \nto the Maccabean period, to seeing some of the numbers in the Bible \nas inflated, to regarding certain elements in Matthew as Midrashic \nembellishment, and to treating Pauls personal advice (e.g., 1 Cor. \n7:2526, 3940) as just that, nonbinding opinion. Pinnock is not \ndogmatic about any of these possibilities, often mentioning them \nsimply as questions arising from the text. But it is clear that he \nhas opened himself to modern biblical scholarship in ways he had \npreviously rejected.\u0014\n\u0014\nPinnock realizes that some will question how such interpretations of \nthe biblical text fit with any typical notion of inerrancy. But his \ndesire to maintain a strong commitment to Scriptures authority and \nreliability has not lessened. Scripture remains for Pinnock inerrant \nin all that it affirms. It is only his understanding of what exactly \nis affirmed that has changed.\u0014\nThe real problem in the inerrancy debate, suspects Pinnock, is that \nmany conservatives are not using inerrancy simply to signify the \ntruth of Gods Word, but also to encourage conformity to a certain \nset of theological beliefs: beliefs about women in ministry, the \ncharismatic renewal, creationism, theories of eschatology and \natonement. Such positions ought to be discussed, argues Pinnock, on \nthe basis of the interpretation of relevant biblical texts rather \nthan being imposed under the banner of inerrancy. That is to say, \ninerrancy must be disentangled from hermeneutics.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving the Bible to be the indispensable source of Gods truth, \nPinnock has spent much of his academic career seeking to clarify its \nnature and authority. He has done this against a backdrop of serious \npolarization between liberal and conservative forces. As Pinnock has \nreworked his understanding of inerrancy, he has recognized among \nliberals a tendency to ignore the Bibles truth claims. But among \nevangelicals there are problems as well. There are a propensity to \novervalue Scriptures self-claims and a concomitant tendency to \nundervalue its humanity. Taking care to emphasize both the truth \nclaims and the humanity of Scripture, Pinnock adds a third element to \nhis understanding of biblical authority: the role of the Holy Spirit. \nPinnock hopes that this third prong of his theology of Scripture will \nprove comprehensive and satisfying to liberals and conservatives \nalike.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Biblical Revelation (1971) Pinnock had argued that the Holy Spirit \nis Scriptures best interpreter, for he is its author. The Spirit \ndoes not obviate the need for sound exegesis; rather, he creates that \ninner receptivity which allows Gods Word to be understood and \nbelieved. It was Pinnocks conviction that without the Spirits \nwitness the biblical text would remain confusing. The Word and the \nSpirit must work in tandem. Any appeal to the Spirit apart from \nScripture is sub-Christian fanaticism, reasoned Pinnock. But to \nappeal to Scripture apart from a humble dependence on the Spirit is \npresumption. Pinnock thus conjoined Word and Spirit in a typically \nReformed manner. But it must also be noted that Pinnock, like most \nAmerican evangelicals, did not initially emphasize the Spirits role \nnor give the Spirit much operational room. It was almost as if, \nhaving tipped his cap to the Spirit, Pinnock felt free to return to a \nproper rational explication of the Word.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"The Scripture Principle\" (1984), while he continues not to affirm \nan authority for the Spirit which is somehow separate from the Word, \nPinnock is concerned to help evangelicals develop a fuller \nappreciation of the work of the Spirit in regard to the Word. In \ncontrast to his earlier writings, Pinnock now argues that the Spirit \nhas a role in providing assurance that revelation is authentic and \ntrue, and that Scripture is trustworthy and authoritative. Reason and \nhistorical investigation alone are not capable of fully testing the \ntruth of Scripture. While there is evidence for the credibility of \nScripture, the ultimate confirmation of the Bibles authority comes \nfrom the Spirits testimony.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Pinnock, evangelicals need also to recover an \nappreciation of the role of the Spirit in relation to both the \ninterpretation and the application of Scripture. The evangelical \npenchant to defend the objective truth of Scripture has led all too \noften to inerrantists downplaying the significance of the Spirit. \nNot wishing to sound like Barth, they avoid sounding like Paul, \ntoo. Whatever the reason, writes Pinnock, stress on the Spirit is \nnoticeably lacking in the literature of inerrancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith regard to interpretation, the historical meaning of a text \nshould be ascertainable by all, but it is the Spirit who causes the \nreader to be receptive to the texts surplus of meaning. The plain \nmeaning of a text does not help us understand the rich figurative \nlanguage in Scripture, which cannot be adequately paraphrased, nor \nthe place of the text within the messianically structured canon. It \nwould be wrong, then, to think that the Bible takes the form of a \nsystematic theology. Rather, it is a narrative, the story of the \ngrace of God in action. As a result, the truth it yields is not \ncut-and-dried, but balanced and nuanced. The Spirit provides the \nwisdom to understand.\u0014\nPinnock also sees the Spirit as fundamental to appropriate biblical \napplication. Although we may be able to comprehend a biblical text at \none level, there is also a large role for the Spirit here, in that \nwe need Gods guidance in knowing how to put the Scriptures into \neffect in our situation today. Beyond understanding what a given \ntext says, Christians need the direction and discernment that the \nSpirit gives as to which of the possible applications is to be made \nin the present situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA balanced view of the Spirits role has helpful implications for all \nthree aspects of Pinnocks understanding of Scripture: (1) because \nthe Spirit authenticates Scripture, it is not necessary to inflate \nthe claims of inspiration; (2) given the Spirits role, the humanity \nof the text is easier to accept, for our trust in it does not depend \non our ability to explain all of its difficult features; (3) \nrecognition of the Spirits empowering presence in the text helps \nreaders avoid inappropriate legalistic interpretations and \napplications of the Bible. Pinnock summarizes the Spirits effect: \nThe Bible can be little more than a museum of old antiques, but when \nthe Spirit gets hold of it, the inspired information deposited in the \nText becomes activated in our experience. The Bible in the power of \nthe Spirit is a means of grace whereby the liberating force of Jesus \nmessage can become real in human life today.\u0014",

Two ex-priests and a former religion teacher, all members of \nthe sect, sought to prevent Bavarian churches from calling themselves \nChristian.  \u0014\nThey had tried before, and failed, to make the arch-conservative \nChristian Social Union, the dominant party in Bavaria, to axe the \nChristian part of its name. In a tongue-in-cheek verdict, the \nnormally staid Bavarian Constitutional Court  located in staunchly \nRoman Catholic Munich  threw out the case. \u0014\n\u0014\nAttacking the Churches\u0014\n\u0014\nLawyer Christian Sailer, representing the three, told the court that \nhis clients were incensed by the way so-called Christian churches \nwere approving wars and even holding ceremonies to bless the weapons \nused.  Jesus, he said, would have never approved.\u0014\nHe also waxed lyrical about the past of the churches, including the \nburning of witches, the persecution of Jews and the executions of \nheretics.\u0014\n \u0014\nIt is a system of murder and blood that has slaughtered more people, \ndestroyed more culture than any war or any scourge, he told the \nbench. And all this in the name of God and Jesus Christ.\u0014\nDefense attorneys Martin Habdank, representing the \nEvangelical-Lutheran Church and Hans-Georg Neumeier, representing the \nArchbishopric of Munich, countered that those times are fortunately \npast. \u0014\nChristian is not a kind of trademark, they warned. \u0014\n\u0014\nBrothers in Spirit\u0014\nThe disgruntled trio based their case on a German law allowing people \nto defend the reputation of dead relatives. They were, they said, \nbrothers in spirit of Jesus Christ, and thus had the right to \ndefend him in court. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause the Bible says Who performs Gods will is my brother, my \nsister and my mother, they are close relatives of Christ, and thus \nqualified to litigate on His behalf, they argued.\u0014\nPresiding Judge Volker Berberich told the trio to go away and \nprivately sort out its problems with the Church. \u0014\nGermanys Constitution forbids courts from interfering in church \naffairs, he ruled. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Big Flaw\u0014\nHe also pointed out a fundamental flaw in their post-mortal personal \nprotection argument: If the trio believes Christ has risen from the \ndead, he mused, then, Jesus is alive, and undoubtedly perfectly \ncapable of defending Himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nSailer and his clients are now mulling over whether to take their \ncase to the Federal Constitutional Court in Berlin, the only court in \nGermany that can overrule the Bavarian court. \\\u0002\u0014",

He said to himself, \n'My\u0014\nfather has no real convictions.\" The incident helped to turn him \nagainst\u0014\nreligion with a vengeance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat young boy later moved to England and began to write. His name was\u0014\nKarl Marx. As the father of communism he wrote the \"Communist\u0014\n Manifesto,\" in which he called religion \"the opiate of the masses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI wonder if world history would have been different had Karl Marx's\u0014\nfather heeded the admonition of the great \"Shema\" of Israel:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: and you shall love the\u0014\nLORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with \nall\u0014\nyour might.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYour kids know whether you love God with all your heart. What they \nwant\u0014\nto see is parents with such love and reverence for God that they bring\u0014\nHim into every area of their lives and put him first in everything. \nKids\u0014\nwant to see whether their parents love God enough to obey him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdrian Rogers, Ten Secrets For A Successful Family, Crossway Books,\u0014",

    "words": "An Uncertain Trumpet \u0014\n\u0014\n                  How Christians in the South sought to reconcile \nslavery with\u0014\n                  Scripture. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Eugene D. Genovese \u0014\n\u0014\n                     When the Confederacy collapsed, Southern divines \nruefully allowed that\u0014\n                  God had punished the South for failing to do \njustice to its slaves.\u0014\n                  Simultaneously, they reiterated their conviction \nthat they had not sinned in\u0014\n                  upholding slavery per se. In October 1865, the \nBaptist Religious Herald of\u0014\n                  Richmond, Virginia, defiantly asked \"whether any \ncombination of capital and\u0014\n                  labor ever produced greater freedom from want and \nsuffering, and a higher\u0014\n                  degree of contentment and cheerfulness among the \nlaboring classes, than did\u0014\n                  Southern slavery.\" A month later, the South \nCarolina Conference of the\u0014\n                  Methodist Episcopal Church, in a pastoral letter, \nreiterated that Holy\u0014\n                  Scripture contains everything necessary for \nsalvation and warned against a\u0014\n                  misreading of the fall of the Confederacy. It \naffirmed that the War had\u0014\n                  settled the question of \"the powers that be,\" whom \nSoutherners were\u0014\n                  commanded to obey as they rendered unto Caesar the \nthings that are\u0014\n                  Caesar's. But the conference insisted that the \ndemise of slavery did not\u0014\n                  invalidate the certainty that God had ordained it \nin a previous time and place.\u0014\n                  Educators like the Presbyterian Reverend T. E. Peck \nof Union Theological\u0014\n                  Seminary in Richmond firmly contended that, \nreligiously and morally, slavery\u0014\n                  was by no means a settled issue. The intransigence \nof the divines may be\u0014\n                  more readily understood if for \"slavery\" we \nsubstitute \"some form of\u0014\n                  personal servitude\" and recall the long efforts to \nbring their preferred social\u0014\n                  system up to biblical standards. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Christian Southerners, sadly acknowledging that \nthey had lost the War\u0014\n                  because a persistent sinfulness had cost them God's \nfavor, recognized a\u0014\n                  bitter irony. By forfeiting God's favor, they had \nsentenced themselves to live\u0014\n                  under the very social system that they had \ncondemned as unchristian in\u0014\n                  tendency. Punished for their lapses, they now found \nthemselves enmeshed in\u0014\n                  a materialistic, marketplace society that promoted \ncompetitive individualism\u0014\n                  and worshiped Mammon. From early on, they had \nfeared that defeat would\u0014\n                  ensure precisely that outcome. In December 1861 the \nReverend J. Henry\u0014\n                  Smith of North Carolina declared, as others were \ndoing in their own words,\u0014\n                  \"If we fail, the progress of civilization will be \nthrown back a century.\" A still\u0014\n                  hopeful James Henley Thornwell pondered that \nfearful possibility in a letter\u0014\n                  written to his wife shortly before his death in \n1862: \"Every day increases my\u0014\n                  sense of the value of the principles for which we \nare contending. If we fail,\u0014\n                  the hopes of the human race are put back for more \nthan a century.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Thornwell could contemplate the possibility of \ndefeat without loss of the\u0014\n                  optimism of the will that Romain Rolland has wisely \nsuggested must\u0014\n                  accompany pessimism of the intellect, but not all \nof his compatriots could\u0014\n                  match his confidence in the ultimate triumph of the \nprinciples for which they\u0014\n                  were contending. When the prospects for a Union \nvictory mounted after\u0014\n                  Gettysburg and Vicksburg, ministers and secular \nleaders continued to\u0014\n                  express confidence in a Confederate victory, but a \nnote of desperation crept\u0014\n                  into their sermons. Haunted by fears of a religious \nas well as social and\u0014\n                  political catastrophe, the preachers redoubled \ntheir efforts to rally the\u0014\n                  faithful, but, notwithstanding the growing doubts, \nthey continued to resist the\u0014\n                  idea of slavery's inherent sinfulness. Instead, \nthey reiterated their belief that\u0014\n                  slavery, with all its faults, sustained a Christian \nsocial order, and they\u0014\n                  focused on the dreaded consequences of the victory \nof the Antichrist.\u0014\n                  Southerners must trust God to save them, the \npreachers cried, for the\u0014\n                  Yankee invaders have shown how utterly bestial they \ncan be. The preachers\u0014\n                  reminded their people that an infidel North stood \nfor a political radicalism\u0014\n                  that threatened the very foundations of \ncivilization. If the North wins, they\u0014\n                  prophesied, the country will fall under a ruthless \ntyranny that will, among\u0014\n                  other atrocities, extinguish religious liberty and, \nwith it, religious truth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     At the end of the War, the unreconstructed \nRobert L. Dabney suffered\u0014\n                  such deep discouragement that he considered \nemigration. Virginia, he wrote\u0014\n                  to the Reverend Moses Drury Hoge in August 1865, \nwill no doubt recover\u0014\n                  its prosperity but only at the price of \"being \ncompletely Yankeeized.\" The\u0014\n                  loss of independence meant that \"the honor, the \nhospitality, the integrity,\u0014\n                  everything which constituted Southern character is \ngone forever.\" The\u0014\n                  Yankees, he added, are killing off the \"ruling \nclass.\" In 1868, speaking at\u0014\n                  Davidson College in North Carolina, Dabney referred \nto the Confederate\u0014\n                  defeat as one more proof that God uses infidels to \nchasten his people, and\u0014\n                  Dabney reiterated that victory in war does not \nalways go to the cause of\u0014\n                  right. Dabney, to the day he died, hated the \nbourgeois social order the slave\u0014\n                  South had stood against, but he wound up supporting \nbig business against\u0014\n                  both Populism and the labor unions as the lesser of \nunspeakable evils.\u0014\n                  Dabney was not alone in being haunted by \napocalyptic visions, which\u0014\n                  marked the sermons of many divines shortly after \nthe War. For men like the\u0014\n                  less politically volatile Reverend John Girardeau, \nthe emergence of socialism,\u0014\n                  anarchism, and class warfare in Europe and America \nconjured up the\u0014\n                  specter of the Antichrist. Without the religious \novertones, the embittered\u0014\n                  Eliza Frances Andrews of Georgia cried, \"In another \ngeneration or two, this\u0014\n                  beautiful country of ours will have lost its \ndistinctive civilization and become\u0014\n                  no better than a nation of Yankee shopkeepers.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The question remains: What went wrong? Why did \nthe many Southerners\u0014\n                  who long before the War saw the need for a drastic \nchange in the social\u0014\n                  order fail so miserably? After all, their ranks \nincluded politically influential\u0014\n                  clerical and secular spokesmen of high intellectual \nquality. That question\u0014\n                  leads to another: With all the good will in the \nworld, could the slaveholders,\u0014\n                  as a class, ever have countenanced the kind of \nreforms that were being\u0014\n                  urged upon them by their pastors and their own \nChristian consciences? \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Let us begin by recalling the paradoxical \njuxtaposition of common beliefs\u0014\n                  in the Southern attitude toward the perpetuation of \nslavery: first, slavery, as\u0014\n                  practiced in the South, might not last forever; \nsecond, slavery was an\u0014\n                  immeasurably better, more Christian system than \nfree labor; and third, the\u0014\n                  Southern slave system cried out for radical reform. \nThornwell provided a\u0014\n                  jarring illustration of the paradox. As forcefully \nas any Southern divine, he\u0014\n                  excoriated the free-labor system and regarded its \nexpected demise as a\u0014\n                  moral, political, and social imperative. Yet \naccording to Benjamin Morgan\u0014\n                  Palmer, Thornwell was drafting a plan for gradual \nemancipation in an\u0014\n                  eleventh-hour effort to head off disunion. Then, \ntoo, in 1864, Mary Chesnut\u0014\n                  heard Palmer deliver a sermon in which he thanked \nGod that slavery was\u0014\n                  doomed. Now, how could Thornwell and Palmer, honest \nand clear-thinking\u0014\n                  men, have simultaneously praised slavery as a \nsuperior labor system,\u0014\n                  damned the free-labor system as morally monstrous \nand politically\u0014\n                  insupportable, and looked kindly on the prospects \nfor emancipation? \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Some Southerners understood the biblical \nsanction of slavery as absolute\u0014\n                  and binding on all future generations until the \nmillennium, but those who\u0014\n                  demurred did more than remind themselves that God \ncould withdraw his\u0014\n                  sanction if he chose. They warned that he should be \nexpected to do so if the\u0014\n                  Southern social system were not brought up to the \nhighest biblical standards.\u0014\n                  For God had ordained slavery as a trust, not a \nsinecure, and those entrusted\u0014\n                  with it had to meet heavy responsibilities. The \napparent contradiction\u0014\n                  disappears once we recognize that, for Southerners, \nemancipation did not\u0014\n                  imply freedom as others understood it. Southerners \nwere by no means\u0014\n                  predicting, much less advocating, an emancipation \nthat would throw into the\u0014\n                  marketplace blacks, whom they regarded as racially \ninferior, or, for that\u0014\n                  matter, the laboring classes of the white race, \nwhom they regarded as also in\u0014\n                  need of paternalistic protection. The divines \nforesaw a stratified order based\u0014\n                  on the strict subordination of the laboring classes \nand the legally enforced\u0014\n                  personal responsibility of a master class toward \nthose who labored for them.\u0014\n                  In effect, they foresaw a transition to a different \nform of bound labor,\u0014\n                  whether called slavery or not. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Many of the divines envisioned a paternalistic \npersonal servitude in which\u0014\n                  white as well as black laborers could be assured of \ntheir \"human rights\"\u0014\n                  while they submitted to the control of individual \nsuperiors. But unlike Henry\u0014\n                  Hughes of Mississippi in his Treatise on Sociology \n(1854), no divine tried\u0014\n                  to envision a socioeconomic system that could \nencompass the\u0014\n                  recommended reforms. That some such system would \nhave been acceptable\u0014\n                  either to Southerners or to Northerners may be \ndoubted, and Thornwell's\u0014\n                  desperate hopes of avoiding secession and war may \nwell have been sheer\u0014\n                  fantasy. Certainly, the problems were daunting. \nThus, in 1858, James P.\u0014\n                  Holcombe cautiously suggested to the State \nAgricultural Society of Virginia\u0014\n                  that slavery could be maintained in a manner that \nheld black families\u0014\n                  together, but he offered no specifics. Holcombe, \nlike other educated\u0014\n                  Southerners, knew that the Spartan helots provided \nan illustration of\u0014\n                  communally owned slaves with family rights, but \nthey also knew that a\u0014\n                  system of helotry was by no means a system of \nslavery as established in\u0014\n                  Athens, Rome, or the South. For that matter, they \nknew how brutally the\u0014\n                  Spartans treated their helots despite formal \nrecognition of family rights. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The War brought the issue to a head. The \nConfederacy may have come\u0014\n                  into being as a bastion of constitutionalism, state \nrights, and traditional\u0014\n                  values, as its originators and many others since \nhave claimed with\u0014\n                  considerable justification, but it also came into \nbeing as a slaveholding\u0014\n                  republic. Alexander H. Stephens could not have been \nclearer in his\u0014\n                  \"Cornerstone Speech,\" and no Southerner of \nimportance contradicted him.\u0014\n                  Yet, almost from the opening shot at Fort Sumter, \nthe future of slavery in a\u0014\n                  victorious Confederacy became the subject of heated \ndebate, for the calls to\u0014\n                  bring slavery up to biblical standards would have \neffected a social\u0014\n                  revolution. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     In 1863, an anonymous writer in Southern \nPresbyterian Review,\u0014\n                  replying to James Lyon and the Presbyterian \nreformers, warmly endorsed\u0014\n                  most of their proposals but demurred on slave \nmarriages. Legalization of\u0014\n                  slave marriages would grant the right of contract \nto slaves and thereby\u0014\n                  destroy the master's patriarchal control: \"It would \namount to a revolution in\u0014\n                  the status of the slave as great as a transfer of \nallegiance from one prince or\u0014\n                  state to another would effect in the condition of a \nfree people.\" That step, he\u0014\n                  insisted, would open the door to recognition of the \nslave's right to enter into\u0014\n                  contracts to accumulate property and much else. \nSome of this writer's\u0014\n                  arguments were tortured, but their principal thrust \nstruck home: The essential\u0014\n                  reforms would undermine the master-slave \nrelationship in a social\u0014\n                  experiment that threatened the power of the master \nclass. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The reformers replied to their critics by \ninsisting that a milder system of\u0014\n                  labor bondage would provide the protection that \nMcCord feared would be\u0014\n                  lost. They were doubtless sincere, but they never \ndid explore the\u0014\n                  ramifications of proposals that would have led \ntoward a new social system.\u0014\n                  From antiquity, as educated Southerners well knew, \nslavery flourished only\u0014\n                  as a system of commodity production -- production \nfor market -- whereas\u0014\n                  serfdom did not, at least not normally or \nnecessarily. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     It is true that the emergence of large-scale \nserfdom in sixteenth-century\u0014\n                  Russia and the \"second serfdom\" in Eastern Europe \npoured foodstuffs into\u0014\n                  the cities of a rapidly developing capitalist \nwestern Europe, but the\u0014\n                  deepening economic backwardness of the East offered \nlittle encouragement\u0014\n                  to those invited to plunge into the proposed \nreformation of slavery. For one\u0014\n                  thing, educated slaveholders were taught medieval \nhistory in school and read\u0014\n                  a good deal of it thereafter. And in the late \nMiddle Ages, just as a vassal\u0014\n                  could turn to the king's court to protect him \nagainst a lord, so a serf could\u0014\n                  run to town not merely to escape his master's \nclutches but to secure legal\u0014\n                  protection against him. The belief in the supremacy \nand sanctity of the law\u0014\n                  rested on hierarchical assumptions that made both \nsuperior and inferior\u0014\n                  subject to mutual obligations and gave inferiors \nthe right to appeal violations\u0014\n                  to an authority higher than the lord. The great \ndifficulty in the way of a\u0014\n                  transition to a system of unfree labor other than \nslavery was that virtually all\u0014\n                  its features threatened the economic or political \nsecurity of the slaveholders\u0014\n                  in a transatlantic world that was rising on \ncommodity production for a\u0014\n                  burgeoning world market. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Albert Barnes threw a favorite proslavery \nargument back in the\u0014\n                  Southerners' faces. Noting that the Southern \ndivines insisted on defending\u0014\n                  the biblical sanction for slavery in general rather \nthan the Southern slave laws\u0014\n                  in particular, Barnes argued, \"It is not improper \nto regard slavery as it exists\u0014\n                  in the United States as a fair illustration of the \ntendency of the system. It\u0014\n                  exists here in the best age of the world, and in \nthe land most distinguished for\u0014\n                  intelligence, and for wisdom in making and \nadministering laws. The laws\u0014\n                  pertaining to the system here may be regarded as \nthose that long experience\u0014\n                  has shown to be necessary.\" Barnes pressed his \npoint: \"It is hardly necessary\u0014\n                  to remark, what a modification it would make in \nslavery in this land, if it\u0014\n                  should become a settled principle that a slave \ncould never be SOLD.\" The\u0014\n                  more moderately antislavery Reverend Rufus Clark of \nNew Hampshire\u0014\n                  acknowledged the existence of many good and kind \nslaveholders but\u0014\n                  charged that the mass of slaveholders were doing \nnothing to mitigate the\u0014\n                  rigors of slavery. He concluded, \"Were the Mosaic \nsystem to be applied to\u0014\n                  American slavery, it would be, by the operation of \nthose laws, very soon\u0014\n                  abolished.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Acute Southerners, opposed to as well as in \nfavor of slavery, had long\u0014\n                  been mulling over the problem. In the winter of \n1839-40 the Reverend\u0014\n                  George F. Simmons became pastor of a church in \nMobile, Alabama, after\u0014\n                  having made clear his antislavery views. In May he \ndelivered two sermons\u0014\n                  on slavery. The congregation listened with \n\"attention and respect\" to the first\u0014\n                  sermon on the Christian duty of masters to their \nslaves. But the second\u0014\n                  sermon on the evils of slavery and the need for a \nprogram of gradual\u0014\n                  emancipation led to his having to flee Mobile. He \nclaimed that the trouble\u0014\n                  came not from his congregation or from the majority \nof the people of Mobile\u0014\n                  but from a \"cabal\" that had failed to have him \nindicted and then threatened to\u0014\n                  invoke lynch law not only against him but against \nanyone who defended his\u0014\n                  right to speak. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Simmons believed that the majority of \nslaveholders, being inherently sinful\u0014\n                  like all men, should be expected to place their \nworldly interests first, so he\u0014\n                  aimed his appeal at the minority of the most pious, \nwho could begin the\u0014\n                  work of reformation and spread its example. Simmons \noutlined the kind of\u0014\n                  reforms that would establish the Mosaic Law, which, \nwhile it tolerated\u0014\n                  slavery, contained no permission for the sale of \nslaves. Christians can only\u0014\n                  \"own\" slaves in the same sense that they may \"own\" \ntheir wives and children\u0014\n                  -- that is, \"they cannot be a part of our property; \nnor can they be treated as\u0014\n                  such.\" To reform slavery according to scriptural \ncommand, he concluded,\u0014\n                  would effect a fundamental transformation: \"Thus \nwill Christianity eat the\u0014\n                  heart of Slavery even while slavery continues.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Simmons's challenge reappeared, if implicitly, \nin the efforts to reform the\u0014\n                  slave codes promoted by Judge John Belton O'Neall, \nwho led judicial\u0014\n                  reformers in championing fairness for slaves and \nfree blacks and in opposing\u0014\n                  obstacles to manumission. O'Neall's bold course led \nto charges that he\u0014\n                  surreptitiously held antislavery views -- an error \nstill echoed in the work of\u0014\n                  some historians who admire his courageous defense \nof the rights of black\u0014\n                  people. O'Neall made clear that he intended to \nstrengthen slavery by\u0014\n                  providing slaves with security and the hopes for \nmanumission as a reward\u0014\n                  for exceptional services. He called for kindness as \nindispensable, noting,\u0014\n                  \"Nothing will more assuredly defeat our institution \nof slavery than harsh\u0014\n                  legislation rigorously enforced.\" Astute \nlegislators and others saw the\u0014\n                  implications of O'Neall's bold program of reform \nand argued that it would\u0014\n                  lead to the collapse of slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     O'Neall's critics were right. As both the more \nperspicacious abolitionists\u0014\n                  and proslavery diehards understood, the proposals \nto bring slavery up to\u0014\n                  biblical standards constituted, at least \npotentially, not so much a program for\u0014\n                  reform as a revolutionary program for the \ntransformation of slavery into an\u0014\n                  alternative form of bond labor. White Southerners \nmight have decided they\u0014\n                  could live with it since it did not necessarily \nthreaten white supremacy and\u0014\n                  racial dictatorship, but some, notably the acute \nLouisa McCord, perceived\u0014\n                  clearly, while others perceived dimly, that any \nsuch transformation invited\u0014\n                  regional economic retrogression and the political \ndecline of the dominant\u0014\n                  class. In the short run, the metamorphosis of the \nslaveholders into a new\u0014\n                  class of quasi-seigneurial landowners might not \nhave undermined the power\u0014\n                  of those at the top, but it would have burdened \nthem with a system ill suited\u0014\n                  to commodity production for a world market. It \nwould have loosened their\u0014\n                  control of labor time, decreased the size of their \nmarketable surplus, and, in\u0014\n                  general, undermined their ability to respond to \nmarket fluctuations. Later\u0014\n                  developments, coming in the wake of a crushing \ndefeat in war, are no sure\u0014\n                  guide to the might-have-beens, but, along with the \nexperience of\u0014\n                  postseigneurial Europe, they do suggest that no \ncourse of action could have\u0014\n                  prevented the emergence of precisely the bourgeois \nsocial order the\u0014\n                  slaveholders had long struggled to avoid. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     A contradiction between intent and reality \nbedeviled Southerners who\u0014\n                  attempted to defend and yet transform slavery. \nRoman law established the\u0014\n                  concept of absolute property, which rationalized a \ncommercial slave system\u0014\n                  based on commodity exchange. Roman law thereby \nprovided an ideal\u0014\n                  starting point for the modern bourgeoisie as it \nfought loose from medieval\u0014\n                  notions of multiple claims to property. The \nSouthern slaveholders necessarily\u0014\n                  had to claim the rights of absolute property for \nthemselves, and they did so\u0014\n                  for the same reasons the Romans did. But \nSoutherners simultaneously had to\u0014\n                  deny that they owned human beings outright and to \nclaim only ownership of\u0014\n                  labor power and services. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Although George Fitzhugh and others proudly \nproclaimed their adherence\u0014\n                  to the idea of property in man, the proslavery \ndivines and no few secular\u0014\n                  theorists adamantly denied that they held any such \nproperty. Their denial that\u0014\n                  they held property in persons hardly ranked among \nthe strongest in the\u0014\n                  proslavery arsenal, and the abolitionists rent it \nsimply by pointing out that, in\u0014\n                  practice, the degree of control of labor power the \nslaveholders claimed\u0014\n                  required power over the body of the worker. But the \nsignificance of this\u0014\n                  argument for the development of proslavery \nideology, while virtually\u0014\n                  unnoticed by historians, should not be \nunderestimated. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Among other things, the claim that slaveholders \nheld property only in labor\u0014\n                  and services exposed the extent to which the \nproposals to reform slavery\u0014\n                  implied a neomedieval theory of property. \nHistorically, free and unfree labor\u0014\n                  have been associated with different forms of \nproperty, and, in modern\u0014\n                  societies based on absolute individual property, \nfree labor has invariably\u0014\n                  triumphed. Modern slavery arose on the crest that \nbrought absolute\u0014\n                  property to the uncontested status required by \ncapitalist expansion.\u0014\n                  Benefiting simultaneously from property in their \nlaborers and the freedom of\u0014\n                  commodities, Southern slaveholders did their utmost \nto garb slavery in older\u0014\n                  traditions according to which different people held \nrights in the same\u0014\n                  property. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The slaveholders tried to square the circle by \nclaiming both the Roman\u0014\n                  concept of property and the medieval, \nnotwithstanding their fundamental\u0014\n                  incompatibility. There can be only one Christian \nposition on property and\u0014\n                  wealth, Dabney wrote: \"Our property is purely a \ntrust fund, and the whole of\u0014\n                  it is to be used for the benefit of the owner.\" The \nowner, he made clear, is\u0014\n                  God, and the human being serves only as the Lord's \nsteward: \"The owner,\u0014\n                  as a just and benevolent man, will of course allow \nhis steward a competent\u0014\n                  subsistence out of the estate; but the profits of \nthe property are his, not his\u0014\n                  servant's.\" Dabney added, pointedly, \"The servant \nmust be duly fed and\u0014\n                  clothed, in order that he may be able to work for \nhis master\" and avoid\u0014\n                  being \"a dull, over-worked hack.\" Augustus Baldwin \nLongstreet took a\u0014\n                  more radical view and wanted to restructure the \nstate legislatures to allow\u0014\n                  for the veto of legislation by representatives of \nsuch corporate groups as\u0014\n                  agriculture, commerce, and manufacturing. \nUltimately, the center would not\u0014\n                  hold, for the proposals to reform slavery exposed \nthe harsh truth that the\u0014\n                  political and economic viability of the South or, \nmore precisely of its\u0014\n                  dominant class, required the retention of property \nin man. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The ablest defenders of slavery did not commit \nthe theological error that\u0014\n                  would have God dictate a particular social, \neconomic, or political system.\u0014\n                  They did not argue that slaveholders were exemplary \nChristians, whereas\u0014\n                  the employers of free labor could never be. Rather, \nslavery's defenders\u0014\n                  argued that slavery, milder forms of bound labor, \nor any other system based\u0014\n                  on organic social relations created conditions \nfavorable to Christian behavior\u0014\n                  and to the spread of Christianity among all \nclasses, whereas the demands of\u0014\n                  the market compelled people to choose between their \nChristian ethics and\u0014\n                  their material interests. Proslavery theorists thus \nmerged \"humanity\" and\u0014\n                  \"sentiment\" with \"interest.\" Recognizing the \ninherent sinfulness of man -- his\u0014\n                  tendency toward selfishness and destructive \nbehavior -- they concluded that\u0014\n                  a social system must encourage the wayward to treat \ntheir dependents\u0014\n                  according to the Golden Rule by providing material \nincentives. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     That was the meaning of the constant boast that \nslavery merged capital\u0014\n                  and labor into a single interest. A slaveholder has \na direct stake not only in\u0014\n                  keeping his slave alive but also in maintaining the \ngood physical and moral\u0014\n                  condition that would enhance his productivity. The \nslaveholders read with\u0014\n                  respect socialists like Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, \nand Proudhon, although,\u0014\n                  to their cost, they did not know Marx, and, like \nthe socialists, they assumed\u0014\n                  that in a society driven by the market, capitalists \nsimply could not provide\u0014\n                  the stewardship of labor to which Christian \ncapitalists might aspire. Northern\u0014\n                  conservatives, especially among the Whigs, believed \nthat strong government\u0014\n                  could render capitalism much more responsible and \nhumane, but they did\u0014\n                  not make headway before the War. Not surprisingly, \nthe slaveholders\u0014\n                  considered them dreamers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Yet a number of the proslavery theorists became \nfascinated with Louis\u0014\n                  Napoleon's social program, interpreting it as a \nbold effort to subjugate and,\u0014\n                  simultaneously, to nourish the working class. In \n1859, James Johnston\u0014\n                  Pettigrew, who knew western Europe firsthand, spoke \nwell of Napoleon III\u0014\n                  as \"really ambitious of advancing humanity,\" but \nPettigrew warned that the\u0014\n                  \"democratic element\" that had helped raise Napoleon \nIII to power \"was\u0014\n                  calculated to cause as much apprehension as the \nenemy in front.\" Pettigrew\u0014\n                  concluded that Europe needed a \"hand of iron.\" \nSoutherners usually\u0014\n                  expressed disdain for this new despot who combined \nmonarchy, demagogy,\u0014\n                  pseudodemocratism, bastardized socialism, and an \niron fist, but they\u0014\n                  grudgingly acknowledged him as the man of order \nneeded to contain the\u0014\n                  social question. Bishop Elliott, in accord with \nJohn Berrien Lindsley, hailed\u0014\n                  Napoleon III as a \"great man\" whose strong-arm \ntactics kept \"the\u0014\n                  discordant elements in the population in \nsubjection.\" Others, while\u0014\n                  denouncing him as a tyrant, recognized him as the \nlong-predicted military\u0014\n                  dictator who would restore social order to a \nderanged Europe, much as his\u0014\n                  great ancestor had done after the French \nRevolution. And besides, the\u0014\n                  proslavery theorists could hardly help chuckling \nwhen they saw a callous and\u0014\n                  arrogant bourgeoisie finally get what it deserved. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The proslavery theorists did not have time to \nponder the implications of a\u0014\n                  resurgent Bonapartism, and they fell from power \nbefore Bismarck instituted\u0014\n                  his social program in Germany. We shall never know \nhow they would have\u0014\n                  evaluated the prospects for a welfare-oriented \ncapitalism that enhanced the\u0014\n                  possibilities for a reformation under Christian \nguidance along the lines\u0014\n                  proposed in Pope Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum. We \nshould not be too hard\u0014\n                  on proponents of Southern slavery for their failure \nof imagination.\u0014\n                  Notwithstanding the immense transformations of our \nown day, who is\u0014\n                  prepared to be sanguine about capitalism's ability \nto avoid the\u0014\n                  commodification of every feature of life and to \npromote a culture in which\u0014\n                  Christian principles can flourish? \u0014\n\u0014\n                     As a matter of high probability, the new order \nenvisioned by the reformers\u0014\n                  would not easily have been able to resist the \npenetration of Northern capital\u0014\n                  and, with it, the political colonization of the \nSouth. An independent\u0014\n                  Confederacy, bent on maintaining political and \nmilitary power in an\u0014\n                  environment of nation-states embedded in a world \nmarket, could hardly\u0014\n                  have avoided the path of rapid industrialization \nand full-fledged capitalist\u0014\n                  development. Those who believe that a Southern \nConfederacy would have\u0014\n                  had to emancipate its slaves before long are \nprobably right, but the kind of\u0014\n                  emancipation that Confederates were most likely to \nconsider, in\u0014\n                  contradistinction to that which would have created \na genuinely free labor\u0014\n                  system, promised to t\u0014",

According to the Bible, the worldwide flood had \nconcluded and\u0014\n there were only 8 humans alive on earth: Noah, his wife, their three \nsons and\u0014\n daughters in law. Noah's son Ham had seen \"the nakedness of his \nfather.\" So,\u0014\n Noah laid a curse -- not on Ham but on his grandson Canaan, and on \nall of Canaan's\u0014\n descendants:  \u0014\n\u0014\n      Genesis 9:25-27: \"Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will \nhe be to his\u0014\n      brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! \nMay Canaan\u0014\n      be the slave of Shem. May God extend the territory of Japheth; \nmay\u0014\n      Japeth live in the tents of Shem and may Canaan be his slave.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n Christians at the time believed that Canaan had settled in Africa. \nThe dark skin of\u0014\n Africans became associated with this \"curse of Ham.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n \"This reading of the Book of Genesis merged easily into a medieval \niconographic\u0014\n tradition in which devils were always depicted as black. Later \npseudo-scientific\u0014\n theories would be built around African skull shapes, dental \nstructure, and body\u0014\n postures, in an attempt to find an unassailable argument--rooted in \nwhatever\u0014\n the most persuasive contemporary idiom happened to be: law, theology,\u0014\n genealogy, or natural science -- why one part of the human race \nshould live in\u0014\n perpetual indebtedness to another.\" 23\u0014\n\u0014\n By today's secular and religious standards:\u0014\n\u0014\n      slavery is immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\n      cursing all of an individual's descendents into perpetual \nslavery because of a\u0014\n      single inappropriate act by an ancestor is immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\n      laying a curse on the son of the person who committed the act \nis immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\n But in previous centuries, cursing a whole race into slavery was \nconsidered\u0014\n acceptable because it was in the Bible. The American slave owner \nfelt that he\u0014\n was carrying out God's plan by buying and using slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\n Slavery was also condoned and regulated in many passages of the in \nthe Bible.\u0014\n There is no record of Jesus having commented on it. Paul had every \nopportunity\u0014\n to condemn slavery, particularly in his Epistle Philemon. But he \nremained silent.\u0014\n\u0014\n More details on slavery in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n Christian support for slavery, prior to the late 17th century CE:\u0014\n\u0014\n Slavery was sanctioned and carefully regulated by many passages in \nthe Hebrew\u0014\n Scriptures (Old Testament) largely in the Pentateuch - its first 5 \nbooks. Although\u0014\n slavery was widespread in Palestine during Jesus' ministry, he is \nnot recorded as\u0014\n having expressed any opinion on it. Slavery was casually mentioned \nwithout\u0014\n criticism in the various books of the Christian Scriptures (New \nTestament). \u0014\n\u0014\n      Circa 340 CE: Manichean Christians had been inciting slaves of \nthe Roman\u0014\n      Empire to take charge of their destiny and emancipate \nthemselves.\u0014\n      (Manichaeism was a Christian heresy based upon the teachings of \na 3rd\u0014\n      century Persian philosopher, Mani.) In response, the Christian \nCouncil of\u0014\n      Gangra issued a statement supporting slavery: \"If anyone, on \nthe pretext of\u0014\n      religion, teaches another man's slave to despise his master and \nto\u0014\n      withdraw from his service, and not serve his master with good \nwill and all\u0014\n      respect, let him be anathema.\" 2 This resolution became part of \nthe\u0014\n      Catholic church's canon law and was quoted as an authoritative \nsource until\u0014\n      the middle of the 18th century. \u0014\n\u0014\n      595 CE: Pope Gregory dispatched a priest to Britain to purchase \nPagan boys\u0014\n      to work as slaves on church estates.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Circa 600 CE: Pope Gregory I wrote, in Pastoral Rule: \"Slaves \nshould be\u0014\n      told...not [to] despise their masters and recognize that they \nare only\u0014\n      slaves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      655 CE: In an attempt to persuade priests to remain celibate, \nthe 9th\u0014\n      Council of Toledo ruled that all children of clerics were to be \nautomatically\u0014\n      enslaved. This ruling was later incorporated into the canon law \nof the\u0014\n      church.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1452/4 CE: Pope Nicholas V wrote Dum Diversas which granted to \nthe kings\u0014\n      of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any \"Saracens \n[Muslims] and\u0014\n      pagans and any other unbelievers\" to perpetual slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1519: Bartholomew De Las Casas, a Dominican, argued against \nslavery. \"No\u0014\n      one may be deprived of his liberty nor may any person be \nenslaved\" He\u0014\n      was ridiculed, silenced and ignored. 19\u0014\n\u0014\n      1537 CE: Pope Paul III wrote in Sublimis Deus that Native \nAmericans were\u0014\n      not to be enslaved. Only  hostile non-Christians, captured in \njust wars could\u0014\n      become slaves. However, in later years, the enslavement of \nNative people\u0014\n      became quite common. The founder of the Hotel Dieu hospital in \nMontreal,\u0014\n      Quebec owned one of the largest group of slaves. Almost all \nwere Natives.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1548 CE: Pope Paul III confirmed that any individual may freely \nbuy, sell and\u0014\n      own slaves. Runaway slaves were to be returned to their owners \nfor\u0014\n      punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1660: Charles II of Britain urged the Council for Foreign \nPlantations to\u0014\n      teach Christianity to slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1629 to 1661 CE: Pope Urban VIII in 1629, Pope Innocent X in \n1645 and Pope\u0014\n      Alexander VII in 1661 were all personally involved in the \npurchase of Muslim\u0014\n      slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\n      By the late 17th century, the institution of slavery was a \nintegral part of\u0014\n      many societies worldwide. The Roman Catholic church only placed \ntwo\u0014\n      restrictions on the purchase and owning of slaves: \u0014\n\u0014\n           They had to be non-Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n           They had to be captured during \"just\" warfare. i.e. in \nwars involving\u0014\n           Christian armies fighting for an honorable cause. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Late in the 17th century, a Roman Catholic theologian, Leander,\u0014\n      wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n           \"It is certainly a matter of faith that this sort of \nslavery in\u0014\n           which a man serves his master as his slave, is altogether\u0014\n           lawful. This is proved from Holy Scripture...It is also\u0014\n           proved from reason for it is not unreasonable that just as\u0014\n           things which are captured in a just war pass into the\u0014\n           power and ownership of the victors, so persons captured\u0014\n           in war pass into the ownership of the captors... All\u0014\n           theologians are unanimous on this.\" 18\u0014\n\u0014\n      We have been unable to find anyone criticizing the institution \nof\u0014\n      slavery prior to this time. People considered it quite \nappropriate for\u0014\n      one person to own another human being as a piece of property. \nPaul's\u0014\n      comment in Galatians 3:28: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, \nthere is\u0014\n      neither bond nor free...for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" \ndid not\u0014\n      appear to have been followed, except perhaps spiritually. \nNeither\u0014\n      were the statements by Jesus about treating one's fellow humans\u0014\n      accepted and applied.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      1667: The Virginia Assembly passes a bill which denied that a \nChristian\u0014\n      baptism grants freedom to slaves\u0014\n\u0014\n      1680:  \u0014\n\u0014\n           The Anglican Church in Virginia started a debate, which \nlasted for 50\u0014\n           years, on whether slaves should be given Christian \ninstruction. They\u0014\n           finally decided in the affirmative. However the landowners \nand slave\u0014\n           owners opposed this program. They feared that if the \nslaves became\u0014\n           Christians, there would be support that they be given \ntheir freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n           The Roman Catholic church in South America insisted that \nslaves be\u0014\n           allowed to marry. They forbade \"promiscuous relationships \nbetween\u0014\n           slaves as well as between masters and slaves, and it \nencouraged\u0014\n           marriage instead of informal mating.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           In the predominately Protestant North America, slaves were\u0014\n           considered property and were not allowed to marry. The \ncourts\u0014\n           decided that a slave owner should be free to sell his \nproperty has he\u0014\n           wished. This overturned laws which prevented slave \nfamilies from\u0014\n           being broken up and the individuals sold separately. 21\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Throughout most of the colonial period, opposition to slavery among \nwhite\u0014\n Americans was virtually nonexistent. Settlers in the 17th and early \n18th\u0014\n centuries came from sharply stratified societies in which the \nwealthy savagely\u0014\n exploited members of the lower classes. Lacking a later generations \nbelief in\u0014\n natural human equality, they saw little reason to question the \nenslavement of\u0014\n Africans.\" 21\u0014\n\u0014\n The \"most abominable aspect of the slave trade, was fueled by the \nidea that\u0014\n Africans, even children, were better off Christianized under a \nsystem of\u0014\n European slavery than left in Africa amid tribal wars, famines and \npaganism\"  22 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Anabaptist demonstrations against slavery; late 17th century\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      1665: Richard Baxter, an ordained priest of the Church of \nEngland,\u0014\n      criticized those who: \"catch up poor Negroes...and...make them \nslaves and\u0014\n      sell them...[This is] one of the worst kinds of thefts in the \nworld...such\u0014\n      persons are to be taken as the common enemies of mankind.\" He, \nand a\u0014\n      very few others who spoke out, had essentially no influence and \nwere\u0014\n      ignored by governments and the public alike.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1683: The first religious group in the U.S. to raise objections \nto slavery\u0014\n      were Mennonites, a Christian group which descended from the \nAnabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Anabaptists had broken away from Luther and Calvin's Protestant \nReformation in the\u0014\n      16th century. Their name comes from the Latin word \n\"anabaptista\" which means\u0014\n      \"one who is rebaptized.\" i.e. a person who was baptized first \nas an infant and later\u0014\n      as an adult. It is a misnomer, because Anabaptists did not \nbaptize infants and did not\u0014\n      recognize the validity of such a baptism. Baptisms were only \nperformed later in life\u0014\n      after the individual is sufficiently mature and has trusted \nJesus as Lord and Savior.\u0014\n      \"Anabaptist\" was originally a term of derision; but the name \nstuck.\u0014\n\u0014\n      One notable feature of the Anabaptists was their love of \nfreedom from\u0014\n      state and religious oppression. They opposed war. They opposed \nthe\u0014\n      taking of oaths in court, believing that a person's word is \nsufficient.\u0014\n      They observed a life of simplicity, with minimal entanglement \nwith\u0014\n      the state.\u0014\n\u0014\n      One of the sects to emerge from the Anabaptist movement were the\u0014\n      Mennonites. Their first permanent settlement in North America \nwas at\u0014\n      Germantown PA (near Philadelphia) in 1683. \"This growing \nMennonite\u0014\n      element is credited with American history's first public protest\u0014\n      against slavery and was very influential in the later Quaker\u0014\n      antislavery position.\" 3 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      1688:A \"Germantown Protest\" pamphlet was printed by Mennonites \nin\u0014\n      Pennsylvania. (Some sources say Quakers; others say Mennonite \nQuakers). It\u0014\n      said, in part: \"Now, tho' they are black, we cannot conceive \nthere is more\u0014\n      liberty to have them slaves, as it is to have other white \nones...And those\u0014\n      who steal or rob men, and those who buy or purchase them, are \nthey not\u0014\n      all alike?\" The document was not well received by the rich \nslave owners in\u0014\n      the region. The Mennonites found themselves rejected and \nisolated by the\u0014\n      rest of Christian society for their radical views. \"They got \nlittle help from\u0014\n      outsiders. Their deprivation was such that Germantown was \nnicknamed\u0014\n      'Armentown' or Poortown.\" 10\u0014\n\u0014\n      1694: A group of Christian clergy petitioned the Massachusetts \ngovernment\u0014\n      to pass a bill which would allow slave owners to retain their \nslaves after the\u0014\n      latter were baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1696: The Society of Friends (the Quakers) is a second faith \ngroup with\u0014\n      Anabaptist roots. They threatened any of their members who \nimported\u0014\n      slaves with expulsion from the denomination. 21 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n During the late 17th century and early 18th century, slavery became \na growing\u0014\n concern among  the Quakers. In protest against slavery, they \nrelocated from their\u0014\n settlements in the southern U.S. states into Indiana and Ohio. \u0014\n\u0014\n Meanwhile, the vast majority of Christian denominations (those which \nwere not\u0014\n Anabaptist) were not troubled by slavery; they continued to view and \nteach it as\u0014\n a spiritually and morally acceptable institution fully supported by \nthe Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Abolition gains momentum: 18th century\u0014\n\u0014\n British Quakers were the first organized religious group to both \nrepudiate slavery\u0014\n and to forbid slave owning among their membership. They provided \nmuch of the\u0014\n leadership of the abolitionist movement, both in Britain and North \nAmerica.\u0014\n However, their influence was limited by their small numerical \nstrength. It was\u0014\n John Wesley (1703-1791), founder of the Methodist movement, who was \nable to\u0014\n convert the small Quaker protest into a mass movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n By the end of the 18th century, slavery appeared to be a dying \ninstitution. In\u0014\n Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, farmers had largely switched from \ntobacco to\u0014\n grains. This required less manpower. Many slave owners freed their \nslaves to\u0014\n avoid the costs of having to care for them. But the invention of Eli \nWitney's\u0014\n cotton gin reversed this trend. Short-staple cotton became very \nprofitable in the\u0014\n south. Production of cotton in the South increased from 3,135 bales \nin 1790 to 4.8\u0014\n million bales at the outbreak of the Civil War. With the increased \nproduction of\u0014\n cotton, the demand for slaves increased. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      1706: Cotton Mather, a Puritain leader, writes \"The Negro \nChristianized.\" It\u0014\n      argues that blacks are human beings and should be given full \nrights.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1723: The German Baptist Brethren arrived in Pennsylvania. They \nwere\u0014\n      known as the Dunkers and later as the Church of the Brethren. \nLike their\u0014\n      fellow Anabaptists, they actively opposed slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1734: The Great Awakening starts in MA. This is a Christian \nrevival that\u0014\n      promoted religious fervor among whites and blacks. Blacks were\u0014\n      encouraged to join the Methodist and Baptist churches.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1752: George Washington acquired his sister-in-law's share in \nthe Mount\u0014\n      Vernon estate in 1752. The purchase included 18 slaves. He \nadded to his\u0014\n      collection; at one time he owned over 300 humans. In his will, \nhe stipulated\u0014\n      that at the death of his wife, his slaves would be freed. He \nalso required\u0014\n      that a fund be set up to support aged and infirmed slaves; it \nappears that\u0014\n      the fund was never established. 21 During the 1780s and 1790s, \nhe\u0014\n      expressed the wish in his private writings that state \ngovernments would\u0014\n      legislate \"a gradual Abolition of Slavery.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      1758: The Philadelphia yearly meeting of Quakers decided that \nslavery was\u0014\n      inconsistent with Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1761: Slave traders were excluded from membership in the \nSociety of\u0014\n      Friends (the Quakers). Some individual Quakers still owned \nslaves at this\u0014\n      time.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1774: Thomas Jefferson owned 187 slaves on his various farms.\u0014\n\u0014\n      17??: The Roman Catholic church's Sacred Congregation of the \nIndex\u0014\n      placed many anti-slavery tracts on their Index of Forbidden \nBooks to\u0014\n      prevent them from being read by the public.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1775: Quakers were mainly responsible for the founding of the \nPennsylvania\u0014\n      Society for the Abolition of Slavery. This was the first \nantislavery society\u0014\n      in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1776: David Hartley makes a motion to outlaw slavery in Britain \nand in\u0014\n      British colonies. He calls slavery \"contrary to the laws of God \nand the rights\u0014\n      of man.\" The motion fails. 21\u0014\n\u0014\n      1777: Slavery is abolished in Vermont.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1784: The Christmas Conference of the Methodist Church passes an\u0014\n      anti-slavery resolution.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1786: The Society of Friends (Quakers) mounts legal lawsuits to \nfree slaves\u0014\n      who are visiting Philadelphia with their owners. George \nWashington\u0014\n      recommends that visiting slave owners avoid problems by \nbypassing the\u0014\n      city. 21\u0014\n\u0014\n      1786: About 10% of the 18,791 Methodists are black. 21\u0014\n\u0014\n      1787: Richard Allen, a former slave, organizes the Free African \nSociety in\u0014\n      Philadelphia, PA.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1789: There is considerable abolitionist feeling the Southern \nChristian\u0014\n      churches. Some southern plantation owners feel uneasy about \nslavery. They\u0014\n      institute educational programs and free many slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1791: In Canada, the legislature of Upper Canada (now called \nOntario)\u0014\n      passed a law to gradually abolish slavery. No more slaves could \nbe\u0014\n      imported; existing slaves would remain enslaved for life; \nchildren of female\u0014\n      slaves would receive their freedom at age 25. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1793: Blacks totaled 18,500 (25%) out of a total of 73,417 \nBaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1799: The second Great Awakening began in Kentucky. Many slaves \nbecome\u0014\n      Christians. It lasts until 1830.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1800: Virginia passed a law forbidding Afro-Americans from \ngathering after\u0014\n      sunset for religious worship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Abolition of Slavery: 19th century:\u0014\n\u0014\n Methodists in the state of Georgia followed John Wesley's lead and \ncondemned\u0014\n slavery. During the early 19th century, Wesleyans \"learned to subdue \ntheir\u0014\n critique, in order to grow in membership...Unlike Calvinist \nintellectuals such as\u0014\n Charles Colcock Jones, Methodists rarely used the Old Testament \npatriarchs and\u0014\n their hierarchical values to buttress the pro-slavery case. Relying \nmainly on the\u0014\n letters attributed to Paul, Georgia Wesleyans argued that slavery was\u0014\n scripturally allowable, but not necessarily ideal. In the \nante-bellum era their\u0014\n theoretical position was neither proslavery nor antislavery, but \nneutrality.\u0014\n Christians lived in an imperfect world where slavery was sanctioned \nby law;\u0014\n therefore, the church should coexist with slavery, just as it did in \nPaul's day.\" 21\u0014\n\u0014\n      1800 +: The Roman Catholic church's Sacred Congregation of the \nIndex\u0014\n      continued to place many anti-slavery tracts on their Index of \nForbidden\u0014\n      Books in order to prevent the public from reading them.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1803: Cotton becomes the main U.S. export crop.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1806 to 1811: Three bills were passed in England which \nprogressively\u0014\n      throttled the British slave trade.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1807: The first black Methodist church, the African Union \nChurch, was\u0014\n      incorporated in Wilmington DE.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1808: Import of slaves into the U.S. was criminalized. Some \nslaves were\u0014\n      imported illegally up to 1860. Estimates range from 250,000 to \n1 million.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1816: The African Methodist Episcopal Church is founded in \nPhiladelphia\u0014\n      PA.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1818: The Chief Justice in  Upper Canada (now Ontario) ruled \nthat a\u0014\n      runaway slave should not be returned to the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1821: Benjamin Lunday, a Quaker from Ohio, started an \nanti-slavery\u0014\n      newspaper \"The Genius of Universal Emancipation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      1821: The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is founded. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1825: Fanny Wright (1795-1852), organized Nashoba. This was a \ntraining\u0014\n      school to help slaves handle liberation from slavery. She was a \nreligious\u0014\n      free-thinker (secularist), and was the first American woman to \npersonally\u0014\n      speak out against slavery in public. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1829's: Congregationalists, Quakers, Mennonites, Methodists and \nUnitarians\u0014\n      organized the \"underground railway\" to help slaves escape \nnorthward\u0014\n      towards Canada and southward into Spanish held territories. 6  \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      1829: David Walker, a free-born Afro-American published the \nfirst major\u0014\n      U.S. anti-slavery publication: \"The David Walker's Appeal in \nFour Articles\u0014\n      Together With A Preamble, To The Coloured Citizens of The \nWorld, But In\u0014\n      Particular, And Very Expressly, To Those of The United States \nof America.\"\u0014\n      Walker died in 1830. Some suspect that a group of slave-owning \nSouthern\u0014\n      governors took a contract out on his life. He criticized \nChristian\u0014\n      denominations for their relative silence about slavery and \nracism; he\u0014\n      condemned those among the white clergy who supported slavery. 5\u0014\n\u0014\n      1830: The Plantation Mission Movement began. Methodist chapels \nwere\u0014\n      constructed on many plantations.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1831: Nat Turner, a Baptist slave pastor, led a major sustained \nslave revolt\u0014\n      in Virginia. He was inspired by the messages of the Old \nTestament prophets\u0014\n      and their calls for justice. \"...the notion that slavery was \nGod's will gained\u0014\n      momentum after the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831. In \nhundreds of\u0014\n      pamphlets, written from 1836 to 1866, Southern slaveholders were\u0014\n      provided a host of religious reasons to justify the social \ncaste system they\u0014\n      had created.\" 24\u0014\n\u0014\n      1833: Over 1,000 regional, state and city groups joined \ntogether to found\u0014\n      the American Anti-Slavery Society.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1833: The British Parliament passed a law which quickly phased \nout slavery\u0014\n      in Britain and its colonies, including Canada. Slave trading by \nother\u0014\n      countries was gradually snuffed out during the following 3 \ndecades, by a\u0014\n      series of treaties and the capture of over 1,000 slave ships by \nthe British.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1833: The Anti-Slavery Convention of 1833 was held. One of the\u0014\n      vice-presidents was Dr. Lord, who later reversed his stance. He \nbecame an\u0014\n      \"advocate of slavery as a divine institution, and denounced woe \nupon the\u0014\n      abolitionists for interfering with the will and purpose of the \nCreator.\" 24\u0014\n\u0014\n      1838: The Presbyterian church divided over slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1839: Pope Gregory XVI wrote in Supremo Apostolatus that he \nadmonishes\u0014\n      and adjures \"in the Lord all believers in Christ, of whatsoever \ncondition,\u0014\n      that no one hereafter may dare unjustly to molest Indians, \nNegroes, or\u0014\n      other men of this sort;...or to reduce them to slavery...\" The \noperative\u0014\n      word is unjustly. The Pope did not condemn slavery if the \nslaves had been\u0014\n      captured justly. Roman Catholic Bishops in the Southern U.S. \ndetermined\u0014\n      that this prohibition did not apply to slavery in the U.S. To \ntheir credit,\u0014\n      various other popes did order or otherwise influence the \nemancipation of\u0014\n      slaves that they considered to be unjustly enslaved.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1840: By this time, the United States had developed an obvious\u0014\n      north/south split over slavery. The cotton-based economy of the \nSouthern\u0014\n      states depended largely on the low cost labor provided by the \nslave\u0014\n      population. In the industrialized North, slavery had become \nonly marginally\u0014\n      economic. This split was reflected in the views of the various \nChristian\u0014\n      denominations with respect to abolition. Many Christians in the \nsouthern\u0014\n      states saw abolition as a massive threat to their culture and \neconomy. They\u0014\n      did not view slavery as a sin; their leaders were able to quote \nmany Biblical\u0014\n      passages in support of slavery. Many Christians in the northern \nstates had\u0014\n      gradually built up a revulsion towards the \"peculiar \ninstitution.\" In\u0014\n      opposition to slavery, they frequently quoted Jesus' statements \nabout\u0014\n      treating others with respect and love. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1841 to 1844: The Baptist movement in the U.S. had maintained a \nstrained\u0014\n      peace by carefully avoiding discussion of the topic. The \nAmerican Baptist\u0014\n      Foreign Mission Board took neither a pro nor anti-slavery \nposition. An\u0014\n      American Baptist Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 brought the \nissue into\u0014\n      the open. Southern delegates to the 1841 Triennial Convention \nof the\u0014\n      Board \"protested the abolitionist agitation and argued that, \nwhile slavery\u0014\n      was a calamity and a great evil, it was not a sin according to \nthe Bible.\" 15\u0014\n      The Board later denied a request by the Alabama Convention that \nslave\u0014\n      owners be eligible to become missionaries. In a test case, the \nGeorgia\u0014\n      Baptist nominated a slave owner as a missionary and asked asked \nthe Home\u0014\n      Missions Society to approve their choice. No decision was made. \nFinally, a\u0014\n      Baptist Free Mission Society was formed; \"it refused 'tainted' \nSouthern\u0014\n      money.\" The Southern members withdrew and formed the Southern \nBaptist\u0014\n      Convention, which eventually grew to become the largest \nProtestant\u0014\n      denomination in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1843: Clergy and laity of the Methodist Episcopal Church left \nto form the\u0014\n      Wesleyan Methodist Church in America. The split was caused \nprimarily by\u0014\n      the slavery issue. The church had reneged on an earlier \ndecision to forbid\u0014\n      members to own slaves. Church teaching and practices were two \nadditional\u0014\n      points of friction. The Wesleyan Methodist Church continues \ntoday as the\u0014\n      Wesleyan Church. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1843: \"In 1843, 1,200 Methodist ministers owned 1,500 slaves, \nand 25,000\u0014\n      members owned 208,000 slaves...the Methodist Church as a whole\u0014\n      remained silent and neutral on the issue of slavery.\" 25\u0014\n\u0014\n      1844: The General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church \nsplit into\u0014\n      two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power \nof bishops\u0014\n      in the denomination. The two General Conferences, the Methodist\u0014\n      Episcopal Church (North) and Methodist Episcopal church, South \nremained\u0014\n      separate until a merger in 1939 created the Methodist Church. \nThe latter\u0014\n      became the present United Methodist Church as a result of \nadditional\u0014\n      mergers. 16\u0014\n\u0014\n      1851: J.F. Brennan published \"Bible defense of slavery.\" He \nclaimed that\u0014\n      Cain's parents were Eve and the serpent. 27\u0014\n\u0014\n      1860: Ministers and laity of the Methodist Episcopal Church's \nGenesee\u0014\n      Conference in western New York state were expelled from the \nchurch for\u0014\n      insubordination. They left to form the Free Methodist Church of \nNorth\u0014\n      America. They split over a variety of factors, including \ntheological\u0014\n      disagreements, the perceived worldliness of the original \nchurch, and\u0014\n      slavery. Their leader \"...Roberts and most of his followers \nwere radical\u0014\n      abolitionists in the years immediately prior to the Civil War, \nat a time\u0014\n      when many within the Methodist Episcopal church were hesitant \nin their\u0014\n      condemnation of the practice of slavery.\" The denomination \ncontinues\u0014\n      today in the U.S., Canada and in countries around the world. 20\u0014\n\u0014\n      1861: The Presbyterians were able to remain united in spite of \ntensions\u0014\n      created by the slavery issue. Shortly after the Civil War \nbegan, the\u0014\n      Southern presbyteries of the United Presbyterian Church in the \nUnited\u0014\n      States of America withdrew and organized the Presbyterian \nChurch in the\u0014\n      Confederate States (later renamed the Presbyterian Church in \nthe United\u0014\n      States). The split was healed in 1983 with the merger of these \ntwo bodies\u0014\n      and the creation of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).\u0014\n\u0014\n      1861-1865: The Civil War (a.k.a. the war between the states) \nwas fought.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1863: President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation \nProclamation on\u0014\n      JAN-1. This is believed by many to have freed the slaves. \nActually, it did\u0014\n      not. Former slaves in the Northern states had already been \nfreed; slaves in\u0014\n      the south were part of the Confederacy, and thus immune to Union\u0014\n      proclamations. \u0014\n\u0014\n      1865: The 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates\u0014\n      ended slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1866: The Holy Office of the Vatican issued a statement in \nsupport of\u0014\n      slavery. It was apparently triggered by the passage of the 13th \nAmendment.\u0014\n      It said that \"Slavery itself...is not at all contrary to the \nnatural and divine\u0014\n      law...The purchaser [of the slave] should carefully examine \nwhether the\u0014\n      slave who is put up for sale has been justly or unjustly \ndeprived of his\u0014\n      liberty, and that the vendor should do nothing which might \nendanger the\u0014\n      life, virtue, or Catholic faith of the slave.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      1873: Pope Pius IX was concerned about the \"wreched Ethopians \nin Central\u0014\n      Africa.\" He prayed that \"Almighty God may at length remove the \ncurse of\u0014\n      Cham [Ham] from their hearts.\" God's curse on Ham was that the \nCanaanite\u0014\n      people would be forever enslaved. Some theologians had long \nused this\u0014\n      Biblical passage to justify enslavement of Africans.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1888: Brazil became the last country in the Western hemisphere \nto abolish\u0014\n      slavery. The Roman Catholic Church reversed its stance \"from the\u0014\n      affirmation to the condemnation of slavery.\" 2 Pope Leo XIII \nsent a letter\u0014\n      to the Brazilian Bishops saying that \"from the beginning, \nalmost nothing\u0014\n      was more venerated in the Catholic Church...that the fact that \nshe looked\u0014\n      to see a slavery eased and abolished...Many of our \npredecessors...made\u0014\n      every effort to ensure that the institution of slavery should \nbe abolished\u0014\n      where it existed and that its roots should not revive where it \nhad been\u0014\n      destroyed.\" This statement does not agree with the historical \nrecord.\u0014\n      Previous church documents clearly stated that slavery was quite\u0014\n      permissible, as long as the slave was a non-Christian and the \nslave's captors\u0014\n      were fighting in a just war.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1917: The Roman Catholic church's Canon Law is expanded to \ndeclare a that\u0014\n      \"selling a human being into slavery or for any other evil \npurpose\" is a\u0014\n      crime.\u0014\n\u0014\n      1965: The Vatican II document \"Pastoral Constitution on the \nChurch in the\u0014\n      Modern World\" stated \"Whatever violates the integrity of the \nhuman\u0014\n      person, such as mutilation, torture...whatever insults human \ndignity, such\u0014\n      as...slavery, prostitution and selling of women and \nchildren...all these\u0014\n      things and others like them are infamous...Human \ninstitutions...should be\u0014\n      bulwarks against any kind of political or social slavery and \nguardians of\u0014\n      basic rights under any kind of government.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n The rejection of slavery as a profoundly immoral practice  became \ngradually\u0014\n accepted by Christians throughout Western countries. This had a \nserious negative\u0014\n effect on the Christian faith. By rejecting the validity of the \npro-slavery passages\u0014\n in the Bible, they were forced to accept that the Bible could not be \nconsidered a\u0014\n totally reliable guide on civil and moral topics. This created a \nserious\u0014\n disillusionment among 19th century Christians. The authority of the \nBible became\u0014\n suspect for the first time. In the intervening years, the slavery \npassages became\u0014\n almost entirely ignored. Some translations of the Bible softened the \nverses by\u0014\n replacing \"slave\" with \"servant.\" However, the Bible could no longer \nbe fully\u0014\n accepted as a guide for public and personal morality, equally \napplicable for all\u0014\n societies and all eras. Some Biblical moral truths became widely \naccepted as true\u0014\n only for a specific group or for a specific time in history.\u0014\n\u0014\n Slavery is still advocated in North America by some \nReconstructionist Christians\u0014\n and a few racist fringe groups within the Christian Identity \nmovement. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Related essays on this site:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Slavery in the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n References:\u0014\n\u0014\n   1.\"What is an Anabaptist,\"  at:\u0014\n      http://www.anabaptists.org/history/what.html \u0014\n   2.M.

    "title": "CAN A PERSON REALY CHANGE?",
    "words": "\"Time\" Magazine (June 5, 2000). In the very back there is always a \nshort essay, This time it was by Mark Leyner (prolific modern writer \nout of New Jersey) and he asks a question: \"Can a person really, and \nI mean fundamentally, change?\" Mark Leyner says, No. There is no such \nanimal, he says, as a changed man. \"I don't believe in epiphanies, \npersonal growth, midlife crises, or death bed conversions.\" He's \nconvinced that the assumptions behind psychiatry, prison reform, and \nreligion are all false. That we are who we are through millions of \nyears of Darwinian evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nStrangely, he adds that, in addition to evolution, everything his \nparents did to mold him made him who he is. That seems a bit \ncontradictory but ok. Let's give him that. Evolution and early social \ninfluences creates a person. The die is cast. A personality is \nformed. Irrevocable.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou might find this surprising but I agree with Mark Leyner. You and \nI cannot change. Even if I had a death bed experience or someone came \nback from the grave to warn me of the judgment to come, it would not \nfundamentally change my behavior. I would continue to live as I \nalways have. (Luke 16:30-31).\u0014\n\u0014\nI think this is Nicodemus' confusion. \"If you're a Jew you're a Jew. \nIf you're a Gentile you're a gentile. Nothing will ever change that. \nI'm a grown man, Jesus. I can't come out of my mother's womb again \nand start all over. I can't be born again!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nicodemus, there is the Spirit and it is like wind. You do not know \nwhere it has come from and you do not know where it is going. And \nNicodemus...so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. God can\u0014\nchange you simply by an act of his grace. There is no reason for it \nhaving happened and there is no explanation for it's continuance. The \nwind: you can hear it but you cannot map it's journey. This man, that \nwoman, this old man, this young child has been changed, \nfundamentally. But, Darwin has no theories to explain this evolution.'\u0014\n\u0014\nThe changes that take place in us do not come from this world and our \neffort. I cannot change. But what Mark the columnist does not \nunderstand Paul the apostle does. When the Spirit breaths new life in \nus it is no longer I who live, but Christ, who lives in me.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrett Blair\u0014",

    "words": "Jesus does not promise to calm every storm in your life. Jesus does\u0014\npromise to calm you in every storm of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wesley could hardly have been called a faint-hearted stay- \nat-home.\u0014\nBut there were times when even he lost his nerve. During one of \nWesley's\u0014\nseveral Atlantic crossings, a frighteningly fierce storm broke out,\u0014\npitching and tossing the ship about like a bathtub toy. While Wesley \nand\u0014\nothers clung to their bunks and hid their heads, a community of\u0014\nMoravians, traveling to their new homeland, calmly gathered to hold\u0014\ntheir daily worship service and sing praises to God. Watching these\u0014\nMoravians, so apparently unperturbed by the howling winds and crashing\u0014\nwaves, Wesley realized he was witnessing a truly waterproof faith. \nFrom\u0014\nthat moment on, John Wesley prayed that God would give him the ability\u0014\nto likewise ride out life's storms with as much confidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat made those Moravians so peaceful in the face of the tempest? It \nwas\u0014\nthe same trait that the disciples so woefully lacked in today's gospel\u0014\ntext: an unquenchable trust in Jesus Christ. After stretching out his\u0014\narms and stilling the storm, Jesus turned to his companions and\u0014\nchastised them. By cowardly cringing and crying out to Jesus in fear,\u0014\nthey had revealed the shallowness of their faith. Although they had \nbeen\u0014\nspecially chosen as Jesus' fellow travelers on this journey, they \nmissed\u0014\nthe boat.\u0014",

    "title": "CRUELTY IS TOO EASILY JUSTIFIED",
    "words": "Cruelty is Too Easily Justified.  By Leonard Pitts       MIAMI      \n6/26/00\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you heard the one about the guy who beat his dog to death \nbecause he thought it was gay? It is not a joke.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty-eight-year-old George Finley of Ocala, Florida, was sentenced \nThursday to six months in jail. According to reports, Finley became \nirritated last July at the way  General Lee, a poodle-Yorkie mix, \nbehaved toward another family dog.  Finley interpreted the behavic as \nhomosexual so he hit the dog with a. vauum cleaner wand, cracking\t \nitsskull. Then he threw against a tree and left it there for two \nhours, refusing to allow anyone to take it for medical help.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen General Lee finally did reach the vet, it was too late. The \ndoctor had to put him to sleep.\u0014\nSome observers already have seized upon this incident as a neon \nexample of cruelty to animals. I have no argument with that. But I \nfind myself even more interested in what it says about  cruelty to \nhomosexuals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's cruelty people sometimes seem all too ready to tolerate or, \nindeed, justify\u0014\n as if gay people lived somewhere beyond the human covenant, beyond \nthe need to restrain our most flendish impulses.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'M REMINDED that the oldest trick of the propagandist is to \ndehumanize the hated other, to objectlfy him and make him \nfacelessthereby making it okay to hurt him. If you don't believe \nthat, listen to 'what some people say next there is an act of \nviolence against a gay man or lesbian. Listen to the way they \nmodulate their voices in soothing tones of apparent  reason. Listen \nto how they go tut-tut, how they say all the right things about \nviolence being wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then, listen to how they rationalize: You can't blame people for \nbeing passionate against homosexuals, they will say, because the gays \nare born child molesters. Too bad this kid got injured or that one \nkilled, they say, like these things wouldn't happen if the gays just \nlived quietly instead of flaunting their condition, demanding special \nrights, and going to all these pride rallies and stuff. And think \nabout it: How would you like it if one of them came on to you? \nBesides, the Bible says 'they're abominations and we always, but \nalways, adhere to the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nProblem is, the rationalizations are irrational, the justificatlons \nunjust. Problem is, they blame the violence on everything except the \nobvious, everythlng except unreasoned hate.\u0014\n\u0014\nS0,1 FIND myself wondering what people like those would make of the \nmurder of this dog:\u0014\nDo they figure General Lee was a born puppy molester?\u0014\nDid he flaunt ~his homosexuality?\u0014\nMaybe had a pink doggie collar or something?\u0014\nWere straight dogs nervous around him?\u0014\nDid God hate General Lee?' '\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd here's the extra-credit question. Why is it always so easy for \nbigots toratlonalize their blgotry?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the way, for whatever it's worth, the dog probably wasn't \"gay  \nat least not as we understand the term.  According to Bash Dibra, a \nNew York State animal behaviorist and author of the book Dogspeak, \nWhat the guy probably saw was normal behavior of dogs showing their \ndominance.... A dog would assert himself saying, I'm in charge. He \nwould jump on the other dog and go to the mounting behavior, That is \nhow a dominant dog tells the subordinate male that [this is] his \nturf.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other' words, by dog standards, General Lee's behavior, was \nactually, well... macho. Strange irony, isn't it\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it's an irony you suspect would.be lost on a George Finley. More \nto the point, lost on the all-too-many of' us for whom deep-seated \nfear and loathing of that which seems different automatically cancels \nthinking cancels compassion, cancels simple decency. Fear and loathing\u0014\nare a poison the soul. And who can really be surprised when poison \nkills?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, the only surprise here is that the victim was a dog.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time.\u0014\nTribune Media Services\u0014",

Still, according to the Muslim \ntraditions of Afghanistan, space was made so that relatives of the \ncondemned pair, including 'small children, could have a clear view of \nthe type of justice preferred by the Taliban, which now controls \nthree-quarters of the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe condemned woman, Nurbibi, 40, was lowered into a pit dug into \nthe. earth beside the wall until only her chest and head were above \nground. Witnesses said she was dressed in a sky-blue burqa, the \nhead-to-toe shroud with a slit for the eyes that the Taliban require \nall women to wear when they are outside their homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nNurbibi's stepson and lover, Taryalai, 38, was taken to a spot about \n20 paces away, blindfolded and turned to face the Muslim cleric who \nwas their judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose close enough to have heard said the cleric spoke briefly about \nthe provisions for stoning adulterers in the Sharia, the ancient \nMuslim legal code, imposed by the Taliban since they began their rise \nto power in Kandahar two years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, those witnesses said, the judge, following tradition, stooped \nto pick up the first stone from one of two piles that had been \nprepared, one for each of the condemned pair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first stone, the witnesses said, was thrown at Nurbibi. Quickly, \nTaliban ~fighters who had been summon~ for the occasion stepped \nforward and launched a cascade of stones. A man who stepped forward \nfrom the crowd to join in the stoning, Rahmatullah, 25, said neither \nNurbibi nor Turyalai had cried out.\u0014\n\u0014\nTuryalai, he said, appeared to be dead after about 10 minutes, but \nthe. killing of Nurbibi took longer, past the point where one of her \nsons, stepping forward to check, turned to the judge to say his \nmother was still alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe son was crying, Rahmatullah said. I could see it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that point, several witnesses said, one of the Taliban fighters \npicked up a large rock, advanced toward Nurbibi and dropped it on her \nhead, finishing her off.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the score of people who gathered before the mosque to offer \ntheir recollections of the stoning, none expressed dismay. To the \ncontrary, all  men and boys, since women in Kandahar are forbidden \nby Taliban rules to linger in public places or to speak to strangers \nspoke with enthusiasm of the killings.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a good thing, the only way to end this kind of sinning, said \nMohammed Younus, 60, a teacher. Mohammed Karim, a 24-year-old Taliban \nfighter, picked up several stones and threw them in an impromptu \nre-enactment of the executions. No, I didn't feel sorry for them at \nall, he said. I was just happy to see Sharia being implemented.\u0014\n\u0014\nCourt-ordered executions of adulterers by stoning have been reported \noccasionally in revolutionary Iran, but since World War II this \npunishment has not been imposed in Afghanistan  until the Taliban \ntook power in Kandahar.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mullah who led the investigation that resulted in the stoning of \nNurbibi and Turyalai, Mohammed Wali, says the incident was at least \nthe third stoning for adultery in the Kandahar region since the \nTaliban took power. Several others have been reported in other areas \nunder Taliban control.\u0014",

    "title": "CAN YOU REMARRY?",
    "words": "You're \nDivorcedCan You Remarry?\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestion:\u0014\n\u0014\n The New Testament seems to support divorce for a narrow range of \nreasons, but does it support remarriage?\u0014\nK A. Miller, Wheaton, Illinois\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches and Christian institutions are mistaken when they \nindiscriminately deny the possibility of leadership or remarriage \nafter men and women have divorced.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnswer:\u0014\n\u0014\n There are three New Testament passages that bear most directly on \nthe subject of\u0014\ndivorce and remarriage. I suggest that when they are carefully \nconsidered, they prove to be\u0014\nboth more demanding and less restrictive on the question of divorce \nand remarriage than evangelicals have often acknowledged.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke 16:18 is a very bold, straightforward saying that seems to \nsettle the issue quickly: Anyone who divorces his wife and marries \nanother commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced from \nher husband commits adultery (all quotations from the NRSV). Both \ndivorce and remarriage are just plain wrongright?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost all New Testament scholars agree that this saying is an \nabbreviation of a saying of Jesus that appears in its fuller form in \nMatthew 5:3132 in the Sermon on the Mount. After discussing his \nviews contrasted with those in Judaism, Jesus remarks, It was also \nsaid, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of \ndivorce.' But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except \non the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and \nwhoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is noteworthy that Jesus clearly sees some circumstances that \nlegitimize divorce. A marriage continues to be valid until one party \ndissolves the marriage through unfaithfulness. This so-called \nexception clause appears here in Matthew 5 and again in Matthew 19 \nbut does not occur in either Mark or Luke.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a similar passage in Mark 10:1112, Jesus widens the scope of the \nteaching to show that such dissolution may apply to the behavior of \neither the man or the woman (even though in Jewish custom women could \nnot divorce their husbands, Jesus includes women equally in his \ncharge): Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits \nadultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries \nanother, she commits adultery. A more literal translation of she \ncommits adultery reads, she is adulterized, meaning if a woman is \ndivorced without just cause, she is left in a valid marriage. \nRemarriage for her would, therefore, be adultery. In saying this, \nJesus may very well have had in mind the practice of men discharging \ntheir wives without just cause, thereby exploiting them.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut how do we apply the exception clause today? Does Jesus only \naccept divorce as legitimate but not remarriage for the innocent \npartner? In the Jewish society of Jesus' day, remarriage was always \nassumed for the innocent party unless prohibited for some particular \nreason. Unfaithfulness, therefore, would make a marriage invalid \nsince a valid divorce canceled the marriage bond and allowed the \ninnocent party to remarry exactly like a single person.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, in his radical kingdom commands, takes divorce very seriously. \nThere is serious judgment for sin, but, at the same time, there is \nand should be no condemnation for the innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did Moses permit divorce?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second crucial passage is Matthew 19:312 (see also Mark \n10:212). Here some Pharisees are testing Jesus' reading of divorce \nlaw. Jesus defends the permanence of marriage by appealing to Genesis \nthat the two shall become one flesh. To answer why Moses permitted \ndivorce, Jesus replies, It was because you were so hard-hearted that \nMoses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it \nwas not so. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for \nunchastity, and marries another commits adultery.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote that again Jesus includes the exception clause, which \nlegitimizes divorces dissolved through unfaithfulness. The problem \nhere has to do with Jewish laws that let men freely discharge their \nwives, often on spurious grounds. One great rabbi, Shammai, taught \nthat the only basis for divorce was sexual unfaithfulness or \nadultery. But the Rabbi Hillel was more generous: A man may divorce \nhis wife even if she burned his soup . . . or spoiled a dish for \nhim. Rabbi Akiba taught that divorce was acceptable if he should \nfind a woman fairer than his wife. Such divorces left women adrift \nin a male world, without hope of remarriage, and completely at a \nloss. Jesus is standing against such divorces of convenience.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was also standing against the teaching that a man was required to \ndispense with his wife when he suspected unfaithfulness. (Consider \nJoseph's reaction when he learned of Mary's surprise pregnancy.) \nJesus amends this, finding such behavior intolerable. Moses did not \ncommand his people to divorce wives, he permitted it. The springboard \nfor right action should not be hard-heartedness, but charity. Jesus \naffirms once more that only if the woman has done something herself \nthat irreparably ruptures the marriage can such a divorce be right. \nBut it isn't a necessary response.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany today have misread this particular passage to make two \nstatements:\u0014\n(1) One cannot divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful; (2) \nWhoever remarries commits adultery. But this is not the meaning. The \nactive verb here is commits adultery, and the entire sentence must \nbe held together. It should be read, Whoever does the following \ncommits adultery: divorces his wife (except for immorality) and \nremarries another. Judgment is being placed not on someone \nremarrying but on someone remarrying after pursuing an illegitimate \ndivorce. If the divorce is invalid, so is the remarriage. But the \nreverse is also tru%~: if the divorce is valid, then remarriage must \nbe acceptable, just as it was in commonplace Jewish custom.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot bound to the marriage\u0014\n\u0014\nA third important passage is found in 1 Corinthians 7, where Paul \ndiscusses Christian marriage. He echoes the teaching of Jesus, saying \nthat husbands and wives are not permitted to leave each other but \nshould work toward reconciliation. Then Paul addresses a subject that \nwas foreign to Jesus and the Gospels. What if a Christian man or \nwoman had a pagan spouse? Could there be spiritual union between two \npeople when one worshiped idols? Paul affirms that Christians should \nnot initiate a divorce because of the spouse's spiritual \ndeficiencies: If any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever, and \nshe consents to live with him, he should not divorce her (v. 12). \nThe presence of a Christian in the marriage, Paul is saying, brings \nhope of salvation to the children and the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then Paul makes one exception to Jesus' rule on divorce: If the \nunbelieving spouse deserts the marriage, the innocent spouse must \nwork on reconciliation (vv. 1011), but in the end is not bound. \nThis final phrase in verse 15 is crucial. The innocent party is not \nbound to the marriage, and this includes women or men equally. This \nlanguage echoes words directly from Jewish\u0014\ndivorce law: not bound means that the innocent person is free to \nremarry.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul even reinforces his thought in 7:2628: I think that, in view \nof the impending crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are. Are \nyou bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a \nwife? Do not seek a wife. But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a \nvirgin marries, she does not sin. More literally rendered, Paul does \nnot say are you free, he says, are you freed, meaning, someone \nwho has been freed from a marriage, namely, someone who was married \nand divorced. Paul prefers they remain single because of the \nsuffering of this age, but if they marry, according to verse 28, they \ndo not sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn sum, Paul adds one more possible reason for a valid divorce: the \ndesertion of a marriage by an unbelieving partner. In such a case, \nwhile the Christian spouse should not be eager to divorce, still, if \nhe or she is a victim of divorce, he or she may remarry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe husband of one wife\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Paul makes some remarks about the nature of marriage in his \npastoral letters that reflect on the issue of divorce and remarriage. \nIn both 1 Timothy 3:2 and in Titus 1:6, Paul stipulates that bishops \n(1 Timothy) and elders (Titus) should be married only once~~ or the \nhusband of one wife. These verses have led many Christian \norganizations to disqualify potential leaders who have ever been \ndivorced. But I doubt that this is even near what Paul is thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, he may be referring to polygamy. While having multiple wives \nwas against Roman law, still, it was legal in Palestinian Judaism \neven though monogamy was the norm. Jewish oral tradition, in fact, \njustifies having 18 wives. Thus, Paul may be saying that these \nChristian leaders must have just one wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, evidence from Greco-Roman society indicates that some men did \nhave concubines even though they were illegal in both Greek and Roman \nsociety. Paul may be making it absolutely clear: Christian men must \nbe pure and moral in their marital relations. He is looking for \nleaders with stable family lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament, therefore, tells us that marriage is to be seen as \na divinely instituted relationship between a man and a woman. It \nshould be monogamous and permanent. However, there are two exceptions \nwhere divorce is valid: when a spouse is unfaithful and when an \nunbelieving spouse deserts the marriage. In each case, the marriage \nis dissolved and the innocent partner is free to remarry.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is the tragic result of what becomes of humanity as it \nwrestles with sin and brokenness. Whenever a marriage fails, we \nshould mourn it as tragic. But there should be no error so grave that \nit cannot be forgiven; no mistake beyond the reach of grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, our God is a God of renewal and restoration. In some cases, \nthis means restoring a marriage to its original partnership. In other \ncasesand I can think of manyit means that\u0014\nremarriage is an opportunity for renewal and new hope. This is why \nchurches and Christian institutions are mistaken when they \nindiscriminately deny the possibility of leadership positions or \nremarriage after men and women have divorced. Such a position denies \nnot only the spirit of Jesus' ministry but also misunderstands the \ngrace of God in a broken world.

In \nthis\u0014\npicture he is standing in the midst of the elders looking very wise,\u0014\nobviously delivering a lecture. He is talking and pointing and they \nare\u0014\nlistening. He had, no doubt, appeared to instruct them in the law, as \nif he\u0014\nknew what they didn't. But that's not what the text says. They found \nhim,\u0014\nsays Luke, \"listening to (the teachers) and asking them questions.\" \nHe was\u0014\nnot the authority; he was the student. He was there to listen and \nlearn. Now\u0014\nit is true that the religious leaders were impressed by how much he \nknew,\u0014\nand by how he answered their questions.

One of my favorite stories about \nRobert E. Lee is how as president of Washington College he once \nremained seated during the graduation ceremonies, so as not to \ndisturb a 5-year-old boy who had climbed into his lap and fallen \nasleep.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     I like that story because it captures the \nessential Lee. Lee is the great anti-egotist in American history, and \nas such, he stands athwart much of contemporary thinking in his \nselflessness, self-denial, and humble, tolerant Christian faith. Yet \nwhen we think of our everyday lives - commuting, at work, or at home \nwith family - we instantly recognize that Lee, the self-denying \nChristian gentleman, is right and contemporary self-affirming \nbromides are wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     How many of us, for instance, think our fellow \ncommuters need \"assertiveness training\"? How many of us would like \nour bosses to think first of themselves or of \"the duty I owe to \nmyself\"? How many of us want our children to subscribe to \"the \nvirtues of selfishness\" as taught by the \"consumer society\"? No, at \nthe end of the day, these buzzwords sound as false, metallic, and \nempty as they really are.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Instead of this, Lee offers wisdom, virtue, and \nreality. He always put the needs of others first, because \"the \npromotion of the happiness and welfare\" of our fellow man was \"the \ngreat duty of life.\" He had no vanity, because he knew, following \nChrist, that to lead is to serve. As a first principle, he advised a \nmother to teach her son \"to deny himself.\" Most of all, he trusted to \nconscience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     IN A LETTER to his daughter Mildred, he wrote: \n\"The struggle which you describe you experience between doing what \nyou ought and what you desire is common to all. You have only to do \nwhat is right. It will become easier by practice, and you will enjoy \nin the midst of your trial the pleasure of an approving conscience. \nThat will be worth everything else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Lee, however, would not dictate conscience; he \nbelieved that people should, and must, govern themselves. When he \nresigned his commission in the United States Army in order to defend \nVirginia as a Confederate officer, he wrote his wife that their son \nCustis \"must consult his own judgment, reason, and conscience as to \nthe course he may take. I do not wish him to be guided by my wishes \nor example. If I have done wrong, let him do better.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When we think about Lee on this Lee-Jackson Day, \nwe should think about him in these terms: as a defender of freedom of \nconscience; as someone who trusted to example, compromise, and moral \nsuasion, rather than force. Lee was a brilliant career soldier. He \nknew, first-hand, the butcher's bill of war. That, to his mind, was \nnot the way Americans should settle political disputes. As he \nfamously wrote, \"With all my devotion to the Union, and all the \nfeeling of loyalty and duty as an American citizen, I have not been \nable to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my \nchildren, my home.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I shall return to my native state,\" he wrote in \nanother, earlier letter, \"and share the miseries of my people, and \nsave in defense will draw my sword on none.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     THE CONFEDERATE cause for which Lee fought was \nnot a cause of slavery or even - except in the most extreme of \ncircumstances - of secession. He fought solely in defense of Virginia \nand her freedom to determine her own destiny, her own laws, abiding \nby her own corporate conscience, which he didn't want driven by the \nbarrel of a gun. Like Martin Luther King, Jr., whose birthday we mark \non Monday, he believed that social evils - including, in Lee's words, \nthe \"moral and political evil\" of slavery - should be met by patient \nand respectful appeal to conscience, by the \"mild and melting \ninfluence\" of Christianity, not by violence. As Lee said, \"I am \nopposed to the theory of doing wrong that good may come of it. I hold \nto the belief that you must act right whatever the consequences.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The consequences of the War Between the States \nwere horrific for Lee personally, and for the United States, which \nsuffered more death and destruction in that war than in all its other \nwars combined. But Lee raised his sword as a Confederate to prevent \nthat destruction. He raised it because he did not want \"the judgment \nof reason\" to be \"displaced by the arbitrament of war.\" He raised it \nbecause he was \"fond of freedom\" and respected freedom of conscience. \nHe raised it because he did not want America's cities, fields, and \nfarms scarred by perpetual political war, where the ends would be \nsaid to justify the means. Finally, Lee raised his sword to defend \nthe one thing he loved most in the world: Virginia. We honor Lee \ntoday because, ultimately, his example and his sacrifice were for us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     H.W. Crocker, III, who will be giving the \nkeynote speech for Lee-Jackson Day at the State Capitol tomorrow, is \nthe author of, among other books, 'Robert E. Lee on Leadership.'\u0014",

But in\u0014\n                       December, when George W. Bush with his \nsports-jock patter made his first postelection visit to Clinton with \nhis\u0014\n                       rock-star genes, they just clicked. The new \nguy had no questions about Third World debt. He wanted to know what\u0014\n                       made the place tick and how you mainline \nyourself into the nation's bloodstream. Clinton told Bush he was \nlucky to\u0014\n                       know already where the light switches were and \nto have hired people who had been there before. Bush asked Clinton\u0014\n                       what he thought about Bush's calling him \"the \nShadow\" during the campaign. Had it spooked Gore? Must have,\u0014\n                       Clinton said; he didn't ask me to appear with \nhim, did he? Pretty smart, hey? Bush laughed, scrunching his\u0014\n                       shoulders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The Shadow developed nearly as much affinity \nfor Bush in two hours as he had for Al Gore in eight years. Clinton\u0014\n                       later told friends, \"Bush really connects. \nIt's a mistake to underestimate him.\" And after seeing Clinton in \nMay, at St.\u0014\n                       Patrick's Cathedral for John Cardinal \nO'Connor's funeral--Clinton reaching across four mourners to grasp \nBush's hand\u0014\n                       during the Sign of Peace--Bush said, \"I don't \nalways respect the guy, but you gotta like him.\" Maybe they see the\u0014\n                       scamp in each other. At the Inaugural Day \ncoffee, it was as if old friends were back in town. When Chelsea \nseemed\u0014\n                       teary amid the hubbub, Bush put an arm around \nher shoulders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       So maybe it wasn't so odd that during his \nsecond-to-last night in the White House, Clinton was worried about how\u0014\n                       Bush would react to the timing of independent \ncounsel Robert Ray's announcement of a Lewinsky settlement. Sure,\u0014\n                       Clinton had been bouncing around the country \nlike Ricky Martin for two weeks, hogging the spotlight, but a\u0014\n                       natural-born pol like Bush could see that was \nfair game. Clinton turned to TV producer/director Thomason--an old\u0014\n                       friend who had got muddied in Travelgate and \nwho with his wife Linda had spent the last Thanksgiving, the last\u0014\n                       Christmas and now the last two days in the \nWhite House--to back-channel an apology through movie producer and\u0014\n                       Bush friend Jerry Weintraub. On Weintraub's \nlast visit to Camp David, in 1992, he and Bush senior were chatting\u0014\n                       about how vulnerable First Friends are. They \ncalled to warn Thomason that he would be sued, slandered and\u0014\n                       vilified--and have no platform from which to \nrespond. Thomason, the son of a Baptist deacon, couldn't imagine that\u0014\n                       happening to an unflashy guy like him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       On the last night, Thomason hoped there might \nbe time to go bowling in the White House basement, as he and\u0014\n                       Clinton had done eight years before (they got \nblisters back then from wearing the wrong shoes). Instead, after\u0014\n                       polishing off some apple cobbler, they watched \na movie, State and Main, and Clinton kept popping up to work on\u0014\n                       presidential pardons. It took until dawn to \nclear out, as Clinton pressed etched bowls, parkas and golf clubs on\u0014\n                       anyone who would take them. On the long table \nthat he kept filling with giveaway items, a lone pair of pajamas\u0014\n                       remained.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Buddy was waiting at the top of the stairs of \nSpecial Air Mission 28000, the plane to New York. The Bush people\u0014\n                       wanted to lend Clinton a DC-9, but he held out \nfor one of the two 747s that rotate as Air Force One. Hillary has told\u0014\n                       friends she's worried--with her days full and \nBill's suddenly empty--that Bill is going to be lost. But the \nComeback Kid,\u0014\n                       who stretched out the Longest Goodbye in \nhistory, says he looks forward to getting rested, making money (he \njust\u0014\n                       turned down $2 million for a Super Bowl ad), \ndoing good and golfing. But he did give Thomason his favorite putter.\u0014\n                       Being First Friend wasn't so bad after all.\u0014",

Proctor, a history \nof science professor at Pennsylvania State University, said of the \nresolution that\u0014\n                     expresses the General Assembly's \"profound \nregret\" over Virginia's role in the eugenics movement. It has passed \nthe House of\u0014\n                     Delegates and is scheduled to be taken up in the \nSenate this week.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"This could well set a national precedent for \nsoul-searching in other areas,\" added Proctor, noting that California \nled all states in\u0014\n                     the nation in sterilizations. Proctor wrote \n\"Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis.\" Under a German law that \nfollowed and\u0014\n                     echoed Virginia's, the Nazis forcibly sterilized \nthousands and perhaps millions of people, according to experts.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The resolution \"may be a very important step in \na kind of healing process,\" said Steven Selden of the University of \nMaryland. He\u0014\n                     belongs to a panel of academic experts advising \nthe Holocaust Museum on a 2004 exhibit on racial science in Nazi \nGermany.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     State and national governments around the world \nare tackling ways to express re- gret for past harms suffered, said \nMartin S.\u0014\n                     Pernick of the University of Michigan\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Certainly, whatever Virginia does will be seen \nas part of that larger working out of how to deal with the past,\" \nsaid Pernick, a\u0014\n                     scholar of eugenics history.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In a striking step for a state with deep pride \nin its past, the House adopted Feb. 2 and sent to the Senate a \nresolution voicing\u0014\n                     \"profound regret over the commonwealth's role in \nthe eugenics movement in this country and the incalculable human \ndamage\u0014\n                     done in the name of eugenics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The resolution even brands use of eugenics laws \nas a \"'scientific' veneer to cover activities of those who held \nblatantly racist\u0014\n                     views,\" a bold statement on Virginia's past.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     About 8,000 Virginians who were poor, uneducated \nor retarded were deemed to be \"unfit\" and involuntarily sterilized \nbetween\u0014\n                     1924 and 1979. Intermarriage of whites and \nnon-whites was barred to preserve white racial \"purity\" under law \nfueled in part by\u0014\n                     the eugenics movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Virginia was among about 30 states to enact such \nlaws, and 60,000 people were sterilized nationwide. Legal and \nhistorical\u0014\n                     experts say they know of no legislature in the \nUnited States that has adopted either an apology or a statement of \nregret\u0014\n                     embracing eugenics.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The House of Delegates adopted the resolution by \nDel. Mitchell Van Yahres, D-Charlottesville, by an 85-10 vote after \nhe agreed\u0014\n                     to remove the word \"apology\" from the title.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Van Yahres said afterward that the resolution \nhad met with some resistance in committee, and he wanted to assure \nits success in\u0014\n                     the full House. He believed the word \"apology\" \ndidn't match the text of the resolution, and he thought modern-day \nlegislators\u0014\n                     were not personally responsible for the damage \nof Virginia's past eugenics history.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Now a retired arborist, Van Yahres is shaking \nthings up in the legislature with sensibilities learned outside \nVirginia. He originally\u0014\n                     came from Long Island, N.Y., moving to Virginia \nafter college at Cornell. His father was in the same business and had \ndone\u0014\n                     restoration work on the trees at Jefferson's \nMonticello in 1926.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The former Charlottesville mayor got interested \nin eugenics after reading an article in The Times-Dispatch last year. \nIt\u0014\n                     examined Virginia's role in the forefront of the \nmovement, its impact, racism, and links between some in the movement \nwith\u0014\n                     adherents in Nazi Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Virginia's sterilization law was passed in 1924. \nIt was upheld in 1927 by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark \ndecision.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Van Yahres has heard from skeptics who say, \n\"Let's not drag up the old skeletons.\" But it's important to confront \nthe past as the\u0014\n                     nation prepares to deal with advances in genetic \nengineering, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     There is disagreement over his amending the \nresolution to delete the word \"apology.\" Afterward, Gov. Jim Gilmore \nvoiced\u0014\n                     support for the resolution. Gilmore's stance \nought to help in the Senate, Van Yahres thinks.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Paul A. Lombardo, a University of Virginia \nprofessor, a lawyer and authority on eugenics history, angrily \nquestioned the revision.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Why is it,\" he asked, \"that the same \npoliticians who insist on 'accountability' and 'responsibility' for \nour children fear to step\u0014\n                     forward and admit that the state's legacy of \neugenics was simply wrong? Where are the champions of 'core values' \nnow?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Another critic was Mary Wade, a Monacan Indian \nactivist and secretary of the Virginia Council on Indians, a group \nthat advises\u0014\n                     the governor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"It seems, as usual, the politicians have danced \ntheir way around the issue,\" she said. \"After all, if they \n'apologize' for eugenics,\u0014\n                     they would have to 'apologize' to the black race \nfor slavery and . . . to the Indian people for taking their land, \ntheir language\u0014\n                     and almost their heritage!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But J. David Smith, dean of education and human \nservices at Longwood College and author of a book titled \"The Eugenic\u0014\n                     Assault on America,\" wasn't bothered by the \nchange in the wording.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I think there's a need for a definitive break \nwith the past,\" Smith said. \"Whether called an apology, or a \nstatement of regret - for\u0014\n                     me, the shades of meaning that may exist don't \nmatter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In 1997, former President Clinton chose the \napology route about the Tuskegee experiment, in which black men with \nvenereal\u0014\n                     disease were left intentionally untreated to \nstudy the disease's long-term effects. \"What the United States \ngovernment did was\u0014\n                     shameful, and I am sorry,\" Clinton said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Van Yahres, for one, doesn't think that a \nstatement of regret over eugenics by the legislature would open the \ndoor to apologies\u0014\n                     over such other historic injustices as slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"We are not dealing here with a group\" that was \nwronged, he said. \"It was against everybody, black and white, male \nand female,\u0014\n                     regardless of your race and creed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     King Salim Khalfani, executive director of the \nVirginia Conference of the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored\u0014\n                     People, did not think an apology over slavery \nwould come easily in Virginia or the nation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"As more people are included in the electoral \nprocess, we're going to force a discussion on it,\" he vowed.\u0014",

    "words": "Christian Sex Rules\u0014\n                      A guide to what's allowed in the bedroom\u0014\n                      By Louis and Melissa McBurney \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When it comes to sex, most married Christians \njust do what\u0014\n                      works for them. If they have been blessed \nenough to have\u0014\n                      discovered something that brings satisfaction, \npleasure,\u0014\n                      closeness, and climax, they most likely will \ncontinue that\u0014\n                      practice. However, some are plagued with guilt \nbecause they\u0014\n                      wonder if what they're doing is sinful.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marriage Partnership receives many, many \nquestions from\u0014\n                      Christian couples who want to know what is and \nwhat is not\u0014\n                      okay to do sexually. Unfortunately, churches \ntend to ignore\u0014\n                      this issue, small groups usually don't talk \nabout sex, and\u0014\n                      most Christian books deal with more \"spiritual\" \nideas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Wouldn't it be nice to have a list of sexual \npractices\u0014\n                      categorized by \"sinful\" or \"okay\"? Is there \nsuch a list? Would\u0014\n                      everyone agree with the list? Is there a \nsolution to this\u0014\n                      dilemma?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We think the answers to those questions are: \nyes, no, no,\u0014\n                      and probably notin that order. We'd really \nlike to create\u0014\n                      such a list that could settle once and forever \nthe niggling\u0014\n                      doubts about sexual practices. But that's not \npossible.\u0014\n                      Different communities of Christians have \ndifferent\u0014\n                      understandings about sexual practices that are \nbased on a\u0014\n                      few general biblical principles. No list would \nbe accepted by\u0014\n                      all Christians. Still, we do want to provide \nsome guidelines\u0014\n                      that we hope will help you enjoy the gift of \nyour sexuality to\u0014\n                      the fullest. That's what we're convinced God \nwants for each of\u0014\n                      his children.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We doubt that God's surprised by the intensity \nof our sexual\u0014\n                      desire or of its fulfillment. Seeing us enjoy \nthe passion and\u0014\n                      pleasure seems to fit with his creative nature. \nThere are some\u0014\n                      definite boundaries, however, that were \nidentified through his\u0014\n                      Word. These are established to protect and \nenhance the\u0014\n                      maximum enjoyment of the gift. We think it's \nlike our giving\u0014\n                      our kids bicycles. We'd teach them the safety \nrules right\u0014\n                      away so they could delight in the ride without \nbeing run over\u0014\n                      by a car on a busy street.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      First, we'd like to point out the obviousthe \nBible is not a\u0014\n                      manual on sexual technique. We've heard some \npeople say\u0014\n                      that Song of Solomon describes acceptable \nsexual positions\u0014\n                      and behavior. We see it as a poetic love song \nthat clearly\u0014\n                      embraces the joy of sexual play. We don't think \nit is an\u0014\n                      attempt to outline any specific sexual \npractices.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Second, we want to emphasize again that there \nare some\u0014\n                      specific sexual behaviors that are forbidden in \nscriptures.\u0014\n                      Adultery, that is having sexual intercourse \nwith another\u0014\n                      person's spouse or a partner other than your \nown spouse, is a\u0014\n                      sin. Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, deepens \nthe\u0014\n                      importance of marital faithfulness by extending \nthe prohibition\u0014\n                      of infidelity to include a lustful thought life \nas well as the\u0014\n                      physical act of intercourse. Looking into our \nminds and hearts\u0014\n                      is an important principle for safeguarding the \ndelights of\u0014\n                      intimacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Scripture is also clear about the evil of \nfornicationpremarital\u0014\n                      sexual intercoursewhich most of our culture \naccepts as\u0014\n                      normal and irresistible. We see many couples \nsuffering from\u0014\n                      the consequences of their early promiscuity. \nThe \"sexual\u0014\n                      freedom\" of our time isn't free and usually \ncarries some pretty\u0014\n                      heavy costs.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Bible also lists other practices that are \n\"abominations\" to\u0014\n                      God (Le v. 18, Rom. 1:21-32, I Thess. 4:1-8, \nand I Cor.\u0014\n                      6:12-20). These include homosexuality, \nbestiality, and incest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And last, there is a vast array of possible \nsexual practices for\u0014\n                      married couples that are not mentioned at all \nin Scripture (we\u0014\n                      can find no reference to Internet pornography, \nvibrators, or\u0014\n                      videos). So, since we aren't likely to find a \ndefinitive answer,\u0014\n                      the best we can do is find the principles God \nhas given us\u0014\n                      and apply them to the cultural setting we're \nliving in. As we\u0014\n                      look for those you may not be surprised to find \nthat we're not\u0014\n                      much different in the twenty-first century than \nhow mankind\u0014\n                      has been since creation. We have the same \nanatomical\u0014\n                      equipment, the same physiologic hormones, the \nsame mental\u0014\n                      capacity for lust and fantasy, and the same \nrelational needs\u0014\n                      that have always driven men and women to seek \nsexual\u0014\n                      pleasure and intimacy. As Ecclesiastes says, \n\"there is\u0014\n                      nothing new under the sun,\" except maybe the \nvast array of\u0014\n                      new toys.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Exclusivity\u0014\n                      Many studies have confirmed what biblical \ncommandments\u0014\n                      imply. That is that becoming one flesh with one \npartner\u0014\n                      provides the best setting for satisfying sexual \nintimacy. Sex\u0014\n                      is neither a spectator sport for group \nindulgence nor an event\u0014\n                      to test a person's ability to score with \nmultiple partners.\u0014\n                      Casual sex as a way to prove one's prowess or \nsimply\u0014\n                      achieve physiologic relief of sexual tension \nonly confirms that\u0014\n                      his or her ability to copulate is intact. \nAlthough providing\u0014\n                      some pleasure, it fails to meet the deeper need \nfor intimacy\u0014\n                      that sex was designed to give. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A couple in a long-term committed relationship \nenters into a\u0014\n                      more secure and trusting territory with each \nsexual\u0014\n                      encounter. In that bed sex can truly become \n\"making love\"\u0014\n                      rather than just having sex. Multiple partners \ncreate mistrust,\u0014\n                      performance anxiety, and comparison evaluations \nthat are\u0014\n                      barriers to the deepest levels of intimacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mutuality\u0014\n                      It is obvious to most couples early on that men \nand women\u0014\n                      are significantly different in their sexual \ninterests and drives.\u0014\n                      Men usually have a desire for more frequent sex \nand greater\u0014\n                      variety in forms of sexual play. Women usually \nwant more\u0014\n                      emotional connectedness through tender touch and\u0014\n                      conversation and prefer more consistent \nlove-making\u0014\n                      technique. These differences often lead to \ntension over\u0014\n                      positions for intercourse, frequency of sex, and\u0014\n                      experimentation with different sources of \nstimulation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This creates enormous opportunity for a couple \nto develop\u0014\n                      mutual submissiveness in their relationship. \nEach individual\u0014\n                      will have ways to show respect and give a \nmeaningful gift of\u0014\n                      love to his or her mate. We feel that giving \nthat respect to\u0014\n                      each other is a huge way to guide your choices \nof sexual play\u0014\n                      in the direction of genuinely mature love.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Doing only what is mutually agreeable sexually \nmeans that\u0014\n                      each partner will make sacrifices for the sake \nof intimacy. A\u0014\n                      wife may give herself more frequently or try a \nvariety of sexual\u0014\n                      experiences that go beyond her comfort zone. A \nhusband\u0014\n                      may relinquish some sexual fantasy or adjust \nhis demands\u0014\n                      for intercourse twice a day just to show love \nto his mate.\u0014\n                      Those exercises in personal restraint are not \neasy, but help\u0014\n                      build the oneness of intimacy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Specific behaviors that often fit this criteria \nare oral sex,\u0014\n                      rear-entry vaginal penetration, initiation of \nsexual activity,\u0014\n                      positions for intercourse, and mutual \nmasturbation. We find\u0014\n                      no scriptural injunction against any of these \nor of frequency of\u0014\n                      intercourse. The Old Testament command of not \nhaving\u0014\n                      intercourse during a woman's menstrual period \ndoes seem to\u0014\n                      have the medical benefit of avoiding some \ninfectious\u0014\n                      processes. Paul's admonition in I Corinthians \nnot to withhold\u0014\n                      sex except by mutual consent seems to fit with \nthis general\u0014\n                      principle of mutuality. It acknowledges the \nlegitimacy of\u0014\n                      sexual desire and reinforces the boundary of \nsex within\u0014\n                      marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pleasurability\u0014\n                      Sexual play should be enjoyable! If an activity \nyou're doing\u0014\n                      doesn't bring enjoyment to both partners it \nwill cause\u0014\n                      resentment and distance between you. That's not \npart of the\u0014\n                      design for \"becoming one flesh.\" It may be that \nsome forms of\u0014\n                      your sexual play create pain for one or both of \nyou. That\u0014\n                      should be evaluated medically. If something is \ncreating\u0014\n                      discomfort, it is probably treatable (such as \nvaginitis or painful\u0014\n                      erections). This can certainly produce barriers \nto intimacy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At times couples may want to explore the areas \nof\u0014\n                      sado-masochistic sex or bondage fantasies. We \nfeel that\u0014\n                      these behaviors move sex out of the arena of \nselfless love into\u0014\n                      that of power or domination fantasies. In those \nneighborhoods\u0014\n                      sex becomes an invasive, controlling behavior \nin which one\u0014\n                      person is violated. That is a sexual perversion \nand is likely to\u0014\n                      create shame, humiliation, and ultimate \ndevaluation of one (or\u0014\n                      both) partners. When domination is a necessary \ningredient for\u0014\n                      sexual pleasure there tends to be development \nof tolerance to\u0014\n                      the level of excitation. Hence increasing \nlevels of the\u0014\n                      stimulation are required for the same sense of \ngratification.\u0014\n                      This is seen in its extreme in pornography that \nincludes rape\u0014\n                      and even murder as forms of sexual stimulation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Relationality Duh! You might think. Well, of \ncourse,\u0014\n                      sexual intimacy includes a strong relational \ncomponent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unfortunately, that ain't necessarily so. One \nof the most\u0014\n                      destructive forces we're seeing these days is \nthe increasing\u0014\n                      frequency of sexual addictive disorders. When \nhaving sexual\u0014\n                      release becomes an addiction driven to levels \nof compulsive\u0014\n                      behavior, the relationship with a marriage \npartner may be\u0014\n                      replaced with various stimuli that are \nessentially fantasy\u0014\n                      based. We have seen men deeply hooked on \nInternet\u0014\n                      pornography (or other forms). They are \ncompulsively driven to\u0014\n                      increasing exposure to pornographic stimulation \nand\u0014\n                      masturbatory release of sexual tension. We have \nseen\u0014\n                      women equally hooked on romance novels or \nchat-room sex\u0014\n                      talk for sexual release. These disorders \ndisplace the relational\u0014\n                      dimension of sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marital sex, if maintained at all, takes place \nmechanically\u0014\n                      with mental fantasies from the artificial \nrelationships providing\u0014\n                      the only sexual stimulation. That robs marriage \nof the most\u0014\n                      crucial part of intimacythe blend of \nrelational and sexual\u0014\n                      connectedness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The use of pornographic films from whatever \nsource\u0014\n                      introduces this possible danger into your \nsexuality. Explicit\u0014\n                      sexual materials can provide sexual excitement \nand arousal,\u0014\n                      but that form of stimulation may erode your \nenjoyment of\u0014\n                      each other. Those images may also create a \nbasic sense of\u0014\n                      dissatisfaction with yourselves since most \ncouples don't\u0014\n                      maintain or ever achieve the sensual appearance \nof porn\u0014\n                      actors and models. The whole industry is based \non illusions\u0014\n                      and those lies can lead to death of your \nrelationship as well\u0014\n                      as your sexual satisfaction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perpetuating Genital Union\u0014\n                      We delight in sexual playfulness and creative \nways to\u0014\n                      pleasure one another, but unless it is not \nphysically possible\u0014\n                      for a couple, we think nothing you do should \ncompletely\u0014\n                      replace genital union.

    "title": "COMPASSION FOR THE SUFFERING",
    "words": "Compassion for the Suffering\u0014\n\u0014\nIn England in the 1940s a young woman entered Oxford University with \nlittle\u0014\nfocus. She had no idea what to do with her life. But she soon came \nunder the\u0014\ninfluence of a colorful professor of English, a writer with a gift, \nnamed C.\u0014\nS. Lewis. She became a Christian through much of his influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe left Oxford, against the advice of friends and family, and began \nto\u0014\nstudy nursing. After five more years of rigorous training, she was \ncertified\u0014\nas a nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut her story doesn't end there, for her questing, Christian spirit \nwould\u0014\nnot let her rest with the way things were. You see, she ended up \nworking on\u0014\na cancer ward in a London hospital. Gradually, she came to realize \nthat most\u0014\nof the doctors ignored the patients who were deemed terminally ill. \nAs a\u0014\nresult she watched many of them die virtually alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreatly troubled she felt that Christian compassion needed to be \nexpressed\u0014\nto these patients in a visible way. She approached the hospital\u0014\nadministration with an idea she had for surrounding those dying of \ncancer\u0014\nwith friends and loved ones during their last days, rather than \nisolating\u0014\nthem in sterile rooms with strangers. Her radical ideas were quickly\u0014\nrejected.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut undaunted, she decided to enroll in medical school to try to make \na\u0014\ndifference even though she was already 33 years old and would not \ngraduate\u0014\nuntil she was 39. This she did and later a movement soon grew around \nhe\u0014\nideas that made it possible for dying patients to live their days in a\u0014\nsetting of love and support.\u0014\n\u0014\nCicely Saunders, out of Christian compassion and a sense of calling \nto help\u0014\nin a specific way, began this movement in England in the 1950s. It \nlater\u0014\nmoved to the Americas and is now used everywhere and in every town. \nIt is\u0014\ncalled the Hospice Movement, and it draws its inspiration from Jesus' \nown\u0014\npassion and compassion for his children -- \"as a hen gathers her \nbrood under\u0014\nher wings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMy prayer is that God will continually come to us in new ways and in \nfresh\u0014\nimages, so that more Cicely Saunderses among us can be moved and \ninspired to\u0014\ntake risks to join in God's compassion for his children.\u0014",

But \nthe theological\u0014\n                      debate that he called for on October 31, 1517 \nnever took\u0014\n                      place. I see the ecumenical consultation that \nhas now taken\u0014\n                      place as a partial response to Luther's call of \nso many years\u0014\n                      ago.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indulgences are not normally a dominant \npractice in the\u0014\n                      day-to-day life of most Roman Catholics. \nHowever, the\u0014\n                      publication by the Vatican in 1998 of a \ndocument on how the\u0014\n                      faithful could obtain plenary indulgences in \nthe Catholic\u0014\n                      Church's jubilee year in 2000 reawakened \nlong-standing\u0014\n                      differences about the issue.

However, many other confessional \nbodies, including\u0014\n                      the LWF, participated in jubilee events in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This month's consultation in Rome was called by \nthe Vatican\u0014\n                      in response to the Protestant criticisms \nregarding\u0014\n                      indulgences.

The\u0014\n                      church teaches that Catholics can obtain an\u0014\n                      indulgenceeither for themselves after their \nown death, or for\u0014\n                      another soul already in purgatoryby following \ncertain rituals\u0014\n                      or acts of self-denial.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The abuse of indulgences, such as their sale by \nprofessional\u0014\n                      \"pardoners\", was one of the practices that \nprompted Martin\u0014\n                      Luther's protest in the 16th century. But the \ntheology of\u0014\n                      granting indulgences is generally problematic \nfor Protestant\u0014\n                      and also Orthodox churches because they do not \naccept the\u0014\n                      Roman Catholic understanding of purgatory.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Roman teaching on indulgences also \nhighlights radical\u0014\n                      differences with Protestants on issues such as \nthe nature of\u0014\n                      the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The document published in 1998, Conditions for \nGaining the\u0014\n                      Jubilee Indulgence, as the Vatican prepared for \nthe jubilee\u0014\n                      year, explains in detail how indulgences are \nobtained:\u0014\n                      Catholics must have been to confession, and on \nthe day they\u0014\n                      wish to receive the indulgence they must \nreceive the\u0014\n                      Eucharist and pray in one of various places, \nsuch as\u0014\n                      churches in Rome, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and \nNazareth, in a\u0014\n                      Catholic cathedral or in any place where they \nare visiting\u0014\n                      those in need or in difficulty. An indulgence \ncan also be\u0014\n                      obtained in a jubilee year by refraining from \nsmoking or\u0014\n                      alcohol and \"donating a proportionate sum of \nmoney to the\u0014\n                      poor\" or by \"devoting a suitable portion of \npersonal free time\u0014\n                      to activities benefiting the community, or \nother similar forms\u0014\n                      of personal sacrifice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hundreds of thousands of Catholics traveled to \nRome last\u0014\n                      year to obtain an indulgence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At this month's consultation two Catholic \ntheologians\u0014\n                      presented papers on the history of and teaching \nabout\u0014\n                      indulgences. Two Lutheran and two Reformed \ntheologians\u0014\n                      were invited to present response papers. All \nthe presentations\u0014\n                      will be published this year.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both Dr Noko and his counterpart at WARC, Dr \nSetri Nyomi,\u0014\n                      who also took part in the consultation, \nwelcomed the fact that\u0014\n                      the talks had taken place and expressed hope \nthat it would\u0014\n                      lead to further discussions. But both officials \nalso made it\u0014\n                      clear that the talks were not a bid to reach an \nagreement on\u0014\n                      the Catholic doctrine of indulgences, but were \nintended rather\u0014\n                      for clarification.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theologians on the staff of WARC and LWF who \nwere in\u0014\n                      Rome for the talks also welcomed the \ndiscussions, but\u0014\n                      pointed out that indulgences had no place in \nProtestant\u0014\n                      teaching. Both Dr Odair Pedroso Mateus, a \nBrazilian\u0014\n                      theologian on WARC's staff in Geneva, and Sven \nOppegaard,\u0014\n                      an ordained Norwegian theologian with the LWF, \ntold ENI that\u0014\n                      while the theological documents, such as the \npapal\u0014\n                      declaration Incarnationis Mysterium:Bull of \nIndiction of the\u0014\n                      Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, included some \nimpressive\u0014\n                      pastoral theology, the instructions for \nobtaining an indulgence\u0014\n                      did not really reflect this theology. The \nproblem was the\u0014\n                      nature of indulgence itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Oppegaard said that many Protestants faced a \ndifficulty over\u0014\n                      the issue - that \"such beautiful theology \nshould boil down to\u0014\n                      such a practice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dr Mateus said that for many ordinary Catholics \nwithout\u0014\n                      theological training, indulgences appeared to \nbe a \"market\u0014\n                      exchange. The structure is: I do something for \nGod and I get\u0014\n                      something from God. This kind of mentality is \nsimilar to the\u0014\n                      theology of prosperity of neo-pentecostal \nchurches which\u0014\n                      teach that you can get rich if you are faithful \nto God, if you\u0014\n                      give money to the church, [or] if you follow \nthe instructions of\u0014\n                      the church. It legitimizes the idea that life \nis not about grace\u0014\n                      and gratefulness but about exchanging goods, \nabout buying\u0014\n                      and selling, about capitalism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Asked by ENI whether the consultation had \nserved a\u0014\n                      usefulpurpose, Dr Mateus said: \"I believe these \nconversations\u0014\n                      have a role of admonition - it's a case of the \nProtestant church\u0014\n                      reminding the Roman Catholic Church that \nefforts should\u0014\n                      continue so that one day this practice \n[indulgences] will lose\u0014\n                      the aspects we reject.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Oppegaard told ENI that \"there was genuine \nwillingness on\u0014\n                      the Catholic side to listen to the way our \ntradition has\u0014\n                      understood and related to this practice. But \nthe most\u0014\n                      important result of the consultation was a \nclarification of the\u0014\n                      broader pastoral issues that are relevant in \nall our church\u0014\n                      traditions.\" He said that all the churches \nfaced a challenge to\u0014\n                      find pastoral practices regarding penance for \nsin which could\u0014\n                      be meaningful and helpful to all their members. \n\"It is an\u0014\n                      enormous challenge, and one in which ecumenical\u0014\n                      cooperation could be of great assistance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He added that \"when an individual commits a \nsin, this\u0014\n                      impacts on the fellowship of believers. \nAccording to Catholic\u0014\n                      teaching, the church, as the communion of \nsaints, has in it a\u0014\n                      richness of grace enabling it to forgive in the \nname of Christ.\"\u0014\n                      Such teaching, he said, could provide insights \nfor progress\u0014\n                      between churches on pastoral matters, even \nthough Lutheran\u0014\n                      objections to indulgences remained.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dr Nyomi was also apparently impressed with at \nleast this\u0014\n                      aspect of Roman teaching: \"It was good,\" he \nsaid, \"to learn\u0014\n                      from the Roman Catholic inputs that the \nindulgences was a\u0014\n                      way in which the church accompanied individuals \nin their\u0014\n                      dealing with the consequences of sin.

    "title": "CRITERIA FOR A GOOD MARRIAGE",
    "words": "Criteria for Marriage - Barbara McDougal\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the United States where almost one-half of the marriages end in \ndivorce, could many couples be selecting a mate based on criteria as \nshallow and fragile as picking daisy petals!\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough there are no magic formulas or pat answers for a successful \nmarriage or for lifelong happiness, some basics can help. So before \none contemplates a lifetime commitment, some important questions need \nto be answered.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Why do you want to get married? All too often, couples get married \nfor the wrong reasons. Being in love with love is not sufficient \nreason for marriage. Or if marriage is to get out of a bad home \nsituation, bad matters can worsen. The only valid reason for marriage \nis a love so strong that one wants to spend the rest of life with the \nperson loved- for better or worse, rich or poor. ...\u0014\n\u0014\n.How much of life have you tasted? Have you learned to depend on \nself? Or, are you moving from parent dependency to spouse dependency? \nMy marriage and family classes often hear, \"Learn to be one before \nyou become two; and learn to become two before you become three, or \nfour, or more!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n.How happy are you now? A single person with a happy attitude before \nmarriage probably will be a happily married person-if a partner is \nwell chosen! But if one is an 'ole grouch,\" then saying \"I do\" isn't \ngoing to change things. The basic personality doesn't change just \nbecause one walks down the aisle and exchanges a few words. Whatever \nwe are like early in life simply magnifies as we get older. Charlie \nShedd says that marriage is not so much finding the right person as \nbeing the right person. So what are you going to be like to live with \nday by day? Or what is that person with whom you are about to make a \ncommitment going to be like in the morning, after a hard day's work, \nor after taking the wrong exit off the interstate?\u0014\n\u0014\n.How long have you known this special person? To really know a person \ntakes time. During early dating especially, couples are on their best \nbehavior. Only with time does one get '.real\" and reveal the true \nself. Before a couple makes a serious commitment, each should visit \nin the home of the potential mate. How does he or she talk to parents \nand sib- lings? Is it with kindness and consideration? This is a good \nindication ofhow you may be treated after you are married a while.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Are you good friends? The best basis for a good marriage is to be \ngood friends first. As friends, persons can be more objective about \neach other. After emotional involvement, many faults may be \noverlooked with an attitude of 'I'll change that after we're married.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n.What attracts you to this person? Is it physical or inner beauty? \nThat beautiful hair may fallout, and that flawless skin will wrinkle. \nThat perfect figure or physique may rearrange itself in time. Will \nlife still be exciting and comfortable? Inward beauty is far more \nimportant than outward beauty-\u0014\n\u0014\n.Do you like each other? In the movie Shenandoah, the young man says \nto the father of the woman he wants to marry, \"Sir, I would like to \nmarry your daughter.\"\u0014\n         The father says, \"Do you like her?\"\u0014\n         In exasperation the young man replies, \"Sir, I love her!\" \nThe reply came softly: \"Oh, I know you love her! But what I want to \nknow is, do you like her?\"\u0014\nLiking and loving are different. We probably could love several \npersons, but we could not live peaceably with them. Do you like each \nother? is an important question.\u0014\n\u0014\n.What is your attitude toward sex ? Sexual union within marriage is \nindeed a gift from God. For good reason, He ordained it to be kept \nwithin the marriage bond. When it is misused or abused, serious \nconsequences result. When the sex act becomes part of the dating \nrelationship, it becomes predominant, excluding the more important \nareas of life that need to be dealt with during that period. In our \ninstant society we have instant rice, oatmeal, cookies, dinner. .. \nand on we go. This may lead us to think we need to wait on nothing. \nTo wait on good things in life makes us more appreciative and life \nmore exciting.\u0014\n\u0014\n.Are you a good problem solver? Life is a series of problems. It \nisn't whether you as a married couple or family will have problems, \nit is which problems you will have. So to learn during the dating \nperiod to resolve differences is important. Do you pout, slam doors, \nor run away? Likely you will react in much the same way as you saw \nyour parents react-that is, unless you work to be different.This wiIl \nrequire conscious and deliberate effort.\u0014\n\u0014\n.How well do you communicate? The glue that holds it all together is \ncommunication. To be able to talk to each other-about everything-is \nimperative. This is learned during dating. To be able to share \nthoughts, feelings, happiness, and sorrows is one key to a good \nmarriage-\u0014\n\u0014\n.What are your expectations? Are your goals compatible? Are you \nexpecting perfection? Many couples are disil- lusioned after a short \ntime because their expectations were too high. Jesus alone is \nperfect; no one else is. Therefore, no perfect marriages and, \ndifficult as it is for parents to admit, no perfect children exist.\u0014\n\u0014\n.What are your spending habits? Do you have similar views on saving \nand spending? In most relationships, money causes more friction than \nanything. Learning to live within the budget is of utmost importance. \nFrom the begin- ning, plans need to be made to give and to save part \nof ev- erything that is earned. Then learn to live on the rest. There \nis so much pressure in our society to buy today and pay tomorrow that \nmillions of families are in serious jeop- ardy because of that little \nplastic card without considering that payday will come. So, who is \ngoing to write the checks? How will you decide how the money is going \nto be spent?\u0014\n\u0014\n.Where does spiritual growth fit into your relationship? Homes need \nthe strength that only God's power can give. To have Christ at the \ncenter of your relationship and your home will afford peace in the \nstorms of life. That peace comes only from each partner knowing and \ntrusting Him with each area of life. A lot to ask, you say? That is \ntrue. But marriage requires a lot. \"But the greatest of these is \nlove\" (1 Cor. 13:13, RSV) D\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nChurches Search for Unity Among Diversity of Worship\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, \nhigh and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple (Isaiah \n6: I) .\u0014\n\u0014\nIF THE ISSUE OF WORSHIP STYLE is a source of unity in your church, \nyour\u0014\n\"experience may be an exception to the rule, \"Nothing divides \nchurches more rapidly than\u0014\nworship issues,\" emphasizes Jim Denison, pastor of Park Cities \nBaptist Church in Dallas, \"Nothing is more emotional, nothing is more \ndivisive, nothing creates a greater sense of competition within a \nfamily of faith,\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing Isaiah 6:1-8 as the foundation text, Denison suggests there is \nonly one biblical model of worship, but with a wide variety of \ncultural expressions.\u0014\n\u0014\nNineteenth century Danish philosopher/theologian Soren Kierkegaard \ncom-\u0014\npared worship to drama: the minister and other worship leaders assume \nthe\u0014\nrole of performers, with God as the off-stage prompter and the \ncongregation as\u0014\nthe audience,\u0014\n\u0014\nIn The Gift of Worship, C, Welton Gaddy amends Kierkegaard's model, \nIn their proper roles, argues Gaddy, members of the congregation \nbecome the performers, the minister and worship leaders serve as the \nprompters, and the audience\u0014\nis God,\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If God is not the audience in any given service, Christian worship \ndoes not take place,\" declares Gaddy; pastor of Northminster Baptist \nChurch in Monroe, La,\u0014\n\u0014\nDenison echoes this sentiment, adding that the biblical pattern of \nworship \"involves the\u0014\nentire congregation in the praise of the only audience we have, the \naudience of the One\u0014\nwhom we worship,\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe the audience of our worship is much more interested in our \nhearts than in our hymnals,\" says Denison, \"and if we ever get to a \nday when we're hungering for biblical worship rather than for one \nparticular cultural expression of it, we'll be in a good place in \nterms of how churches understand worship.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Isaiah 6 is one of the most-cited examples of a biblical model \nof worship, Texas pastor George Mason points to others, including \nDavid dancing around the ark of God, the early church sharing bread \nand all belongings in Acts 4, the singing of hymns and spiritual \nsongs in Ephesians 5, and the angels and saints singing praises \naround God's throne in Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue worship is the gathered people of God \"joining together with the \ncommunion of saints now and across the ages, along with the heavenly \nhost, offering their most honest and worthy praise and prayers in \nresponse to God's work in the world and in their lives, and listening \nfor God's word to break forth afresh,\" says Mason, pastor of Wilshire \nBaptist Church in Dallas.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of today's worship tends to focus on one aspect of the character \nof God more than another, Mason believes. \"If we are worshipping the \nGod who has revealed himself to us in salvation history, than we must \nworship God as triune - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite numerous definitions of worship, some common factors exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nMilbum Price identifies two recurring emphases in worship based on \nthe Old Testament: \"the revelation of God -God's word coming to the \ncongregation -and the congregation's response to God.\" The New \nTestament adds the element of members of the community speaking to \neach other about their faith, say Price, co-author of The Dialogue of \nWorship with Birmingham pastor Gary Purr.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of focusing on a definition, churches need to determine the \nirreducible, essential elements of Christian worship, says Price, \ndean of Samford University's School of Music. These elements, he \nsays, go beyond issues of style to include the following: a community \nof believers gathering in the presence of God, speaking to God, \nexpecting the Word of God to come, and communicating with each other \nabout their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamford music professor Paul A. Richardson urges worship leaders to \nbe more \u0014\nintentional. \"One of our shortcomings as Baptists,\" he argues, \"is \nthat we have lumped together all the things we do when we are \ngathered and call them worship.\" Evangelism, Christian education, \nmissions and fellowship are important ministries of the church, \nRichardson says, but they are not worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastors Gaddy and Mason agree, stressing that the greatest threat to \nworship in most churches is a tendency to use worship for other means.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Worship is to glorify God, and if we use it for some other purpose, \nit makes it idolatrous,\" explains Mason. \"The single greatest \nconsideration is, does God hear us? Is God here?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany worship planners suggest that one way of coming into God's \npresence is through silence. Silence is critical in worship, notes \nPrice, because leaders cannot possibly anticipate all that's going on \nin the hearts and minds of the congregation: \"Silence provides an \nopportunity for the individual to speak to God words that we haven't \nscripted for them that day:\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes silence is uncomfortable, adds Terry Hamrick, CBF's \ncoordinator of         congregational life and leadership. \"True \nworship should make us uncomfortable in God's presence because, \nthrough it, we get a realistic picture of ourselves. \"\u0014\n\u0014\n---Lisa Jones, Atlanta Freelance Writer\u0014",

    "words": "A history by: James Carroll                 \u0014\n\u0014\n                    A large cross, more than 20 feet tall and made of \nrailroad ties, stands beside a group\u0014\n                   of buildings in a field of weeds in Krakw, \nPoland. The cross looms near the\u0014\n                   infamous Barracks 13, one of the death bunkers of \nthe Auschwitz concentration\u0014\n                   camp. It was in one of Barracks 13's cells that \nthe Franciscan priest Maximilian Kolbe\u0014\n                   was martyred; the cross at Auschwitz is for Kolbe. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   This cross serves as an ide fixe for writer James \nCarroll in Constantine's Sword:                           The\u0014\n                   Church and the Jews: A History. For Carroll, an \nantiwar activist and former Catholic\u0014\n                   chaplain of Boston University, the cross at \nAuschwitz is a grim point of reference for\u0014\n                   nearly 2000 years of anti-Jewish sentiment \npromulgated by the Catholic Churcha\u0014\n                   legacy that climaxed in the catastrophe of the \nHolocaust. As Jews and Christians\u0014\n                   passionately debate its presence at Auschwitz, \nCarroll sees the cross \"in its full and\u0014\n                   awful truth for the first time.\" It is a symbol of \nboth persecution and reconciliation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   In Constantine's Sword, Carroll accompanies the \nreader on a troubling journey\u0014\n                   through history; a history that has been marred by \nChurch-inspired anti-Judaism.\u0014\n                   Although a devote Christian, Carroll is \nunflinching in his examination of the roots of\u0014\n                   anti-Judaism found in the Gospels, the militant \nCatholicism of the Emperor\u0014\n                   Constantine and the bloody swath the Crusades cut \nthrough non-Christians in the\u0014\n                   Middle Ages. After painfully enumerating these \ndisturbing policies of a militant\u0014\n                   Church, Carroll explores their consequences: a \nmodern anti-Judaism that reached its\u0014\n                   hideous apotheosis in countless fields (like the \none at Krakw) throughout Europe\u0014\n                   during the Holocaust. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   \"Across the geography of conscience\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                   For Carroll, the journey through the tortured \nhistory of Christian-Jewish relations is\u0014\n                   also a deeply personal one. The author begins by \nasking himself the question Pope\u0014\n                   John Paul II posed to Catholics regarding the \nHolocaust: \"How can we not lament\u0014\n                   the lack of discernment, which at times became \neven acquiescence?\" Carroll is not a\u0014\n                   Christian apologist, and at times some of his \ncriticisms of the Church will startle and,\u0014\n                   perhaps, anger Christian readers. The author's \nprobing, uncompromising tone strips\u0014\n                   away the platitudes and breast-beating that have \ncolored much post-Holocaust\u0014\n                   literature written by Christian writers. \nIronically, Carroll's examination of his own soul,\u0014\n                   and its relation to the Church and the Jews, is \ndeeply Christian and owes much to\u0014\n                   the confessions of one of the oldest Christian \nwriters, St. Augustine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The chapters that explore the roots of \nanti-Judaism and the official sanctioning of\u0014\n                   Christianity by the Emperor Constantine are \nmasterfully drawn and well researched.\u0014\n                   Carroll points out that the seeds of anti-Judaism \nwere nurtured not in conflict\u0014\n                   between opposing religions, but in the fertile \nsoil of internecine conflicts among\u0014\n                   various Jewish sects. As for the Roman Emperor \nConstantine's conversion and\u0014\n                   sanctioning of Christianity, widely romanticized \nas \"the second greatest story ever\u0014\n                   told.\" Carroll sees the conversion as less a \nmiracle and more a savvy political move\u0014\n                   on the Emperor's part to consolidate his power. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   The event set the tone for Christian-Jewish \nrelations in the centuries that followed.\u0014\n                   Carroll points out that in the Age of Constantine, \n\"Christians went from being 10\u0014\n                   percent of the empire...to being its solid \nmajority....The status of Judaism was\u0014\n                   similarly reversed, from a licit self-rule, a \nrespected exception within a sea of\u0014\n                   paganism, to a state of highly vulnerable \ndisenfranchisement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Where do we go from here?\u0014\n\u0014\n                   The most affecting moments in the book are \nCarroll's reminiscences of his own\u0014\n                   spiritual and intellectual development: early \nboyhood adventures with a Jewish\u0014\n                   friend and his struggle to understand what it \nmeant to be a Jew. Carroll recounts\u0014\n                   Holy Week pilgrimages with his mother to shrines \nalong the Rhineland (Carroll's\u0014\n                   father was U.S. Air Force chief of staff stationed \nin Wiesbaden, Germany), and a\u0014\n                   memorable audience with Pope John XXIII. He \ndiscusses his life as a seminarian\u0014\n                   and confronting anti-Semitism as a chaplain at \nBoston University. These scenes lend\u0014\n                   immediacy and humanity to Carroll's intellectually \nchallenging tome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Carroll doesn't offer easy solutions, and that's a \ngreat part of the book's appeal.\u0014\n                   Clearly, there are no simple answers to a \n2000-year-old question. Constantine's\u0014\n                   Sword will inform, provoke and, hopefully, \nenlighten readers of all faiths. As a work\u0014\n                   of history it is epic, as a personal memoir it is \npenetrating and moving. There is\u0014\n                   much anger here, and much sorrow. But there is \nalso hope. Carroll closes the book\u0014\n                   with a quote from his friend, Rabbi Abraham Joshua \nHeschel: \"God is greater than\u0014\n                   religion...faith is greater than dogma.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                         \nAuthor Profile\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                       \nMembers who bought this\u0014\n\n                                                                       \ntitle also bought:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nReligion  Biblical\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nReligion  Christianity\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                        \nReligion  General\u0014",

He \nwas\u0014\n                      shocked to see so many children \"wretchedly \nragged, at play\u0014\n                      in the street.\" He asked a local woman about \nthis.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"On a Sunday you would be shocked indeed,\" she \nreplied,\u0014\n                      \"for then the street is filled with multitudes \nof the wretches\u0014\n                      who, released on that day from employment, \nspend their day\u0014\n                      in noise and riot. cursing and swearing in a \nmanner so\u0014\n                      horrid as to convey  an idea of hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1700s England, it was generally agreed that \nsomething\u0014\n                      must be done about children's poverty and \nignorance. The\u0014\n                      Society for the Promotion of Christian \nKnowledge established\u0014\n                      1,500 charity schools for such students, and \nGeorge\u0014\n                      Whitefield and the Wesleys preached to them. \nYet reformers\u0014\n                      faced several difficulties. Class separation \nkept the learned\u0014\n                      from the poor. Class condition was attributed \nto \"breeding,\"\u0014\n                      which education could not change. Individual \nreformers\u0014\n                      worked alone, and the public had no \nappreciation of their\u0014\n                      success. Then there was the law: until 1779, it \nwas illegal for\u0014\n                      non-Anglicans to start a school or teach.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Raikes (who died April 5, 1811) learned concern \nfor the poor\u0014\n                      from his father, from whom he also inherited an \ninfluential\u0014\n                      newspaper. He was a bit of a dandywalking \nabout town in\u0014\n                      his wig and claret-colored coat, and carrying a \ngold snuff\u0014\n                      case. But he was also a committed member of the \nChurch of\u0014\n                      England. His first efforts to live out his \nChristian convictions\u0014\n                      focused on prison reform, but he then decided \nchildren must\u0014\n                      be put on the right path before evil habits \nwere formed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Immediately after his shocking encounter in the \nGloucester\u0014\n                      slum, he hired four women to teach the children \nthat next\u0014\n                      Sunday. After securing permission of the \nparents, Raikes\u0014\n                      sent 20 children to each teacher. School began \nat 10 a.m.,\u0014\n                      let out an hour for lunch, then continued until \n5 p.m. The\u0014\n                      children also attended an afternoon church \nservice. The Bible\u0014\n                      was the basis of instruction.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1783 Raikes wrote an article in his paper, \nwithout\u0014\n                      mentioning his own involvement, noting the \nsuccess of these\u0014\n                      \"Sunday schools.\" Readers were fascinated and \nasked for\u0014\n                      more information. Raikes provided enthusiastic \nreplies, which\u0014\n                      were printed and reprinted in publications \nacross England.\u0014\n                      Other schools soon formed, and Raikes \npublicized their\u0014\n                      successes. His publicity campaign reached its \nzenith when\u0014\n                      he was summoned to an audience with the royal \nfamily. King\u0014\n                      George III wished that \"every child in my \nkingdom should be\u0014\n                      taught to read the Bible.\" (This is, of course, \nthe same \"royal\u0014\n                      brute\" whose government, Thomas Paine griped, \n\"so\u0014\n                      impiously invades the prerogative of heaven.\")\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sunday schools grew dramatically. In 1787, four \nyears after\u0014\n                      Raikes's first article, there were 250,000 \nSunday school\u0014\n                      students. By 1811 there were 500,000, and by \n1831 there\u0014\n                      were 1.25 million. In 1833 the government began \nsubsidizing\u0014\n                      the schools. Sunday schools spread to the \nUnited States,\u0014\n                      Scotland, Ireland, and the Continent.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Eventually children's education passed into the \nhands of the\u0014\n                      state, and religious instruction was \neliminated. The Sunday\u0014\n                      school movement lost its zeal and went into a \n50-year\u0014\n                      membership decline in the early twentieth \ncentury. Today we\u0014\n                      see only its faded remnants in the mere hour \nspent with the\u0014\n                      clean and well-mannered children of believers. \nBut in its day,\u0014\n                      it was a remarkable institution. Adam Smith, \nauthor of the\u0014\n                      classic _Wealth of Nations_, declared that no \nplan so\u0014\n                      promising for improving morals had been devised \nsince the\u0014\n                      days of the apostles.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Elesha Coffman is associate editor of Christian \nHistory.\u0014",

    "words": "C.S. Lewis \u0014\n\u0014\n              The atheist scholar who became an Anglican, an\u0014\n              apologist, and a \"patron saint\" of Christians \neverywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                           Ted Olsen\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"He was a heavily built man who looked about \nforty, with a fleshy oval face\u0014\n                      and a ruddy complexion. His black hair had \nretreated from his forehead,\u0014\n                      which made him especially imposing. I knew \nnothing about him, except \u0014\n                      that he was the college English tutor. I did \nnot know that he was the best \u0014\n                      lecturer\u0014\n                      in the department, nor had I read the only book \nthat he had published under\u0014\n                      his own name (hardly anyone had). Even after I \nhad been taught by him for\u0014\n                      three years, it never entered my mind that he \ncould one day become an\u0014\n                      author whose books would sell at the rate of \nabout two million copies a\u0014\n                      year. Since he never spoke of religion while I \nwas his pupil, or until we had\u0014\n                      become friends 15 years later, it would have \nseemed incredible that he\u0014\n                      would become the means of bringing many back to \nthe Christian faith.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even to his best biographer and longtime friend \nGeorge Sayer, Clive\u0014\n                      Staples Lewis was a surprise and a mystery. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As J. R. R. Tolkien advised Sayer, \"You'll \nnever get to the bottom of him.\"\u0014\n                      But understanding or even fully agreeing with \nLewis have never been\u0014\n                      prerequisites to enjoying and admiring him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His books continue to sell extremely well (the \nChronicles of Narnia set, for\u0014\n                      example, is among Amazon.com's top 200 titles), \nand many readers rate\u0014\n                      him as the most influential writer in their \nlives. Quite a feat for a man who\u0014\n                      long disparaged \"the Christian mythology\" and \nregarded God as \"My\u0014\n                      Enemy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis was born into a bookish family of \nProtestants in Belfast, Ireland. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"There were books in the study, books in the \ndining room, books in the\u0014\n                      cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great \nbookcase on the landing, books\u0014\n                      in a bedroom, books piled as high as my \nshoulder in the cistern attic,\u0014\n                      books of all kinds,\" Lewis remembered, and none \nwere off limits to him. On\u0014\n                      rainy daysand there were many in northern \nIrelandhe pulled volumes off\u0014\n                      the shelves and entered into worlds created by \nauthors such as Conan\u0014\n                      Doyle, E. Nesbit, Mark Twain, and Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After his only brother, Warren, was sent off to \nEnglish boarding school in\u0014\n                      1905, Jack became reclusive. He spent more time \nin books and an\u0014\n                      imaginary world of \"dressed animals\" and \n\"knights in armor.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His mother's death from cancer in 1908 made him \neven more withdrawn.\u0014\n                      Mrs. Lewis's death came just three months \nbefore Jack's tenth birthday,\u0014\n                      and the young man was hurt deeply by her \npassing. On top of that, his father\u0014\n                      never fully recovered from her death, and both \nboys felt increasingly\u0014\n                      estranged from him; home life was never warm \nand satisfying again. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      His mother's death convinced young Jack that \nthe God he encountered in\u0014\n                      the Bible his mother gave him didn't always \nanswer prayers. This early\u0014\n                      doubt, coupled with an unduly harsh, \nself-directed spiritual regimen and the\u0014\n                      influence of a mildly occultist boarding school \nmatron a few years later,\u0014\n                      caused Lewis to reject Christianity and become \nan avowed atheist. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis entered Oxford in 1917 as a student and \nnever really left. \"The place\u0014\n                      has surpassed my wildest dreams,\" he wrote to \nhis father after spending\u0014\n                      his first day there. \"I never saw anything so \nbeautiful.\" Despite an\u0014\n                      interruption to fight in World War I (in which \nhe was wounded by a bursting\u0014\n                      shell), he always maintained his home and \nfriends in Oxford. His\u0014\n                      attachment to Oxford was so strong that when he \ntaught at Cambridge from\u0014\n                      1955 to 1963, he commuted back to Oxford on \nweekends so he could be\u0014\n                      close to familiar places and beloved friends. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                   \"Christianity, if false, is of no \nimportance, \u0014\n                                       and, if true, of infinite \nimportance. \u0014\n                              The one thing it cannot be is \nmoderately important.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                  C.S. Lewis\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1919 Lewis published his first book, a cycle \nof lyrics titled Spirits in\u0014\n                      Bondage, which he wrote under the pseudonym \nClive Hamilton. In 1924 he\u0014\n                      became a philosophy tutor at University \nCollege, and the following year he\u0014\n                      was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, where \nhe tutored in English\u0014\n                      language and literature. His second volume of \npoetry, Dymer, was also\u0014\n                      published pseudonymously. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Lewis continued to read, he especially \nenjoyed Christian author George\u0014\n                      MacDonald. One volume, Phantastes, powerfully \nchallenged his atheism.\u0014\n                      \"What it actually did to me,\" wrote Lewis, \"was \nto convert, even to\u0014\n                      baptizemy imagination.\" G. K. Chesterton's \nbooks worked much the\u0014\n                      same way, especially The Everlasting Man, which \nraised serious\u0014\n                      questions about the young intellectual's \nmaterialism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"A young man who wishes to remain a sound \natheist cannot be too careful\u0014\n                      of his reading,\" Lewis later wrote in the \nautobiographical Surprised by Joy.\u0014\n                      \"God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      While MacDonald and Chesterton were stirring \nLewis's thoughts, close\u0014\n                      friend Owen Barfield pounced on the logic of \nLewis's atheism. Barfield had\u0014\n                      converted from atheism to theism, then finally \nto Christianity, and he\u0014\n                      frequently badgered Lewis about his \nmaterialism. So did Nevill Coghill, a\u0014\n                      brilliant fellow student and lifelong friend \nwho, to Lewis's amazement, was\u0014\n                      \"a Christian and a thoroughgoing \nsupernaturalist.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Soon after joining the English faculty at \nOxford's Magdalen College, Lewis\u0014\n                      met two more Christians, Hugo Dyson and J. R. \nR. Tolkien. These men\u0014\n                      became close friends of Lewis. He admired their \nbrilliance and their logic.\u0014\n                      Soon Lewis recognized that most of his friends, \nlike his favorite\u0014\n                      authorsMacDonald, Chesterton, Johnson, \nSpenser, and Miltonheld to\u0014\n                      this Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1929 these roads met, and Lewis surrendered, \nadmitting \"God was God,\u0014\n                      and knelt and prayed.\" Within two years the \nreluctant convert also moved\u0014\n                      from theism to Christianity and joined the \nChurch of England. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Almost immediately, Lewis set out in a new \ndirection, most demonstrably in\u0014\n                      his writing. Earlier efforts to become a poet \nwere laid to rest. The new\u0014\n                      Christian devoted his talent and energy to \nwriting prose that reflected his\u0014\n                      recently found faith. Within two years of his \nconversion, Lewis published\u0014\n                      The Pilgrim's Regress: An Allegorical Apology \nfor Christianity, Reason\u0014\n                      and Romanticism (1933). This little volume \nopened a 30-year stream of\u0014\n                      books on Christian apologetics and discipleship \nthat became a lifelong\u0014\n                      avocation. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not everyone approved of his new interest in \napologetics. Lewis frequently\u0014\n                      received criticism from members of his closest \ncircle of friends, the Inklings\u0014\n                      (the nickname for the group of intellectuals \nand writers who met regularly to\u0014\n                      exchange ideas). Even close Christian friends \nlike Tolkien and Owen\u0014\n                      Barfield openly disapproved of Lewis's \nevangelistic speaking and writing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In fact, Lewis's \"Christian\" books caused so \nmuch disapproval that he was\u0014\n                      more than once passed over for a professorship \nat Oxford, with the honors\u0014\n                      going to men of lesser reputation. It was \nMagdalene College at Cambridge\u0014\n                      University that finally honored Lewis with a \nchair in 1955. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Regardless of their reception close to home, \nLewis's 25 Christian books,\u0014\n                      including The Screwtape Letters (1942), Mere \nChristianity (1952), the\u0014\n                      Chronicles of Narnia (1950-56), The Great \nDivorce (1946), and the\u0014\n                      Abolition of Man (1943), which Encyclopedia \nBritannica included in its\u0014\n                      collection of Great Books of the World, have \nsold millions of copies. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though his books gained him worldwide fame, \nLewis was always first a\u0014\n                      scholar. He continued to write literary history \nand criticism such as The\u0014\n                      Allegory of Love (1936), considered a classic \nin its field, and English\u0014\n                      Literature in the Sixteenth Century (1954). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In spite of his many intellectual \naccomplishments, he refused to be\u0014\n                      arrogant: \"The intellectual life is not the \nonly road to God, nor the safest, but\u0014\n                      we find it to be a road, and it may be the \nappointed road for us. Of course,\u0014\n                      it will be so only so long as we keep the \nimpulse pure and disinterested.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis did hit at least one jarring bump in his \nintellectual road: a 1948\u0014\n                      debate with British philosopher Elizabeth \nAnscombe. Anscombe read a\u0014\n                      paper before the Oxford Socratic Club (a forum \nLewis led for many years)\u0014\n                      in which she attacked Lewis's recently \npublished Miracles and his whole\u0014\n                      argument against naturalism. Anscombe won the \nday, and Lewis was\u0014\n                      reportedly \"deeply disturbed\" and \"in very low \nspirits.\" He never wrote\u0014\n                      straight apologetics again, though he continued \nto communicate his faith\u0014\n                      through fiction and other literary forms. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Books were not the only means Lewis found for \nsharing his message. In\u0014\n                      1941, the director of religious broadcasting at \nthe BBC (who had found\u0014\n                      personal comfort through reading The Problem of \nPain) asked if Lewis\u0014\n                      would be willing to speak on the radio. Though \nthe author hated radio, he\u0014\n                      recognized the opportunity to reach a wider \naudience. The outcome was\u0014\n                      seven sets of talks, broadcast between 1941 and \n1944, with titles like\u0014\n                      \"Right and Wrong: A Clue to the Meaning of the \nUniverse?\" and \"What\u0014\n                      Christians Believe.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The weekly broadcasts were very popularjust \nwhat weary, discouraged\u0014\n                      Brits were looking for in the gloom of World \nWar II. Sayer recounts, \"I\u0014\n                      remember being at a pub filled with soldiers on \none Wednesday evening.\u0014\n                      At a quarter to eight, the bartender turned the \nradio up for Lewis. 'You listen\u0014\n                      to this bloke,' he shouted. 'He's really worth \nlistening to.' And those soldiers\u0014\n                      did listen attentively for the entire fifteen \nminutes.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In addition to spreading Lewis's fame as an \napologist and speaker, the\u0014\n                      BBC talks produced at least two major results. \nOne was the book Mere\u0014\n                      Christianity (1952), a collection of all the \ntalks that is now Lewis's\u0014\n                      second-bestselling work. The other was a deluge \nof correspondence,\u0014\n                      including many letters from spiritual seekers \nto whom he wished to make a\u0014\n                      detailed, personal reply. The sheer volume of \nletters led him to seek his\u0014\n                      brother Warren's secretarial assistance but did \nnot prevent him from\u0014\n                      crafting responses that showed the same clarity \nof thought and literary\u0014\n                      grace possessed by all his writing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One correspondent in particular would play a \nmajor role in Lewis's life. In\u0014\n                      1950 he received a letter from Joy Davidman \nGresham, a New Yorker who\u0014\n                      had become a Christian through reading The \nGreat Divorce and The\u0014\n                      Screwtape Letters. Lewis was impressed by the \nwriting and the mind\u0014\n                      behind it, and a lively, intense correspondence \nfollowed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two years later, Joy crossed the Atlantic to \nvisit her spiritual mentor in\u0014\n                      England. Soon thereafter her alcoholic husband \nabandoned her for another\u0014\n                      woman, and she moved to London with her two \nadolescent boys, David\u0014\n                      and Douglas. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Joy gradually fell into financial trouble. \nLewis helped out by underwriting the\u0014\n                      boys' boarding school education and paying the \nrent on a house not far\u0014\n                      from his own. The two developed a deep \nfriendship, much to the dismay of\u0014\n                      many of Lewis's friends. Joy had many strikes \nagainst her: she was an\u0014\n                      American, of Jewish descent, a former \ncommunist, 16 years younger than\u0014\n                      Lewis, divorced, and personally abrasive. \nHowever, she stimulated Lewis's\u0014\n                      writing, and he enjoyed her company. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even so, it wasn't love that primarily \nmotivated the couple to marry in\u0014\n                      1956Joy couldn't renew her permit to live and \nwork in England, so her\u0014\n                      only chance to stay in the country was to marry \nan Englishman. Lewis\u0014\n                      gallantly offered his services. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A few months after the civil wedding ceremony, \nsomething happened that\u0014\n                      did rouse Lewis's emotions. After a bad fall in \nher house, Joy was\u0014\n                      diagnosed with bone cancer. \"Never have I loved \nher more than since she\u0014\n                      was struck down,\" Lewis wrote to a friend. The \ntwo were married in an\u0014\n                      ecclesiastical ceremony at Joy's bedside, and \nshe moved in with Lewis,\u0014\n                      presumably to die. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In a seeming miracle, Joy's condition improved, \nand she and Lewis\u0014\n                      enjoyed three happy years together. As he wrote \nto one friend soon after\u0014\n                      their marriage, \"It's funny having at 59 the \nsort of happiness most men have\u0014\n                      in their twenties'Thou hast kept the good wine \ntill now.' \" A writer in her\u0014\n                      own right, her influence on what Jack \nconsidered his best book, Till We\u0014\n                      Have Faces (1956), was so profound that he told \none close friend she was\u0014\n                      actually its co-author. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Joy's death in 1960, like the death of his \nmother, dealt Lewis a severe\u0014\n                      blow. The best way he knew to grapple with his \nfeelings of grief, anger, and\u0014\n                      doubt was to write a book. A Grief Observed \nappeared in 1961 under a\u0014\n                      pseudonym, because it was so intimate and \npersonal Lewis couldn't bear\u0014\n                      for it to be published with his own name. Few \ncopies were sold until it was\u0014\n                      reissued under the author's true name after his \ndeath. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the summer and fall of 1963, Lewis's health \ndeteriorated. He died in his\u0014\n                      sleep on November 22, the same day John F. \nKennedy was assassinated.\u0014\n                      Perhaps because of the worldwide shock \nregarding the president's death,\u0014\n                      Lewis barely made headlines, and his funeral \nwas attended mostly by\u0014\n                      family and close friends, including the \nInklings. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis may have been buried without fanfare, but \nhis impact on hearts and\u0014\n                      lives has never stopped growing. In the words \nof evangelical leader John\u0014\n                      Stott, \"He was a Christ-centered, \ngreat-tradition mainstream Christian\u0014\n                      whose stature a generation after his death \nseems greater than anyone ever\u0014\n                      thought while he was alive, and whose Christian \nwritings are now seen as\u0014\n                      having classic status. I doubt whether the \nfull measure of him has been\u0014\n                      taken by anyone.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ted Olsen, former assistant editor of CHRISTIAN \nHISTORY, now edits\u0014\n                      ChristianityToday.com.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                  Timeline \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1898 Clive Staples Lewis born in Belfast, \nIreland \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1908 Lewis's mother dies \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1917 Lewis begins studies at University \nCollege, Oxford \u0014\n\u0014\n                      1925 Awarded a fellowship in English at \nOxford's Magdalen College;\u0014\n                      publication of G.K.

    "words": "C.S. Lewis on \nChristmas\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis summed up Christmas in one sentence: 'The \nSon of God became a\u0014\n                      man to enable men to become the sons of God.'\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Kathryn Lindskoog | Our earliest description \nof Christmas from\u0014\n                      C.S. Lewis is a bitter one. The year was 1922. \nAs usual, C.S.\u0014\n                      Lewis and his brother Warren spent the holidays \nwith their\u0014\n                      widowed father in his big house outside Belfast.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It was a dark morning with a gale blowing and \nsome very\u0014\n                      cold rain,\" Lewis reported in his diary. Their \nfather Albert\u0014\n                      awakened his two sons, both in their \nmidtwenties, to go to\u0014\n                      early Communion service. As they walked to \nchurch in the\u0014\n                      dawn light, they started discussing the time of \nsunrise. Albert\u0014\n                      irritated his sons by insisting that the sun \nhad already risen or\u0014\n                      else they would not have any light. He was an \nillogical and\u0014\n                      argumentative man.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Saint Mark's church was intensely cold. Warren \nwanted to\u0014\n                      keep his coat on during the service, and his \nfather\u0014\n                      disapproved. \"Well, at least you won't keep it \non when you go\u0014\n                      up to the Table,\" Albert warned. Warren asked \nwhy not and\u0014\n                      was told that taking Communion with a coat on \nwas \"most\u0014\n                      disrespectful.\" Warren took his coat off to \navoid an argument.\u0014\n                      Not one of the three Lewis men had any interest \nin the\u0014\n                      meaning of Communion. The two sons hadn't \nbelieved in\u0014\n                      Christianity for years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Christmas dinner, a rather deplorable \nceremony, at quarter to\u0014\n                      four, Lewis continued in his diary. After \ndinner the rain had\u0014\n                      stopped at last, and Albert urged his two sons \nto take a walk.\u0014\n                      They were delighted to get out into the fresh \nair and head for a\u0014\n                      pub where they could get a drink. Before they \ncame to the\u0014\n                      pub, however, some relatives drove by on the \nway to their\u0014\n                      house for a visit and gave them an unwelcome \nride right back\u0014\n                      home.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After too much sitting and talking and eating \nand smoking all\u0014\n                      day in the stuffy house, Lewis went to bed \nearly, dead tired\u0014\n                      and headachy. He felt like a flabby, lazy \nteenager again. It\u0014\n                      had been another bad Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1929 Albert Lewis suddenly died of cancer. \nThere would be\u0014\n                      no more coming home for Christmas. Within a \ncouple of\u0014\n                      years of their father's death, both Warren and \nC.S. Lewis\u0014\n                      privately made some major shifts in their ideas \nabout religion.\u0014\n                      They were separately moving toward Christian \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It was 1931. In Shanghai, where he was serving \nas a British\u0014\n                      military officer, Warren got up at 6:30 on \nChristmas morning.\u0014\n                      There was bright sun, frost on the ground, and \nwhat Warren\u0014\n                      called a faint keen wind. For the first time in \nmany years\u0014\n                      Warren went to church to take Communion. He was \ndeeply\u0014\n                      excited about it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Warren couldn't help thinking about the old \ndays when he had\u0014\n                      attended Christmas Communion at home in \nIreland. \"The\u0014\n                      kafuffle of the early start, the hurried walk \nin the chill half light,\u0014\n                      Barton's beautiful voice, the dim lights of \nSaint Mark's and\u0014\n                      then the return home to the Gargantuan \nbreakfast-how jolly it\u0014\n                      all seems in retrospect!\" It hadn't seemed \njolly at the time.\u0014\n                      Warren felt great sorrow about the past, but \nhis sorrow was\u0014\n                      outweighed by gladness and thanks that he was \nonce again a\u0014\n                      believer in the Christmas story.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On that very day, Christmas of 1931, C.S. Lewis \nsat down in\u0014\n                      Oxford to write an eight-page letter to Warren. \nHe began by\u0014\n                      warning that because of his teaching duties he \nhad done,\u0014\n                      read, and heard nothing for a long time that \ncould possibly\u0014\n                      interest Warren. Then he proceeded to write one \nof his usual\u0014\n                      entertaining letters full of humor and ideas \nand bits of new. In\u0014\n                      the middle of the letter he mentioned that it \nwas a foggy\u0014\n                      afternoon, but that it had seemed springlike \nearly that\u0014\n                      morning as he went to the Communion service. \nThat is how\u0014\n                      he admitted the big news that he had taken \nCommunion for\u0014\n                      the first time in many years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At that point in the letter, C.S. Lewis \nrecounted a few thing\u0014\n                      that he had heard in recent sermons. In a \nsermon on foreign\u0014\n                      missions the preacher had said, \"Many of us \nhave friends who\u0014\n                      used to live abroad, and had a native Christian \ncook who was\u0014\n                      unsatisfactory. Well, after all there are a \ngreat many\u0014\n                      unsatisfactory Christians in England too. In \nfact I'm one\u0014\n                      myself.\" In a different sermon, that preacher \nhad declared that\u0014\n                      if early Christians had known they were \nfounding an\u0014\n                      organization to last for centuries, they would \nhave organized it\u0014\n                      to death. But because they believed that they \nwere making\u0014\n                      provisional arrangements for a year or so, they \nleft it free to\u0014\n                      live. Lewis thought that was an interesting \nidea.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A less helpful preacher had said shortly before \nChristmas that\u0014\n                      he objected to the early chapters of Luke, \nespecially the story\u0014\n                      of the Annunciation, because they were \nindelicate. Such\u0014\n                      prudery left Lewis gasping.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That Christmas letter from C.S. Lewis found its \nway to\u0014\n                      Warren on January 19, 1932, and he wrote in his \ndiary, \"A\u0014\n                      letter  today containing the news that he too \nhas once more\u0014\n                      started to go to Communion, at which I am \ndelighted.\" Had he\u0014\n                      not done so, Warren reflected, they would not \nhave been quite\u0014\n                      so close in the future as in the past.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      From 1931 to the end of his life, C.S. Lewis \nlooked at\u0014\n                      Christmas from a Christian point of view. In \n1939 Warren was\u0014\n                      on duty away from home again, and on Christmas \nEve C.S.\u0014\n                      Lewis wrote that he had been thinking much that \nweek about\u0014\n                      Christmas cards. Aside from the absurdity of \ncelebrating the\u0014\n                      nativity at all if you don't believe in the \nIncarnation, \"what in\u0014\n                      heaven's name is the idea of everyone sending \neveryone else\u0014\n                      pictures of stage-coaches, fairies, foxes, \ndogs, butterflies,\u0014\n                      kittens, flowers, etc.?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Warming to his topic, Lewis asked his brother \nto imagine a\u0014\n                      Chinese man sitting at a table covered with \nsmall pictures.\u0014\n                      The man explains that he is preparing for the \nanniversary of\u0014\n                      Buddha's being protected by the dragons. Not \nthat he\u0014\n                      personally believes that this is the real \nanniversary of the\u0014\n                      event or even that it really happened. He is \njust keeping up\u0014\n                      the old custom. Not that he has any pictures of \nBuddha or of\u0014\n                      the dragons. He doesn't like that kind. He \nsays, \"Here's one\u0014\n                      of a traction engine for Hu Flung Dung, and I'm \nsending this\u0014\n                      study of a napkin-ring to Lo Hung Git, and \nthese jolly ones of\u0014\n                      bluebottles are for the children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Aside from thinking about Christmas cards, \nLewis had\u0014\n                      enjoyed himself in two ways that week. He was \nback at work\u0014\n                      on his book The Problem of Pain, and he was \nable to enjoy\u0014\n                      good winter walks. The pond on his property had \na thin skin of\u0014\n                      ice. The beautiful frozen days had been of two \nkinds: \"those\u0014\n                      with bright yellow suns, turning at sunset to \nred cannon balls,\u0014\n                      and those with deep dark-grey fog through which \nthe ridges of\u0014\n                      the grass loom up white.\" Near the end of his \nletter he said,\u0014\n                      \"Well, Brother, (as the troops say) it's a sad \nbusiness not to\u0014\n                      have you with me to-morrow morning. \" That \nmeant church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During World War II C.S. Lewis gave a series of \ntalks about\u0014\n                      Christianity on BBC radio, and later he brought \nthese out as\u0014\n                      his book Mere Christianity. In that book Lewis \nsummed up\u0014\n                      Christmas and Christianity in one memorable \nsentence: \"The\u0014\n                      Son of God became a man to enable men to become \nthe\u0014\n                      sons of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In his 1950 book for children, The Lion the \nWitch and the\u0014\n                      Wardrobe, Lewis made it clear that he was all \nfor merry times\u0014\n                      and good gifts and Christmas pudding. The land \nof Narnia was\u0014\n                      under the spell of a wicked white witch who \nmade it always\u0014\n                      winter and never Christmas. When the great gold \nlion Aslan\u0014\n                      brought the thaw that spelled her doom, Father \nChristmas\u0014\n                      came at last.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1954 Lewis published a very different kind \nof fantasy about\u0014\n                      Christmas, \"Xmas and Christmas.\" It is an essay \nabout the\u0014\n                      strange island called Niatirb (Britain spelled \nbackwards) and\u0014\n                      the winter festival called Exmas that the \nNiatirbians observe\u0014\n                      with great patience and endurance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the customs that fills the marketplace \nwith crowds\u0014\n                      during the foggiest and rainiest season of the \nyear is the great\u0014\n                      labor and weariness of sending cards and gifts. \nEvery citizen\u0014\n                      has to guess the value of the gift that every \nfriend will send\u0014\n                      him so that he may send one of equal value \nwhether he can\u0014\n                      afford it or not. Everyone becomes so pale and \nweary that it\u0014\n                      looks as if calamity has struck. These days are \ncalled the\u0014\n                      Exmas Rush. Exhausted with the Rush, most \ncitizens lie in\u0014\n                      bed until noon on the day of the festival. \nLater that day they\u0014\n                      eat far too much and get intoxicated. On the \nday after Exmas\u0014\n                      they are very grave because they feel unwell \nand begin to\u0014\n                      calculate how much they have spent on Exmas and \nthe\u0014\n                      Rush.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is also a festival in Niatirb called \nCrissmas, held on the\u0014\n                      same day as Exmas. A few people in Niatirb keep \nCrissmas\u0014\n                      sacred, but they are greatly distracted by \nExmas and the\u0014\n                      Rush.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On December 17, 1955, Lewis wrote to an old \nfriend that he\u0014\n                      was pleased by the card the man had sent him, a\u0014\n                      Japanese-style nativity scene. But, he \ncontinued, Christmas\u0014\n                      cards in general and the whole vast commercial \ndrive called\u0014\n                      \"Xmas\" was one of his pet abominations. He \nwished they\u0014\n                      would die away and leave the Christmas \nobservance alone.\u0014\n                      He had nothing against secular festivities. But \nhe despised\u0014\n                      the artificial childlikeness, and the attempt \nto keep up some\u0014\n                      shallow connection with the birth of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1957 C.S. Lewis published \"What Christmas \nMeans to\u0014\n                      Me.\" He claimed that three things go by the \nname of\u0014\n                      Christmas. First is the religious festival. \nSecond is an\u0014\n                      occasion for merry making and hospitality. \nThird is the\u0014\n                      commercial racket, a modern invention to boost \nsales. He\u0014\n                      listed his reasons for condemning the \ncommercial racket.\u0014\n                      First, it causes more pain than pleasure. \nSecond, it is a trap\u0014\n                      made up of obligations. Third, many of the \npurchases are\u0014\n                      gaudy rubbish. Fourth, we get exhausted by \nhaving to support\u0014\n                      the commercial racket while carrying on all our \nregular duties\u0014\n                      as well. \"Can it really be my duty to buy and \nreceive masses\u0014\n                      of junk every winter?\" Lewis demanded \nplaintively.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two years later C.S. Lewis was featured in the \nChristmas\u0014\n                      issue of the Saturday Evening Post. The issue, \ndated\u0014\n                      December 19, 1959, bore on its cover a 15-cent \nprice, a\u0014\n                      picture of a man struggling clumsily to get a \npackage\u0014\n                      wrapped, and the announcement of a new \nScrewtape letter by\u0014\n                      C.S. Lewis. Inside was a life-sized, close-up \nphoto of Lewis's\u0014\n                      face and his essay \"Screwtape Proposes a \nToast.\" This was\u0014\n                      a kind of Christmas gift to the public from the \neditors.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1963 the Saturday Evening Post featured C. \nS. Lewis in its\u0014\n                      Christmas issue for the second time. This time \nthe price on\u0014\n                      the cover was 20 cents and the picture on the \ncover was of a\u0014\n                      children's choir. Inside was Lewis's article \n\"We Have No 'Right\u0014\n                      to Happiness'\" with the heading, \"Is \nhappiness-in particular\u0014\n                      sexual happiness-one of man's inalienable \nrights? A\u0014\n                      distinguished author attacks the brutality of \nthis increasingly\u0014\n                      common notion.\" In the upper right-hand corner \nis the\u0014\n                      announcement, \"As this article went to press, \nits author died\u0014\n                      at his home in Oxford, England. The article is \nhis last work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Since Lewis's death on November 22, 1963, a \nnumber of his\u0014\n                      writings from earlier years have become more \nwidely\u0014\n                      available. A few not published at all in his \nlifetime have now\u0014\n                      found their way into print. One of these is his \nundated poem\u0014\n                      \"The Nativity,\" available in his book Poems. In \nthis brief poem\u0014\n                      Lewis shows what the nativity scene meant in \nhis own prayer\u0014\n                      life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      First, Lewis likens himself to a slow, dull ox. \nAlong with the\u0014\n                      oxen he sees the glory growing in the stable, \nhe says, and he\u0014\n                      hopes that it will give him, at length, an ox's \nstrength.\u0014\n                      Second, Lewis likens himself to a stubborn and \nfoolish ass.\u0014\n                      Along with the asses he sees the Savior in the \nhay, and he\u0014\n                      hopes that he will learn the patience of an \nass. Third, Lewis\u0014\n                      likens himself to a strayed and bleating sheep. \nAlong with the\u0014\n                      sheep in the stable he watches his Lord lying \nin the manger.\u0014\n                      From his Lord he hopes to gain some of a \nsheep's woolly\u0014\n                      innocence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the earliest photos of C.S. Lewis shows \nhim as a very\u0014\n                      little boy posed with a Father Christmas doll. \nThe half-smile\u0014\n                      caught forever on his plump young face seems \nbalanced\u0014\n                      between anxiety and pleasure. He looks \nthoughtfully attentive.\u0014\n                      It is fitting, because he half-smiled at \nChristmas the rest of\u0014\n                      his days. We might do well to pause in the \n\"kafuffle\" and\u0014\n                      \"Exmas Rush\" and look into the manger with C.S. \nLewis.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This article originally appeared in the \nDecember 16, 1983 issue of\u0014\n                      Christianity Today.

He stated, \"I believe children should be given a \nfree rein to think and act and thus learn at an early age to make \ntheir own decisions. This is the only way they can grow into their \nfull potential.\" Coleridge made no comment but simply led the man to \nhis garden. \"Come see my flower garden,\" he said. The opinionated \nvisitor took one look at the overgrown garden and remarked, \"Why, \nthat's nothing but a yard full of weeds.\" The wise poet declared, \"It \nused to be filled with roses, but this year I thought I'd let the \ngarden grow as it willed without tending to it. This is the result.\" \nChildren, like gardens, will not automatically flourish. They need \ndaily attention and care.\u0014\n\u0014\n* Crossroads, Vol. l, No. 4, p. 23\u0014",

During the \nconvention, many\u0014\n                      went evangelizing door-to-door.

    "words": "World Report 4/30/01\u0014\n\u0014\n                      China's Christian Underground\u0014\n                      Millions of Chinese risk the government's wrath \nby pursuing their\u0014\n                      faith \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Bay Fang \u0014\n\u0014\n                      CENTRAL CHINAIt is dark, and one by one \nshadows slip up the concrete stairwell.\u0014\n                      Suddenly a door slides open and a throbbing hum \nrolls out. The room is packed with 80  middle-aged men and women \nsquatting on tiny stools, heads bowed and eyes squeezed shut, \nwhispering prayers. They wear the padded cotton jackets of farmers \nand they pray for forgiveness, for better lives, for protection from \npersecution. The combined sound of\u0014\ntheir worship is a low rumble, like distant thunder.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Beijing had better brace for the approaching \nstorm. While China's leaders have waged a full-scale war on Falun \nGong the past two years, the underground Christian movement\u0014\nhas been slowly gathering its forces, and a battle may be about to \nbegin. Authorities\u0014\narrested two leaders at a house church meeting in central Hubei \nprovince on March 12\u0014\nand reportedly tortured them. But every day, all over China, groups \nlike this meet secretly\u0014\nin private homes, and they have slowly formed an astonishingly \nwell-organized national\u0014\nnetwork, receiving training and funds from overseas. While there are \n10 to 15 million\u0014\nProtestants attending official churches controlled by the Communist \nParty, there are\u0014\npossibly five times as many who participate in underground churches. \n(Also, some 5\u0014\nmillion Roman Catholics attend state-authorized churches, and, by \nVatican estimates,\u0014\ntwice that number attend underground ones.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christianity, like Falun Gong, resonates with \npeople for whom Communist ideology has no more hold. For those whose \nsecurity has broken down, faith in                 \nsomethinganythingfulfills a real need. \"If we do not spread the \ngospel, other  ideologies will take over,\" says one 30-year-old \nevangelist who has taken the name  Daniel. \"We want not only a person \nbut a city, a country, transformed by Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The transformation begins in this room of \nfarmers with wind-burned but radiant faces. They stand up one by one, \nweaving their way through the crowd to belt out what sounds\u0014\nlike traditional Chinese folk tunes but are actually improvised \nversions of Christian hymns.\u0014\nThe sermon is about overcoming adversity, and they read along in \nbattered Bibles carefully covered with plastic bags. They are risking \ntheir lives to be here, having chosen  not to attend an official \nchurch, which would require ultimate allegiance not to God but to the \nCommunist Party. \"The authorities are very afraid of these groups \nright now  because they are not willing to obey,\" says Kwok Nai-Wong, \na retired minister based in Hong Kong. \"If you ask them to register, \nthey refuse. If you harass them, they have more martyrs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Migration evangelism. The worshipers belong to \na 5 million-strong church group that began in central Henan province, \nbreeding ground for many house church movements.\u0014\nUnlike some of the meetings in big cities, which have single \ncongregations but do not\u0014\nexpand, this group, like most other rural ones, has been aggressively \nforming nationwide\u0014\nnetworks. Preachers are trained quickly and then start their own \nchurches in other villages\u0014\nor provinces. Some practice \"migration evangelism\" by moving couples \nto remote\u0014\nprovinces to live as businesspeople while trying to influence their \nneighbors, often ethnic\u0014\nminorities. \"These groups are much more dynamic, fast-growing, and \norganized than the\u0014\nestablished urban churches,\" says Jonathan Chao, president of the \nTaiwan-based\u0014\nresearch center China Ministries International. \"The government does \nnot mind\u0014\ngrass-roots worship too much. What it minds is leadership training, \nbecause these\u0014\nevangelists are then sent out and act as agents of growth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The command center for one band of these \nChristian warriors is a small apartment in southern China. One room \nholds bunk beds for visiting missionaries. Another has a\u0014\nheavy-duty computer, printer, and copier, surrounded by boxes of \ncopied books waiting to\u0014\nbe distributed, with names like \"100 Lessons in Biblical Truth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Squeezed together on plastic stools are two \ndozen young evangelists. They are the third  generation of leaders, \nand some have traveled for hours to come meet visiting American\u0014\npastors. They talk about personal conversion experiences, but the \ndiscussion quickly turns\u0014\npolitical. \"The only real hope is to let Christians change the \ncountrynot by revolution,\u0014\nbut by the changing of hearts and institutions in society. Once we \nhave Christian lawyers,\u0014\nteachers, postal workers, this will lead to the Christianization of \nChinese culture, which\u0014\nwill lead to democracy,\" declares Rebecca, a 32-year-old evangelist \nwho has already\u0014\nconverted over 1,000 people. \"We have to be as good at infiltration \nas the Communists\u0014\nwere in the 1930s.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The parallels to the Communist Party do not \nstop there. The organization of many of\u0014\nthese groups, from a central committee down to local cells, closely \nresembles that of the\u0014\nparty. Sam, a pale 44-year-old church leader, carries a mobile phone \nthat rings every\u0014\nhalf hour. He whispers into it, using code words to tell other \nleaders what he is doing. They talk every day, from all over the \ncountry, and change their phone numbers every\u0014\nmonth to avoid being detected. Last year six church groups, with an \nestimated total of\u0014\nover 16 million members, began jointly publishing a quarterly \njournal, financed by a\u0014\nTaiwanese businessman. Four times a year, the heads hold a summit. \n\"These leaders\u0014\ncould mobilize over a million people in one place,\" says Chao. \"They \nare so organized, it would take just a word. That is why the \ngovernment is so alarmed.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Foreign aid. It would mind even more if it knew \nthe extent of foreign sponsorship. After one meeting, a regional \nleader holds whispered consultations in a taxi with a visiting\u0014\nAmerican pastor. \"We really need $2,500 to build a meeting hall,\" she \nsays. \"We have\u0014\nthousands of people who would come if we had the space, but now we \nmust divide into\u0014\nsmaller groups.\" This missionary has been coming into China regularly \nfor the past 20\u0014\nyears to meet with house church leaders, to conduct training \nsessions, and to distribute\u0014\nmoney. He also brings books, videos, and film used to print training \nmaterials and Bibles.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Twice a year, he brings along other foreign \npastors, under cover as businessmen,\u0014\nteachers, or tourists. \"China is seen as a part of the Christian \nchurch that's exploding and really needs some assistance in \nleadership development and financial resources,\" says one American \ntouring the underground projects his church has helped fund. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      One experience that has come to be regarded as \nan integral part of the training is arrest  and torture in a labor \ncamp. Shao Zhixiu, a woman with thick, wind-burned lips, twists her\u0014\ngnarled hands together in her lap as she describes her 23-year-old \ndaughter's arrest last\u0014\nOctober. She was sent to the notorious \"18-Mile River\" labor camp in \nHenan province,\u0014\nwhere she was beaten and forced to undergo daily interrogations, \nwrite confessions, and\u0014\nmake wigs, sticking in the hairs strand by strand. If she did not \ncomplete two wigs a day,\u0014\nher sentence was extended. \"I've only seen her once, to bring her \nsome clothes,\" says\u0014\nShao. \"I could see she was badly beaten, but she wouldn't admit it \nbecause she didn't\u0014\nwant me to worry.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sam, the leader who has spent years in that \ncamp, chuckles brusquely at Shao's misery and tells her to get used \nto it. \"We were stripped naked and made to sit outside in the\u0014\nfreezing cold while we were interrogated for three days and three \nnights straight,\" he\u0014\nsays. \"But suffering is beneficial to usit tests our faith and our \nlove.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While underground church leaders have been \narrested and harassed for decades, the government's crackdown on \nFalun Gong has altered the atmosphere of persecution.\u0014\nRecent arrests show a widening dragnet, but in some places the focus \non Falun Gong has\u0014\neased pressure on Christians. In some cases, local police know about \narea churches but\u0014\nraid them only when they need some quick cash through fines. Allen \nYuan, pastor of a\u0014\nhouse church in Beijing, has held mass baptisms in a public lake \nevery year. Last year, it\u0014\nattracted over 300 peopleand the authorities. \"But they took one \nlook, said, 'Oh, you're\u0014\nnot Falun Gong,' and left,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the green hills of southern China, an \nimposing building stands with a magnificent view of the countryside, \nlooking very much like a military outpost. It has been built mostly \nwith money from a church in California, and though it is empty now, \nlater this year it will house the first class of secret seminary \nstudents. They will have classes taught by local\u0014\nand foreign pastors, and at the end of the course they will be able \nto staff seven regional\u0014\nunderground seminaries for high school graduates. At least according \nto this missionary's\u0014\nSix-Year Plan. \"When the political situation changes, we'll build a \nseminary on a\u0014\nhundred acres of land. Then we'll have 10,000 applicants, and only be \nable to take a\u0014\nthousand.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But, for now, they are just praying. They cover \ntheir faces with their hands, murmuring between heavy sighs. And then \nthey sing. \"As a prodigal I have no place to go. I will go to my \nfather's place. I will rise up and go to the father. . . . \"\u0014",

    "words": "Creating a Singles-Friendly Sermon\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How to preach to 40 percent of today's adults. \u0014\n                      by Susan Maycinik \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For me and for many singles I've talked to, \nSunday morning can be the loneliest time of the week. Why? Because we \nsee church as a couples' and families' world. Sermons, announcements, \neven the way Sunday school classes and small groups are structured \ncan communicate that we're not part of the program. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet singles make up 40 percent of the U.S. \nadult population. We are the fastest-growing population group. How, \nthen, can you be sure your church welcomes single adults? The good \nnews is that the most significant ways don't require a program or a \nbudget. But they may require a change in perspective. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Listen and ask questions\u0014\n        \u0014\n           David Fisher, pastor of Colonial Church of Edina \n(Minnesota) began learning about the single life today when he was \nasked to preach a sermon called \"Single and Happy.\" To prepare, he \nasked questions of singles he knew: \"What does it feel like to be a \nsingle person in a world that's mostly married? How can I describe \nthat to someone else?\" He says, \"I had to learn to listen with ears \nthat weren't normal for me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dan Yeary, pastor at North Phoenix Baptist \nChurch, encourages pastors to gather ten to twelve singles and ask \npointed questions: \"How can I preach for you? What's the church doing \nthat's helping you, and what could it be doing? Singles will perceive \nthat you care and feel a sense of ownership in the church because \nthey've been given a fair hearing.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As you're talking to singles, be sure to seek \nout people of different ages who are single for different reasons. \nThe issues and needs important to a single 23-year-old can be vastly \ndifferent from those of a still-single 39-year-old, or of someone \nwhose marriage ended in divorce, or of a widow. Singles with children \nwill have different concerns from those without kids, or those whose \nchildren are grown. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Use language carefully\u0014\n                       \u0014\n                      Like everyone, single adults want to be \nacknowledged and valued. Yet in some churches, language from the \npulpit assumes every adult is married. Illustrations are drawn \nprimarily from marriage and family relationships. Women are referred \nto exclusively as wives and mothers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A simple change in wording can draw immense \ngratitude from your single members. If your sermon application \nconcerns close relationships, refer to \"roommates and friends\" as \nwell as \"spouses and children.\" When speaking about households in the \ncongregation, say \"families and individuals\" instead of just \n\"families.\" Instead of \"family picnic,\" announce \"an all-church \npicnic.\" You'll show unmarried adults that you know they're there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By varying illustrations, you communicate that \nthe various forms of single life are normal and as valid as marriage. \nLon Solomon, pastor of MacLean Bible Church in Virginia, says, \"I'm \nalways asking, How can I make sure at least some examples I use are \nunique for singles?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many statements meant to encourage families \nsubtly communicate that single life is second-best. The speaker at a \nchurch women's retreat declared, \"God's highest calling for a woman \nis to be a wife and mother.\" The speaker could have affirmed moms, \nyet avoided injuring the unmarried and childless, by saying, \"One of \nGod's highest callings is to be a wife and mother.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As you talk about divorce from the pulpit, be \nsensitive to the fact that some in the congregation are single \nagainmany not by choice. Ask yourself as you prepare a sermon, \"If I \nwere divorced, would I feel condemned or rejected if I heard this \nstatement? Have I implied that a divorced person is a lesser child of \nGod? Have I balanced my charge to stay married with the \nacknowledgment that people fail and that God offers forgiveness for \nall types of sin?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      What my pastor communicates\u0014\n                                   about marriage and singleness can \u0014\n                                    profoundly affect how I see \nmyself. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Keep statements biblical\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In movies, music, and family reunions, \nChristian singles hear the message, \"You're nobody till somebody \nloves you.\" Even in church, marriage is often seen as the norm, a \nkind of passage to adulthood. Children and young people hear, \"When \nyou get married and have a family,\" not if. Single adults hear, \n\"You're such a nice person. I don't understand why you're not \nmarried.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This mindset is more reflective of a culture \nthat exalts romance than of Scripture. The Bible honors marriage, but \nit gives an equal (or, arguably, higher) place to the single life. \nConsider Paul's teaching about marriage in 1 Corinthians 7, which \ncomes far from exalting marriage as the ideal. The best thing Paul \ncan say about marriage is, \"If you do marry, you have not sinned\"! \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The whole congregationsingles, couples, and \nparents of future single adultsneeds to hear that according to \nScripture, staying single is often preferable. It takes courage to \npromote this countercultural but thoroughly biblical view. Jesus and \nPaul were single adults, as were many other Bible leaders. Scripture \nshows and teaches that marriage is optional, not inevitable. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Choose topics for all\u0014\n                      \u0014\n                      Most singles expect to hear a family-oriented \nsermon now and then. But a five-week or three-month series on \nmarriage and family issues gives singles the message: \"This church is \nnot for you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If marriages or families need special \nattention, consider teaching a Sunday school class or weekend \nseminar. Or preach more broadly on related topics such as love and \nforgiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As a single adult, I have seen that what my \npastor communicates about marriage and singleness can profoundly \naffect how I see myself.

    "words": "Cellular Divide\u0014\n\u0014\nHarvested from embryos, stem cells may cure Alzheimers, Parkinsons \nand a host of other diseases. But now the cells are at the heart of a \nwar pitting pro-life purists against research\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Sharon Begley\u0014\nNEWSWEEK\u0014\n\u0014\nJuly 9 issue  Theyre not much to look at, really. To see the cells \nof a four-day human embryo, you stain them with a few drops of dye, \nslip them under a 20- to 40-magnification microscope and peer through \nthe eyepiece. There they are: a hollow sphere of roundish balls, \nsnuggled up against each other like sticky blueberries, pollen grains \nor vibrant red raspberry drupelets (depending on which stain you \nused). The 40 or so cells that constitute the embryo look a little \nfuzzy, dusty even, as if they had been rolling around on a dirty \nfloor. But that, of course, is only the beginning of what you see.\u0014\n\u0014\nIF YOU ARE a passionate right-to-life activist, you see in the cells \nan incipient human life, one deserving all the rights and respect of \nany other human, chief among those the right not to be destroyed and \nnot to be used as a means to an end. If, though, you suffer from a \ncurrently incurable disease like Parkinsons or Alzheimers, or love \nsomeone who does, then those cells look very different: they look \nlike the seeds of hope, tiny miracles able to dance on the head of a \npin.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn those two clashing views lie the makings of the latest embryo war. \nThis time, its not about abortion: the embryos whose cells, called \nstem cells, hold the promise of treating often fatal illnesses come \nnot from clinics where pregnancies end but from those where they \nbegin: in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers, which fuse sperm with \neggs in a petri dish, and where spare embryos, too numerous to \nimplant in the womb of the would-be mother, are otherwise discarded. \nEven though stem cells do not come from aborted fetuses (which are \ndefined as older than nine weeks, with a shape and incipient organs), \nthe moral and theological issues inherent in using human embryos in \nresearch press the same hot buttons. As a result the White House, \nwhich hoped it had done its right-to-life duty by pulling financial \nsupport for organizations that offer abortion counseling overseas and \nby supporting every piece of pro-life legislation introduced in \nCongress, has been dragged into the heart of an issue it very much \nhoped to avoid. \u0014\n\u0014\nBUSHS STANCE\u0014\nSometime in the coming weeks, President George W. Bush is expected to \ndecide whether to allow federal funding for research on stem cells \ntaken from human embryos (see related story). So far, he has remained \ntrue to his campaign stance opposing the research. In February he \nordered a review of the Clintonian compromise under which federal \nmoney could be used to conduct such research, but not to obtain the \nembryonic cells in the first place. And this spring the \nadministration canceled the inaugural meeting of a National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) committee that was to review applications \nfor federal grants to study human embryonic stem cells. As long as \nBush puts off a decision, the status quounder which the research has \ncome to a virtual standstill except in labs funded by biotech firms \nand other private moneywill continue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat infuriates an awful lot of politicians as well as ordinary folks \nwho have decided that pro-life need not mean no stem-cell \nresearch. In recent polls, 57 percent of abortion opponents have \nsaid they support embryonic stem-cell research. So have 72 percent of \nRoman Catholics. Sen. Orrin Hatch, as anti-abortion as they come, \nargues that a frozen embryo stored in a refrigerator in a clinic \njust isnt the same as a fetus developing in a mothers womb. \nFormer Florida senator Connie Mack, a pro-life Catholic and a \nRepublican, has broken with his church and his party to support the \nresearch. For me, as long as that fertilized egg is not destined to \nbe placed in a uterus, it cannot become life, he says. But it can, \nperhaps, bestow life. Anyone who would ban research on embryonic \nstem cells will be responsible for the harm done to real, alive, \npostnatal, sentient human beings who might be helped by this \nresearch, argues biologist Irv Weissman of Stanford University. \nOpponents are sacrificing these people to keep from destroying \nembryos in fertility-clinic freezers that will be thrown out anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe cells that make up days-old embryos embody a world of potential. \nFour days after fertilization, the embryo is a hollow ball of cells \ncalled a blastocyst. Cells in the outer layer are destined to become \nthe placenta. Those in the inner layer have not yet decided what they \nwill be when they grow up: they are pluripotent, able to \ndifferentiate into any of the 220 cell types that make up a human \nbody, from the kidney, heart and liver to the skin, neuronal and \npancreatic. These are the famous embryonic stem cells. For a few \nshort days they are blank slates waiting for destiny (or the complex \ninterplay of genes and biochemistry) to write their future.\u0014\n\u0014\nASTOUNDINGLY VERSATILE\u0014\nAnd that is the source of their power. A decade ago research on lab \nanimals revealed that stem cells taken from animal embryos are \nastoundingly versatile. They grow in the lab, proliferate like \nrabbits and turn into specialized cells such as neurons. But no one \nhad turned the same trick with human cells. Then, in November 1998, \nresearchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and at Johns \nHopkins University announced that they had independently cultured \nstem cells taken from human embryos. In particular, they had stopped \nhuman embryonic stem cells from differentiating and, instead, kept \nthem merrily growing in lab dishes while maintaining their \npluripotency. It was as if someone had fired the starters pistol. \nThe next month John Gearhart, the lead Hopkins scientist, testified \nbefore Congress that embryonic stem cells might one day treat \nAlzheimers disease, Huntingtons disease, stroke and spinal-cord \ninjury, as well as diabetes and muscular dystrophies: in each case, \nstem cells would be coaxed to turn into the appropriate cell and \ntransplanted into a patient. By last December, Gearhart and Geron \nCorp., which funds his work, had figured out how to turn human \nembryonic stem cells into 10 kinds of cells, including heart muscle, \nskin cells and the immune systems T cells. Last week they were up to \n110. We have the technology to make infinite quantities of literally \nall cellular tissue in the body, says Geron CEO Dr. Thomas Okarma. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne early hopethat embryonic stem cells could be used to seed organ \nfarms, growing livers, hearts and other body partsis fizzling, \nhowever. Organs have intricate structures, with ducts and valves \neverywhere, and so will probably be tough to grow outside a body. \nStem cells transplanted into a patient, however, are another story. \nIn the two years since the discovery that human stem cells can be \ngrown in the lab, their potential has only expanded, according to the \nNIH. Injecting stem cells into a liver could produce new liver cells, \nrejuvenating an organ decimated by cirrhosis or hepatitis. Stem-cell \ntherapy might cure rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis by \nreplacing wrecked cartilage; it could supply new skin to treat \nlife-threatening burns. Stem cells coaxed to produce cardiac muscle \ncells could replace cells damaged by chronic heart disease. It is \nnot unrealistic to say that [stem cell] research has the potential to \nrevolutionize the practice of medicine, says Dr. Harold Varmus, \nformer NIH director. How soon? Okarma guesses that clinical trials in \nwhich cells grown from human embryonic stem cells are implanted into \npatients are at least three years away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe NIH, the chief supporter of biomedical research in the United \nStates, has yet to award grants for studies using human embryonic \nstem cells. Some research is underwayWisconsin has shipped its cells \nto some 30 research groupsbut it is all privately funded, and \ntherefore subject to minimal government oversight. Several \nresearchers have told NEWSWEEK that since spare embryos are often \ninferior, and thus might not harbor healthy stem cells, some biotech \nfirms are recruiting anonymous gamete donors to provide sperm or \neggs. The former fertilize the latter. Presto: embryos to order, and \nto harvest stem cells from. The Biotechnology Industry Organization \nsays it is unaware that any company is creating embryos in order to \nexperiment on them. Another problem is that private companies are \nmore likely than academics to hide their failures. And any therapies \nthey develop, warns Dr. Evan Snyder of Harvard University, will be \nexceedingly more expensive than you get with federally funded \nresearch.\u0014\nGOOD FOR HUMANS?\u0014\nSo far, stem cells have proved a godsend to rats and mice, at least. \nTransplants of embryonic stem cells have enabled animals that \nsuffered spinal-cord injuries to move their legs and partially \nsupport their body weight: the stem cells, taking a cue from their \nnew surroundings, morphed into neurons. The cells have enabled rats \nthat suffered strokes in the brains motor cortex to move again: the \ncells home in on the lesion, mature into neurons and form the \nconnections necessary for movement. Rats with the rodent versions of \nAlzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (Lou Gehrigs disease) improved somewhat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a big surprise, scientists have discovered that even cells that \nseemed irrevocably committed to one job were capable of a midlife \ncareer switch. They have long known that many kinds of tissue include \nadult stem cells whose job it is to produce more cells of that kind: \nadult liver stem cells give rise to liver cells, adult skin stem \ncells give rise to skin, and so on. The cell divides, producing one \ndifferentiated cell (skin, say) and one stem cell, thus maintaining \nits biological seed corn. But lately, multipotent adult stem \ncellscapable of turning into more than one kind of cellhave been \npopping out all over. In mice, adult bone-marrow cells have produced \nneurons, liver cells, lung cells and gastrointestinal cells. When \nimplanted into the hearts of mice that had suffered heart attacks, \nadult stem cells from bone marrow developed into cardiac cells and \nreplaced damaged tissue. Last August, Ira Black of the Robert Wood \nJohnson Medical School reported that he had gotten bone-marrow stem \ncells from rats, which ordinarily become muscle, fat, tendons, \nligaments or cartilage, to become neurons instead; implanted into rat \nbrains, the cells survived and formed functional connections. This \noverturns long-hallowed dogma, says Black. We can induce adult stem \ncells to become novel cell types, such as neurons.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf human stem cells are equally versatile, it raises the possibility \nthat all of us are harboring the seeds of our own self-renewal, says \nBlack. Last autumn, researchers announced that stem cells in human \nbone marrow had been transformed into neuronal cells. Adult blood \nstem cells seem able to spawn both brain and bone cells. Stem cells \nfrom one tissue, like bone marrow, can actually be reprogrammed into \ncells that can repopulate muscle or brain, says Dr. Jeffrey Leiden, \nwho recently left Harvard to become chief scientific officer for \nAbbott Laboratories. That was completely unexpected, and it really \nopened up the number of diseases that can be treated by using adult \nstem cells. Humans also have adult blood stem cells, liver stem \ncells, neuronal stem cells and the likeall able to produce only that \nkind of cell but, still, produce it they do. There are lots of \nstudies, with more coming out, showing that you can take cells from \none part of the body, grow them in culture, transplant them to \nanother part of the body, and they turn into cells of that part of \nthe body, says biologist Fred Gage of the Salk Institute.\u0014\n\u0014\nCRAP SCIENCE? \u0014\nTo opponents of using embryos, this ends the debate. Why kill \nanybody, as Sen. Sam Brownback put it, referring to stem cells from \nIVF embryos, when you can instead tap into willing adults with hardly \nmore fuss than drawing blood? But adult stem cells may not live up to \ntheir name. They seem to proliferate more slowly than the embryonic \nones, and so might not provide an ever-renewing source of new cells \nto replace those lost to, say, arthritis. Also, the studies on human \nadult stem cells may be flawed, says Gage. One biologist even calls \nthem crap science: although scientists think they induced \nbone-marrow cells to become brain or bone cells, in fact precursor \ncells of those tissues might have been present in the bone marrow all \nalong. No paper shows definitively any adult stem cell in humans \nturning into anything else, says Stanfords Weissman. Looked at \ncarefully, a lot of the claims have fallen apart. Last month, in \nfact, Margaret Goodell of Baylor College of Medicine backed away from \nher 1999 claim that she induced human muscle stem cells to become \nblood cells. Its baloney that adult stem cells are all we need to \nmake regenerative medicine real, says Okarma. A new NIH report \nconcludes that embryonic stem cells may be superior to the adult \nvariety.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich is why scientists covet the six or so colonies of human \nembryonic stem cells growing in labs around the world, says Dr. James \nThomson, whose Wisconsin lab started one of the first colonies. These \nlines might provide endless quantities of stem cells, obviating the \nneed to harvest more embryos. You can imagine a system where you \ndont have to keep going back to embryos, says Harvards Snyder. But \nuntil enough such cell lines are established, Thomson says, if the \ndestiny of embryos at IVF clinics is to be thrown out, and couples \nare willing to donate them to research instead, its hard for me to \nbelieve that throwing them out is a better ethical decision. \u0014\nWe have more questions than answers about the medical benefits of \nembryonic stem cells, either as the salvation of people with \nincurable diseases or as sources of knowledge about tragedies like \nbirth defects. (Gearharts original motivation for establishing a \nline of human embryonic stem cells was to discover what goes so wrong \nin a fetus as to cause Down syndrome.) It may indeed turn out that \ndoctors will be able to work therapeutic magic with stem cells \nderived from adults. And it may turn out that embryonic stem cells \nwill fall short of their promise. But we wont know either of those \nif American research on embryonic cells remains effectively off \nlimits. That may be the most tragic consequence of squelching what \nis, more than anything, a quest for knowledge. We simply dont know \nhow embryonic cells might help people who are suffering and dying \ntoday. By banning the research, we uphold the most extreme view of \nthe sanctity of life, but at a price: foreclosing the possibility of \ndoing all we can to improve the lot of the living.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith Andrew Murr in Los Angeles, Erika Check in San Francisco and \nAdam Rogers in Washington     2001 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

    "words": "Crime, Christianity & Early America   by Austin Kline\u0014\n                       Written: September 02, 1999\u0014\n\u0014\n                       A number of my recent articles have been \ndirectly or indirectly\u0014\n                       related to the increasing number of people in \nAmerica who have\u0014\n                       been claiming that America would be less \nviolent if religion played\u0014\n                       a stronger role in the daily lives of its \ncitizens. I have questioned\u0014\n                       this claim on a number of different levels, \nbut this week I'd like to\u0014\n                       take a slightly different tact.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       As leaders and pundits of the religious right \nare fond of pointing\u0014\n                       out, there was a time in America's history \nwhen religion did play a\u0014\n                       greater role in the lives of American \ncitizens. Unfortunately, it\u0014\n                       wasn't quite the role which is commonly \nassumed. At the time of\u0014\n                       the American Revolution, only about 14% of the \npopulation was\u0014\n                       \"churched,\" which is to say that only that \namount went to church\u0014\n                       on a regular basis. For private citizens, \nthen, religion did not play\u0014\n                       as strong a role as modern religious leaders \nwould have us\u0014\n                       believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       However, it is nevertheless true that many \nmore of the laws at the\u0014\n                       time reflected a distinctly Christian bias. \nAmerica was not very\u0014\n                       diverse in any sense, especially religiously. \nAlthough some\u0014\n                       colonial governments forbade compulsory \nreligion, the day-to-day\u0014\n                       legal reality was different. The federal \nconstitution later also\u0014\n                       mandated a certain amount of government \nneutrality towards\u0014\n                       religion, but that was rarely followed in \npractice. So we have\u0014\n                       before us a rather good opportunity to examine \nwhat it was like\u0014\n                       when Christian morals and Christian \nassumptions dominated the\u0014\n                       legal landscape, even though regular adherence \nto organized\u0014\n                       Christianity was not as strong as it is today. \nWhat was it like? Is it\u0014\n                       something that America - or indeed any modern \nnation - should\u0014\n                       aspire to?\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Dominance of Religion\u0014\n\u0014\n                       As previously stated, the legal context of the \nAmerican colonies\u0014\n                       was dominated by specifically religious \nassumptions. It is\u0014\n                       important to understand that colonial life was \npredominantly\u0014\n                       village life - people lived in insular rural \nsettings where a few\u0014\n                       powerful ideas about God, social order and \npunishment held\u0014\n                       sway. Concepts of hierarchy and subordination \nalso played\u0014\n                       strong roles, and they will become recurring \nthemes here.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       We must also keep in mind that although \nEnglish common law\u0014\n                       played a role in colonial criminal justice, \nthe worldview and\u0014\n                       ideology of colonial leaders influenced ideas \nof justice in profound\u0014\n                       ways. Laws and legal customs tended to mirror \nwhat leaders and\u0014\n                       magistrates thought about the nature of what \nwas good, true and\u0014\n                       right. And for a long time, those elites were \nlargely religious\u0014\n                       leaders - obvious examples being the Puritans \nin Massachusetts\u0014\n                       and the Quakers in Pennsylvania. Distinct \nlegal cultures were\u0014\n                       thus created in the colonies - although most \nstrikingly in the\u0014\n                       Puritan north.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The common people may have been mostly \nunchurched, but the\u0014\n                       leaders were explicitly religious in their \norientation. Although many\u0014\n                       people came to the colonies in search of \neconomic opportunities,\u0014\n                       many others - including those who would go on \nto lead some of\u0014\n                       the colonies - were looking for new ways to \nserve God, create a\u0014\n                       godly paradise, and build a new society which \nwould be based on\u0014\n                       what they considered the word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       It isn't a coincidence that modern religious \nleaders and politicians\u0014\n                       who pander to the religious right explicitly \nclaim that they are after\u0014\n                       the same thing. The early colonial leaders \nlooking to build godly\u0014\n                       societies quite simply failed - forces beyond \ntheir control, like\u0014\n                       technology and the brute physical facts of the \ncontinent -\u0014\n                       eventually undid them. But despite this modern \nfundamentalists\u0014\n                       and evangelicals are inheritors of the same \nreligious traditions, so\u0014\n                       they are aiming for similar goals. They aren't \naware that history\u0014\n                       passed their ideology by about 200 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Religion and Crime\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Legal codes in the colonies - and especially \nin the Puritan north -\u0014\n                       served as enforcement arms of religious \northodoxy. For this\u0014\n                       reason, the codes themselves cannot be \nunderstood without also\u0014\n                       understanding the basic religious doctrines \nunderlying them. It\u0014\n                       cannot be ignored even for a minute that the \ncolonial system of\u0014\n                       justice - designed largely to achieve a more \ngodly society - was\u0014\n                       almost entirely paternalistic in nature. In a \npaternal society, the\u0014\n                       community is modeled after the ideal of a \npatriarchal household.\u0014\n                       Community leaders acted as stern fathers to \nthe children God\u0014\n                       had entrusted to their care. Members of the \ncommunity were\u0014\n                       supposed to be taught God's paths for their \nlives and brought\u0014\n                       back into the fold when they strayed - but the \nrod was not spared.\u0014\n                       Courts, like fathers, existed to enforce \ndiscipline and obedience.\u0014\n                       This image of family and government are not \ntoo far off from what\u0014\n                       modern evangelical leaders like to preach.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                And while magistrates \nand\u0014\n                                                religious leaders \nmade the laws,\u0014\n                                                the burden of those \nlaws fell\u0014\n                                                almost entirely on \nthe shoulders\u0014\n                                                of the lower classes: \nslaves,\u0014\n                                                servants and \nchildren. Colonial\u0014\n                                                society might have \nbeen less\u0014\n                                                stratified and \nhierarchical than\u0014\n                                                English society, but \nit still had a\u0014\n                                                long way to go. \nOpportunities for\u0014\n                                                advancement existed, \nbut only\u0014\n                                                among white men.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                Even just being a bad \ncitizen\u0014\n                                                was itself a crime. A \nrefusal to\u0014\n                                                conform to the \nstandards of the\u0014\n                                                community meant \nrefusing to\u0014\n                                                conform to the \nstandards of\u0014\n                                                virtue handed down by \nGod.\u0014\n                                                Little or no \ndistinction was made\u0014\n                                                between a \"sin\" and a \n\"crime.\"\u0014\n                                                Piety and religion \ndominated the\u0014\n                                                lives of religious \nleaders, and\u0014\n                                                they in turn \ndominated the lives\u0014\n                                                of other colonists. \nSince religion\u0014\n                                                was the cornerstone \nof the\u0014\n                                                community, especially \nin some\u0014\n                       areas, it became the duty of the law to \nuphold, encourage and\u0014\n                       certainly enforce what was regarded as the One \nTrue Faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Government was regarded as the \"instrument of \nGod on Earth\" -\u0014\n                       and the basic criminal code was not regarded \nas having been\u0014\n                       made by men for men, but made by God for men. \nIt should be\u0014\n                       remembered then that when someone today claims \nthat their\u0014\n                       religion is necessary for the establishment of \na moral and\u0014\n                       peaceful community, they are also calling for \ntheir religion to be\u0014\n                       enforced by the government in the interest of \nmaintaining and\u0014\n                       stabilizing such a community.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Religious Enforcement\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Religious messages of the above sort can be \nfound on almost\u0014\n                       every page of the \"Laws and Liberties of \nMassachusetts\" written\u0014\n                       in 1648. Anabaptists, for example, are \ncondemned as\u0014\n                       \"Incendiaries of Common-wealths & the \nInfectors of persons.\" If\u0014\n                       these misguided miscreants remained \n\"obstinate\" in their heretical\u0014\n                       beliefs, they were likely to be banished from \nthe colony.\u0014\n                       Banishment was a common punishment - when a \nperson's beliefs\u0014\n                       or acts threaten to undermine the social order \nand they refuse to\u0014\n                       repent, then expelling them from the group was \nthe only option.\u0014\n                       The most common reason for banishment was some \nform of\u0014\n                       heresy, described as \"tending to the \nsubversion of the Christian\u0014\n                       Faith and the destruction of the soules of \nmen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Laws against Quakers were even worse than \nthose against\u0014\n                       Anabaptists - they could be executed if they \ndared to return after\u0014\n                       having been banished. Quakers appear to have \nbeen especially\u0014\n                       feared as threatening to \"undermine & ruine\" \nthe properly\u0014\n                       instituted authorities of the colony. Two \nQuakers were made\u0014\n                       examples of and hanged in 1659, but they \nweren't the only ones.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Blasphemy was another crime which merited \nswift and harsh\u0014\n                       punishment - as with the previous examples, \nany act which might\u0014\n                       undermine unquestioning faith as promoted by \nthe local religious\u0014\n                       leaders was regarded as threatening to \nundermine general social\u0014\n                       stability. Blasphemers could, at court \ndiscretion, be put in the\u0014\n                       pillory, whipped, have his tongue bored out \nwith a hot iron, or be\u0014\n                       forced to stand in the gallows with a rope \naround his neck.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Massachusetts was certainly not the only \ncolony to expressly\u0014\n                       prohibit such things. A Virginia statute from \n1699 was designed to\u0014\n                       eliminate \"horrid and Atheisticall principles \ngreatly tending to the\u0014\n                       dishonour of Almighty God, and...destructive \nto the peace and\u0014\n                       wellfaire of this...collony.\" A crime was \ncommitted whenever\u0014\n                       someone dared to deny \"the being of God or the \nholy\u0014\n                       Trinity...assert or maintaine there are more \nGods then one...deny\u0014\n                       the truth of Christianity...\" and much more.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The Sabbath was naturally taken very seriously \nby colonial\u0014\n                       religious leaders. Sundays were reserved for \npraying and church\u0014\n                       attendance, even though church attendance was \ngenerally very\u0014\n                       low across the colony. Obviously this could \nonly be enforced\u0014\n                       effectively either in a village community \nwhere it was obvious that\u0014\n                       people were not in church or in a tightly knit \nreligious area. Most\u0014\n                       rural farmers would be more likely to treat \nSunday like any other\u0014\n                       day, and no one would know otherwise.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Massachusetts, of course, was one place that \nenforcing Sabbath\u0014\n                       laws happened frequently. In Salem in 1668, \nJohn Smith and the\u0014\n                       wife of John Kitchin were fined \"for frequent \nabsenting themselves\u0014\n                       from the public worship of God on the Lord's \nday.\" There's no\u0014\n                       indication if they were absenting church \nservices together and, if\u0014\n                       so, what they may have found to do that was \nmore interesting.\u0014\n                       Profaning the sabbath was also a definite \nno-no. In Boston in\u0014\n                       1656, Captain Kemble was forced to sit in the \nstocks for two hours\u0014\n                       due to \"lewd and unseemly behavior\" on the \nsabbath. His\u0014\n                       transgression consisted of having kissed his \nwife upon his return\u0014\n                       home after three years at sea.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Victimless Crimes\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Since crimes were sins and sins were crimes, \nthe very concept of\u0014\n                       a \"victimless crime\" simply didn't exist back \nthen. This is a concept\u0014\n                       which has been created in the 20th century as \nwe have\u0014\n                       developed the idea of personal privacy. Any \noffense against the\u0014\n                       True God, even if it did not appear to affect \nanyone else, was\u0014\n                       automatically an offense against the community \nand against the\u0014\n                       principle of social order. Such threats had to \nbe dealt with swiftly\u0014\n                       and harshly - God's punishment of Sodom and \nGomorrah was\u0014\n                       ever-present in the minds of religious leaders \nwho feared what\u0014\n                       might happen if they, too, did not work to \nenforce God's moral\u0014\n                       laws. For the Puritans, guilt was corporate in \nnature and so the\u0014\n                       whole group would suffer if even one member \ntransgressed. Only\u0014\n                       by a very public punishment could the group \nboth express\u0014\n                       communal disapproval for the acts and hope to \nescape\u0014\n                       punishment themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       That imagery hasn't faded in the past two \ncenturies and is used\u0014\n                       even today by religious leaders who fear that \ntheir God will punish\u0014\n                       an entire nation when it tolerates individuals \nviolating religious\u0014\n                       rules.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       Legal codes, especially among Puritans, even \nmade criminal\u0014\n                       offenses out of lying and idleness - not to \nmention the ever\u0014\n                       popular fornication, adultery and sodomy. One \ninteresting idea to\u0014\n                       keep in mind when looking at all these laws is \nthe fact that such\u0014\n                       regulations were obviously needed. If the \ncolonists - and\u0014\n                       Puritans in particular - were completely \nsexually repressed and\u0014\n                       obedient robots, there would have been little \nto no need for the\u0014\n                       statutes which I quote. The fact that the \nreligious leaders felt a\u0014\n                       need to explicitly condemn such acts means \nthat at least some\u0014\n                       people were happily engaged in all manner of \nunseemly activities.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The people were obviously quite active \nsexually, although the\u0014\n                       court systems were just as obviously engaged \nin attempting to\u0014\n                       punish and suppress that sexuality. A study by \nWilliam Nelson of\u0014\n                       seven Massachusetts counties between 1760 and \n1774 found\u0014\n                       that almost 38% of all criminal cases involved \nfornication - and\u0014\n                       that wasn't even the only sexual offense \nprosecuted. Although\u0014\n                       most people probably did not transgress or at \nleast not\u0014\n                       transgress too seriously, there was obviously \na lot more going on\u0014\n                       than current evangelical leaders would have \npeople believe. Even\u0014\n                       Puritan New England was perhaps more fun that \nis commonly\u0014\n                       imagined.\u0014",

    "title": "CONFRONTING THE SPIRIT OF FUNDAMENTALISM",
    "words": "Confronting the \nSpirit of Fundamentalism\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Gary Burton\u0014\n\u0014\nThe distilled essence of Fundamentalism in Southern Baptist life is \nmanifested in an attitude, a spirit. Since 1979, the beginning of the \nFundamentalist takeover of the SBC, the climate has changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a Southern Baptist is not what it used to be. While common \nelements can be found among fundamentalist Muslims, Hindus, \nCatholics, and even fundamentalist Jews, it is my intent to address \nthe noxious spirit of the Baptist Fundamentalist movement. Others may \naddress history, doctrine, and personalities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn general, simple terms, what are the signs by which the spirit of \nBaptist Fundamentalism can be recognized?\u0014\n\u0014\nA Diminished View of Holy Scripture\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible has been reduced from a guidebook to a law book. The Funda- \nmentalist approach to the written Word demeans the power, vitality, \nand trustworthiness of the sacred revelation. The Bible has become a \nlegal code that requires defending.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist is quite convinced that the Bible will be \ndestroyed by interpretations that differ from his point of view. \nWhatever happened to Charles Spurgeon's classic maxim: \"The Bible is \nlike a lion. Whoever heard of defending a lion~ Just turn it loose, \nit will defend itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Arrogant Intolerance of Other Viewpoints\u0014\n\u0014\nThat attitude is not just about the Bible, but also about social \nissues, politics, education and missions. The insecurity of the \nFundamentalist will prevent him from saying two things: \"I don't \nknow\" and \"1 could be wrong; you may be right.\" Life in a world of \ncreative tension between varying viewpoints would be insufferable. Be \nprepared. The classic Fundamentalist will demonize those who oppose \nhim by connecting them to laughable, liberal causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Need to Be Angry at Something\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has often been observed that Fundamentalism, by its very nature, \nis religion gone mad. Angry people find a haven in the Fundamentalist \ntent. One must have enemies to combat, even if those adversaries are \ncontrived and exaggerated. The gospel has too much real opposition to \nspend inordinate amounts of energy, purging seminaries of professors \nand making women second-class citizens in the body of Christ. But, \nalas, why fight the devil when we can fight each other?\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Unhealthy View of Leadership\u0014\n\u0014\nAutocratic, obstinate attitudes toward people make their way into the \nleadership styles of Fundamentalist pastors.The manufactured doctrine \nof \"pastoral authority\" allows a church leader to intimidate others \nby invoking religious rhetoric, thus squashing all other opinions. \nForget consensus-building or strategic planning. Why engage in such \nwhen God communicates His will to a pastor who then hands \"down\" his \nvision to laypersons who cannot possibly know the will of God for a \nlocal church like a theologically trained professional?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth: dictatorial pastors might espouse the priesthood of every \nbel iever , but in practice their idea of priesthood is one with a \nhierarchy. Guess who is close to the top~ Control, not empowerment, \nbecomes all consuming.\u0014\n\u0014\nFear and Guilt\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist pastor is a pro at mobilizing people to support \npet causes. Sermons are layered with fear and guilt. Responding out \nof love and gratitude to a positive, inclusive vision will not \ngenerate the quick success for which the insecure pastor longs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe were told that liberals were taking over our seminaries (all of \nthem combined could have met in a phone booth) and pulpits are \nthreatened by large numbers of women who want to run the church. Be \nafraid. Feel guilty. James Madison said, \"Crisis is the rallying cry \nof the tyrant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPurity, Not Redemption\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism is more interested in purging churches, associations, \nand conventions than in the transformation of individuals and culture \nby the power of gospel. In practice, the Fundamentalist definition of \npurity is conformity of thought. Such is the spirit of \nFundamentalism. What can an individual do to confront the \nFundamentalist influence, which is so pervasive in Baptist lifel\u0014\n\u0014\nDo Your Own Thinking\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism must be confronted in the same manner Jesus confronted \nthe Pharisees of his day. Is it possible for religious systems to \nbecome self-serving? Absolutely. It happens over time.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo not allow anyone else to tyrannize your mind with religious \nrhetoric or bombastic opinions. Traditional Baptists have not been \nafraid to think.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecome a Student of the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Fundamentalists study the Scriptures superficially and \nselectively. It is easier to cry \"inerrancy\" or \"infallibility\" than \nit is to expend energy in serious study.\u0014\n\u0014\nMake the journey from intellectual stimulation to courageous \napplication. Study both the \"letter and spirit\" of biblical Truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAvoiding Issues Is Not Christ-like \u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone should be accorded dignity and respect. A mean spirit and a \nnarrow mind must be rejected completely. Fundamentalism will always \nmove into a vacuum of leadership. Responding like\u0014\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\"THE BIBLE IS LIKE A LION. WHOEVER HEARD OF DEFENDING A LION? JUST \nTURN IT LOOSE, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF.\"\u0014\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nChrist when intimidated is hard, but possible. We must be owned by no \none but Jesus Christ, the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nEncourage Your Pastor to Take a Stand\u0014\n\u0014\nMost pastors are uncomfortable with Fundamentalism, but feel there is \nlittle support in the congregation for being a Traditional Baptist.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo pastor wants to hear \"You don't believe the Bible\" or \"You are a \nliberal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSet your pastor free. Deep down pastors know that Fundamentalism is \ndestructive to a church, but it takes courage to stand against an \nestablished religious system laced with Fundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n[FUNDAMENTALISM IS MORE INTERESTED IN PURGING CHURCHES, ASSOCIATIONS, \nAND CONVENTIONS THAN IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND CULTURE \nBY THE POWER OF GOSPEL.]\u0014\n\u0014\nBe Responsible. Educate Yourself\u0014\n\u0014\nA Fundamentalist's Nightmare is an informed and empowered laity. Be \nresponsible. Educate yourself. Resources abound from books to \nwebsites. Our Baptist heritage must be recovered before it is too \nlate. Soon it will take an archaeologist to find a Traditional \nBaptist under layers of encrusted Fundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key to rediscovering what's good and wholesome about being a \nBaptist rests with laypersons. Pastors are afraid and caught in the \ncrossfire of trying to grow a church and being sycophants in a \nreligious system that cannot endure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the times that call for both courage and kindness. Baptists \nemerged on the stage of world history as people of conscience. Don't \nbe afraid to dissent.\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Burton is pastor of Pintlala Baptist Church near Montqomery, A/a.\u0014",

Italy's medical\u0014\n                 code stipulates that medical experimentation\u0014\n                 is allowed only for the prevention and\u0014\n                 correction of medical problems. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But Antinori, director of the Rome's\u0014\n                 International Associated Research Institute,\u0014\n                 told Reuters news agency: \"You can't put up the \nbarriers on therapeutic\u0014\n                 cloning. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Cloning will help us put an end to so many \ndiseases, give infertile men\u0014\n                 the chance to have children. We can't miss this \nopportunity,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Antinori said he would use his speech on Tuesday to \nattack a sweeping\u0014\n                 ban on human cloning approved by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives\u0014\n                 last week. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Safety issues\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The doctor is no stranger to controversy. His Rome \nfertility clinic\u0014\n                 produced a 62-year-old mother of a baby in 1994. Two \nyears he later\u0014\n                 helped a 59-year-old British unmarried mother to \nhave twins. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But leading fertility experts say that human cloning \nstill presents a high\u0014\n                 risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or producing a \ndisabled child. It took 277\u0014\n                 attempts to produce the first cloned sheep, Dolly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Professor Art Caplan, from the University of \nPennsylvania, said the\u0014\n                 clone bid should not be carried out because of the \nsafety implications. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"If you look at the carnage associated with animal \ncloning there is\u0014\n                 probably a ratio of about 290 dead embryos for every \none that goes\u0014\n                 anywhere,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Dr. Zavos and his group have been kind of the \nhigh-flying, showbiz\u0014\n                 operators of cloning. If you look at the animal work \nthat's been done,\u0014\n                 and the people who really know this procedure of \ncloning -- that is,\u0014\n                 veterinarians who try it in animals -- the procedure \nis just not safe,\" he\u0014\n                 said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Though critics have warned that attempts to clone \nanimals have\u0014\n                 resulted in a high rate of ill or deformed clones, \nZavos said, \"We intend\u0014\n                 to do it right or not do it at all.\" He said the \ncouples are aware of the\u0014\n                 risks involved. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"They are willing to take the chance,\" Zavos, a \nformer University of\u0014\n                 Kentucky professor, told CNN. \"They know that the \nchances are not\u0014\n                 even good for them to get pregnant, but that's life. \nSo they are willing to\u0014\n                 be the guinea pig, so to speak. Of course, we don't \nlook at them that\u0014\n                 way.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Anti-abortion groups are outraged by their plans, \nand Antinori has said\u0014\n                 he may be forced to work in a remote country or even \non board a ship\u0014\n                 moored in international waters. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The technique is similar to the one used to produce \nDolly the sheep and\u0014\n                 involves injecting cells from the infertile father \ninto an egg, which is then\u0014\n                 implanted in the mother's uterus. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The resulting child would have the same physical \ncharacteristics as his\u0014\n                 father and infertile parents would not have to rely \non sperm donors.\u0014\n                 Most of the males in the volunteering couples are \ninfertile. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Playing God?\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Washington's human cloning conference, which opened \nTuesday,\u0014\n                 comprises a joint panel of the U.S. National \nAcademies' Committee on\u0014\n                 Science, Engineering Public Policy and the Board of \nLife Sciences. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It will discuss the scientific, medical and ethical \nissues involved in human\u0014\n                 cloning, and also look at the confusion outside the \nscientific community\u0014\n                 on the differences between human cloning and \nembryonic stem-cell\u0014\n                 research. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Ethical and religious groups argue Antinori's team \nand other cloning\u0014\n                 researchers are trying to \"play God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Antinori said he would argue in Washington that \ncloning is not a\u0014\n                 religious question, adding that U.S. President \nGeorge W. Bush was only\u0014\n                 against cloning because \"he listens to the Pope.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The U.S. House of Representatives voted July 31 to \nban all human\u0014\n                 cloning. Last week, Bush said human cloning \npresented profound moral\u0014\n                 issues and said he welcomed the approval of \ncongressional ban as \"a\u0014\n                 strong ethical statement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"We must advance the promise and cause of science \nbut do so in a way\u0014\n                 that honors and respects life,\" Bush said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Legalization predicted\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Meanwhile, European pro-life groups on Monday \npredicted cloning will\u0014\n                 eventually be legalized despite their objections. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Professor Jack Scarisbrick, British national \ndirector of Life, said there\u0014\n                 was \"no doubt whatsoever\" reproductive cloning would \neventually\u0014\n                 become legal in the United Kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"The pressures will be great.

\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Even before the human cloning\u0014\n                 presentation was made, one of the\u0014\n                 scientists was defending his plans. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"They may be calling us mad scientists,\u0014\n                 which of course we're not, but this is very\u0014\n                 important,\" said Zavos, one of the human\u0014\n                 cloning advocates, during in a fiery\u0014\n                 exchange with a colleague who warned that\u0014\n                 the procedure was fraught with danger. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Zavos told CNN that the research team was\u0014\n                 working with 200 infertile couples from \"all\u0014\n                 over.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"We hope that in November we will begin to\u0014\n                 do the nuclear transfer, which in actuality is\u0014\n                 a transfer of the nucleus of a somatic cell, a\u0014\n                 body cell, into the egg of a woman for the\u0014\n                 purpose of establishing an embryo,\" he\u0014\n                 said. \"And that embryo will be transferred\u0014\n                 into the uterus to establish a pregnancy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Zavos would not reveal where the\u0014\n                 experiment would be conducted, but did say\u0014\n                 the United States would not host it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"We are made out of so many cultures that\u0014\n                 it is very difficult to convince all cultures that\u0014\n                 this is a beneficial effort,\" he said. \"The\u0014\n                 United States is a great country but this is\u0014\n                 not the place to be at this time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Strong opposition\u0014\n\u0014\n                 But criticism of the cloning effort has come\u0014\n                 from outside the United States as well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Dr. Ian Wilmut, the man who created Dolly,\u0014\n                 the first cloned sheep, said that society\u0014\n                 should determine how far such technology\u0014\n                 goes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"If society decides that it doesn't like a\u0014\n                 particular thing, it could stop it,\" Wilmut said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Wilmut also questioned the use of cloning to\u0014\n                 aid infertile couples, saying he knew of \"no\u0014\n                 cause of infertility that could only be\u0014\n                 overcome by cloning.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The Italian medical association has already\u0014\n                 launched disciplinary action against\u0014\n                 Antinori, who will participate in the\u0014\n                 experiment with Zavos, for his stated plans,\u0014\n                 which would also violate a Council of Europe\u0014\n                 convention prohibiting human cloning that\u0014\n                 came into force in March. Italy's medical\u0014\n                 code stipulates that medical experimentation\u0014\n                 is allowed only for the prevention and\u0014\n                 correction of medical problems. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But Antinori, director of the Rome's\u0014\n                 International Associated Research Institute,\u0014\n                 told Reuters news agency: \"You can't put up the \nbarriers on therapeutic\u0014\n                 cloning. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Cloning will help us put an end to so many \ndiseases, give infertile men\u0014\n                 the chance to have children. We can't miss this \nopportunity,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Antinori said he would use his speech on Tuesday to \nattack a sweeping\u0014\n                 ban on human cloning approved by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives\u0014\n                 last week. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Safety issues\u0014\n\u0014\n                 The doctor is no stranger to controversy. His Rome \nfertility clinic\u0014\n                 produced a 62-year-old mother of a baby in 1994. Two \nyears he later\u0014\n                 helped a 59-year-old British unmarried mother to \nhave twins. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 But leading fertility experts say that human cloning \nstill presents a high\u0014\n                 risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or producing a \ndisabled child. It took 277\u0014\n                 attempts to produce the first cloned sheep, Dolly. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Professor Art Caplan, from the University of \nPennsylvania, said the\u0014\n                 clone bid should not be carried out because of the \nsafety implications. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"If you look at the carnage associated with animal \ncloning there is\u0014\n                 probably a ratio of about 290 dead embryos for every \none that goes\u0014\n                 anywhere,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"Dr. Zavos and his group have been kind of the \nhigh-flying, showbiz\u0014\n                 operators of cloning.

Of course, we don't \nlook at them that\u0014\n                 way.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Anti-abortion groups are outraged by their plans, \nand Antinori has said\u0014\n                 he may be forced to work in a remote country or even \non board a ship\u0014\n                 moored in international waters. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The technique is similar to the one used to produce \nDolly the sheep and\u0014\n                 involves injecting cells from the infertile father \ninto an egg, which is then\u0014\n                 implanted in the mother's uterus. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The resulting child would have the same physical \ncharacteristics as his\u0014\n                 father and infertile parents would not have to rely \non sperm donors.\u0014\n                 Most of the males in the volunteering couples are \ninfertile. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Playing God?\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Washington's human cloning conference, which opened \nTuesday,\u0014\n                 comprises a joint panel of the U.S. National \nAcademies' Committee on\u0014\n                 Science, Engineering Public Policy and the Board of \nLife Sciences. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 It will discuss the scientific, medical and ethical \nissues involved in human\u0014\n                 cloning, and also look at the confusion outside the \nscientific community\u0014\n                 on the differences between human cloning and \nembryonic stem-cell\u0014\n                 research. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Ethical and religious groups argue Antinori's team \nand other cloning\u0014\n                 researchers are trying to \"play God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Antinori said he would argue in Washington that \ncloning is not a\u0014\n                 religious question, adding that U.S. President \nGeorge W. Bush was only\u0014\n                 against cloning because \"he listens to the Pope.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 The U.S. House of Representatives voted July 31 to \nban all human\u0014\n                 cloning. Last week, Bush said human cloning \npresented profound moral\u0014\n                 issues and said he welcomed the approval of \ncongressional ban as \"a\u0014\n                 strong ethical statement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"We must advance the promise and cause of science \nbut do so in a way\u0014\n                 that honors and respects life,\" Bush said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Legalization predicted\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Meanwhile, European pro-life groups on Monday \npredicted cloning will\u0014\n                 eventually be legalized despite their objections. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Professor Jack Scarisbrick, British national \ndirector of Life, said there\u0014\n                 was \"no doubt whatsoever\" reproductive cloning would \neventually\u0014\n                 become legal in the United Kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"The pressures will be great.

    "words": "Andrew Sullivan, The New York Times Review of \nBooks \u0014\n                     \"Remarkable. . . A book of a deeper sort. . .\" \u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine's Sword is a sprawling work of history, theology, and \npersonal confession by\u0014\nJames Carroll (the author of An American Requiem, among many others). \nCarroll begins\u0014\nhis landmark project by describing contemporary Catholic remembrances \nof the Holocaust and the Church's intolerable legacy of hostility \ntowards Jews. He then surveys Catholic\u0014\nanti-Judaism beginning with the New Testament and proceeding through \nthe early Church,\u0014\nthe Crusades, the Inquisition, the Enlightenment, and World War II, \nbefore concluding with\u0014\n\"A Call for Vatican III,\" a Church council that would make meaningful \nrepentance for an\u0014\nentrenched tradition of hatred. Carroll's prescriptions for \nrepentance, continued in a\u0014\npowerful epilogue, are bracingly concrete: \"there is no apology for \nHoly Week preaching\u0014\nthat prompted pogroms until Holy Week liturgies, sermons, and \nreadings have been\u0014\npurged of the anti-Jewish slanders that sent the mobs rushing out of \nchurch....\u0014\n\u0014\nForgiveness for the sin of anti-Semitism presumes a promise to \ndismantle all that makes it\u0014\npossible.\" Carroll's personal reflections as an American Catholic \ninfuse his historical\u0014\nnarrative, and although his reflections are sometimes unnecessarily \ndetailed, they are\u0014\nadmirable for the principle they express: \"I find myself unable to \naccuse my Church of any\u0014\nsin that I cannot equally accuse myself of,\" he writes. Carroll's \njudgments on the Church\u0014\nare rightly harsh, even agonizing. And yet his vision for a future \nrapprochement between\u0014\nChristians and Jews is hopeful, in part because he personally has \ncome to understand the\u0014\ndeep connections between Israel and the Church: \"Jesus offers me, a \nnon-Jew, access to\u0014\nthe biblical hope that was his birthright as a son of Israel.\" \n--Michael Joseph Gross\u0014\n\u0014\nBoston Magazine \u0014\n                     \"Whatever the solution, in the end, \nunsderstanding the conflict is half the battle. It's a\u0014\n                     battle Carroll wins in this historical tome.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Book Description \u0014\n                     In a bold and moving book that is sure to spark \nheated debate, the novelist and cultural\u0014\n                     critic James Carroll maps the profoundly \ntroubling two-thousand-year course of the\u0014\n                     Church's battle against Judaism and faces the \ncrisis of faith it has provoked in his own                           \nlife\u0014\n                     as a Catholic. More than a chronicle of \nreligion, this dark history is the central tragedy of\u0014\n                     Western civilization, its fault lines reaching \ndeep into our culture. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The Church's failure to protest the Holocaust -- \nthe infamous silence of Pius XII -- is only\u0014\n                     part of the story: the death camps, Carroll \nshows, are the culmination of a long,\u0014\n                     entrenched tradition of anti-Judaism. From \nGospel accounts of the death of Jesus on the\u0014\n                     cross, to Constantine's transformation of the \ncross into a sword, to the rise of \nblood                                 libels,\u0014\n                     scapegoating, and modern anti-Semitism, Carroll \nreconstructs the dramatic story of the\u0014\n                     Church's conflict not only with Jews but with \nitself. Yet in tracing the arc of this \nnarrative,                           he\u0014\n                     implicitly affirms that it did not necessarily \nhave to be so. There were roads not taken,\u0014\n                     heroes forgotten; new roads can be taken yet. \nDemanding that the Church finally face this\u0014\n                     past in full, Carroll calls for a fundamental \nrethinking of the deepest questions \nof                                      Christian\u0014\n                     faith. Only then can Christians, Jews, and all \nwho carry the burden of this history begin to\u0014\n                     forge a new future. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Drawing on his well-known talents as a \nstoryteller and memoirist, and weaving historical\u0014\n                     research through an intensely personal \nexamination of conscience, Carroll has created a\u0014\n                     work of singular power and urgency. \nCONSTANTINE'S SWORD is a brave and affecting\u0014\n                     reckoning with difficult truths that will touch \nevery reader. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     About the Author \u0014\n                     Born in Chicago in 1943 and raised in \nWashington, D.C., where his father was an Air\u0014\n                     Force general and the director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, James Carroll was\u0014\n                     educated at Washington's Priory School and at an \nAmerican high school in Wiesbaden,\u0014\n                     Germany.

    "words": "Sadly Child Abuse Is Not \nSo Rare\u0014\n\u0014\nBOB GREENE\u0014\nGRAND ISLAND. NEBRASKA  8/16/01 .\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes it seems there is no end to this. \u0014\n\u0014\nJamie G. Henry, 24, recently pleaded no contest to two felony charges \nthat stemmed from the torture of his 8-year-old stepson and \nfive-year-old daughter with an electrified cattle prod meant to shock \n2,000 bulls into obedience.  In exchange for the plea, Hall County \nprosecutors agreed to drop six other felony charges, each arising \nfrom Henry's alleged beating of the children.\u0014\n\u0014\nSentencing is scheduled for September 24, but sheriff's officers and \nprosecutors told us that a continuing investigation into other areas \nof the alleged abuse by Henry and his wife, Billie D. Henry, 25, may \nlead to new charges before that date.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, another appalling case of the mistreatment of children is \nunfolding in this same largely rural county. The heartbreaking thing \nabout these cases is not that they are rare, or even unusual--the \nheartbreaking thing is that the torture and forced confinement of \nchildren is, if not routine in the U,S., then at least so common that \npolice and child protective workers encounter it on a regular \nbasis.What should be shocking is instead matter-of-fact.\u0014\n\u0014\nHERE IN HALL County, Robert G. Burkhardt, Jr. 32, has been charged \nwith cruelly punishing a 6-year-old boy. Additional charges of \nBurkhardt's mistreatment of a 4-year-old-girl and a 19-month-old girl \nwere dismissed by a Hall County judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to court testimony at a preliminary hearing, the 6-year-old \nboy-the son of Burkhardt's girlfriend, Brenda West, 27 -had cigarette \nburns on his back and significant bruising on his upper buttocks. His \nankles bore the remnants from where Burkhardt had allegedly taped \nthem together because the child did not obey in a way that satisfied \nBurkhardt.\u0014\n\u0014\n(This kind of punishment was similar to what Jamie Henry allegedly \ndid to his 8-year-old stepson, whose wrists and arms were reportedly \nbound tightly by Henry, and who reportedly was locked outside the \nhouse during winter and tied to a tree while barefoot. These alleged \noffenses against the child were among the charges dropped by Hall \nCounty prosecutors as part of their plea agreement with Henry.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Burkhardt's case, police and children's protective workers said \nhis 4-year-old daughter had dime-sized red marks on her back, and \nbruises on her buttocks. They said the younger girl - also his \ndaughter --had a gash on her forehead; her hair was matted with dried \njuice. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat especially upset police and children's protective workers was \nwhat they saw when the two older children opened their mouths.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir teeth had been rotted down to the nubs of their gums. Carrie \nSheldon, of the Hall County office of the Nebraska Department of \nHealth and Human Services, told us. \"The children had never been \ntaken to a dentist in their lives, and their teeth had just rotted \naway. It hurt them when they tried to eat.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter we removed the children from the house, we took them to a \ndentist. He said it was the worst thing he had ever seen; he said \nthat there was no hope other than to surgically remove the children's \nteeth. The children had to be put to sleep because the dental surgery \nwas so extreme. The boy had 12 of his teeth removed; the girl had 5 \nteeth removed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Hall County Court, Burkhardt--like Jamie Henry--was required to \nmeet no bail requirements. He was released on his own recognizance. \nBail, a Hall County deputy prosecutor told us, is required only for \npeople who are considered to be flight risks, or a danger to the \ncommunity .\u0014\n\u0014\nSOMETIMES it seems as if there is no end. At the Grand Island \nWal-Mart, on a 99-degree afternoon, a man and woman walking near a \npickup truck in the parking lot heard a child's cries.\u0014\n\u0014\nLocked inside the hot truck was an 8-month-old girl, sobbing, pulling \nat her hair, and banging her head. One of the people who had noticed \nthis went into the store and had the owner of the truck paged. No one \nresponded to the page.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the two people used a coat hanger to slip into a crack at the top \nof the truck's window and unlock it. They also called the police.The \nchild was taken to St. Francis Medical Center for treatment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the owner of the truck--the girl's mother--came out of the \nWal-Mart, she was with her three older children. She told police she \nhad forgotten the baby was in the truck.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill this kind of thing ever stop? We will follow the cases of Jamie \nHenry and Robert Burkhardt as they work their way through the justice \nsystem--not because they are so unusual in the U.S., but, sadly, \nbecause they aren't. What are we to think of a nation in which crimes \nlike this are not even considered important enough to be stories \nbeyond the county line?\u0014\n\u0014\n(c) Tribune Media Services\u0014",

Local \nwriters told me the capital\u0014\n                      city has one bookstoreto their knowledge the \nonly bookstore for a\u0014\n                      population of 50 million. They joked that \nMyanmar does not have\u0014\n                      copyright, but \"copy left\": they rely on \nforeigners who leave copies\u0014\n                      behind as their main source of books. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Billboards around town proclaim the \"People's \nDesires\" in\u0014\n                      Stalinesque prose, such as \"Report all stooges \nto the authorities.\" A\u0014\n                      troika runs the country with an iron fist, \nsqueezing life out of the\u0014\n                      economy, stifling religion and the arts, and \ncrushing any moves\u0014\n                      toward democracy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the Nobel Peace \nPrize in 1991, has\u0014\n                      done her best to expose and oppose the \nbrutality of Myanmar's\u0014\n                      rulers. Daughter of a national hero, she lives \nunder house arrest in\u0014\n                      Yangon. Whenever she tries to leave, army \nvehicles blockade her\u0014\n                      car, creating incidents that attract the \ninternational press.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Myanmar I met with representatives of a \nsmall Christian relief\u0014\n                      organization that helps victims of AIDS. By \ntheir estimate, 50,000\u0014\n                      AIDS orphans roam the streets of Myanmar, \nthough the government\u0014\n                      officially denies any problem. Recently the \nrelief workers had visited\u0014\n                      Aung San Suu Kyi, a bold act that risked \nretaliation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Why are you helping these children?\" asked the \nwoman reverentially\u0014\n                      called \"The Lady\" by most Burmese. Aid to the \nneedy helps prop up\u0014\n                      a corrupt regime, she said. They should let \nconditions grow so\u0014\n                      intolerable that citizens would rise up in \nrevolt, or the regime would\u0014\n                      simply collapse.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The relief organization agreed that her \nargument has a certain logic.\u0014\n                      Many South Africans supported international \nsanctions, which\u0014\n                      harmed people in the short term, in hopes that \nthey might eventually\u0014\n                      help liberate them. In Miami, Cuban refugees \nuse the same\u0014\n                      reasoning to oppose economic aid to Castro's \nbeleaguered island.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the end, though, the Christian relief \nworkers could not simply close\u0014\n                      their eyes and sacrifice 50,000 orphans to some \npolitical end.\u0014\n                      Through orphanages, clinics, and adoptive \nfamilies, they are meeting\u0014\n                      human needs one at a time, as Christians \nthrough the ages have\u0014\n                      traditionally done.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How Then Should We Live?\u0014\n                      The dilemma in Myanmar got me thinking of \nproblems in a wider\u0014\n                      context. Christians see our world as \ntransitory, infected with evil, and\u0014\n                      destined for destruction. In words from 2 Peter \n3:10, \"The day of the\u0014\n                      Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will \ndisappear with a roar; the\u0014\n                      elements will be destroyed by fire, and the \nearth and everything in it\u0014\n                      will be laid bare.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How should we live in view of such a future? \nThe next verses address\u0014\n                      that very question: \"Since everything will be \ndestroyed in this way,\u0014\n                      what kind of people ought you to be?\" The \nauthor urges his readers\u0014\n                      to \"live holy and godly lives,\" to prepare for \napocalypse by being\u0014\n                      spotless, blameless, and at peace with God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Bible gives us glimpses of the future. Yet \nit tells us to focus on\u0014\n                      behavior in the present, trusting God with the \nbig picture. Some\u0014\n                      Christians I know tend to confuse those two \nperspectives. They\u0014\n                      shrug off destruction of the world's forests \nand pollution of its air and\u0014\n                      waterWon't the whole planet be destroyed, like \nPeter said? In\u0014\n                      Middle East conflicts, they always side with \nIsrael, ignoring\u0014\n                      injustices against the PalestiniansHasn't God \npromised to bless\u0014\n                      his chosen people in the latter days?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such policies confuse our roles with God's. The \nprophets also\u0014\n                      predicted the Crucifixion, but that does not \nmean followers of Jesus\u0014\n                      should have helped nail him to the cross. The \nNew Testament\u0014\n                      speaks of an Antichrist, but I will not \nknowingly vote for him even\u0014\n                      though doing so might hasten the Second Coming. \nThough I have\u0014\n                      some hints about the future, I must live in the \npresent, treating the\u0014\n                      Earth and its people with the same love and \ncare that God invested\u0014\n                      in them at the Creation, acting out my faith \nthat God will someday\u0014\n                      restore it to that graced state.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We take our brightest clue from Jesus, who knew \nbetter than anyone\u0014\n                      the ultimate fate of this planet and described \nit in terrifying detail.\u0014\n                      Nonetheless, he spent his time on Earth healing \nthe sick, raising the\u0014\n                      dead, helping widows and orphans, comforting \nprisoners, ministering\u0014\n                      to the poor. \"Thy will be done on earth as it \nis in heaven,\" Jesus\u0014\n                      taught us to pray, and then proceeded to show \nus exactly what that\u0014\n                      might look like. He showed little concern over \nthe impact his acts of\u0014\n                      compassion might have on the longevity of the \nRoman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014",

As a result, off they \nwent, to disperse their \nvarious                                                   abilities \nand liabilities into the Thoroughbred gene pool. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  History tells us Point Given won't be the last one. \nIt becomes clear that it's almost\u0014\n                  time to say \"goodbye\" as soon as we've learned to \nsay \"hello\" to them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  This disheartening situation was brought into sharp \nfocus for me recently while\u0014\n                  researching a book on one of my old equine heroes, \nRound Table (to be published\u0014\n                  by Eclipse Press in the spring of 2002). He had a \ncareer that today seems almost\u0014\n                  unfathomable. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Round Table raced for four years. He made 66 \nstarts, winning 43. Our last four\u0014\n                  3-year-old champions--I am awarding that title to \nPoint Given in advance of the\u0014\n                  balloting--made fewer starts than Round Table \ncombined (Point Given, 13; Tiznow,\u0014\n                  13 to date; Charismatic, 17; Real Quiet, 20). \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Round Table was in training steadily for almost \nfour years. He sat out four months\u0014\n                  at five with a quarter crack, yet made 14 starts \nthat year, winning nine and \nsetting                                         or equaling five \ntrack records. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  At two, Round Table won five of 10 races; at three, \n15 of 22; and at four, 14 of \n20.                                        He carried 130 pounds or \nmore 25 times, winning 17 times. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  These exploits earned Round Table the 1958 Horse of \nthe Year title, the grass\u0014\n                  championship in three straight years (1957-59), and \nthe handicap horse title in '58.\u0014\n                  Before embarking on a successful stud career at \nClaiborne, Round Table set or\u0014\n                  equaled 16 records--11 on dirt, five on grass. In \none sequence near the end of his\u0014\n                  career, Round Table carried 132 pounds and set an \nAmerican record on turf, then\u0014\n                  two weeks later carried 132 and set a track record \non dirt. Considered in \nthe                                                 context of \ncontemporary runners, this rsum seems to border on the   \u0014\n                  mythological. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  As much as I admired him, I don't believe Point \nGiven can be described as a great\u0014\n                  horse. He never broke a track record, never carried \nmore than 126 pounds, never\u0014\n                  competed in a handicap or faced older horses, and \nonly had 13 career starts. His\u0014\n                  credentials do not qualify him for greatness, which \nto my mind is defined by\u0014\n                  sustained brilliance in testing competition. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The potential for greatness was in Point Given. The \nphysical constitution \nrequired                                         to display that \ngreatness was not. That's what made this tremendously exciting colt's \u0014\n                   injury and departure so hurtful. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  So many of our recent champions have this in \ncommon: they were fast, but they\u0014\n                  couldn't last. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I guess we should be used to this by now.\u0014",

    "title": "CAN TERRORISM BE FORGIVEN",
    "words": "Can terrorism be \nforgiven?\u0014\n\u0014\nJulia Duin\u0014\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished 9/13/01\u0014\n\u0014\n     As a stunned nation watched hell unleashed in New York and \nWashington on Tuesday, talk quickly turned to revenge. \"My first \nreaction is let them glow for 10,000 years,\" wrote one mourner on the \nWeb site www.crosswalk.com, which set up a \"call to prayer\" forum \nwithin a half-hour of the first attack.\u0014\n     Said another, \"Yes, it might start World War III if we retaliate \nbut where would we be if we had not retaliated to Pearl Harbor?\"\u0014\n     But unless the country seeks some sort of collective healing, \nAmericans will be poisoned by hate much like what has festered in \nNorthern Ireland, in the Balkans and in the Middle East, some \nforgiveness experts say.\u0014\n     For now, \"rage is good,\" says University of Wisconsin psychology \nprofessor Robert Enright, whose new book,\"Forgiveness Is a Choice,\" \nwas, ironically, released on Tuesday. He is co-founder of the \nInternational Forgiveness Institute in Madison.\u0014\n     \"Forgiveness starts with rage,\" he says. \"Forgiveness does not \nmean dusting this under the rug. Forgiveness starts with the cold, \nhard facts that what happened was grossly unfair, is grossly unfair \nand will always be grossly unfair.\u0014\n     \"This will be extremely hard to forgive. They are using our \ncommercial airlines as weapons against innocent citizens. That did \nnot happen in Pearl Harbor, where it was military versus military. \nThis incident has a real patina of evil about it.\u0014\n     \"The people who did what they did to us on Tuesday are dead,\" he \nsays. \"That is what is so sinister about evil.There is no way to get \nback, so one of the ways to get emotional healing from this is to \nforgive. Forgiveness restores hope.\"\u0014\n     Sooner or later, he added, America must learn how to deal with \nbitterness of spirit.\u0014\n     \"Even people with horrendous wrongs done against them, like \nincest, have lived a life of such pessimism and hatred where it has \nso poisoned them that everything is colored by the horror of the act. \nForgiveness can cut through that and restore a sense of hope.\u0014\n     \"A terrible distortion is to think that if you forgive, you \ncannot seek justice. You can, but it is not being sought through the \neffect of hatred. You have looked at the evil and not walked away \nfrom it, but you've confronted it in new ways.\"\u0014\n     Mindful that the probable source of Tuesday's attack are Islamic \nterrorists, the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic \nRelations issued a blizzard of press releases, starting Tuesday \nafternoon, distancing themselves from the unknown attackers.\u0014\n     They also suggested Muslims request additional security around \nmosques and that anyone wearing \"Islamic attire\" stay out of the \npublic eye.\u0014\n     The national mood already is turning from grief to revenge. One \nearly poll, announced yesterday morning, said more than 90 percent of \nAmericans favor going to war, just as America declared war on Japan \nafter Pearl Harbor 60 years ago.\u0014\n     Whereas the New Testament holds up forgiveness as a command, the \nOld Testament demands justice first, says Rabbi Charles Klein of Long \nIsland and author of the 1995 book \"How to Forgive When You Can't \nForget.\"\u0014\n     \"I think Americans got in touch Tuesday with what Israelis have \nfaced for years,\" he says. \"All those political leaders who have \nasked for restraint in the face of terrorism now are eating their \nwords.\u0014\n     \"I don't think a nation can forgive this. I don't believe \nforgiveness is gratuitous. Since there is no one prepared to take \nresponsibility for this, there is no one to forgive. Forgiveness is \nthe expression of remorse on the part of the one who committed that \nact of treachery and a commitment by them to work toward peace and \nunderstanding. I don't think that is going to happen.\u0014\n     \"So, we are left having to cope with these feelings of anger and \noutrage and maybe all we can hope to do with this is not misdirect it \nand aim our anger at people who are not responsible.\" \u0014\n     A national trauma that may dwarf the current record for \nAmericans killed in one day (23,000 on Sept. 17, 1862, at the battle \nof Antietam) needs a healing ritual, he said. It must be far more \nprofound than what was done in Oklahoma City to mark the 168 deaths \nin the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. \u0014\n     Mr. Enright said this would mean a \"massive movement\" toward \nforgiveness.\u0014\n     \"At least we need a massive public discussion of forgiveness,\" \nhe said. \"The closest we've come is Bill Clinton asking our \nforgiveness daily during the Monica Lewinsky debate.\"\u0014\n     The rabbi insists America's wound will never heal.\u0014\n     \"This will not be forgiven, it will not be forgiven,\" he says. \n\"I challenge anyone to explain to me how this is forgiven.\"\u0014\n     But Everett Worthington, director of the Campaign for \nForgiveness Research in Richmond, says people wrongly equate \nforgiveness with justice. Having had to process the murder of his \nmother by an intruder at her home in Knoxville, Tenn., he says true \njustice is impossible this side of heaven.\u0014\n     \"If you think about getting justice, what could possibly make up \nfor what's been done?\" he asks. \"Nothing we could ever do could make \nup for this. Justice is about balancing the scale and there's no way \nto do that here.\u0014\n     \"There is nothing we can do to any terrorist organization that \ncould fix the thousands of people killed, the billions of dollars \nwasted. People will always feel injustice is done, so they have a \nchoice. Will they just let their bitterness fester and eat them up \nand warp their personalities? Or will people try in some way to \nreduce the gap between what ought to be and what is?\u0014\n     \"Even if we bring these people to justice, there is still no way \nto make up for the pain. So people have to move on from this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Copyright  2001 News World \nCommunications, Inc. All rights reserved.\u0014",

It should be \nstressed that the terrorist acts are ones of desperation and horror \n-- that there are \"bad\" people out there, and bad people do bad \nthings. But not all people in a particular group are bad. Children \nshould know that lashing out at members of a particular religious or \nethnic group will only cause more harm.\u0014",

The New\u0014\n                      Testament is solid in viewing death and \njudgment this way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Modern theologians are not all solid here.

Some who expect \nthis are\u0014\n                      evangelicals who think that the God of grace \nowes everyone a\u0014\n                      clear presentation of the gospel in terms they \nunderstand.\u0014\n                      Others who expect an exercise of postmortem \nfaith are\u0014\n                      universalists, for whom it is axiomatic that \nall humans will finally\u0014\n                      enjoy God in heaven, and therefore that God \nmust and will\u0014\n                      continue to exert loving pressure till all have \nbeen drawn to\u0014\n                      Christ. So John Hick posits as many postmortem \nlives for each\u0014\n                      non-Christian as is necessary to this end, and \nNels Ferr&#142;\u0014\n                      describes hell as having \"a school and a door\" \nin it: when those\u0014\n                      in hell come to their senses about Christ they \nmay leave, so\u0014\n                      that the place ends up empty. But this is \nnonscriptural\u0014\n                      speculation, and reflects an inadequate grasp \nof what turning\u0014\n                      to Christ involves. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What sort of event is \"choice for/against Jesus \nas Savior?\" The\u0014\n                      phrase might suggest it is like choosing the \npreferred dish from\u0014\n                      a menua choice where you opt for what strikes \nyou as the\u0014\n                      best of the bunch, knowing that if your first \nchoice is not\u0014\n                      available, a second is always possible. But \ncoming savingly to\u0014\n                      Christ is not like that. When it occurs, there \nis a sense of\u0014\n                      inevitability about it, springing from three \nsources: the pressure\u0014\n                      of gospel truth that feels too certain to be \ndenied, plus the\u0014\n                      sense of God's presence forcing one to face the \nreality of\u0014\n                      Jesus Christ, plus the realization that without \nhim, one is lost,\u0014\n                      currently ruining oneself and desperately \nneeding to be\u0014\n                      changed. This sense is generated by God's \nprevenient\u0014\n                      gracehis action of making the first move. \nThere is no\u0014\n                      commitment to Christ (no \"choice for Jesus,\" if \none prefers to\u0014\n                      say it that way) apart from this convicting \ndivine action. The\u0014\n                      nature and necessity of regeneration (for that \nis what this is)\u0014\n                      was never a matter of dispute between Puritan \nCalvinists and\u0014\n                      Wesleyan Arminians. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The act of the heart in choosing Jesus Christ \nis not always\u0014\n                      performed in a single moment, nor is it always \nperformed calmly\u0014\n                      and clear-headedly. At surface level there are \noften\u0014\n                      crosscurrents of reluctance. C. S. Lewis, \ndissecting his own\u0014\n                      conversion story, wrote of \"the steady, \nunrelenting approach of\u0014\n                      him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet,\" \nand scoffed at\u0014\n                      the idea that anyone really seeks the real God \nand the real,\u0014\n                      living Christ, with their dominating, \ndictatorial demands for\u0014\n                      discipleship. (\"You might as well speak of the \nmouse's search\u0014\n                      for the cat.\") But in every real conversion, \nprevenient grace\u0014\n                      (meaning, as is now clear, the Holy Spirit) \nensures a real\u0014\n                      change of heart through the Calvary love of \nChrist becoming\u0014\n                      irresistible. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How a just-dead person's perceptions differ \nfrom what they\u0014\n                      were before is more than we have been told. But \nScripture says\u0014\n                      nothing of prevenient grace triggering \npostmortem conversions,\u0014\n                      and that being so, we should conclude that the \nunbeliever's\u0014\n                      lack of desire for Christ and the Father and \nheaven remains\u0014\n                      unchanged. So for God to extend the offer of \nsalvation beyond\u0014\n                      the moment of death, even for thirty seconds, \nwould be\u0014\n                      pointless. Nothing would come of it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      J. I.

    "words": "Sunday, Nov. 25, 2001 Associated Press\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                          Company \nSays It Cloned Human Embryo \u0014\n\u0014\n          BOSTON (AP) - A research company reported Sunday it had \ncloned the first human embryo, a development\u0014\n          it said was aimed at producing genetically matched \nreplacement cells for patients with a wide range of\u0014\n          diseases.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But the news from Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, \nMass., drew swift protests from religious and\u0014\n          political leaders who saw it as a step toward cloning human \nbeings.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Several states, including California, have banned human \ncloning, and Congress is considering such a\u0014\n          ban. But company officials insisted their work is the first \nstep in providing hope for people with spinal\u0014\n          injuries, heart disease and other ailments.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``These are exciting preliminary results,'' said Dr. Robert \nP. Lanza, one of the researchers at Advanced Cell\u0014\n          Technology. ``This work sets the stage for human \ntherapeutic cloning as a potentially limitless source of\u0014\n          immune-compatible cells for tissue engineering and \ntransplantation medicine.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Lanza and the company's top executive Michael West said \nthey had no interest in transplanting such early\u0014\n          embryos into a woman's womb to give birth to a cloned human \nbeing, nor was it clear that their embryo\u0014\n          would be capable of that.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But the Washington D.C.-based National Right to Life \nCommittee wasted little time Sunday attacking the\u0014\n          announcement.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``This corporation is creating human embryos for the sole \npurpose of killing them and harvesting their\u0014\n          cells,'' said the group's legislative director Douglas \nJohnson. ``Unless Congress acts quickly, this\u0014\n          corporation and others will be opening human embryo farms.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          And a critic of the company who used to sit on ACT's ethics \nboard said Advanced Cell's announcement\u0014\n          was premature and would serve only to encourage such harsh \nreaction against cloning.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Glenn McGee, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist who \nresigned from Advanced Cell Technology's\u0014\n          ethics advisory board, called the announcement ``nothing \nbut hype.'' He said the company's report lacks\u0014\n          any significant details, including what cells company \nscientists actually grew from the cloned embryo. The\u0014\n          paper doesn't say if Advanced Cell was able to derive any \nhuman embryonic stem cells from its cloning\u0014\n          effort.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``They are doing science by press release,'' he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In findings published Sunday by the online journal, \ne-biomed: The Journal of Regenerative Medicine, and\u0014\n          also described online in Scientific American, the \nscientists said they had grown a six-cell human embryo.\u0014\n\u0014\n          They said they created the early embryo by injecting a very \nsmall cell with its genetic material into a\u0014\n          woman's donated egg. In such cloning, the injected DNA \noften comes from a skin cell, but the researchers\u0014\n          this time used a cumulus cell, which nurtures a developing \negg.\u0014\n\u0014\n          This technique could produce replacement cells only for a \nwoman of childbearing age, since the injected\u0014\n          DNA comes from a woman's reproductive system. However, the \nscientists have been experimenting with\u0014\n          injecting adult skin cells into the eggs as well.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In a separate experiment, the scientists showed they could \npush the development of human egg cells\u0014\n          even further with a technique known as parthenogenesis. In \nthat process, they said, six eggs\u0014\n          reprogrammed themselves to develop into early embryos.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Such eggs would be largely compatible with the genetics of \nthe egg donor.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The scientists described all the work as preliminary. \nNeither experiment has yet produced the coveted\u0014\n          stems cells, master cells which grow into all kinds of body \ntissues.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Other research groups in this country and abroad have \nplunged into efforts for human ``reproductive\u0014\n          cloning,'' which aims to produce a new person, or \n``therapeutic cloning,'' which seeks only to create\u0014\n          embryos that would yield stem cells for treating diseases.\u0014\n\u0014\n          And last September, a report from the National Academy of \nSciences - an independent, congressionally\u0014\n          chartered organization - said therapeutic cloning should be \npursued.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Dr. Norman Fost, director of the bioethics program at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, said he\u0014\n          believes a ``slippery slope'' argument for banning \ntherapeutic cloning is a poor approach.\u0014\n\u0014\n          One could have made such a case against test-tube \nfertilization, which has turned out to be beneficial, and\u0014\n          which also can be seen as a step toward cloning humans, he \nsaid Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The announcement by the Massachusetts researchers, he said, \nis ``a basic part of making stem cell\u0014\n          research useful for human beings.'' That, he said is ``a \npath which the huge majority of the American\u0014\n          people favor.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          The researchers described their work as an important step \ntoward producing stem cells to generate\u0014\n          replacement cells as treatments for diabetes, heart \ndisease, spinal injuries, and many other ailments.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``We think we've shown that it's going to be possible, in \nthe lifetime of many of us, to take a cell from our\u0014\n          body and, by using cloning technology ... to take a \npatient's cell back in time using the egg cells, sort of a\u0014\n          little time machine, and then making these cells that we've \nheard so much over the last few months, the\u0014\n          embryonic stem cell, to make your own embryonic stem cells, \nyoung cells,'' said Michael West, president\u0014\n          of Advanced Cell Technology.\u0014\n\u0014\n          But using human embryos for such work faces huge hurdles in \nWashington.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``The president has made it clear that he is opposed to any \ntype of human cloning,'' said White House\u0014\n          spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise. ``He supported the House \nlegislation to ban human cloning that\u0014\n          passed overwhelmingly. The Senate has a busy calendar but \nthis shows why it is important for the Senate\u0014\n          to act.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \nD-S.D., said while he only had sketchy\u0014\n          details, he was worried about reproductive cloning. He \ncalled the reports ``disconcerting.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``I think it's going in the wrong direction,'' he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., \nsaid ``I believe it will be perhaps a big debate,\u0014\n          but at the end of the day I don't believe that we're going \nto let the cloning of human embryos go on.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told CNN's ``Late Edition'' \nthat ``the Senate should be deliberative.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``We really ought to take it on the basis of much more \nthorough understanding than this first report,'' he\u0014\n          said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization, predicted that Congress will\u0014\n          ultimately allow human cloning for therapeutic purposes. \n``Therapeutic cloning has been gaining allies as\u0014\n          its applications are understood,'' he said.\u0014",

    "words": "The 'Other' Tragedy\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The attack on the Pentagon left heroes, victims,\u0014\n                      survivors. Here's their story\u0014\n\u0014\n                      BY ANGIE CANNON\u0014\n\u0014\n                      They all remember the blackness. It formed a \nwall of inky, blinding smoke inside the\u0014\n                      Pentagon, and Isaac Hoopii ran right through \nit. He wore only his short-sleeved blue\u0014\n                      police uniformno mask, no protective coat, not \neven a handkerchief over his mouth.\u0014\n                      \"Is anybody in here? Anybody here?\" From the \ndarkness, frantic voices replied: \"Help\u0014\n                      me! Help me! I'm over here.\" Hoopii called \nback, over and over: \"Head toward my voice,\u0014\n                      head toward my voice! Come toward my voice!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hoopii's is a singer's voice, deep and mellow, \neven in small talk. On  weekends, the\u0014\n                      38-year-old  Hawaiian K-9 cop sings in a \nwedding band called the  Aloha Boys. On\u0014\n                      September 11,  Hoopii used his  voice to save \nlives. He was at the Pentagon when the\u0014\n                      big Boeing 757  slammed into it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We are reminded often of the\u0014\n                      haunting images of that infamous morning, \nespecially the strikes against the twin\u0014\n                      towers in New York and the heroes of United \nFlight 93, who perished in a\u0014\n                      Pennsylvania field. But there was, of course, \nanother attack that day. Terrorists also\u0014\n                      hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and flew \nit into the west side of the Pentagon.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is the story of that \"other\" attack. It is \na story with its own distinctive collection of\u0014\n                      victims, heroes, survivors. We remember still \nthe ghastly gash and the blackened\u0014\n                      facade of the famous five-sided building. For a \nwhile, the Pentagon was part of\u0014\n                      split-screen America with the World Trade \nCenter. But attention quickly receded from\u0014\n                      Washington. So much so that sometimes we don't \nrealize that more people died at the\u0014\n                      Pentagon189than in the Oklahoma City bombing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Inner view. Since September 11, the gouge in \nthe Pentagon has widened day by day,\u0014\n                      as the damage to the nation's symbolic fortress \nis far worse than first appeared.\u0014\n                      Demolition crews use an ultra-long-reach \nexcavator (the only other one in the country\u0014\n                      is at ground zero, in New York) to remove the \nrubble, 5,000 pounds at a time. To look\u0014\n                      at the Pentagon today is to see a much \ndifferent place, almost one without its\u0014\n                      geometric distinctiveness. The clean cuts on \nthe edges of the building look as if they\u0014\n                      might have been part of the original design. \nNow the building's inner B ring is plainly\u0014\n                      visible, a view not possible when the \nPentagon's construction was completed in\u0014\n                      January 1943.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In all, 400,000 square feet of office space \nwill be rebuilt. Part of that area had been\u0014\n                      renovated recently, and that saved lives. Not \nall the offices were occupied that\u0014\n                      morning because of the renovation. In addition, \nthe outer ring had been reinforced by\u0014\n                      floor-to-ceiling steel beams that ran through \nall five floors. Between them was a\u0014\n                      Kevlar-like mesh, similar to the material in \nbulletproof vests, which kept masonry from\u0014\n                      becoming shrapnel. Together, the beams and the \nmesh formed a citadel that kept the\u0014\n                      top floors from collapsing for about 35 \nminutes, time enough for some people to\u0014\n                      escape. New blast-resistant windows above the \ncrash site didn't shatter. A new\u0014\n                      sprinkler system kept the fires from consuming \nthe entire place.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now, it's time to start over again. All in \nkeeping with the original designthe 171/2 miles\u0014\n                      of corridors that connect the five ringsright \ndown to replacement limestone from\u0014\n                      southern Indiana quarries. The grand ambition \nhas people working in the outermost\u0014\n                      ring by Sept. 11, 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Derek Spector has driven past the Pentagon \ncountless times, visual furniture in his\u0014\n                      daily life. On September 11, he was five blocks \naway, sitting with fellow firefighters at\u0014\n                      Fire Station No. 5 in Arlington, Va., watching \nTV as the second plane rammed into the\u0014\n                      World Trade Center. \"You never know, it could \nhappen here,\" a friend on the phone\u0014\n                      said. \"No way, man,\" Spector shot back. Then he \nheard a plane, fast and low.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The hijacked jetliner, traveling at 350 miles \nan hour, was only about 100 feet from the\u0014\n                      ground when it cruised over Arlington police \nofficer Richard Cox's head, just a quarter\u0014\n                      mile from the Pentagon. \"It was low enough for \nme to see the reflection of cars and\u0014\n                      trees and buildings on its underside as it \npassed by,\" he says. \"It was low enough for\u0014\n                      my heart to stop.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The plane clipped light poles on nearby Route \n27 and a backup generator at the\u0014\n                      Pentagon, bouncing off the ground before \nplowing into the building at a 45-degree\u0014\n                      angle. Originally bound for Los Angeles, the \njet, carrying 64 people, crashed between\u0014\n                      corridors 4 and 5, blasting the first and \nsecond floors of Rings E, D, and C. \"You could\u0014\n                      feel the explosion in your chest,\" says Cox. At \nthe fire station, the ground shook.\u0014\n                      \"What was that?\" Spector shouted. \"A plane,\" \nfirefighter Brian Roach said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Chaos. Wayne Sinclair heard it before he felt \nit. He outfitted computers for the Army\u0014\n                      on the first floor of the D Ring. As usual that \nmorning, Sinclair, 54, caught the subway\u0014\n                      so he could be at work by 6, always the first \nof the seven employees to arrive in\u0014\n                      Room 1D520. He made coffee, dashed off a few \nE-mails, tinkered with computers.\u0014\n                      Shortly after 9:30 a.m., he and his colleagues \nwere watching the World Trade Center\u0014\n                      attack on CNN's Web site when they heard a \nthunderous roar.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Everything turned black. Smoke and fire \nengulfed the room. Walls crumbled. Desks, file\u0014\n                      cabinets, and computers hurtled through the \nair. \"You couldn't see anything,\" he says.\u0014\n                      Some people were thrown to the floor. Sinclair \ncould feel his face, ears, and arms\u0014\n                      burning. But he couldn't see them because the \nsmoke was so thick. People screamed\u0014\n                      for help. Chaos reigned.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Down the hall from Sinclair's office, Jim \nLynch, 55, was well into his workday morning\u0014\n                      in room 1D457, part of the Navy Command Center. \nOfficially, Lynch performed\u0014\n                      behind-the-scenes communications wizardry. But \nmost knew him simply as the Candy\u0014\n                      Man. For years, he briskly walked the Pentagon \nhalls, listening to light rock on his\u0014\n                      Walkman and wearing bright orange, red, and \nyellow ties and tennis shoes. The\u0014\n                      Candy Man bought cases of gold-wrapped \nWerther's Originals and handed them out\u0014\n                      each day during his lunch break, a big-hearted \nfixture in the bureaucratic maze. Trish\u0014\n                      Hackett, an Air Force executive assistant, like \nso many, heard of him soon after she\u0014\n                      started her Pentagon job a couple of years ago. \n\"One day, a friendly, smiling Kenny\u0014\n                      Rogers look-alike wearing earphones handed me a \npiece of candy, and I knew I had\u0014\n                      finally met the Candy Man.\" Lynch had planned \nto take that Tuesday off, but he had too\u0014\n                      much work to do. He started his day meeting \nover bagels and doughnuts with an\u0014\n                      employee from the Norfolk, Va., naval base. \nLater, Lynch returned to his command\u0014\n                      center office. After the attack, his wife, \nBrenda, frantically called his number; she\u0014\n                      couldn't reach him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many of those affected by the attack had worked \nin the Pentagon for years and\u0014\n                      viewed it as a fortress. One ring away from the \nCandy Man's office, Louise Kurtz\u0014\n                      hadn't had time to develop that sense of \ncomfort and control. She was starting only\u0014\n                      her second day in a new job at the Pentagon. \nLife was sweet. She and her husband,\u0014\n                      Mike, had saved for two years for their first \nreal vacation ever last spring, an Alaskan\u0014\n                      cruise. The 49-year-old Army accountant was \nexcited about her new job and was\u0014\n                      faxing payroll information. She went over to a \ncoworker's desk with a radio so they\u0014\n                      could listen to reports from New York. Ten \nseconds later, their world exploded and a\u0014\n                      fireball swallowed them. The petite woman \ninstinctively put her hands over her face\u0014\n                      before she somehow managed to climb out a \nwindow and escape.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bomb! One floor up, John Yates worked in 2E471, \na warren of cubicles. At 50, he\u0014\n                      was an Army security manager who handed out \nkeys and employee badges. His\u0014\n                      morning also began quietly with E-mails and \nphone calls. \"Do me a favor, do the rest of\u0014\n                      your work today under your desk,\" his wife, \nEllen, said only half jokingly when they\u0014\n                      spoke by the phone after the World Trade Center \nnews. He had been sitting on a table\u0014\n                      watching TV. When he stood up, the Pentagon \nshuddered. A big ball of fire knocked\u0014\n                      him to the floor. Black smoke flooded the room. \nSearing heat scorched him. Upended\u0014\n                      file cabinets blocked him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Down the hall from Yates, Lt. Col. Brian \nBirdwell, 40, had been at his desk in Room\u0014\n                      2E486 since 6:30 a.m. He had scanned the day's \nheadlines and some documents,\u0014\n                      while sipping his ritual morning Coke. Cheryle \nSincock, 53, worked there too. A\u0014\n                      two-star general's secretary, she had arrived, \nas always, at 4:30 a.m. There were\u0014\n                      always a million things to do before her boss \narrived. Her husband, Craig, who\u0014\n                      worked two corridors away, called at 8 a.m. to \nsay he was leaving the building for a\u0014\n                      meeting. Two daughters called later with news \nof the twin towers. \"There's no way\u0014\n                      that's an accident,\" Birdwell murmured to \nCheryle as they watched the World Trade\u0014\n                      Center crumble. Birdwell walked out to the \nmen's room in corridor 4, a move that saved\u0014\n                      his life. He had just taken three or four steps \nout of the bathroom when the building\u0014\n                      was rocked. \"Bomb!\" the Gulf War vet \nimmediately thought as he was knocked down.\u0014\n                      When he stood up, he realized he was on fire. \n\"Jesus, I'm coming to see you,\" Birdwell\u0014\n                      prayed. His mind flashed to his family. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At Washington Hospital Center, Dr. Marion \nJordan also was watching TV when an\u0014\n                      announcer broke in with the bulletin about the \nPentagon. \"This is gonna be a long day,\"\u0014\n                      Jordan muttered. Quickly, he ditched his sport \ncoat for green scrubs. \"Code Orange.\u0014\n                      Code Orange,\" a voice blared over the \nhospital's PA system. \"This is not a drill.\"\u0014\n                      Doctors scrambled to the five bays near the \nhelicopter pad. \"It was pretty much\u0014\n                      bedlam,\" says Jordan, the Burn Center director. \nA clinical manager with a booming\u0014\n                      voice yelled above the din: \"Everyone keep the \nvolume down!\" The quiet lasted until the\u0014\n                      first patients arrived.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Firefighter Spector and his two-man crew were \namong the first responders at the\u0014\n                      Pentagon. Spector saw flames shooting from the \ntop and armies of people running in\u0014\n                      an orderly way from the building. The heavy \nwooden doors to corridor 5 were blown\u0014\n                      off their hinges. \"There's a lady screaming in \nthe E ring,\" an Army officer cried to\u0014\n                      Spector. The firefighters combed E ring for \nabout 50 feet until a huge debris pile\u0014\n                      blocked them. They searched D ring until they \nhit a wall of fire. At times, they stopped,\u0014\n                      held their breath and listened, hoping to hear \nany sign of life. They heard only popping\u0014\n                      noises and falling ceiling tiles. \"We never \nfound a single soul,\" says Spector. \"That will\u0014\n                      stay with me forever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Officer Hoopii was more fortunate. He helped \npeople straggling out of the building. One\u0014\n                      woman's skin was peeling so he hoisted her on \nhis broad shoulders. Another woman\u0014\n                      was missing her shoes, so he carried her. Her \nmouth and nose were black, and she\u0014\n                      was in shock. \"You are alive,\" he reassured \nher. He wanted to go deeper into the\u0014\n                      blackness. Someone yelled at him to stop. \"We \ngotta get people,\" he shouted back. He\u0014\n                      was going on pure adrenaline. The smoke was \nsuffocating, and he heard the building\u0014\n                      cracking. But he pressed on to the D ring. \nThat's when he heard the desperate voices.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Wayne Sinclair and five coworkers crawled over \nthe rubble and out of their office, 50\u0014\n                      to 75 feet from where the plane hit. The \nhallway was so black, they lost all sense of\u0014\n                      direction. Only Hoopii's voice guided them. \n\"Head toward my voice. Head toward my\u0014\n                      voice,\" he called. Huddled closely together, \nthey followed it. Hoopii's voice led them out\u0014\n                      of the building, but Sinclair and the others \nnever saw whom it belonged to. Hoopii was\u0014\n                      already back helping others.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      John Yates was one floor up from Sinclair. \nDying in a fire had been Yates's biggest\u0014\n                      fear. But he didn't let it paralyze \nhiminstead, he started crawling. Someone grabbed\u0014\n                      his right leg. Yates heard voices at the far \nend of the room. He moved that way and\u0014\n                      found some coworkers. \"We can't get out this \nway,\" they told him. \"Yes, we can.\u0014\n                      Follow me. Just follow me,\" Yates insisted. \nThey crawled over the debris and ended\u0014\n                      up in corridor 4. A couple of Navy guys grabbed \nhim under the armpits and walked him\u0014\n                      to the center courtyard. \"I could see the flesh \nhanging off my hands,\" Yates says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brian Birdwell was lying on the ground in the \nsame corridor, his head on the floor. The\u0014\n                      smoke was several inches above him. But in \nthose few inches, he could see down\u0014\n                      the corridor, so he knew which way to head. He \nstumbled toward A ring. Several\u0014\n                      Army guys, including a close running buddy, \ncarried him to a triage site. He tasted jet\u0014\n                      fuel in his mouth. He was shaking violently, \nand medics cut off his dark green uniform\u0014\n                      pants. \"It looked like I had melted,\" says \nBirdwell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meanwhile, 57-year-old Craig Sincock, wearing \ncivilian clothes, had run the 2 miles\u0014\n                      back to the Pentagon from his meeting. He \npitched in, offering water to workers,\u0014\n                      carrying stretchers. But he had another motive: \nHe wanted to be as close to the crash\u0014\n                      site as possible so he could look for Cheryle, \nhis wife of nearly 25 years, the general's\u0014\n                      secretary. He stared at the windows, trying to \nremember where her office was. He\u0014\n                      stayed until 11 p.m., went home, showered, \nslept briefly, changed into his Army\u0014\n                      uniform, and returned at 4 a.m. to help out \nmore. At 10 a.m., he got a call, saying she\u0014\n                      was missing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Birdwell and nine others were transported to \nWashington Hospital Center. Doctors had\u0014\n                      never seen this many major burn patients at \nonce. Some were critically ill. Dr. Jordan,\u0014\n                      57, a good-natured dynamo who likes to rebuild \nold Harleys in his spare time, grabbed\u0014\n                      his partner, Dr. James Jeng: \"We need to get \nthe burned skin off so it doesn't form a\u0014\n                      tourniquet.\" The pair opened up operating rooms \nand bounced between them. They\u0014\n                      essentially shaved off burned skin. The doctors \ncut until they found live tissue, then\u0014\n                      covered it temporarily with donated skin.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jordan knew they would quickly go through all \nthe skin in the freezer, so he had a\u0014\n                      nurse call the skin bank at the University of \nTexas Southwestern Medical Center in\u0014\n                      Dallas. \"Send us what you've got,\" was the \nurgent request. Planes weren't flying, so\u0014\n                      the medical center packed 70 square feet of \nskin on dry ice, stuck it in three Styrofoam\u0014\n                      coolers, and drove it up in a blue Chevy van. \nThe two drivers broke speed limits,\u0014\n                      pausing only for bathroom breaks and tacos at \ndrive-through windows. The skin\u0014\n                      arrived 23 hours and 12 minutes later. A \nCincinnati skin bank came through with 30\u0014\n                      more square feet in 12 hours. Another in Dayton \ndelivered more skin to\u0014\n                      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base with the order: \n\"As soon as you're flying again, get\u0014\n                      this to Washington Hospital Center.\" The \ndonated skin stabilized the wounds until the\u0014\n                      doctors could graft the patients' own skin \ntaken from the rare spots that weren't\u0014\n                      burned. Jordan and Jeng worked 12-to-16-hour \ndays for three weeks. They traded\u0014\n                      off spending the night at the hospital, with \nJordan sleeping on his office couch and\u0014\n                      Jeng curling up on an air mattress. Since \nSeptember 11, they have done 112 surgeries\u0014\n                      on nine of the patients.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jordan sees something different about his \nPentagon patients from the literally 10,000\u0014\n                      other burn patients he has treated in 23 years: \ntheir spirit. \"They have a different\u0014\n                      mind-set: 'I'm not going to let it beat me.' \" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Cadaver skin. You can see that in Brian \nBirdwell, who mouthed the words \"I love\u0014\n                      you\" to his wife, Mel, when he opened his eyes \nfor the first time September 13. That\u0014\n                      same day, President Bush visited the Fort Worth \nnative. \"Colonel Birdwell,\" the\u0014\n                      commander in chief said as he strode into the \nhospital room. With tears in his eyes, the\u0014\n                      president saluted the bandaged soldier, holding \nit until Birdwell slowly raised his\u0014\n                      burned arm as high as he could to return the \nsalute. Birdwell, burned over 40 percent\u0014\n                      of his body, saw himself in the mirror \nrecentlyhis forehead plastered with cadaver\u0014\n                      skin, the tips of his ears singed off, the \ndelicate skin around his eyes stretched out.\u0014\n                      His sense of humor was intact. \"I think I look \npretty good for a guy who just got run\u0014\n                      over by a plane,\" he said, grinning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mike Kurtz, 50, didn't recognize his wife of \nnearly 31 years, Louise, when she was\u0014\n                      wheeled past him in the hospital. She's the \nArmy accountant who had been on the job\u0014\n                      only two days at the Pentagon. He thought it \nwas a mummy when she went by. He\u0014\n                      has since been at her side every day. Louise, \nburned over nearly 70 percent of her\u0014\n                      body, spent more than two months in intensive \ncare. Three weeks after Louise\u0014\n                      arrived, the doctors amputated all her fingers, \nwhich were burned badly when she\u0014\n                      tried to cover her face. Her husband agonized \nfor the words to tell her. He was\u0014\n                      struggling through it, when he noticed she was \ntrying to say something. \"I know,\" she\u0014\n                      mouthed. \"It's OK.\" Mike Kurtz broke down \nsobbing, because she had known for two\u0014\n                      days. \"She is a pillar of strength,\" he says. \nHe had bought Louise her first real ring, a\u0014\n                      2-carat diamond, for their 30th anniversary. \nNow, he intends to put the stone in a\u0014\n                      necklace.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The burn patients are rebuilding their lives. \nJohn Yates's daily therapy begins when a\u0014\n                      therapist pours hot wax on his purplish hands \nto soften the scar. Then, he massages\u0014\n                      cream into them. And then, he bends his fingers \ndown, holding them for a 10-count.\u0014\n                      It's excruciating, yet it's the standard \ntherapy; it keeps burn patients' fingers flexible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I'm still here.\" Simple things are \nconfounding. Turning doorknobs. Opening soda\u0014\n                      cans. Holding a pen. In the big picture, \nthough, those are small things. \"At least I'm still\u0014\n                      here,\" says Yates, grateful to have been \nspared. Birdwell recently went outside for\u0014\n                      the first time since September 11. He looked up \nat the sky in the hospital courtyard and\u0014\n                      simply said, \"Thank you, God, I'm still here.\" \nHe has a renewed sense of purpose:\u0014\n                      \"Christ got me out of the fire. In him not \ntaking me, that means I have a mission to\u0014\n                      complete. He'll tell me what it is in due time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Craig Sincock lost Cheryle, the general's \nsecretary who worked with Birdwell. He\u0014\n                      recently wrote a letter to his wife: \"Thank \nyou, Cheryle, for a quarter century of\u0014\n                      happiness, joy, friendship, and love. . . . \nThank you for your patience when my ego\u0014\n                      became too big. . . . Thank you for being my \nbest friend. . . .\" The day after the attack,\u0014\n                      he went to the Family Assistance Center set up \nin a nearby hotel and counseled other\u0014\n                      families every day for about three weeks. \"The \nmore I worked with them, the less fear\u0014\n                      I had about what happened,\" he said. And then, \nhe returned to the church he had left\u0014\n                      years ago. Now, Sincock is back at work doing \nlong-range planning at the Pentagon.\u0014\n                      He started a Web site for the families \n(www.pentagonangels.net), on his own time, with\u0014\n                      his own money. Sincock says he has seen many \nmiracles since September 11the\u0014\n                      biggest is watching families move from grief to \nacceptance. \"When you see where\u0014\n                      they were to where they are now, that's a true \nmiracle,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After three weeks in the hospital, Wayne \nSinclair found his rescuer after the\u0014\n                      Washington Post published a short story on his \nescape. \"You sure were my guardian\u0014\n                      angel that day,\" he told Officer Hoopii. \"I'm \njust so happy you are alive,\" Hoopii replied.\u0014\n                      Now, they are fast friends. Hoopii is back \nworking with a bomb-sniffing dog, but every\u0014\n                      night, he looks at the Pentagon and thinks: \n\"There are so many people there who won't\u0014\n                      be going home, and I am so fortunate to go \nhome.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Right after the attack, a shrine was erected at \nthe center for Pentagon families.\u0014\n                      Beneath the photo of Jim Lynch was a box \nbrimming with gold-wrapped Werther's\u0014\n                      Originals and a note: \"Have a candy and a smile \nfor the Candy Man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Shortly after September 11, Trish Hackett quit \nher Pentagon job to join her husband,\u0014\n                      stationed with the Army in Turkey, sooner than \nplanned. Life is too fragile, she\u0014\n                      realized, when she saw the Candy Man's name on \nthe list of the dead. \"To Jim Lynch,\u0014\n                      thank you for your bright smile and happy \nheart,\" she wrote in her eulogy of him. \"I\u0014\n                      only hope you have a very large pocketful of \nWerther's Originals with you because I\u0014\n                      have heard they are the angels' favorite candy.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Chocolate is A Vegetable \u0014\n\u0014\nChocolate is a Vegetable: Chocolate is derived from cocoa beans. Bean \n= \u0014\nvegetable. \u0014\n\u0014\nSugar is derived from either sugar CANE or sugar BEETS. Both are \nplants, \u0014\nwhich places them in the vegetable category. \u0014\n\u0014\nThus, chocolate is a vegetable. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo go one step further, chocolate candy bars also contain milk, which \nis \u0014\ndairy. So candy bars are a health food. \u0014\n\u0014\nChocolate-covered raisins, cherries, orange slices and strawberries \nall \u0014\ncount as fruit, so eat as many as you want. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're eating it \ntoo \u0014\nslowly. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem: How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the store in \na hot \u0014\ncar.  The solution: Eat it in the parking lot. \u0014\n\u0014\nDiet tip: Eat a chocolate bar before each meal.  It'll take the edge \noff \u0014\nyour appetite, and you'll eat less. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that \na \u0014\nbalanced diet? Don't they actually counteract each other? \u0014\n\u0014\nChocolate has many preservatives.

In preparing for this council, a compliment was paid to him \nwhich was not paid to any other person; for, whereas it was usual to \ninvite the chief bishop only of each province to such meetings, and \nto leave him to choose which of his brethren should accompany him, a \nspecial invitation was sent to Augustine, although he was not even a \nmetropolitan (p 82), but only bishop of a small town. This shows what \nfame he had gained, and in what respect his name was held, even in \nthe Eastern Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nConstantinople. It would have been well for it if it had enjoyed the \nbenefit of the great and good Augustine's presence; for its \nproceedings were carried on in such a way that it is not pleasant to \nread of them But, whatever may have been the faults of those who were \nactive in the council it laid down clearly the truth which Nestorius \nwas charged with denying--that (as is said in the Athanasian creed) \nour blessed Lord, \"although He be God and man, yet is He not two, but \none Christ;\" and this council which was held at Ephesus in the year \n431, is reckoned as the third general council. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome years after it, a disturbance arose about a monk of \nConstantinople, named Eutyches, who had been very zealous against \nNestorius, and now ran into errors of an opposite kind. Another \ncouncil was held at Ephesus in 449; but Dioscorus, bishop of \nAlexandria, and a number of disorderly monks who were favourable to \nEutyches, behaved in such a furious manner at this assembly, that, \ninstead of being considered as a general council, it is known by the \nname \"Latrocinium,\" which means a meeting of robbers. But two years \nlater, when a new emperor had succeeded to the government of the \nEast, another general council was held at Chalcedon (pronounced \nkal-SEE-don) (AD 451); and there the doctrines of Eutyches were \ncondemned, and Dioscotus was deprived of his bishopric. This council, \nwhich was the fourth of the general councils, was attended by six \nhundred and thirty bishops. It laid down the doctrine that our Lord \nis \"One, not by conversion [or turning] of the Godhead into flesh, \nbut by taking of the manhood into God: One altogether, not by \nconfusion of substance, but by unity of person; for, as the \nreasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording, then, to these two councils, which were held against \nNestorius and Eutyches, we are to believe that our blessed Lord is \nreally God and really man. The Godhead and the manhood are not mixed \ntogether in Him, so as to make something which would be neither the \none nor the other (which is what the creed means by \"confusion of \nsubstance\"); but they are in Him distinct from each other, just as \nthe soul and the body are distinct in man, and yet they are not two \npersons, but are joined together in one Person, just as the soul and \nthe body are joined in one man. All this may perhaps be rather hard \nfor young readers to understand, but the third and fourth general \ncouncils are too important to be passed over, even in a little book \nlike this; and, even if what has been said here should not be quite \nunderstood, it will at least show that all those distinctions in the \nAthanasian creed mean something, and that they were not set forth \nwithout some reason, but in order to meet errors which had actually \nbeen taught. \u0014\n\u0014\nI may mention here two other things which were settled by the Council \nof Chalcedon--that it gave the bishops of Constantinople authority \nover Thrace, Asia, and Pontus; and that it raised Jerusalem, which \nuntil then had been only an ordinary bishopric, to have authority of \nthe same kind over the Holy Land. These chief bishops are now called \n\"patriarchs\", and there were thus five patriarchs--namely, the \nbishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. \nThe map will show you how these patriarchates were divided, but there \nwere still some Christian countries which did not belong to any of \nthem. \u0014\n\u0014\nr title which we hear much oftener--I mean the title of \"pope\". The \nproper meaning of it is \"father\"; in short, it is nothing else than \nthe word \"papa,\" which children among ourselves use in speaking to \ntheir fathers. This title of pope (or father), then, was at first \ngiven to all bishops; but, by degrees, it came to be confined in its \nuse; so that, in the East, only the bishops of Rome and Alexandria \nwere called by it, while in the West it was given to the bishop or \npatriarch of Rome alone.\u0014",

So bars are a health food. \u0014\n\u0014\nChocolate-covered raisins, cherries, orange slices and strawberries \nall\u0014\ncount as fruit, so eat as many as you want. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're eating it \ntoo\u0014\nslowly. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem: How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the store in a\u0014\nhot car. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe solution: Eat it in the parking lot. \u0014\n\u0014\nDiet tip: Eat a chocolate bar before each meal. \u0014\nIt'll take the edge off your appetite, and you'll eat less. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that \na\u0014\nbalanced diet? Don't they actually counteract each other? \u0014\n\u0014\nChocolate has many preservatives. Preservatives make you look \nyounger. \u0014\nPut \"eat chocolate\" at the top of your list of things to do today. \u0014\nThat way, at least you'll get one thing done. \u0014\n\u0014\nA nice box of chocolates can provide your total daily intake of \ncalories\u0014\nin one place.

    "words": "The Talk in the \nChurch \u0014\n                 Some Experts Say Abuse Cases Could Open Up Religious \nSexual Discussions\u0014\n                                                     By Geraldine \nSealey\u0014\nFeb.22, 2002  ABC News \u0014\n\u0014\n For all the counsel and solace millions of Americans seek in their \nreligious institutions, most churches aren't exactly known for \noffering a frank, healthy forum for talk about sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent highly publicized cases of child sexual abuse at the hands of \nclergy, though, are getting people talking about religion and sex  \nalthough the discussion focuses on a specific pathology, pedophilia. \u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Roman Catholic priest John Geoghan was sentenced Thursday to \nup to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in \n1991. More than 130 people have claimed Geoghan fondled or raped them \nwhile he served in Boston-area parishes. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday, the cantor at New York City's largest Reform synagogue \nwas arrested on charges that he sexually abused his own nephew. \nHoward Nevison, 61, the longtime cantor of Congregation Emanu-El, has \ndenied the charges. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an ABCNEWS poll, an overwhelming majority says the Catholic Church \nshould be more open about sexual abuse. Nearly nine in 10 people said \nparishioners should be told of such allegations. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile such high-profile cases may serve to get people talking about \npedophilia, some religion and sexuality experts say they hope such \npublicity also will help launch broader, more open talk about \nsexuality. Perhaps more frank discussion, some experts say, would in \nturn help prevent some abuse cases and help victims tell their \nstories. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurches aren't doing enough to help families grapple with the \nsensitive topic of human sexuality, some experts argue. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"For the most part, churches refrain from dealing with this key \ndimension of life that we are sexual beings from the moment of birth \nto our death,\" said Larry Greenfield, a Baptist minister and former \npresident of Colgate Rochester Divinity School. \"We are sexual \nthroughout our lives but we need the churches, temples, synagogues \nand religious organizations all to think about what it means to give \ngood counsel [on sexuality] as a regular part of what we do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNot Just About 'Plumbing' \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the dangers with the Geoghan case and cases like it, \nGreenfield said, is that out of fear, churches could become even more \nclosed on the topic of sexuality. \"It has the possibility of making a \nsilent church even more mum,\" he said. \"A pastor can say, 'I'm going \nto protect myself, I'm not even going to mention sex.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFor sure, open discussion of sexuality in churches of all \ndenominations has become more frequent in the last 20 years. Now, \nmost churches offer sexuality education in one form or another, as do \nschools. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut some argue that religion is so integral to people's lives and \nvalue systems that churches need to play a bigger role. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe kind of sexuality education children get at church is often more \nrelational and less anatomy-based than what is taught in schools. \n\"It's not just about the plumbing,\" said the Rev. Robert M. Friday, a \nreligion professor at Catholic University of America in Washington, \nD.C. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut religious sexuality education programs can often fall short, some \nexperts say. As with many school-based programs, some say programs \noften target middle and late adolescents  which is not soon enough. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's too late if we're talking about laying the foundation for a \nhealthy sexuality and way too late for sexual abuse prevention,\" said \nDebra Haffner, who with Greenfield is the co-director of the \nReligious Institute for Sexual Morality, Justice and Healing in \nNorwalk, Conn. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while sexual abuse prevention programs with \"good touch, bad \ntouch\" messages are quite common now, some say more openness about \nsexuality in general could go even further toward preventing abuse. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Parents ought to say we want the kind of sexuality education that \nwill protect our kids and make them healthy, where they won't feel \nshame and guilt over their sexual feelings,\" Greenfield said. \"Not \njust that I don't want to be abused but I don't want to be an abuser, \nI have enough pride in myself as a child of God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere Should Parents Turn? \u0014\n\u0014\nMany times, restrictive sexual atmospheres  common in some religious \ninstitutions and households  can actually contribute to sexual \ndisorders such as pedophilia, says Dr. Fred Berlin, a Baltimore \npsychiatrist with the Institute for Study, Prevention and Treatment \nof Sexual Trauma. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome clergy being treated for pedophilia talk of childhoods \ncharacterized by strict attitudes toward sex, he said. \"Maybe they \nweren't abused but had a very suppressed curiosity about sex,\" Berlin \nsaid. \"In some cases, that may have been damaging to them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA more open atmosphere may encourage adolescents to discuss confusion \nabout their sexuality  including feeling attraction to younger kids \n before they become sex \u0014\noffenders, Berlin says. As it stands though, parents have nowhere to \nturn. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"You know where to send them if they have anorexia, depression, or if \nthey're abusing drugs, but do we even have places to go in society if \nyou're thinking your child is confused sexually?\" Berlin said. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor sure, churches are not the only institutions with a \nresponsibility to teach about healthy sexuality  education starts at \nhome. \"There needs to be an education of parents,\" said Friday. \"They \nneed to have an open and free dialogue with their sons and \ndaughters.\" \u0014\nParents are the best sex educators of all, most experts agree, but \nsome say churches also should be in a position to help parents field \nor encourage questions from their children about their sexuality. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It would be nice if the church helped families deal with sexuality, \nmoral development, and complex issues in our culture,\" said the Rev. \nJoretta Marshall, academic dean of Eden Theological Seminary in St. \nLouis and a pastoral counselor specializing in sexuality and gender \nissues. \"Most parents don't understand how the church can help them. \n[The Geoghan case] is a great example where the church isn't always \nhelpful.\" \\\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 ABC News Internet Ventures.\u0014",

The NIVI was mentioned, \nbut when Olasky wrote\u0014\n                      about what the new NIV might look like she used \nexamples from the\u0014\n                      New Revised Standard Version (see below).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It wasn't until International Bible Society and \nZondervan Publishing\u0014\n                      House complained that World had misrepresented \ntheir plans that\u0014\n                      World issued a specific list of problematic \npassages in the NIVI. In an\u0014\n                      April 19, 1997, article, Trinity International \nUniversity theologian Wayne\u0014\n                      Grudem (then president of the Council on \nBiblical Manhood and\u0014\n                      Womanhood) compared several verses in the NIV \nand NIVI, giving\u0014\n                      reasons why he believed the changes compromised \nChristian\u0014\n                      theology. \"Such revisions are not the words God \noriginally caused to\u0014\n                      be written, and thus they are not the words of \nGod,\" he wrote. \"They\u0014\n                      are human words that men have substituted for \nthe words of God, and\u0014\n                      they have no place in the Bible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Committee on Bible Translation (CBT), which \ntranslated the NIV,\u0014\n                      NIVI, and the recently announced Today's New \nInternational Version\u0014\n                      (TNIV) clearly disagrees with Grudem's \nassessment. \"The TNIV uses\u0014\n                      generic language only where the meaning of the \ntext was intended to\u0014\n                      include both men and women,\" the translation's \nWeb site says. \"These\u0014\n                      changes reflect a better understanding of the \nmeaning of the original\u0014\n                      Greek and Hebrew.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In other words, World magazine and other NIVI \nopponents believe the\u0014\n                      changes were made to reflect changing cultural \nvalues. The CBT, on\u0014\n                      the other hand, believes the changes were made \nbecause some\u0014\n                      English words no longer mean what they used to.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The TNIV, therefore, remains closer to the NIVI \nthan the NIV in most of\u0014\n                      the passages criticized by Grudem's 1997 \narticle. This is especially in\u0014\n                      cases where gender-specific words were made \nplural to include both\u0014\n                      men and women.

    "title": "CAN WE TALK?",
    "words": "CT Classic: Can We Talk?\u0014\nWe may never resolve all our differences about women in leadership, \nbut we can help each other toward better understanding.\u0014\nBy Terry C. Muck | posted 03/15/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nIt happens every time we publish something about Women in Leadership \n(WIL). It happened after we ran a profile of Roberta Hestenes, \npresident of Eastern College. It happened after we printed a two-page \nadvertisement from the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. It \nhappened after we ran a competing message from another group, \nChristians for Biblical Equality. And as sure as the sun will come up \ntomorrow, it will happen in response to articles in this issue: Mary \nVan Leeuwen's essay on the meaning of Pentecost for gender issues; \nand a report on a CT survey of readers' attitudes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happens is that we get lots of (predictable) letters. If an \narticle endorses women in leadership roles, many letters object and a \nfew congratulate. If the article endorses a male hierarchy, many \nobject and a few congratulate. Letters come from men and women alike, \nthough we have not studied trends to see how either sex tends to \nrespond to the issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsually, our letters to the editor include a certain percentage from \naxe-grinders. But the letters on WIL are from serious-minded \nevangelicals who have strong beliefs on this subject and want to \nshare them. Many are filled with solid exegesis. Others passionately \nmarshal theological, philosophical, sociological, and psychological \ndata. These are not harsh, unknown critics, but friends of CT.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the mail response is so passionate because CT readers are \nstill trying to work out gender issues in their own lives. Our survey \ndata show that while CT readers' beliefs are consistently more \nconservative than those of the general populace, in actual practice, \nthe gender aspects of their lives are very similar. This clash \nbetween lifestyle and values suggests a serious tension in CT \nreaders' families.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut our readers are not the only ones divided on this issue. Members \nof our in-house editorial staff also line up on opposite sides of the \nquestion. As do our senior editors and our board members.\u0014\nWe have not made a hard-and-fast position on WIL a crusade. But there \nare certain elements of the issue we are willing to crusade for: We \nbelieve women should be treated as well as men; we believe God has \ngifted each of us, male and female, and expects us to help all \nbelievers exercise their gifts; we believe sexism is real and should \nbe eradicated.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that does not exhaust all the elements of the question: Should \nwomen be ordained? What is the full meaning of Paul's statements in 1 \nCorinthians 14:35 and 1 Timothy 2:12? What role does culture (both \nPaul's and ours) play in how we decide WIL issues?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the role of a magazine like CT when it confronts an issue on \nwhich its core audience is divided? Although we have taken editorial \npositions on aspects of WIL in the past, our tone has not been \ndogmatic because we realize that this question needs continuing work \nfrom the best theological minds. We would like CT's pages to be a \nplatform where divisive issues can be debated with logical yet loving \nforce. As you read Mary Van Leeuwen's essay in this issue, senior \neditor J. I. Packer is writing out his reasons (to be published early \nin 1991) for not making women presbyters. Although Drs. Packer and \nVan Leeuwen disagree on such issues, they provide excellent models \nfor carrying on the WIL discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe believe that WIL should not divide us. Resolution can be achieved \nwithout radical surgery, without cutting off any limb from the body \nof Christ. Indeed, it must be if the conclusions are to carry any \nweight. We pledge our pages to work toward that end.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article originally appeared in the July 16, 1990 issue.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christianity Today.\u0014",

Sheler\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For weeks, the Rev. Nick Cieri has been mulling \nover what to say in his Easter sermon,\u0014\n                      arguably the most daunting Sunday act of the \nyear. Should he recount Jesus's arrest\u0014\n                      and Crucifixion? Should he tell the 1,200 \nfamilies in his Severn, Md., parish about how\u0014\n                      Peter denied betraying Jesus? What about how \nconfused and sad the disciples felt\u0014\n                      after Jesus diedonly to feel joyful when he \nrose from the dead? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Actually, it all works.  Cieri has plenty of  \nmaterial to draw on  this year as he\u0014\n                      weaves his Easter homily into the context  of \none of the Roman Catholic Church's\u0014\n                      biggest crises in  modern history: a series of  \nyouth-sex-abuse cases among priests.\u0014\n                      He will attempt to make parallels between the \ncurrent crisis and the death and \u0014\n                      Resurrection of  Jesus. \"This is also a time of \ncarrying the cross and great difficulty,\" says \u0014\n                      Cieri, pastor of St. Bernadette for  a decade. \n\"This is like death. But God brings life out of \u0014\n                      death, and just as God raised  Jesus from \ndeath, so our hope is he will raise us from the  \u0014\n                      dead, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Last week, the sex-abuse scandal that has \nfestered in the shadows of the Catholic\u0014\n                      Church for yearssometimes ignored and abetted \nby leaders intent on protecting the\u0014\n                      church's imageburst into clearer public view, \nwith disturbing new allegations of\u0014\n                      abusive priests and complicit church officials. \nAt the same time, there were new signs\u0014\n                      of recognition at the church's highest levels \nthat the scandal could no longer be\u0014\n                      dismissed as the regrettable but controllable \nperversions of a few priests. Rather, it is\u0014\n                      a full-blown cancer, threatening to sap the \nchurch of its moral authority, public trust,\u0014\n                      and financial resources. Breaking weeks of \nvirtual silence on the widening crisis,\u0014\n                      Pope John Paul ii last week referred to the \nsex-abuse cases as a \"grave scandal\" that\u0014\n                      was casting a \"dark shadow of suspicion\" over \nall priests. In his annual pre-Easter\u0014\n                      message to priests throughout the world, the \npontiff said, \"As priests we are\u0014\n                      personally and profoundly afflicted by the sins \nof some of our brothers who have\u0014\n                      betrayed the grace of ordination.\" While the \nchurch, he said, \"shows her concern for\u0014\n                      the victims and strives to respond in truth and \njustice,\" the pope stopped short of\u0014\n                      offering any new course of action to heal the \nwounds of victims and their families or\u0014\n                      to resolve the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet for many American Catholics, practicing and \nlapsed, it is exactly that\u0014\n                      questionhow will the church now respond?that \nbegs for a concrete answer. \"We\u0014\n                      need a cleans-ing,\" says Lee Spampinato, 65, a \nCatholic parishioner in Denver. \"And\u0014\n                      the hierarchy should take a very proactive \nstance in correcting this problem.\" The\u0014\n                      crisis has stirred an intensity of debate \nreminiscent of the 1960s, when many\u0014\n                      American Catholics vocally opposed papal \nteachings on birth control. In parish halls,\u0014\n                      parochial schools, sacristies, and no doubt \neven in the confessional booth, the faithful\u0014\n                      and their clergy are wrestling with vexing \nquestions: Is celibacy an essential part of\u0014\n                      the priesthood? Can we trust our bishops when \nsome among them have covered up\u0014\n                      crimes? Should the church be more accountable \nto the legal authorities of the land?\u0014\n                      Why should parish or church funds be decimated \nto pay for the vast\u0014\n                      settlementsestimated to reach as much as $1 \nbillion? And why doesn't the church\u0014\n                      have a better system of screening priests? \"The \ncrisis is not just about priests who\u0014\n                      have committed sexual crimes,\" says R. Scott \nAppleby, a historian at the University of\u0014\n                      Notre Dame, where he directs the Cushwa Center \nfor the Study of American\u0014\n                      Catholicism. \"It's about the culture of secrecy \nand the persistence of a two-tiered\u0014\n                      church with an elite tier that keeps its own \ncounsel and makes financial, personnel,\u0014\n                      and other policy decisions without consulting \nthe laity.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The cases themselves are horrifying: men of \nfaith, respected and relied upon in their\u0014\n                      communities, taking terrible advantage of their \nmost vulnerable parishioners, mostly\u0014\n                      boys and teens. Many incidents date back \ndecades; virtually no region of the country\u0014\n                      is untouched. And still new cases were \nsurfacing as late as last week: Washington,\u0014\n                      D.C.'s Cardinal Theodore McCarrick suspended a \nprominent, popular priest, Msgr.\u0014\n                      Russell Dillard, after two women reported \nalleged sexual misconduct to the\u0014\n                      archdiocese. And on Friday, the Detroit Free \nPress reported that former Major League\u0014\n                      Baseball player Tom Paciorek said he and three \nof his brothers had been molested by\u0014\n                      a priest who was removed from a Michigan church \nlast week. It's unlikely that this is\u0014\n                      the last case, either.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But beyond the actions of individual priests, \nrevelations about coverups by some\u0014\n                      church leaders are equally distressing. What \nhas emerged is a practice of silencing\u0014\n                      the victims and their families while shuttling \nthe miscreant to another postand a new\u0014\n                      crop of potential victims. In one of the most \nshocking cases, the Boston Globe\u0014\n                      reported in January that Boston's Cardinal \nBernard Law had moved the Rev. John\u0014\n                      Geoghan in 1984 from one parish to another even \nthough his predatory sexual\u0014\n                      behavior was well documented. Geoghan, accused \nof fondling or raping more than\u0014\n                      130 children over 30 years, was sentenced to \nnine to 10 years in prison in February\u0014\n                      for fondling a 10-year-old boy. He still faces \ncharges of indecent assault and battery\u0014\n                      for allegedly molesting a boy in the 1990s.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Reassignments. Last week, the scandal touched \nthe nation's most prominent\u0014\n                      prelate: New York's Cardinal Edward Egan, who \nthe Hartford Courant says\u0014\n                      reassigned priests accused of sex abuse without \ninforming law enforcement\u0014\n                      authorities when he was the bishop in \nBridgeport, Conn. Egan had allegedly allowed\u0014\n                      several priests to continue working for years, \nfailed to aggressively investigate some\u0014\n                      allegations, and suggested that a dozen people \nwho complained about one priest may\u0014\n                      have been lying. The diocese last year settled \na court case against six priests and\u0014\n                      Egan for $12 million to $15 million. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The personal toll in these cases is \nheartbreaking. David Gagnon, now 37, says he\u0014\n                      was 15 when the Rev. Michael Doucette, an \nassistant priest in his parish in Biddeford,\u0014\n                      Maine, invited him to stay over. The abuse \nbegan that night and continued for three\u0014\n                      years. \"He said it was our unique relationship \nand not to talk to anyone about it,\" says\u0014\n                      Gagnon, who now lives in Ottawa. \"He called it \nour special friendship, just between\u0014\n                      us.\" In 1991, Gagnon reported it to the bishop, \nwho said he would investigate. Soon\u0014\n                      after, he says, Doucette sent him an apology \nletter, a legal release to sign, and a\u0014\n                      $10,000 check: \"go away and shut up money,\" \nGagnon calls it. A year later, Gagnon\u0014\n                      sued and settled the case for a modest amount. \nMost of the money has gone toward\u0014\n                      therapy, he says, yet he is forever a changed \nperson. \"I have had tremendous\u0014\n                      difficulty with intimacy,\" he says. \"Who wants \nto be dating somebody who has such a\u0014\n                      huge, gaping wound?\" He also lost much of the \nfaith that might have gotten him\u0014\n                      through the tough times. He is, he says, still \na \"spiritual person, but I wouldn't consider\u0014\n                      myself Catholic anymore.\" (Doucette was \nrecently dismissed after another young man\u0014\n                      came forward to say that the priest had made \nrepeated sexual advances toward him\u0014\n                      in the 1980s.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps most damaging to the church in the \nlonger haul is the loss of trust that\u0014\n                      Gagnon describes. \"If people cannot trust in \nthe leadership of the church, that it will\u0014\n                      maintain quality control over its most trusted \nservants, then 100 years of social capital\u0014\n                      will be quickly spent,\" says Appleby of Notre \nDame. A poll released last week found\u0014\n                      that about 75 percent of Catholics believe \nchurch leaders have done only a poor or\u0014\n                      fair job dealing with the issue. The poll, \nconducted by Zogby International and Le\u0014\n                      Moyne College, also said that 56 percent of \nCatholics who attend mass daily give\u0014\n                      leaders a negative rating for their handling of \nyouth sexual abuse by priests, showing\u0014\n                      a disgust among even the most devout Catholics. \nMeanwhile, the approval rating for\u0014\n                      American bishops has dropped sharply from 84 \npercent last October to 68 percent in\u0014\n                      March. \"They have totally lost all moral \nauthority,\" says Jan Leary, an organizer of an\u0014\n                      alternative Good Friday liturgy outside Law's \ncathedral in Boston this week. \"If they\u0014\n                      had been open about it in the beginning, so \nmuch abuse would have stopped. Anyone\u0014\n                      who keeps these secrets is not a good leader.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Suspicions. The scandals have in effect cast \ndoubt on all priests. \"It's made me look\u0014\n                      askance at certain men I've dealt with over the \nyears,\" says Dianne Knoblauch, 53, a\u0014\n                      17-year Catholic school teacher in Philadelphia \nso devoted to her faith that she\u0014\n                      attended two masses one recent Sunday. \"Now I \nwonder in the back of my mind.\" Pat\u0014\n                      Staflin, a 55-year-old former office manager, \nsays that although the crisis has not\u0014\n                      affected her faith, she worries about others. \n\"I fear it will shake the faith of many\u0014\n                      pew-sitting Catholics because they can't help \nbut look at priests differently,\" says\u0014\n                      Staflin, a parishioner at Maryland's St. \nBernadette. \"Now, instead of the respect that\u0014\n                      comes with the collar, there's going to be some \ndoubt.\" Staflin says if she had young\u0014\n                      childrenher three are now adultsshe would \nleave them in the company of a priest\u0014\n                      only if she knew him very well. \"I would have \nsome difficulty saying to my kids, 'Go to\u0014\n                      the ballgame with Father,' \" she says, \"whereas \n20 years ago, it was the norm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Good priests feel humiliated by the taint of \ntheir accused brethren. \"It's not often that\u0014\n                      we witness the death of a mystique,\" says \nDaniel Maguire, a former priest who\u0014\n                      currently is a moral theologian at Marquette \nUniversity. \"Catholic priests have had the\u0014\n                      highest possible prestige. Now, you have sick \npriests who preyed on children and a\u0014\n                      hierarchy that aided and abetted the \nmolestation of children through a deliberate\u0014\n                      coverup.\" The Most Rev. Robert Mulvee, 72, \nbishop of the diocese of Providence,\u0014\n                      says he wakes up at 3 a.m., sick with grief. \n\"It's like being hit with a tidal wave. You\u0014\n                      know you'll get your feet on the ground, but \nyou don't know when. . . . What more can\u0014\n                      we do?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That's exactly the question parishioners most \nwant the church to answer. In finding a\u0014\n                      solution, church leaders will not have to start \nfrom scratch. After an eruption of\u0014\n                      sex-abuse cases in the early 1990s, American \nbishops in 1993 adopted what then\u0014\n                      was seen as a tough set of standards aimed at \nrooting out sexually abusive priests\u0014\n                      and helping victims recover from their \nspiritual and psychological wounds. Based on\u0014\n                      those guidelines, most of the nation's 188 \ndioceses adopted stricter rules and\u0014\n                      procedures. But enforcement was left up to each \nlocal bishop and, critics say, some\u0014\n                      were more aggressive than others. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now, the American bishops are looking for ways \nto clamp down harder. In mid-March,\u0014\n                      leaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops announced that the sex-abuse\u0014\n                      scandal will be on the agenda at their next \ngeneral meeting in Dallas in June. The\u0014\n                      conference's Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse \nhas been asked to make\u0014\n                      recommendations for a \"comprehensive response\" \non the national level. \"We've done\u0014\n                      a lot,\" says Bishop Wilton Gregory of \nBelleville, Ill., president of the national\u0014\n                      conference. \"The fact that it's still a \npressing issue makes it apparent that we have not\u0014\n                      done all we may have to do.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Unconvincing.\" But just how far the bishops \nmight go in mandating change is\u0014\n                      uncertain. Some bishops contend that the \nconference has no authority to impose rules\u0014\n                      on local dioceses, out of respect for the \nautonomy of each bishop. \"This is\u0014\n                      unconvincing,\" writes the Rev. Thomas Reese, \neditor of the Catholic magazine\u0014\n                      America, in a recent editorial, \"considering \nthat bishops have adopted rules\u0014\n                      micromanaging such things as when people can \nkneel and stand during the\u0014\n                      eucharistic prayer.\" Reese thinks \ninvestigations of sex abuse should be taken out of\u0014\n                      the hands of clergy and given to an independent \nboard of laypersons in each diocese.\u0014\n                      \"No professional grouplawyers, police, \naccountants, doctorsis good at policing\u0014\n                      itself,\" says Reese. \"For the clergy, this is \neven more difficult not only because they\u0014\n                      are investigating their brothers but also \nbecause their whole training urges them\u0014\n                      toward forgiveness rather than punishment.\" \nWhatever the U.S. bishops decide to do,\u0014\n                      it is unlikely to fully succeed, some say, \nwithout the support of the Vatican. Gregory,\u0014\n                      the bishops' president, plans to go to Rome \nnext month to talk with the pope and other\u0014\n                      Vatican officials to stress \"the seriousness of \nthis moment\" in the American church\u0014\n                      and \"to seek their guidance.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is even a sense among some Catholics that \ngood still can emerge from this\u0014\n                      crisisif the church reforms itself. \"The \nbeginning of the good news must begin with\u0014\n                      the current crisis and must go deeper than \nthat,\" says Appleby at Notre Dame. Experts\u0014\n                      say the church needs binding policies on every \nbishop to screen seminarians, support\u0014\n                      priests in their vow of celibacy, yank priests \nfrom pastoral duties when accusations\u0014\n                      are made, afford priests due process, and \npermanently remove those found guilty of\u0014\n                      sexual misconduct. Observers add that U.S. \nbishops need to adopt a new political\u0014\n                      culture that embraces consultation, debate, and \naccountability. \"They need to be\u0014\n                      accountable to the people and their pastors,\" \nsays Appleby.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another aspect of church life that some \nCatholics are debating is the church's\u0014\n                      long-standing policy of priestly celibacy (box, \nPage 54). \"The pedophilia problem has\u0014\n                      nothing to do with celibacy or homosexuality,\" \nsays the Rev. Joel Garner, pastor of a\u0014\n                      Catholic church in Albuquerque, N.M. \"These are \ndeeply flawed human persons who\u0014\n                      cannot relate sexually at an adult level, \nwhether it be with a male or female.\" Still, the\u0014\n                      official Catholic newspaper of Boston's \narchdiocese recently editorialized that the\u0014\n                      Catholic Church should now study whether the \npriesthood should continue to be\u0014\n                      celibate. It's unlikely, though, that the \nVatican will bend that rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The crisis probably will hurt the church's \nrecruitment efforts at a time when it already\u0014\n                      faces a dire shortage of priests. The number of \npriests nationwide has dropped from\u0014\n                      58,632 in 1965 to 45,191 last year, even as the \nCatholic population in the United States\u0014\n                      grew from 45 million to 60 million nationally. \nPart of this shift is due to major social\u0014\n                      changes; a generation ago, many seminarians \ncame from mostly immigrant,\u0014\n                      working-class families, but today's more \neducated, wealthier Catholics seek other\u0014\n                      career choices. With the scandals, there's \nenormous fear that even fewer men will\u0014\n                      pick the priesthood as a vocation. \"We're at a \nvery serious crisis point,\" says Sister\u0014\n                      Katarina Schuth, a seminary instructor at \nMinnesota's University of St. Thomas. \"I\u0014\n                      honestly wonder about the size of next year's \nclass.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Screening. Seminaries have already made major \nchanges in the way they screen\u0014\n                      and train potential priests. Candidates are \ninterviewed repeatedly by psychologists\u0014\n                      and church officialsand many don't make it. \nThese days, seminarians also spend\u0014\n                      much more time in classes that cover their \nidentity as a human being and as a sexual\u0014\n                      being, as well as celibacy and boundaries. \nDioceses have gotten better at talking\u0014\n                      about sex and lust. \"The modern seminary is a \nvery different place from what the\u0014\n                      old-style seminary was,\" says the Rev. Tom \nBaima, 49, the provost of Mundelein (Ill.)\u0014\n                      Seminary. \"There is what you could call a \ncurriculum in celibacy, where every year a\u0014\n                      different aspect is treated in a different way. \n. . . We're not just talking about genital\u0014\n                      expressionbut about loneliness, desire, \nintimacy, the whole range.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some view this as a moment in which \nrank-and-file Catholics will try to reclaim their\u0014\n                      church. \"The laity is rising up in ways they \nhaven't before,\" says Maguire, the\u0014\n                      Marquette University theologian. \"The old \ntop-heavy hierarchical church is passing\u0014\n                      away right before our eyes.\" That is already \nstarting to happen at churches like St.\u0014\n                      John the Evangelist in Wellesley, Mass. At \nfirst, Jim Muller, a 59-year-old cardiologist\u0014\n                      and lifelong Catholic, was so disgusted with \nthe national crisis he was ready to quit\u0014\n                      the church. But then he and other parishioners \nasked their pastor if they could hold a\u0014\n                      meeting in the church hall. That one meeting \nhas turned into a weekly event.\u0014\n                      \"Parishioners talk about their love of the \nfaith and their desire to do something\u0014\n                      positive,\" says Muller. And now Muller has \nchanged his mind about leaving the church:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We say, 'Keep the faith; change the church.' \" \nl\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With Nancy Bentrup, Dan Gilgoff, Katy Kelly, \nKit R.

    "words": "Chastity and lust\u0014\n                      Is there a psychological link between sexuality,\u0014\n                      celibacy, and predation?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Marianne Szegedy-Maszak \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Poverty. Chastity. Obedience. \"Can anything be \nmore un-American?\" asks Thomas\u0014\n                      Plante, a psychology professor at Santa Clara \nUniversity. Plante, who counsels and\u0014\n                      screens Catholic priests in California, is half \njoking, of course. But his dark humor\u0014\n                      illuminates the enormous psychological and \nmaterial sacrifices required to live the\u0014\n                      priestly life in a culture as saturated in \nsexuality and materialism as post-1960s\u0014\n                      America. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the reports of sexual perversion and child \nabuse in the Roman Catholic\u0014\n                      Church have reached near-epidemic proportions, \none of  these vows in\u0014\n                      particular has been singled out for scrutiny: \ncelibacy. Some have suggested\u0014\n                      that a celibate life is so unnatural that it  \nmakes otherwise normal men lust after\u0014\n                      children. Others argue that the very structure \nof the priesthood\u0014\n                      attracts those who recognize those dark \nyearnings in themselves and are drawn to a\u0014\n                      life of repressed sexuality. But in teasing out \npsychological explanations for the\u0014\n                      current crisis in the church, a fundamental \nquestion lingers: Is there a difference\u0014\n                      between a typical pedophile and one who wears a \nRoman collar?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pedophilia is defined simply as intense, \nsexually arousing fantasies, urges, or activity\u0014\n                      with a prepubescent child. But it's difficult \nto characterize a typical pedophile. They\u0014\n                      include a wide range of personalities, social \nclasses, and educational backgrounds,\u0014\n                      and the list of possible contributing factors \nis long: everything from substance abuse\u0014\n                      to endocrine disorders. While up to 80 percent \nof pedophiles suffer from some kind of\u0014\n                      physical sexual disorder, many have other \ndisorders as well. More than half, for\u0014\n                      example, are alcoholics.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Compared with other pedophiles, pedophiliac \nclergy tend to be older and more highly\u0014\n                      educated. While pedophiles in general are \nsociopaths, with histories of crime and\u0014\n                      violence, pedophiliac clergy are not, according \nto several studies. They tend instead to\u0014\n                      be sexually conflicted. And sexual-abuse \nvictims often grow up to become abusers:\u0014\n                      Indeed, 70 percent of pedophiliac priests were \nthemselves sexually abused as\u0014\n                      children. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seeking haven. The celibacy-pedophilia link is \ncomplex. While there is no real\u0014\n                      evidence that sexual abstinence leads to sexual \nperversion, the celibate life might\u0014\n                      appeal to those who are uncomfortable with \ntheir own sexuality, says Ronald\u0014\n                      Langevin, a psychologist at the University of \nToronto. They may imagine that the\u0014\n                      priesthood will help them cope with their \ndisorder and repress their sexual yearnings:\u0014\n                      \"But they end up acting out.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many priests, like the Rev. Robert Stewart, the \npastor at Holy Family Church in Kansas\u0014\n                      City, Mo., do \"not have a problem with \ncelibacy.\" Stewart, 53, has been a priest since\u0014\n                      he was 33 and explains: \"If one orients one's \nlife to doing the work of Christ, if one\u0014\n                      forms healthy relationships with family and \nfriends, if one prays and studies and uses\u0014\n                      energy properly, it's difficult but it's not \nimpossible. It's difficult to be married, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Despite the common image of a priest sodomizing \na 9-year-old altar boy, most of the\u0014\n                      priest abusers are technically \n\"ephebophiles\"that is, they abuse adolescents rather\u0014\n                      than children. An extensive study of Catholic \nclergy and sexual abuse was conducted\u0014\n                      by the Chicago archdiocese in the early 1990s. \nSome 2,200 priestsevery priest who\u0014\n                      had ever served the archdiocese in the previous \n40 yearswere surveyed, and every\u0014\n                      internal complaint was re-examined. The survey \nfound that about 40 priests, or 1.8\u0014\n                      percent, were guilty of some sexual misconduct \nwith minors. But only one of those\u0014\n                      was actually a pedophile. There is no real cure \nfor pedophilia, although counseling can\u0014\n                      help men resist their urges. Men who are \nephebophiles, however, are more likely to\u0014\n                      become more fully functional, since their \nattraction is often predicated on an adult,\u0014\n                      heterosexual maladjustment, rather than a deep \nattraction to children. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Priests today must go through a screening \nprocess that has changed dramatically\u0014\n                      over the past decade, says Sister Katarina \nSchuth, a seminary instructor at\u0014\n                      Minnesota's University of St. Thomas. \nCandidates for the priesthood are interviewed\u0014\n                      repeatedly by both psychologists and church \nofficialsat the beginning of their\u0014\n                      candidacy and at several stages afterwardand \nare questioned about relationships\u0014\n                      with family, friends, and the opposite sex.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many of the priests being charged today were \nordained at a time when screening\u0014\n                      was much less rigorous. So it's possible that \nup-and-coming priests are as a group\u0014\n                      more psychologically healthy. But the fact is \nthat no screening is foolproof. What is\u0014\n                      essential, psychologists say, is that aberrant \nbehavior be seen and treated as mental\u0014\n                      illness. \"Initially, the church viewed sexual \noffenses as sins to be confessed rather\u0014\n                      than a sickness to be treated, \" writes Curtis \nBryant, a former director of inpatient\u0014\n                      clinical services at St. Luke's, a treatment \ncenter for priests in Silver Spring, Md.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the end, the vows of poverty, chastity, and \nobedience hold a clue to the great\u0014\n                      psychological strengthand the greatest \nweaknessof the church. It is, according to\u0014\n                      psychiatrist Volney Gay of Vanderbilt \nUniversity, a \"total institution, and some who\u0014\n                      enter it seek to be relieved of the burden of \nindividual choice; you own nothing, you\u0014\n                      are given a new name, you renounce sexuality. \nIt is a complete supplanting of the\u0014\n                      self.\" And as such it will always attract the \ntruly holyand the truly troubled.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With Michael Schaffer and Dan Gilgoff, US News \nand World Report\u0014",

It will take many \nmillions more to\u0014\n                         settle just the lawsuits we know about. \nBishops and\u0014\n                         cardinals could face criminal prosecution in \naddition to\u0014\n                         civil litigation for choosing to reassign \npriests charged\u0014\n                         with pedophilia rather than turning them \nover to the\u0014\n                         authorities. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The Catholic hierarchy hasnt even \nbegun to come\u0014\n                         to grips with the implications of the \nunfolding revelations.\u0014\n                         The church faces a crisis of confidence not \nunlike that\u0014\n                         which periodically seizes Capitol Hill, \nanother institution\u0014\n                         with rigid rules and a hierarchical \nleadership based on\u0014\n                         seniority. Like the church, Congress makes \nlaws but\u0014\n                         doesnt always follow them.

The \nmedia is an\u0014\n                         agency of grace, bringing light to the \nchurch, says a\u0014\n                         diocesan priest, who wishes to remain \nanonymous. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 That priest says that those who \nembrace modern\u0014\n                         views do not rise in the church hierarchy \nbecause they\u0014\n                         cant pass the ideological test, much like \nthe old\u0014\n                         Communist Party.

These men are American Vatican \nbureaucrats,\u0014\n                         more focused on politics than ministering to \na real-world\u0014\n                         flock. Few within the church mourn their \nfall from grace.\u0014\n                         People are sitting on the sidelines \ncheering, this priest\u0014\n                         observes. A Washington-area priest used his \nPalm\u0014\n                         Sunday sermon to call for Laws resignation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                         It is tempting to predict that the church is \non the\u0014\n                         verge of a second Reformation, and that it \nwill emerge\u0014\n                         stronger than ever. But reforming the church \nis not unlike\u0014\n                         reforming politics. Pope John Paul II has \nbeen in power\u0014\n                         since 1978, long enough to have named \nvirtually every\u0014\n                         bishop in America. All of this popes \nappointees are\u0014\n                         ideologically conservative. What has \nhappened mirrors a\u0014\n                         U.S. president stacking the courts. With \nJohn Paul\u0014\n                         loyalists at every level, social change will \nbe wrenching, if\u0014\n                         not impossible. As a group, theyre like \nthe Taliban. If\u0014\n                         you want to succeed in this system, you \nnever talk about\u0014\n                         the ordination of womenand abortion and \nbirth control\u0014\n                         are like the third rail, says this diocesan \npriest. Now in\u0014\n                         his mid-50s, he has watched the church \nelevate only\u0014\n                         those priests who represent a hidebound \ntraditionalism.\u0014\n                         Its all coming home to roost, he says. \nTheyre not\u0014\n                         capable of dealing in a more diverse \ncommunity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 A member of Congress home for the \nspring recess\u0014\n                         recalls attending the annual Catholic \nCharities dinner in\u0014\n                         his district. He goes every year and admires \nthe groups\u0014\n                         activism on behalf of the poor. They always \nhave a\u0014\n                         speaker who has performed extraordinary good \nworks,\u0014\n                         and the evening never fails to stir him. \nWhen I come to\u0014\n                         this dinner, I think about converting to \nCatholicism, he\u0014\n                         says. Then I think about the popeand how \nsclerotic\u0014\n                         and calcified the church is.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Pope John Paul is sick, and has been \nfor some time.\u0014\n                         His increasing disability has made him more \nremote, and\u0014\n                         there are whispers among the clergy that \nnobody is in\u0014\n                         charge. For the first time, the Vatican \nadmitted the pope\u0014\n                         could not stand for services on Palm Sunday. \nThe papal\u0014\n                         courtiers have surrounded him, and the vapid \npress\u0014\n                         statements emerging from the cocoon \nunderscore how\u0014\n                         disconnected the hierarchy is from the \ntumult within the\u0014\n                         church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The papacy as we know it is a \n19th-century\u0014\n                         convention. The idea that in an age of \ne-mail and fax,\u0014\n                         and the ability to whisk around the globe in \njets,\u0014\n                         everybody kowtows to a central figure seems \nquaint. The\u0014\n                         church is not a democracy, but neither is it \na totalitarian\u0014\n                         state. \u0014\n                                 Members of Congress are not saying \nmuch. They\u0014\n                         dont want to risk offending Catholics, and \ntheres no role\u0014\n                         for government in the affairs of this \nchurch. But a House\u0014\n                         Republican aide, a devout Catholic, voiced \nwhat many\u0014\n                         are feeling. The church has let this stuff \ngo on for way\u0014\n                         too long, he says, recalling as a boy the \nlore about\u0014\n                         which priests everybody knew to avoid. He \nwonders\u0014\n                         whether celibacy is possible in the modern \nera. Not that\u0014\n                         celibacy is the cause of deviancy, but the \npool of people\u0014\n                         who think they can live a life of celibacy \nis too small to fill\u0014\n                         the churchs needs. The priesthood attracts \nsexually\u0014\n                         conflicted men, and the church will have to \nface up to\u0014\n                         that as a potentially criminal matter, not \nas a way to\u0014\n                         perpetuate an outdated custom of celibacy. \u0014\n                                \u0014\n                                 2002 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

    "words": "Confronted with the \nShameful\u0014\n\u0014\nHow you should respondlegally and responsiblywhen a staff member is \naccused of child molestation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Woodruff and Dennis Kasper\u0014\n\u0014\nNews stories of child molestation in the church cross our desk with \nalarming regularity. Recently prominent churches in the Midwest and \nSouth have been tragically shaken by allegations of criminal sexual \nconduct. Because of pending litigation and privacy issues, churches \nare reluctant to share the details of their experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Leadership came across a story that has run the circuit of \naccusation, investigation, and resolution. Mike Woodruff obtained \npermission to write the story of a church on the West Coast that \nlived through this crisis. As Mike relays the pastor's story, we've \ninterspersed the counsel of Dennis Kasper, an attorney specializing \nin church crisis management, who comments on the steps necessary in \nresponding to charges of sexual misconduct with a minor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor's story:\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Woodruff\u0014\nOur youth intern is in jail, two boys are in therapy, and one family \nhas left the church. What started out as the renewal of our middle \nschool ministry ended in shameful tragedy. \u0014\n\u0014\nI had no indication anything was wrong until the day our 25-year-old \nyouth intern, Roy, asked for a meeting with the pastoral staff. As we \ngathered on that Wednesday afternoon nearly five years ago, our jaws \ndropped open and our mouths went dry as Roy began confessing \ninappropriate, make that horrific actions, including smoking \nmarijuana with a 15-year-old student and renting a hotel room so the \ntwo of them could drink \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein and watch \u0014\nR-rated movies.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the worst was yet to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater that week, Roy was arrested on five felony counts of child \nmolestation. Because the youth in question was a member of our \nchurch, and because Roy claimed that the molestation charges were \nfalse, we were faced with a complicated crisis. The watchful eye of \nthe press ensured the crisis would be public.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe attorney's analysis:\u0014\n\u0014\nDennis Kasper\u0014\nIn such a situation, several concerns must be kept in mind: the \ninitial crisis response, communication, the ensuing investigation, \nand resolution, including ministry to the involved parties and their \nfamilies. Each concern is loaded with legal and spiritual \nramifications. \u0014\n\u0014\nNumerous people are involved: the victim, the victim's family, the \naccused, the accused's family, witnesses, other students and parents \ninvolved in the youth group, the church, the authorities, the media, \nand the community. Prepared leadership, coupled with wise legal \ncounsel, can manage these concerns.\u0014\n\u0014\nWoodruff: Roy came to us on an unpaid internship from our \ndenominational seminary. We welcomed him onto our staff after we had \ncontacted previous employers and run a criminal background check, \nwhich he passed.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoy jumped into the job with great vigor, quickly forming friendships \nwith a number of the kids. He was especially determined to win his \nway into the lives of those on the fringes. Roy spent the most time \nwith a boy named Jessie, a 15-year-old from a single-parent home, \nwhose mother attended our church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happened next depends on whose account you believe. According to \nRoy, trying to fit into the lives of the youth mushroomed into an \nunhealthy desire for acceptance. Jessie took advantage of that \nweakness, manipulating Roy into purchasing cigarettes for him, then \nproviding alcohol, and eventually smoking pot with him. Roy claims he \nwas motivated solely by a desire to befriend Jessie and see him turn \nhis life around. He described a desperate attempt to shake Jessie \nloose from the grip of drug use.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jessie, I'd do anything to get you off of drugs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Okay, I'll quit. Just smoke pot with me one time, and I'll quit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRoy did.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jessie didn't keep the promise to stop doing drugs, Roy \nconfronted him. \"Look, Jessie, I can't keep quiet about this. You're \nhurting yourself. I'm going to have to bring your mom and the other \npastors into this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you do,\" Roy claimed Jessie said, \"I'll tell them you smoked \npot.\" Right then Roy realized his mistakes were going to mean trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoy claims he was blackmailed by Jessie and duped into a downward \nspiral of poor decisions until the gravity of the situation forced \nhim to confess. \"I didn't feel like I had a choice,\" says Roy. \n\"Things were out of control. I was so sick of what was going on, but \nI didn't see a way out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe events culminated when Roywho was boarding with someone from the \nchurchrented a hotel room as a \"safe\" place to drink with the youth. \nDuring their second drinking party they also watched movies with \ngraphic sex scenes. Roy claims Jessie was drunk and began to \nmasturbate. When he couldn't talk Jessie out of it, Roy locked \nhimself in the bathroom for an hour.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was shaking and sweating and throwing up,\" claims Roy. \"I knew \nthings were over, one way or the other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, Roy asked for the meeting that shocked our staff.\u0014\n\u0014\nJessie's account is considerably more sordid, and involves charges of \nmolestation. It suggests Roy was a crafty manipulator who was \ngrooming Jessie for a homosexual encounter from the beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nKasper: What do you do in this situation? Given the conflicting \naccounts, how do you juggle lawyers, reporters, counselors, gossips, \nvictims, an accused staff member, and a church on the side?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact is, no one is completely capable of dealing with situations \nthis complicated, this significant, and this demanding of time and \nresources. For that reason, I urge churches to form a Crisis Response \nTeam. The response team's job is to move quickly to address all the \npreviously stated concerns in a unified way, while minimizing \ndisruption and damage.\u0014\n\u0014\nA crisis necessitating a response team doesn't have to involve sexual \nmisconduct. A crisis is any unplanned event that presents either a \nsignificant risk or a significant distraction to the church. By that \ndefinition, crises may include natural disasters, accidents, \nmisconduct, strife, and a host of other possibilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Crisis Response Team should be appointed by the pastor and/or \nboard and consist of several key people:\u0014\n\ta member of the pastoral staff (if possible) \u0014\n\ta member of the church governing board \u0014\n\tsomeone with excellent writing and verbal communications skills \u0014\n\tsomeone with pastoral care or mental health care skills \u0014\n\tsomeone with legal or investigative training \u0014\n\tsomeone with a heart for intercessory prayer \u0014\nExperience has taught me that this group should not include the \nentire staff because the pastors' energy and focus will be demanded \nelsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese members need not meet regularly, but must be available to drop \neverything and meet immediately in time of crisis. Meeting the same \nday of a crisis, or at the latest the next day, can be crucial. \nParticularly in misconduct cases, word of the crisis spreads quickly \n(often through the victim's family), and the law may dictate the \nchurch take immediate action.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen activated, the Crisis Response Team should have the authority to \nmake quick and ongoing decisions. They should report regularly during \nthe crisis to the pastor and board.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case involving Roy, an impromptu response team was formed out \nof the available pastoral staff. While this can work, I would \nrecommend pre-selecting, and possibly even pre-training, a group of \nrespected, mature, and level-headed people to fill out the team.\u0014\n\u0014\nCrisis response\u0014\nWoodruff: After a quick huddle with the pastoral staff, we called \nJessie's mother and accompanied Roy while he shared the \"facts\" as we \nnow had them. That evening she confronted her son, who offered his \ncompletely different account. They immediately asked to meet with us \nto explain his side of the story. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the surfacing of molestation allegations, we had no choice but \nto phone the police.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the advice of our denominational leaders, we also prepared a \nstatement for the press, notified our insurance company of a possible \nlawsuit, and prepared a letter to the entire church explaining as \nmuch as we could be certain of.\u0014\n\u0014\nKasper:The church was wise to respond swiftly. With the possible \nexception of trying to conduct their own investigation, they handled \nthe situation reasonably well and took steps to protect themselves \nlegally.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral actions are key to handling a crisis well. Having a \nseveral-member response team will enable you do these things quickly.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Meet immediately with legal counsel. It is unlikely someone within \nthe church will be sufficiently trained to handle this kind of \nsituationconsult someone specializing in church crisis management. \nYou will want to specifically discuss issues of how to protect the \nwork of the team under the attorney/client privilege.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Determine if any criminal report is required. Many states mandate \nreporting incidents involving minors immediately. Attorney Stephen \nChawaga warns, \"Failure to take action after hearing of a complaint, \nor turning a blind eye to misconduct a later investigation reveals, \npractically guarantees that your church will be sued\" (\"The Ten \nDeadly Lawsuits,\" Your Church, May/June 2001).\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Advise the accused to seek an attorney. Especially in the case of \ncriminal allegation, the church can have no part in offering the \naccused what may be construed as legal counsel.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Contact your church's insurance company. Most church insurance \nproviders protect against certain lawsuits. Just as you would contact \nyour auto insurer in case of accident, contact the church's insurer \nto guide you through the necessary steps to ensure coverage.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Assign liaisons. A point person should maintain regular contact \nand provide pastoral support to the victim and the victim's family. A \ndifferent person should do the same for the accused.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Develop a plan of communication. Select a point person to handle \ncommunication specifically with the church, the media, the \nauthorities, and the lawyers. Agree upon what, to whom, and how \ncommunication will be offered. Generally, the closer a person is to \nthe situation the more detail they need to know.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Develop a plan for further investigation. A church should not try \nto investigate the guilt or innocence of the accused. Criminal \ninvestigation must be left to the authorities. But it is important \nfor a church to determine if there are any other victims.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Make counseling available. Prepare, practically and financially, \nto provide professional counseling for the victims, victims' \nfamilies, and other affected youths in the program.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommunication strategy\u0014\nWoodruff: As soon as charges were filed, we began to receive phone \ncalls from local radio stations and newspapers. We had anticipated \nthis. Our staff agreed that only one person would act as the \nspokesman for the church, and all requests for information would be \nchanneled to him. This helped us avoid issuing contradictory \nstatements and put our best communicator in the spotlight. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe took the stance that the media was a neutral party and that \ncertain questions needed to be answered publicly. Nonetheless, we \nguarded our words to protect privacy and to avoid issuing opinions or \nspeculation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the Sunday following Roy's arrest we spent the entire Sunday \nschool hour in a forum with the church body answering questions about \nthe charges. We needed to squelch rumors and provide as many facts as \nwe could. We held a similar session during youth group later that \nweek.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt each forum I read the prepared statement, which included a summary \nof the accusations. I informed the congregation of the likelihood of \na police investigation and upcoming legal action. I asked them to \npray for both parties. Then we opened the forum for questions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe silence was thick.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a long, torturous pause of shuffling bulletins and echoed \ncoughs, the first question came. \"Are we vulnerable to a lawsuit?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What are our obligations to the accused?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was a harder question. Our primary responsibility had to be to \nJessie and his family. It hurt to say it, but we had no obligation to \nRoy. Our attorney advised us that it's considered an improper use of \ncharitable funds to defend criminal activity. We recommended to Roy \nthat he get his own legal counsel. So our contact with Roy would be \nlimited.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What did we do wrong?\" someone asked. \"How could this happen?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was the hardest question of all. We didn't have any answers. Yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nKasper: The church handled this situation well. Observe each of their \nchoices: they prepared formal statements, limiting such revelations \nto fact; public communication was directed to one designated \nspokesperson; they remembered that both the victim and the accused \nhave certain rights to privacy (for instance, a minor cannot have his \nidentity shared); they sought to stay ahead of the gossip curve by \nproviding facts on a \"need to know\" basis and quelling speculation; \nand finally, a method was developed for the church and concerned \npeople to question the response team.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo further points need addressing. First, do not assume either party \nis telling the whole truth. Often, a victim isn't entirely \nforthcoming. In the effort to protect themselves and avoid blame for \ncertain events, both the victim and the accused may tell only part of \nthe story. A church cannot get caught up in the \"he said, she said\" \ngame and should avoid all temptations to determine guilt or innocence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, realize those closest to the situation need the most \ninformation, while those furthest removed need the least. It is \nunwise (and sometimes unlawful) to share details with the public. \nMore information needs to be shared with the church, then more with \nthe youth group, and more still with the families involved.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, a media statement may include the fact that there's \nbeen an allegation, that a crisis response team is evaluating \nappropriate actions, and that the church is offering professional \ncounseling to potential victimsnothing more. The church may be \ninformed additionally of the response team's names and dates for \ncommunication forums. The youth group's parents will need assurance \nthat actions are being taken to protect their children. The victim's \nparents need to know what care and counseling is available to them \nand their child.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigation\u0014\nWoodruff: Roy's prosecuting attorney later spoke of how we handled \nthe allegation: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The one mistake the church made was in starting to conduct the \ninvestigation themselves. Church staff are not prepared for this type \nof work, and instead of trying to find out what actually happened, \nthey should have immediately called the police. You are free to tell \nthe person that you are going to report them, but you cannot fail to \nreport them just because they claim innocence or state that a false \naccusation will ruin them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKasper: A church must never attempt to determine if the accused is \nguilty of a crime. That's the job of the police. Any attempt to \ndetermine guilt puts the church in the precarious position of \nbecoming a witness in a criminal case. When there are criminal \nallegations, your church's first steps are clearly defined: call your \nlawyer, call the authorities, and advise the accused to seek his or \nher own attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is, however, an important place for investigation in these \nmatters. The investigation's purpose is not to determine guilt. \nInstead, an investigation should be conducted to determine if other \nvictims are involved, to determine if disciplinary action needs to be \ntaken, and to determine if church procedures need to be changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo determine if there are any other victims, I recommend publicizing \nthe provision of mental health care, as victims may be more likely to \ncome forward to get help. It is important to discover who has been \naffected by the actions in question.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften, even without being found guilty of a crime, the accused merits \ndiscipline (i.e. firing) for violating clear church policy. \nOccasionally, action needs to be taken against other staff members or \nvolunteers as well. Even as an unpaid intern, Roy could have been \nfired for committing a crime (providing cigarettes and alcohol to a \nminor), since that was admitted by all parties. In other cases, even \nwithout determining guilt, grounds for firing can be met on the basis \nof inappropriate advances, unsupervised contact, or wrongful counsel. \nFormal action should only be taken after consulting your lawyer to \navoid violating employment law.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, an investigation may reveal that the church needs to \nchange its supervision or accountability policies. Perhaps an \ninvestigation will reveal the need to redefine or clarify church \npolicy regarding sexual boundaries and misconduct.\u0014\n\u0014\nLastly, make sure to coordinate the investigation with your lawyer. \nYou may want to discuss the specific questions being asked of \ninterviewees, how to take and legally protect the notes from those \nconversations, how to protect the investigators via attorney/client \nprivilege, and how to protect the accused's Fifth Amendment rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nResolution\u0014\nWoodruff: The three months leading up to the trial were tense, to say \nthe least. People constantly wanted updates. A few criticized us for \nnot publicly backing Jessie, but as church leaders we needed to \nmaintain a legal neutrality. I did, however, spend considerable time \nprivately counseling and supporting Jessie's family. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of our criticism came from those who thought we weren't doing \nenough. Jessie's family was angry for not receiving more support from \nchurch members. Though we couldn't publicly name Jessie, still his \nfamily argued, \"Everyone knows by now. Why aren't people reaching out \nto us?\" Roy's family was also angered that we didn't provide \nfinancial help with legal fees.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we faced the lingering question, \"How could this happen?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOur staff eventually determined there were several changes in policy \nthat needed to be made to infuse our youth ministry with more \naccountability, rules, and supervision.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church also offered to pay for all of Jessie's family's \ncounseling, but we did not pay for Roy's. Some church members \nattempted to stay in touch with him, and I prayed with him on several \noccasions, but knowing I might be subpoenaed, I found it difficult to \noffer any meaningful care.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the eleventh hour the prosecution offered to drop all of the child \nmolestation charges if Roy would plead guilty to lesser offenses. The \nfamily was not out for vengeance, and they did not want to drag \nJessie through a trial that would likely turn nasty. Roy accepted the \nplea bargain and was sentenced to one year in the local jail.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemarkably, the entire crisis was weathered without a lawsuit and \nwithout any noticeable exodus from the church or the youth program.\u0014\n\u0014\nKasper: Crises do not simply go away when the storm blows over. \nCommunication and ministry needs continue. The Crisis Response Team \nshould continue to meet and report regularly during the aftermath. \nThe point people assigned to the victim and the accused should \ncontinue to meet with their assigned person to keep communication \nflowing. The families and congregation should receive regular \nupdates. Providing counseling for the victims, witnesses, and their \nfamilies is essential.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, as the situation draws to a close, the team should meet \nwith their attorney to determine what was handled well, and what \nthings need to be done differently, both now and in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the results of the investigation should prompt decisions and \npolicy changes as necessary. It may be considered by many a healing \nbalm to know that the church is taking steps to prevent this kind of \ntragedy from happening again.\u0014\n\u0014\nWoodruff: Like any group that has weathered a storm like this, we \nexamined both the events leading up to the crisis and our response to \nit. Our staff met to discuss these issues. There were a few things we \ndid right with Roy, actions that prevented the situation from being \nmuch worse. But we also made some grievous mistakes that needed to be \ncorrected.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur largest mistake was allowing Roy to operate with too much \nautonomy. We had accountability meetings with Roy, thinking that was \nsufficient supervision, but we were wrong. Roy was still working as \nan island. We have since realized that he needed active partnership \nand mentoring that we didn't provide. Roy later confessed, \"I can't \nwatch a kid fail. I had a savior complex, and no one ever warned me \nof the problems that might cause.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also encountered a faulty assumption with our church insurance \npolicy. We discovered too late that our policy did not cover any of \nour staff if we faced criminal charges, only civil ones. Roy was \nforced to pay for his own legal representation, and we were left \nvulnerable to a lawsuit. We have since committed to reviewing our \npolicies annually.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, our staff affirmed the necessity of conducting background \nchecks, especially on those who work with children. It's likely that \nour thoroughness with Roy's background check saved us from a lawsuit. \nRoy's prosecuting attorney later attested, \"The church conducted a \ndecent background check on Roy. They reviewed his employment history, \nand they phoned the police in those states where he had been \npreviously employed to check on any criminal convictions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt has been nearly five years since Roy first confessed to buying \nJessie alcohol. Jessie has been greatly helped by counseling, and \nthough he no longer attends our church, his mother told me, \"If he \nstays with God through all of this, it will be because of your care.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Roy, he served his sentence in jail, where he was active in \nBible studies and found refuge with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was released after a one year jail term and no longer works in \nyouth ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Woodruff is associate pastor of Christ Church Lake Forest in \nLake Forest, Illinois.\u0014\nMikeWoodru@aol.com\u0014\nDennis Kasper is an attorney specializing in church law in Los \nAngeles, California.\u0014",

In a summer poll, 3-in-10 said Satan was \nmerely\u0014\n symbolic. Now only 2-in-10 deny his existence. Among adults of all \nages,\u0014\n only 23% said Satan is not a living being, a five-point change.\u0014\n\u0014\n If Satan is making a comeback, God took a slight hit (in the poll). \nFewer\u0014\n men think God is \"allknowing and allpowerful,\" a decline of six \npoints to\u0014\n 63%.\u0014\n\u0014\n The number of people claiming to have made a \"personal commitment to \nJesus\u0014\n Christ that is still important in your life today\" is unchanged at \n68%.\u0014\n\u0014\n Worship attendance is near normal levels again, Barna says. In a \nsummer\u0014\n survey, 42% of respondents reported attending a church service in the\u0014\n previous week.

    "title": "CHURCH STATE SEPARATION FACES CHALLENGES",
    "words": "Church-state separation faces post-Sept. 11 challenges\u0014\n\u0014\n By Robert Marus\u0014\n\u0014\n WASHINGTON (ABP)  Six months ago, God Bless America captured the \nspirit of renewed\u0014\n patriotism and religious fervor in a forever-changed United States.\u0014\n\u0014\n But did another famous motto  the separation of church and state  \nsuffer post-Sept. 11?\u0014\n\u0014\n Some observers think so.\u0014\n\u0014\n From proposed school-prayer amendments to the Constitution to county \ncommissions voting to\u0014\n post the Ten Commandments in their chambers, church-state activists \ndescribe an alarming\u0014\n increase in challenges to the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\u0014\n\u0014\n The September 11 tragedy and the atrocities of the Taliban provide \nan extreme example of\u0014\n what can happen when religious zeal is combined with coercive power, \nsaid Brent Walker,\u0014\n director of the Washington-based Baptist Joint Committee on Public \nAffairs. Americans now\u0014\n should be even more insistent upon upholding the wall of separation \nthat has served us so well.\u0014\n\u0014\n The words separation of church and state aren't in the Constitution. \nInstead, they were\u0014\n introduced in a letter written by one of its framers describing his \nviews about what the First\u0014\n Amendment implies.\u0014\n\u0014\n Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter Jan. 1, 1802, to a Baptist \nassociation in Danbury, Conn. It read\u0014\n in part: I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the \nwhole American people which\u0014\n declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or\u0014\n prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of \nseparation between church and\u0014\n State.\u0014\n\u0014\n Baptists historically supported the separation of church and state \non religious grounds, and the\u0014\n concept has been upheld in courts. More recently, however, some have \nchallenged a strict\u0014\n separationist view, claiming the First Amendment allows more \nlatitude for accommodation of\u0014\n religion.\u0014\n\u0014\n Such voices have stepped up efforts since Sept. 11:\u0014\n\u0014\n  Weeks after the terrorist attacks, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives passed a resolution\u0014\n encouraging the display of the words God bless America in public \nschools.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Religious Right leaders Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson said the \nattacks indicated that God\u0014\n was punishing America for supporting the principle of church-state \nseparation, as well as\u0014\n tolerating homosexuality and abortion. Falwell later apologized to \ngays and abortion-rights\u0014\n supporters, but not to church-state separationists.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In November, the House passed another resolution that said schools \nin the United States\u0014\n should set aside a sufficient period of time to allow children to \npray for, or quietly reflect on\u0014\n behalf of, the Nation during this time of struggle against the \nforces of international terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Dozens of municipalities across the country have voted to display \nthe Christian version of\u0014\n the Ten Commandments in civic buildings, such as city halls and \ncourthouses. One of the\u0014\n largest was the Knox County Commission in Knoxville, Tenn.\u0014\n\u0014\n  In January, Rep. Ernest Istook (R&Mac246;Okla.) for the third time \nin the last four years\u0014\n introduced into Congress a proposed amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution that would, for the\u0014\n first time, insert a reference to God into the Constitution. Critics \nsay it would encourage\u0014\n government-sanctioned school prayer and endorsement of religious \ndocuments.\u0014\n\u0014\n  A public school bus driver in Carroll County, Md., was removed \nfrom her route after refusing\u0014\n to stop her practice of leading the students in morning prayers. She \ntold the Washington Times\u0014\n she began doing it because of President Bush's call to pray for the \nnation after the Sept. 11\u0014\n attacks. She is suing the school district for alleged violation of \nher constitutional rights.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Most recently, on March 7, U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) \nintroduced his Ten\u0014\n Commandments Defense Act. It would allow government religious \ndisplays and instruct federal\u0014\n courts to find such displays constitutional. Aderholt attempted to \npass a similar piece of\u0014\n legislation in 1998, but it failed.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Several states have passed laws allowing or encouraging schools to \npost the words In God\u0014\n We Trust  the U.S. national motto. When Melissa Killingbeck, a \nteacher at Central Elementary\u0014\n School in Flushing, Mich., decided to post the words in her \nclassroom, she told the Flint Journal\u0014\n that she didn't feel the stating of the words were unconstitutional \nbecause, It was even upheld\u0014\n in court that this is not a religious symbol.\u0014\n\u0014\n Despite his concerns about such activity, Walker said some positive \naspects of America's\u0014\n commitment to religious liberty have also emerged in the wake of \nSept. 11.\u0014\n\u0014\n I think we've done a pretty good job here too, post 9-11, Walker \nsaid. Many  including\u0014\n President Bush  have stepped forward to defend the rights of \nAmerican Muslims so much that\u0014\n the president has been attacked by some on the far right as being \ntoo sympathetic to Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\n Indeed, Christian expressions are not the only ones that critics say \nhave crossed the\u0014\n church-state line in recent months.\u0014\n\u0014\n Last month, a school district in California came under fire from \nAmericans United for Separation\u0014\n of Church and State over a seventh-grade course on understanding \nIslam that required\u0014\n students to wear Muslim garb and adopt Islamic names.\u0014\n\u0014\n But challenges to church-state separation coming from Christians \ncontinue to be the most\u0014\n frequent post-Sept. 11 worry of separationist groups. In the January \nissue of Americans\u0014\n United's magazine, Church and State, an article examined the history \nof Jefferson's letter to the\u0014\n Danbury Baptists and the use of his phrase in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\n Robert O'Neil, head of the Jefferson Center at the University of \nVirginia and a legal expert on\u0014\n church-state issues, told the magazine he thinks attacking \nchurch-state separation is the wrong\u0014\n response to terrorist attacks.\u0014\n\u0014\n One of the things that has troubled me in recent weeks, O'Neil said, \nis that we haven't made\u0014\n enough of the extraordinary fact that Osama bin Laden and others \nlike him hate us so much\u0014\n and are so angry in part because we are a secular state.\u0014\n\u0014\n There are apparently a number of grievances from these individuals, \ncontinued O'Neil. But\u0014\n clearly one of them  and they've said it  is that we are a secular \nstate, church and state are\u0014\n separate and religion does not drive government. Insofar as that is \nseen as one of the things\u0014\n they despise and find alienating about us, I think we should pick up \non that. I am very\u0014\n disappointed that we have not. We have always been and will remain a \nsecular state.\u0014",

    "title": "CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE IN THE CHURCH",
    "words": "Celebrating Independence by Celebrating Religious Liberty\u0014\nBY Ray Furr\u0014\n\u0014\nJuly Fourth is an opportunity for churches to celebrate religious \nliberty, but it is not a time for holding a patriotic pep rally, \naccording to a church-state expert. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"A healthy sense of patriotism is good. But we are Christians first \nand Americans second,\" Brent Walker, executive director of the \nBaptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, told EthicsDaily.com. \nWalker noted that it is appropriate for Christians to refer to \nthemselves as American Christians, but cautioned people against \nreferring to themselves as Christian Americans. \u0014\n\u0014\nJames Miller, pastor of The First Baptist Church in Providence, R.I., \nhas little problem striking a note of national recognition while \nremaining worshipful in his church. Miller is pastor of the first \nBaptist church founded in America by ardent religious liberty \nadvocate Roger Williams. In the 17th century when all other \nneighboring settlements became modified versions of the Church of \nEngland, Providence remained as a place where everyone would have \nreligious freedom and complete separation of church and state. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We have almost no symbols at all in the church because of its \ntradition of religious liberty,\" Miller told EthicsDaily.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Miller is not opposed to celebrating liberty, especially \nreligious liberty. \u0014\n\"Rather than tapping into those old land of liberty-type of songs \nthat are often sung in some churches, I prefer to highlighting those \nold hymns such as 'Be Thou My Vision' and 'God of Grace and God of \nGlory' that remind us we are citizens of two worlds but that it is \nGod we worship,\" Miller said.\u0014\nWalker agrees and said that \"Faith in God is superior to love of \ncountry; allegiance to God transcends all nationalism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWalker cautioned against making the flag an idol and placing it along \nside the Christian Flag on a routine basis because it signals that \nthe Kingdom of God and the kingdom of Caesar are equal. \u0014\n\"We are citizens of two kingdoms,\" Walker said. \"Yes, we are to \nrespect our governmental institutions and pray for our governmental \nleaders, but that must always be secondary to our commitment to and \nlove for God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMiller said there are all sorts of creative things that can be done \nwhich would be appropriate for the occasion. He said that the song, \n\"America the Beautiful\" was originally a poem written by Katharine \nLee Bates but that it was a Baptist minister, Clarence Barbour, who \ncombined the poem with a melody written by Samuel Ward to fashioned \nthe song as we know it. \u0014\n\u0014\nMiller said that it is important to refrain from fanfare and pep \nrallies and remember that the church is a \"sacred place.\" He said \nthat shortly after the Sept. 11 disaster, author David McCollough \nspoke at his church. \u0014\n\u0014\nMcCollough said that there are some \"sacred places\" in America where \nimportant and meaningful events tend to occur repeatedly such as \nprophetic vision and healing. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It dawned on me about how the church has historically occupied its \nsacred space and becomes the center of America's prophetic vision, \nwound healing and other important events in the life of this nation,\" \nMiller said. \u0014\n\u0014\nWalker noted that it is okay to include patriotic symbols in worship \nservices but only in certain places and at special times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is quite appropriate to display the flag, even in the sanctuary, \non special occasions,\" he said. Walker noted that the First \nAmendment's Establishment Clause bars the government from endorsing a \nreligious message or a particular religious group but \"... it does \nnot prohibit a church from endorsing a patriotic symbol.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMiller said a church he previously pastored borrowed 60 flags from \nthe United Nations building and displayed them throughout the \nsanctuary. \"By doing this we acknowledged that as Americans we are \npart of a world that is interrelated with other nations,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalker cited special occasion worship services that celebrate the \nFourth of July, religious freedom day and times of national crisis \nand mourning as examples of when it is appropriate for a church to \ndisplay the U.S. Flag or other patriotic symbols.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have never been comfortable waving the flag in the sanctuary,\" \nMiller said. \"I am not opposed to displaying an American flag in the \nvestibule or some other area of the church, but not in the sanctuary.\"\u0014\nWalker said he believes churches that routinely display an American \nflag in the sanctuary may be promoting an act of \"civil religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe sees no problem with displaying patriotic symbols routinely in \nother parts of the church where worship does not occur. Areas such as \nthe fellowship hall, assembly rooms, the vestibule and other places \nwhere they can be seen and appreciated are more appropriate. But, he \nsaid, the flag should be placed where it does not threaten to \ndisplace the cross as the quintessential symbol of Christianity.\u0014\nWalker believes that whatever a church does in celebrating \nIndependence Day, \"... we must be sure that we don't overshadow the \ncross.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRay Furr is a freelance writer and operates his own \ncommunications/marketing business in Poquoson, Va\u0014",

    "title": "CHOOSING WISE LEADERS -- SEVEN QUESTIONS",
    "words": "Choosing Wise Leaders \u0014\n7 questions to measure a candidate's most important qualification.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Mel Lawrenz\u0014\n\u0014\nQualified leaders are hard to find. But the search becomes even more \ndifficult when we look for the wrong qualifications. Churches \ninvariably seek candidates who are godly and of good reputation. Does \nthe candidate's calling match the position? Is he or she passionate, \ndevoted, gifted? Good questions, good qualities, but the most \nimportant qualification is often overlooked.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Elmbrook Church, our council selects new elders when a position is \nvacated. For years, I have advised the council with one plea. \n\"Please, oh please, find candidates who are wise.\" Passion and vision \nare important traits, but wisdom points vision in the right direction \nand keeps passion pushing in the proper places.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider this scenario: The pastor announces, \"It is my belief that \nwe should double our attendance in the next two years and add 100 new \nsmall groups in the next 100 days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe board sits silent and stunned. No one asks, \"Where did you get \nthose numbers? Why 100 in 100?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor's discernment isn't examined. Instead, the pastor is \napplauded for his passion, and the proposal is accepted.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, when the small groups barely reach half the goal number, and \nwhen attendance rises by one-fourth his projection, the pastor's \nundiscerning zeal is turned against him. Some in the congregation \nchide him. Others are confused. Trust in his leadership is eroded.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast, I have studied Stuart Briscoe during the 20 years I \nserved as associate pastor at Elmbrook. Many would identify preaching \nas Stuart's primary gift, but I think of his wisdom. When Stuart made \ndecisions, the people assented because they recognized the \nselflessness, fairness, and rightness behind the decisions. Wisdom \ngives leaders the authority to lead because it gives followers a \nreason to trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nServing with Stuart, and now as his successor, I hope to continue to \npoint to wisdom as one of the chief criteria in our church's search \nfor leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we find wise leaders? Based on biblical criteria and personal \nexperience, I've created a list of seven questions to discern a \ncandidate's wisdom.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Does this person live a life of grace?\u0014\n\u0014\nWise spiritual leaders have a vision of God's flow of grace to us and \nthrough us. They go with that flow. The decisions they make in the \nchurch about programs, people, and budgets are in tune with God's \nworks of grace and compassion. A wise leader, therefore, will reflect \na generosity of spirit, a love for mercy, and the ability to forgive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why James warns about people motivated by envy and selfish \nambition. Sometimes ambitious people are appointed as leaders because \nthey are willing to step in where others are not. But such \nself-interest is out of touch with God's grace-work. Wisdom is absent \nwhen a leader is looking more to get than to give.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Do others seek this person's counsel?\u0014\n\u0014\nWise people influence by planting seeds in the hearts and minds of \nothers. Wise people are trusted. Their words are deep and sound.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many years I have seen people seek out one of our leaders when \nthey needed advice. Win has earned her reputation. She gives counsel \nto young and old, to singles and marrieds, to missionaries and \npastors. I have leaned on her many times. So it's not surprising when \nan important new committee is formed that Win is invited to those \ndiscussions. She is sought out because of a wisdom that comes from a \nheart singularly focused on honoring God.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Does this person live a consistent life?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe need leaders who are consistent, stable, and whose personal lives \nare congruent with their public personas. There needs to be integrity \nor wholeness to who they are, what they think, and how they act.\u0014\n\u0014\nScott came onto our council of elders with enthusiasm and zeal. In \nhis late thirties, he was a young elder, but the church saw in Scott \na crystal-clear consistency between his personal life as a husband \nand father, his professional life as an executive, and his leadership \nof a burgeoning home fellowship group. Scott has since become the \nchairman of the council and has guided them during times of testing \nand transition. When he speaks to the congregation, there is \nimmediate trust because everyone knows that with Scott, what you see \nis what you get.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Does this person show depth of thought?\u0014\n\u0014\nWise leaders want their decisions to be based on biblical principles, \nand they are willing to make the mental and spiritual effort to \ndiscern them. Beyond asking why a decision should be made, a wise \nleader discerns the underlying values that are shaping church life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI often seek the opinion of my colleague Dick because his wisdom is \nevident by the depth of thought he brings to every discussion. His \nopinions are not designed to please people, or to take the safe \nalternative, but to plunge through the superficial to the depths of \nunderlying principles.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Does this person show breadth of thought?\u0014\n\u0014\nWise people know how to remain true to their convictions while \ndesiring to understand divergent points of view. They are willing to \nadapt their thinking because they realize their own fallibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nWisdom dictates that we do not selfishly promote our preferences, but \ndistinguish between issues of style and substance. Wisdom prevents us \nfrom feeling threatened by new ideas. When we are wise, we can freely \nadmit how often we succumb to foolishness.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Does this person make judgments impartially?\u0014\n\u0014\nA leader's judgments engender trust only if people see that the \njudgments don't waver from one situation to the next. Children aren't \nthe only ones to say, \"That's not fair!\" Sensitivity to justice is \ntrue of everyone. The people in our churches are always looking for \nfairness and justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of our members, Steve, has served in a variety of leadership \nroles. When he was on the missions committee, he championed the cause \nof missions. When he became an elder, he had to handle the breadth of \nthe church's issues. He had to weigh the needs of the missions \nministries against the needs of other ministries, and he did so \nwithout partiality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Steve has demonstrated fair-mindedness in his judgments, \npeople have learned to trust him.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Does this person understand suffering?\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch wisdom is borne out of pain. It strips us down to bare \nessentials; it puts in perspective the things that matter; it teaches \nthe things that belong to the soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Ecclesiastes puts it: \"Sorrow is better than laughter, because a \nsad face is good for the heart. The heart of the wise is in the house \nof mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure\" \n(7:3-4).\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew Ingrid had wisdom before I married her. She grew up fast, in \npainful circumstances. When she speaks, it's out of a deep repository \nof grace, because she's had to draw on that grace herself. She works \nas a professional counselor. Her clients and I have both marveled at \nthe way she connects to the most horrendous kinds of personal pain. \nThey thank her for her wisdom. I treasure her for it. I know when my \nwife gives me her opinion, it is tempered by personal experience and \noffered with grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the absence of magi\u0014\n\u0014\nYou might say, \"I don't know if I know anybody in my church who would \nmeet all these criteria.\" You're not alone. Any wisdom that we do \nfind in ourselves or in other leaders is a work in progress.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, we should never assign leadership roles to people who \nwould be described by Proverbs as \"fools.\" If a person is imprudent, \nself-absorbed, unmerciful, or given to partiality, he or she should \nnot be assigned a leadership role.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt doesn't matter if that person is the only one willing to chair the \ncommittee or if that person has the most passion and zeal. If he or \nshe shows a void of wisdom, then someone else should be assigned.\u0014\n\u0014\nWisdom often determines the quality and integrity of a ministry. \nThere may be a season to call a church to begin 100 small groups in \n100 days. And there may be a season to patiently serve for 30 years. \nBut neither method, nor vision, nor the passion of the preacher will \ndiscern the proper season.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's wisdom's job.\u0014\n\u0014\nMel Lawrenz pastors Elmbrook Church in Brookfield, Wisconsin. \nmlawrenz@elmbrook.org\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "CHOOSING A SLOWER LANE\u0014\n   by John Ortberg, guest columnist\u0014\n\u0014\n   A Tacoma, Washington, newspaper carried the story of Tattoo\u0014\n   the basset hound a while back. Tattoo didn't intend to go for\u0014\n   an evening run, but when his owner shut the dog's leash in the\u0014\n   car door and took off for a drive with Tattoo still outside\u0014\n   the vehicle, he had no choice.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Motorcycle officer Terry Filbert noticed a passing vehicle\u0014\n   with something dragging behind it, \"the basset hound picking\u0014\n   them up and putting them down as fast as he could.\" He chased\u0014\n   the car to a stop, and Tattoo was rescued, but not before the\u0014\n   dog had reached a speed of 20-25 miles per hour, rolling over\u0014\n   several times.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Too many pastors end up living like Tattoo, their days marked\u0014\n   by picking them up and putting them down as fast as they can.\u0014\n\u0014\n   It's time to learn another way to live. To do that, we must\u0014\n   ruthlessly eliminate hurry from our lives. As much as we\u0014\n   complain about it, though, there's part of us that is drawn\u0014\n   to a hurried life. It makes us feel important. It keeps the\u0014\n   adrenaline pumping. It means I don't have to look too closely\u0014\n   at my heart or life. It keeps us from feeling our loneliness.\u0014\n   As long as I have meetings to attend and occasions to preach\u0014\n   and teach, I can demonstrate that I am an important person.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"The press of busyness is like a charm,\" Kierkegaard wrote.\u0014\n   \"Its power swells ... it reaches out, seeking always to lay\u0014\n   hold of ever-younger victims so that childhood or youth are\u0014\n   scarcely allowed the quiet and the retirement in which the\u0014\n   Eternal may unfold a divine growth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Hurry, then, is not just a disordered schedule. Hurry is a\u0014\n   disordered heart.\u0014\n\u0014\n   We don't have to live this way. The hurried can become\u0014\n   unhurried. But it will not happen by trying alone, nor will it\u0014\n   happen instantly. You will have to enter a life of training.\u0014\n\u0014\n   One useful practice might be called \"slowing.\" This involves\u0014\n   cultivating patience by deliberately choosing to place\u0014\n   yourself in positions where you have to wait. For instance,\u0014\n   over the next few days or weeks, try these:\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Deliberately drive in the slow lane on the expressway. It\u0014\n   may be that not swerving from lane to lane will cause you to\u0014\n   arrive five minutes later. But you will find that you don't\u0014\n   get nearly so angry at other drivers. Instead of trying to\u0014\n   pass them, say a little prayer as they go by, asking God to\u0014\n   bless them.\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Declare a fast from honking. Put your horn under a vow of\u0014\n   silence. (One author writes about the world's shortest unit of\u0014\n   time, the honkosecond: the amount of time that elapses after\u0014\n   the light turns green and before the car behind you honks.)\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Eat your food slowly. Force yourself to chew at least 15\u0014\n   times before each swallow.\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> At the grocery store, discover which check-out line is the\u0014\n   longest, and get in it. Then let one person go in front of\u0014\n   you.\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Reread a book. In our day we have largely traded wisdom for\u0014\n   information. We keep reading more and thinking less. David\u0014\n   Donald notes in his biography of Abraham Lincoln that Lincoln\u0014\n   grew up with access to few books: the Bible, Aesop's Fables,\u0014\n   and a few others. Portions of these he read over and over,\u0014\n   until, as Lincoln's stepmother remembered, \"he never lost that\u0014\n   fact or the understanding of it.\" His law partner said,\u0014\n   \"Lincoln read less and thought more than any man in his sphere\u0014\n   in America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   >> Take an hour simply to be with God. Don't use this time to\u0014\n   prepare messages or do strategic planning. Don't use this time\u0014\n   at all. Simply be with God.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In short, find ways to choose waiting deliberately that make\u0014\n   hurry impossible. As you practice them, tell God you are\u0014\n   trusting he will enable you to accomplish all you need to get\u0014\n   done. Often people worry that if they don't rush, they will\u0014\n   accomplish less. In fact, researchers have found that there is\u0014\n   simply no correlation between hurry and productivity. You will\u0014\n   discover you can survive without hurry.\u0014\n\u0014\n   John Ortberg is teaching pastor at Willow Creek Community\u0014\n   Church in South Barrington, Illinois.\u0014",

Lewis to Corbin Carnell, dated April \n4, 1953\u0014\n\u0014\n     Dear Mr. Carnell:\u0014\n\u0014\n     I am myself a little uneasy about the question you raise: there \nseems to be an almost equal\u0014\n     objection to the position taken up in my footnote and to its \nalternative of attributing the\u0014\n     same kind and degree of historicity to all books of the Bible. \nYou see, the question about\u0014\n     Jonah and the great fish does not turn simply on intrinsic \nprobability. The point is that the\u0014\n     whole Book of Jonah has to me the air of being a moral romance, \na quite different kind of\u0014\n     thing from, say, the account of King David or the New Testament \nnarratives, not pegged,\u0014\n     like them, into any historical situation.\u0014\n\u0014\n     In what sense does the Bible \"present\" the Jonah story \"as \nhistorical\"? Of course it doesn\u2019t\u0014\n     say, \"This is fiction,\" but then neither does our Lord say that \nthe Unjust Judge, Good\u0014\n     Samaritan, or Prodigal Son are fiction (I would put Esther in \nthe same category as Jonah\u0014\n     for the same reason). How does a denial, a doubt, of their \nhistoricity lead logically to a\u0014\n     similar denial of New Testament miracles? Supposing (as I think \nis the case), that sound\u0014\n     critical reading revealed different kinds of narrative in the \nBible, surely it would be illogical\u0014\n     to suppose that these different kinds should all be read in the \nsame way?\u0014\n\u0014\n     This is not a \"rationalistic approach\" to miracles. Where I \ndoubt the historicity of an Old\u0014\n     Testament narrative I never do so on the ground that the \nmiraculous as such is incredible.\u0014\n     Nor does it deny a unique sort of inspiration: allegory, \nparable, romance, and lyric might be\u0014\n     inspired as well as chronicle. I wish I could direct you to a \ngood book on the subject, but I\u0014\n     don\u2019t know one.\u0014\n\u0014\n     With all good wishes, yours sincerely,\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n     C. S. Lewis\u0014\n\u0014\n             From a letter to Clyde S. Kilby, May 7, 1959, from C. S. \nLewis\u0014\n\u0014\n     Whatever view we hold of the divine authority of Scripture must \nmake room for the\u0014\n     following facts:\u0014\n\u0014\n     1. The distinction which St. Paul makes in 1 Cor vii between ouk \nego all\u2019 ho kurios [not\u0014\n     myself but the Lord] (v. 10) and ego lego oux ho kurios [I \nmyself say, not the Lord] (v.\u0014\n     12).\u0014\n\u0014\n     2. The apparent inconsistencies between the genealogies in Matt. \ni and Luke ii; with the\u0014\n     accounts of the death of Judas in Matt. xxvii 5 and Acts i 18-19.\u0014\n\u0014\n     3. St. Luke\u2019s own account of how he obtained his matter (i \n1-4).\u0014\n\u0014\n     4. The universally admitted unhistoricity (I do not say, of \ncourse, falsity) of at least some\u0014\n     of the narratives in Scripture (the parables), which may well \nalso extend to Jonah and Job.\u0014\n\u0014\n     5. If every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of \nlights, then all true and edifying\u0014\n     writings, whether in Scripture or not, must be in some sense \ninspired.\u0014\n\u0014\n     6. John xi 49-52 Inspiration may operate in a wicked man without \nhim knowing it, and he\u0014\n     can then utter the untruth he intends (propriety of making an \ninnocent man a political\u0014\n     scapegoat) as well as the truth he does not intend (the divine \nsacrifice).\u0014\n\u0014\n     It seems to me that 2 and 4 rule out the view that every \nstatement in Scripture must be\u0014\n     historical truth. And 1, 3, 5, and 6 rule out the view that \ninspiration is a single thing in the\u0014\n     sense that, if present at all, it is always present in the same \nmode and the same degree.\u0014\n     Therefore, I think, rule out the view that any one passage taken \nin isolation can be\u0014\n     assumed to be inerrant in exactly the same sense as any other: \ne.g., that the numbers of\u0014\n     O.T. armies (which in view of the size of the country, if true, \ninvolve continuous miracle)\u0014\n     are statistically correct because the story of the Resurrection \nis historically correct. That\u0014\n     the over-all operation of Scripture is to convey God\u2019s Word to \nthe reader (he also needs\u0014\n     his inspiration) who reads it in the right spirit, I fully \nbelieve. That it also gives true\u0014\n     answers to all the questions (often religiously irrelevant) \nwhich he might ask, I don\u2019t. The\u0014\n     very kind of truth we are often demanding was, in my opinion, \nnot even envisaged by the\u0014\n     ancients. \u0014\n\u0014\n               - Quoted in Michael J. Christensen, C.

    "title": "CONVERTING BY THE SWORD--CHRISTIANS USED IT",
    "words": "This issue, more than any other we've published, raises the awkward \nmatter of forced conversions\"Be Christian or die.\" There's no sense \nin pretending this was an exceptional missionary tactic; for many \ncenturies, it was the method of choice among Christian rulers and \nmissionaries. The conversion of much of Europe and of Latin America \nis unimaginable without the sword. \u0014\nIt is not a pleasant aspect of our heritage, but one that nonetheless \nteaches us a great deal about human nature and what, in fact, \nsolidifies Christian faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo explore this topic, CHRISTIAN HISTORY spoke with Richard Fletcher, \nhistory professor at the University of York, England. Professor \nFletcher has spent a lot of time researching medieval Europe, the era \nwhen forced conversions were the rule, and his The Barbarian \nConversion: From Paganism to Christianity (Henry Holt, 1997) is one \nof the splendid results. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did Christians first begin to use force to convert people? \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine, though \nthe first use of force was not designed to convert pagans but to \ncorrect dissident Christians. Augustine, the great bishop of Hippo in \nNorth Africa in the late fourth and early fifth century, was faced \nwith a dissident sect, the Donatists. Augustine wanted to bring them \nback in the orthodox fold, and he agonized about whether it was \npermissible to use coercion to do so. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually he decided it was, and one biblical text that persuaded \nhim was the parable of the great banquet (Luke 14:1624). A rich man \ngives a feast, and when no one he invites shows up, he tells his \nservants to go out and \"Compel people to come in.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt isn't until the Frankish kingdom of Charlemagne in the eighth \ncentury that we see force used to coerce conversions, specifically in \nthe campaign against the Saxons. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did Charlemagne move in this direction? \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the concept of Christian kingship had developed the previous \ncentury, and the duty of expanding Christendom, if necessary by \nforce, became part of a king's duty. It's partly based on an Old \nTestament model of kingship. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, an adviser at the highest levels of Charlemagne's government \npushed this particular policy. Scholars think the real hard-liner was \na man named Lull, who was of Anglo-Saxon origin, had traveled with \nBoniface, and had succeeded Boniface as archbishop of Mainz. He'd \ngiven his life to the conversion of the Saxons, and nothing had \nworked. In essence he said to Charlemagne, \"These stubborn people \nwill never convert on their own. We've got to force them to submit.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis policy of using violence to motivate conversion in Saxony was \nnot supported by all the king's advisers. Another Englishman at \nCharlemagne's court, Alcuin, had grave doubts. In the 790s, when the \nFranks conquered the Avars on the eastern frontier (in modern \nHungary), Alcuin wrote letters to Charlemagne, saying essentially, \n\"Don't make the same mistakes you made with the Saxons. You can't \nforce Christianity upon people.\" There are some signs that Alcuin's \nadvice was heeded; the proposals to convert the Avars by force were \nslightly toned down. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut by the 1300s, no one objects anymore. The chronicles of the \nViking kings, for example, laud them for using the sword to convert \npagans. What happened in medieval Europe to solidify this view? \u0014\nRobert Moore, author of The Rise of the Persecuting Society, argues \nthat from the eleventh to the fourteenth century, European Christian \nsociety became much less tolerant. This is the era when we see \npersecution of Jews and heretics, crusades against Muslims, and the \nincreasing acceptance of forcible conversionespecially in the only \narea of Europe that remained unconverted: Scandinavia and the Baltic \nregion. I don't agree with Moore's argument in all respects, but more \npeople were being persecuted in Europe in 1250 than were in the \nEurope of 1050. That's a fact. One can't get away from it. \u0014\nIs this a product of Christian theologyan insistence on Jesus Christ \nas the truthor of political strengthChristians finally have the \nmilitary force to insist on their way? \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth. On the theological side, there is an unprecedented emphasis \nupon the humanity of Jesus Christ, especially upon his sufferings. \nComing closely behind is a feeling of enmity toward those who were \nidentified as his persecutors, especially the Jews, and by extension, \nall those who were perceived as not fully Christian. Though \nChristians lived peaceably with Muslims in the Holy Land for \ncenturies, during this era, Muslims become identified as the enemies \nof Christ who must be booted out of the Christian holy places. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet we should also emphasize the sheer power of Western Christendom, \nwhich blossoms during this time. There is an upsurge in technology, \nin military organization, in state power, in the ability to raise \ntaxes and hire armies. This put Western European states at a decisive \nadvantage over the remaining pagans in the Baltic, for example. Given \nthe climate of intolerance, it's irresistible to use the power at \nyour disposal to clobber pagans and make them Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere forced conversions successful? \u0014\n\u0014\nYes and no. The problem is semantic. The definition of conversion has \nchanged over the centuries. \u0014\nCharlemagne or Olaf Trygvesson would have said, \"I defeat my enemies, \nand a priest then sprinkles water over them and says some words in \nLatin, and they become Christians. They've been converted.\" \u0014\nToday, we don't regard that as conversionnor would some early \nmedieval people, like the Venerable Bede (c.673735) or Alcuin \n(c.740 804). They wouldn't have thought people converted until they \nwere taught the creeds, Christian morality, and the likewhich may \ntake two, three, or four generations. \u0014\nNonetheless, because of the initiative of coercive kings, \nChristianization was now possible in a way it hadn't been possible \nbefore. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, medieval pagans seemed more willing to submit to forced \nconversions than Christians under similar circumstances. Why is that? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe common factor in paganism all over medieval Europe was \npolytheism. Pagans had lots and lots of godsgods of weather, of \nharvest, of the sea, of the sky, of \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein making, \nof battle, and so on. Anthropologists who've studied conversion in \npolytheistic culture in Africa, for example, have found that such \npeoples think they can just add Christ to their existing pantheon. \nThis is what seems to have happened in medieval Europe. The exclusive \nclaims of a monotheistic faith didn't sink in at first. That's why \neven after \"conversion,\" we find a long period in which ideas about \ngods and goddesses, spirits and fairies, elves and goblins coexist \nwith faith in Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason was that pagans were impressed with the sheer material \npower of Christendom. Paganism was a faith that was largely geared to \ngaining material prosperity. There were gods for the crops because \nthey wanted their crops to grow. They had gods for cattle so that \nthey would produce more milk. When these pagans looked at the wealth \nand power of Christian Europe, they were impressed: the Christian God \nwas obviously one who could deliver the goods. Christians built \nbigger buildings, made more beautiful jewelry, possessed better \nships, and so on. Many pagans were not adverse to converting to \nChristianity because they believed it would, in fact, give them more \nmaterial prosperity than had their gods. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo appreciate this point, note how Christian missionaries fared in \nsixteenth-century China. Here was a non-Christian culture that was in \nmany ways superior to the West. In that context, Christianity makes \npractically no headway. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Europe, we see evidence that this wasn't a by-product but a \ndeliberate tactic of missionaries. When the bishop of Winchester sent \nhis pupil Boniface to evangelize Germany, he stressed that Boniface \nshould remind the pagans just how rich and powerful the Christians \nwere. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of  the intiative of coercive kings, Christianization was now \npossible in a way it hadn't\u0014\nbeen possible before. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere there any cases in which forced conversion didn't work? \u0014\n\u0014\nYes. With pagan polytheists, I don't think there were any failures. \nBut with the monotheistsJews and Muslimscoercion had little \nsuccess. They understood it wasn't a matter of adding a new god but \nchoosing a different one. They also come out of cultures that were \nsophisticated in their own right. \u0014\nThough the first generations converted for less-than-pure motives, in \nsubsequent generations, Christianity seems to \"stick.\" That is, as \nthe centuries unfold, these formerly pagan societies sincerely adopt \nChristianity. Why is that? \u0014\n\u0014\nOne significant reason is the Christian teaching that took place \nafter the formal acceptance of Christianity. It's easy to point out \nthe many abuses of the medieval church, even in what it taught. On \nthe other hand, it did an awful good job at instilling knowledge of \nChristianity into people who had been pagan for centuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne good example of this is seen in Anglo-Saxon England. The \nVenerable Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, \ntells the story of King Edwin, who had embraced Christianity \nprimarily because he thought he would become a great and powerful \nking as a result. And Bede says, in fact, he did. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut he also noted that Edwin was, and always had been, a thoughtful \nman who would sit by himself hour after hour pondering the deep \nmysteries of life. Before he had become a king, in fact, he had a \nvision in the middle of the night, in which a mysterious stranger \nsaid to him, \"I will tell you about a God who brings salvation.\" \nLater on, after Edwin had become king and was growing in power, he \nran into a missionary who was this same mysterious stranger whom he'd \nhad seen in his vision years earlier. \u0014\nThere was in Edwin a desire for salvation, and he felt that beyond \nthe wealth and power Christianity gave him, it also helped him settle \nthis issue in his own heart and mind. For Bede, this seems to \nillustrate the need for Christian teachingto instruct especially \nrulers and the elite on the meaning of Christianity, of salvation, \nand other key theological concepts. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday using force to convert is unthinkable. Why did this idea, that \nwas used for centuries, pass away? \u0014\nA couple disclaimers: this is an immensely complex topic, and I'm not \nan expert on post-medieval missionary history. That being said, my \nhunch is that it's largely due to the rise of Protestant evangelical \nmovements, especially the Great Awakening. Here we see a new stress \nplaced upon the individual soul and upon religious experience. \nConversion becomes a voluntary, individual turning to God. Once you \nhave that understanding, the idea of forcing someone to convert \nbecomes absurd. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, the foundation stave. Though no stave churches remain from the \neleventh century, 28 of the 800 to 1,100 such churches built in the \n1100s survive, including this one in Borgund, Norway. They often \nincorporated Viking imagery, but more importantly were built of wood, \nlike the old pagan temples, not the stone churches of most of \nChristendom. The Danish crucifix on the facing page, from around \n1100, demonstrates how Jesus was constantly portrayed as a triumphant \nrulereven in crucifixes. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1999 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History Magazine\u0014",

    "title": "CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS ORDERS LET ABUSIVE PRIESTS STAY",
    "words": "August 10, 2002, New York Times\u0014\nCatholic Religious Orders Let Abusive Priests Stay\u0014\nBy SAM DILLON\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman Catholic religious orders that include a third of the \nnation'spriests will not expel sexual predators from their ranks, \nleaders of the orders said yesterday. But the leaders are debating \nways to protect children from abusive priests and whether the priests \nshould be allowed to wear religious habits as they continue their \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeeting in an annual conference in Philadelphia, the leaders of the \n125 Catholic orders said they considered it inappropriate to force \nsexual abusers from their communities, which include the Jesuits, \nBenedictines, Dominicans and more than 100 other service and \nmissionary groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lifelong vows of poverty, chastity and obedience that commit the \npriests, monks and brothers to their Catholic communities obligate \ntheir religious superiors to support them financially and to oversee \nthem throughout their lives, even if they commit sexual crimes, the \nleaders of the orders said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new sexual abuse policy of the Catholic orders, which their \nleaders have been shaping this week at the conference, means that \ntheir priests are likely to face less stringent measures than those \nworking under the jurisdiction of the nation's diocesan bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a June meeting in Dallas, the bishops adopted a \"zero tolerance\" \npolicy under which abusive priests must be removed from ministry and \nbarred from wearing religious garb. That policy applies to the 30,000 \npriests who work under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United \nStates' 194 diocesan bishops, but not to the 15,000 priests who \nbelong to religious orders, which are headed not by bishops but by \nmajor superiors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Conference of Major Superiors of Men, an umbrella organization of \nthe religious orders, began its four-day meeting on Wednesday. As \npart of a broader agenda, the major superiors were studying the \nCharter for the Protection of Children and Young People, the national \nsexual abuse policy adopted by the bishops in Dallas that calls for \nthe removal of every priest who has committed even one confirmed act \nof sexual abuse from ministry and the creation of a national review \nboard to oversee the bishops' compliance with the policies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conference members intend to write their own sexual abuse \npolicies by drawing from the bishops' charter some measures they find \napplicable to the religious orders, while modifying or ignoring \nothers that are inappropriate, the Rev. Ted Keating, the Marist \npriest who is the conference's executive director, said. The orders \nmust closely supervise abusive priests, but cannot expel them from \ntheir ranks, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe religious leaders are seeking \"proper ways to supervise those who \nhave abused in the past and to do everything possible to prevent it \nin the future,\" Father Keating said. \"It's our mission to find ways \nto implement the charter, adapting it to the special needs of the \nreligious.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause the religious orders are autonomous, with their leaders under \nno hierarchical authority other than the pope, whatever sexual abuse \npolicies are adopted by the conference in Philadelphia will not be \nbinding on the orders, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This conference does not have the authority to bind,\" Father Keating \nsaid. \"We cannot hold the orders accountable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a keynote speech to more than 100 leaders of Catholic orders \nyesterday, Archbishop Thomas C. Kelly of Louisville, a Dominican, did \nnot specifically cite the sexual abuse scandal that has shaken the \nCatholic Church in the United States this year. But Archbishop Kelly \nseemed to refer to it when he told the audience to resist outside \npressures and obey the holy instructions, or charisms, of their \nbrotherhoods.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I urge you to be faithful to the charisms of your orders and not to \nyield to whatever pressures you feel from the outside,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday night, the Franciscan priest who is the conference's \npresident, the Rev. Canice Connors, decried the media attention paid \nthis year to the scandal that he said had included a \"continuous \ngraphic, public portrayal of abusive priest criminals, sometimes \naided and abetted by episcopal malfeasance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scandal has created a vengeful public atmosphere in which priests \nhave become, Father Connors said, \"a legitimized target population \nfor venomous language and violent action.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also said the term \"zero tolerance\" was a \"war slogan\" that was \ninappropriate for the church.\u0014\nFather Keating said the conference had no statistics on how many \npriests in religious orders had been accused of abuse. Victims' \ngroups estimate that priests from religious orders have abused \nthousands of Catholics. The largest victims' group, the Survivors \nNetwork of Those Abused by Priests, has documented more than 8,000 \ncases of clerical sexual abuse, about a quarter of them committed by \npriests in religious orders.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarbara Blaine, a Chicago lawyer who is the network's president, said \nshe had been abused as a teenager in Ohio by a priest from the Oblate \norder, and Peter Isely, a therapist who represents the network in \nWisconsin, said he was abused by a priest of the Capuchin order.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company | Permissions | Privacy \nPolicy \u0014\n\\\u0002\u0014",

    "words": "Chasing Aimee\u0014\nThe evangelist was tried for a tall tale \u0014\n\u0014\nBY LEWIS LORD\u0014\n\u0014\nMoviegoers of the 1930s roared when Mae West cracked a classic line: \n\"That's my story, boys, and I'm sticking to it.\" In early 1999, the \nlaughs went to an impeached Bill Clinton, who topped off a night of \npolitical ribbing by telling Washington's Gridiron Club he had \nwritten his White House memoir. Its title: My Storyand I'm Sticking \nto It.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth speakers understood th\u0014\nat few statements are more comic than a firm but improbable denial of \nsexual mischief. But the person who popularized the \"my story\" \ndeclaration was the antithesis of the sexpot actress and the \nphilandering president. The line first was uttered by Aimee Semple \nMcPherson, the 20th century's most celebrated female evangelist.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1926, the minister known as Sister Aimee endured what Monica \nLewinsky experienced seven decades later. She bore the brunt of bawdy \njokes. Reporters pried into her private life. And prosecutors \nthreatened to jail her if she stuck to her denial that she had \ncommitted adultery.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany flapper-era Americans wished the Aimee affair would simply go \naway. \"Utter foolishness,\" a Los Angeles banker said of McPherson's \nprosecution. \"It will cost the county $150,000 before they're \nthrough. Why can't they drop the case?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThey didn't drop it because Sister Aimee was a big fish to fry. When \nthe comely Canadian arrived in L.A. in 1918, she had $10, a \ntambourine, and a worn-out Oldsmobile with \"Jesus Is Coming SoonGet \nReady\" painted down the side. Within five years, she owned a $1 \nmillion temple topped by a rotating cross visible 50 miles away.\u0014\n\u0014\nLost at sea? She was 35 and billed as \"the world's most \npulchritudinous evangelist\" when the \"Aimee scandal\" broke. On May \n18, 1926, she donned a green bathing suit and swam into the Pacific \nsurf at Venice, Calif. When she failed to return, thousands thronged \nher temple to hear her mother report \"she is with Jesuspray for \nher.\" For a month, the faithful stood watch. Then, in the predawn \ndarkness of June 23, she stumbled into a cottage in the Arizona \ndesert. Three kidnappers had held her captive, she said, and \"God has \nresurrected me from the dead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 100,000 Angelenos welcomed her home. But amid the cheers \ncame press reports that the young widow, far from being an Arizona \ncaptive, had joined the one-legged engineer from her radio station in \na cycle of sin at a Carmel, Calif., \"love nest.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nReporters, finding no evidence to support her abduction claim, \ndemanded an explanation. The desert account was \"my story,\" she \nreplied, and she was \"sticking to it.\" She soon was charged with a \nfelony, trying to \"obstruct justice\" by giving police a false report. \nAs the case crowded front pages across America, H. L. Mencken \nreported from Los Angeles that \"the more civilized Angeleos all \nsympathize with . . . poor Aimee.\" The Baltimore columnist saw her \nstory as bogus but excusable.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What she is charged with, in essence, is perjury,\" Mencken wrote, \n\"and the chief speculation is that, when asked if she had been guilty \nof unchastity, she said no. It is unheard of, indeed, in any \ncivilized community for a woman to be tried for perjury uttered in \ndefense of her honor. But in California, as everyone knows, the \nprocess of justice is full of unpleasant novelties.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe process continued until the state's key witness altered an \naccount once too often. With that, the district attorney finally \ndropped the case of The People v. Aimee Semple McPherson. A 22-city \n\"vindication tour\" ensued. But as headlines faded, the crowds \nwithered, too. By 1932, Sister Aimee had vanished from Who's Who in \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, one thing did not change: For 18 years, until her death at 53 \nfrom an overdose of sleeping pills, she had her story. And, hoax or \nnot, she stuck to it.\u0014",

    "title": "CATHOLICS CALLED ANTI-SEMITIC FOR EXCLUDING JEWS",
    "words": "Baptist Leader Calls Catholics Anti-Semitic for Excluding Jews from \nEvangelism\u0014\n\u0014\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (BP)--Christians have a responsibility to proclaim \nthe gospel to all people, including Jews, Southern Baptist \nTheological Seminary President R. Albert Mohler Jr. said during a \nspirited debate on MSNBC's \"Donahue\" Aug. 20.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMohler joined a Messianic Jew, a rabbi and host Phil Donahue in \ndebating the issue of Jewish evangelism -- a subject that came to the \nnational forefront when the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \nissued a statement rejecting the need for Jewish people to embrace \nJesus as the Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue, a Roman Catholic, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach hotly contested \nany contention that Jews should be evangelized. Donahue called such \nthinking \"intolerant\" and \"arrogant,\" while Boteach went one step \nfurther in calling Mohler a \"spiritual Neanderthal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mohler and Michael Brown, a Messianic Jew, grounded their answers \nin Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue began the show by joking that \"all we have to do is convince \nthe Southern Baptists\" to follow the Catholics' lead. In fact, the \nfirst few minutes were a mini-debate between Donahue and Mohler.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue began by asking Mohler if the Southern Baptist Convention's \n16 million members believe that Jews can go to heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Southern Baptists, [along] with other Christians, believe that all \npersons can go to heaven who come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,\" \nMohler said, \"[T]here's no discrimination on the basis of ethnic or \nracial or national issues.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue then asked, \"So a good Jew is not going to heaven?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"All persons are sinners in need of a savior,\" Mohler responded. \n\"Jesus Christ is the sole mediator. The gospel, we are told by the \napostle Paul, comes first to the Jews and then to gentiles. Salvation \nis found in his name and in his name alone through faith in Christ, \nand [through] that faith alone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNot satisfied with the answer, Donahue asked another question: Who's \nmore likely to go to heaven -- a Nazi or a \"good Jew\" killed in a \nconcentration camp?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The gospel is not just for the worst of us, the gospel is for all of \nus,\" Mohler said. \"The Scripture tells us the hard truth that all \nhave sinned. That Nazi guard is going to be punished for his sin and \nit will be judged as sin. His only hope would be the grace of God \nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord. The profound truth of the gospel is \nthat the salvation that can come to any person who comes to faith in \nChrist can come to that Jew who was killed and to that guard who does \nthe killing. That's the radical nature of the gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue responded that while Southern Baptists have \"many wonderful \nmembers,\" Mohler's views are full of anti-Semitism and prejudice.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If the church had just come up with this in the 20th century as a \nnovel idea, perhaps it should be subjected to such a critique,\" \nMohler said. \"But this is a gospel that has been received from the \nLord Jesus Christ himself, who said he came first of all for the \npeople and children of Israel and then also for the gentiles. He \nhimself declared that he is the Way, the Truth and the Life and that \nno man commeth to the Father but through him. He spoke as a man born \nof the Jewish race, but he was also the Son of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, who was a drug user until becoming a Christian as a teenager, \nagreed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My goal is not to convert Jews to Christianity,\" said Brown, \npresident of ICN Ministries, a Pensacola, Fla.,-based evangelistic \noutreach with a focus on \"Israel, the Church and the Nations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My goal is to get Jews [and] gentiles to recognize who the Savior \nis. ... Jesus came as a Jew to fulfill what was written in Moses and \nthe Prophets. If he did it, Jews should believe in him. If not, throw \nthe whole thing out. If Jesus is not for Jews, he's not for anybody.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBoteach, a radio host and author of \"Judaism for Everyone,\" strongly \ndisagreed with both Mohler and Brown.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Rev. Mohler, however intelligent of a scholar he may be, he is a \nspiritual Neanderthal with repulsive, revolting views,\" Boteach said. \n\"... This is the modern equivalent of spiritual terrorism. You would \nthink that we would have progressed to some sort of racial harmony \nand tolerance -- especially after Sept. 11.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoteach later asserted that, \"If Jesus were alive today I think he \nwould take Rev. Mohler and Dr. Brown to court for character \nassassination. They took the Prince of Peace and made him into the \ntorturer-in-chief.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue took Mohler to task again, saying that he has made God into \nan \"egomaniac\" who tells people, \"You better pray to me or I'll show \nyou what trouble really is.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMohler, though, responded by saying his views are founded in both the \nOld and New Testaments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God declared this to Moses in the covenant at Sinai,\" Mohler said. \n\"He spoke very much about the fact that there was an order to have no \ngods before him. Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of that law.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDonahue asserted that Mohler's views were arrogant, arguing that the \nCrusades began with similar beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mohler said he has a duty to proclaim the gospel message.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It would be [arrogant] if this was our message,\" Mohler answered. \n\"But if that is what the Son of God said himself, if that is the \ntruth, then it would be hateful and it would be intolerant not to \ntell you what we believe to be the truth. I cannot compel any person \nto believe in Christ, but I do have the responsibility with gladness \nand joy to share the good news of the gospel, knowing that all who \nbelieve in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved whether Jew or \ngentile.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBoteach, obviously upset at Mohler's answer, then asked a series of \nquestions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Rev. Mohler, are you allowed to think?\" Boteach asked. \"Because you \nsound like a broken record. You have been repeating this mantra since \nthe show started. Does your religion allow for independent thought? \nAre you allowed to have a heart? Can you feel for people? Do you know \nthat Jews have been turned into lampshades and bars of soap and \nashes? ... You are a liability to Christianity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Mohler said that his beliefs are the bedrock of orthodox \nChristianity and that the Jewish people have a special place in God's \nplan.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I am fully aware that neither the Roman Catholic bishops nor the \nleaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have any power to send any \nsoul to heaven or to hell,\" he said to Boteach. \"The question comes \ndown to what the gospel really is. What you assaulted in your \nlanguage there is classical Christianity as taught by the apostles \nand handed down by the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe that God has a distinctive purpose for the Jewish people \nand that Christians are called to be friends to all, and especially \nto the Jewish people with a sense of indebtedness. At the same time, \nwe are to bear witness to the gospel, believing that God is going to \ndo a remarkable thing in bringing many, many Jewish persons to faith \nin Christ.\"\u0014",

The lions carry books bearing an \nancient prophecy: \"Peace be with you, Mark my evangelist. Here your \nbody shall rest.\" The prophecy did indeed come true, but it might not \nhave been fulfilled (and Venice would not have its winged lions) if \nVenetians hadn't stolen St. Mark's corpse from its grave in Egypt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophecy supposedly was spoken by an angel, who appeared to Mark \nwhile he was passing through the Venice Lagoon in the first century \nAD. In 828, imbued with the early Christian enthusiasm for sacred \nrelics, Venetians decided to put the stamp of heavenly approval on \ntheir earthly activities by laying claim to St. Mark's bones. Some \nhistorians allege that the prophecy itself was a Venetian invention, \nintended to trump all the other cities of the West in a game of \nreligious one-upmanship. No other city possessed the bones of a \ngenuine evangelist except Rome, which had St. Peter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was just one problem: St. Mark's bones were in Alexandria, \nEgypt. Two Venetian merchants overcame this inconvenience by looting \nthe saint's tomb and packing his corpse into a barrel of pork, which \nMuslim customs agents were forbidden to touch by Islamic law. Back in \nVenice, St. Mark was buried in a church built especially for him (the \n11th-century basilica that bears his name).\u0014\n\u0014\nPilfering relics became a sort of Venetian pastime after this \nescapade--over the years, the remains of 54 other saints made their \nway to the city. The modern traveler can see testaments to this odd \nlegacy of graverobbing by visiting any of the city's churches, under \nwhich is likely to rest the bones of a kidnapped saint.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------\u0014\nThis is one of Christianity's greatest embarrassments.

The study is based on self-reporting by religious \ngroups, a method that the study's authors acknowledge is imprecise \nbecause religious groups can inflate their numbers. The study was \nconducted by Glenmary Research Center and sponsored by the \nAssociation of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.\u0014\n\"I was astounded to see that by and large the growing churches are \nthose that we ordinarily call conservative,\" said Ken Sanchagrin, \ndirector of the Glenmary Research Center and a professor and chairman \nof the department of sociology at Mars Hill College in Mars Hill, \nN.C. \"And when I looked at those that were declining, most were \nmoderate or liberal churches.

Many Catholics \nhave moved in the last decade from the Northeast and the Midwest to \nthe South and Southwest, the survey found.\u0014\nThe next largest denomination is the Southern Baptists, with nearly \n20 million members.

    "words": "\"Corrupt\" religious expressions not limited to Islam, says Baptist \nscholar\u0014\n\u0014\n By John Pierce\u0014\n\u0014\n WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- \"[M]ore wars have been raged, more people \nkilled, and these days\u0014\n more evil perpetrated in the name of religion than by any other \ninstitutional force in human\u0014\n history,\" says Charles Kimball, a Baptist minister and chairman of \nthe religion department at\u0014\n Wake Forest University, in his new book, When Religion Becomes Evil \n(HarperSanFrancisco,\u0014\n 2002).\u0014\n\u0014\n A respected expert on Islam and the Middle East, Kimball calls for a \nthorough examination of\u0014\n how religious expression can be corrupted for evil purposes. \nHowever, he warns that religion\u0014\n itself is not inherently evil and that corruption is not limited to \nany one religious persuasion.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Corrupt religious truth claims always lack the liberating awareness \nthat humans are limited as\u0014\n they search for and articulate religious truth,\" writes Kimball.\u0014\n\u0014\n Religious zealots \"open a door to the possibility that their \nreligion will become evil,\" says\u0014\n Kimball, when they elevate their faith claims to an absolute level.\u0014\n\u0014\n What often follows such inflexibility, he adds, is that those \"armed \nwith absolute truth claims are\u0014\n closely linked with violent extremism, charismatic leaders, and \nvarious justifications for acts\u0014\n otherwise understood to be unacceptable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Therefore, \"claims of absolute truth\" is the first of five warning \nsigns that Kimball suggests\u0014\n observers look for in identifying corrupted faith. He identifies \nfour others as well: \"blind\u0014\n obedience\" (often to a charismatic figure like Jim Jones or David \nKoresh); \"establishing the\u0014\n 'ideal' time\" (disguising a political agenda as an urgent divine \nmandate); \"the end justifies any\u0014\n means\" (endorsing behavior that violates the group's own teachings); \nand declaring holy war\u0014\n (\"a sure sign of corrupt religion\").\u0014\n\u0014\n Kimball equally rejects the notions that religion itself is the \ncause of evil in the world or that evil\u0014\n is the sole property of one religious tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"To say that religion is the problem may capture part of the truth, \nbut it is ultimately an\u0014\n unhelpful response to a host of urgent and troublesome issues ...,\" \nhe writes.\u0014\n\u0014\n Kimball references the Islamic militants who attacked the United \nStates on Sept. 11, 2001, as\u0014\n an obvious example of how religious faith can be corrupted. However, \nhe also points to several\u0014\n other examples of religiously based acts of evil from a variety of \nreligious traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\n Kimball, who holds a doctorate in comparative religions from Harvard \nUniversity and previously\u0014\n directed the Middle East office of the National Council of Churches, \ndisplays a fair hand in\u0014\n assessing how the world's leading religions can be used for both \ngood and evil. Rather than\u0014\n evaluating the various faith traditions individually, however, \nKimball points to the common traits\u0014\n found when faith is corrupted for evil.\u0014\n\u0014\n In addition to the Islamic militants affiliated with Al-Qaeda, \nKimball applies his \"warning signs\" to\u0014\n fanatical Christians and Jewish extremists, as well as some \nadherents of Buddhism and\u0014\n Hinduism, who perpetuate evil in the name of religious faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n Some Baptist readers will likely appreciate Kimball's references to \nhis own church tradition that\u0014\n have helped him distinguish between authentic and corrupt faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n For example, Kimball recalls taking Dale Moody's \"Doctrine of the \nAtonement\" class at Southern\u0014\n Baptist Theological Seminary more than 30 years ago. In addition to \nthe doctrinal insights,\u0014\n Kimball said he learned that \"the most basic truths in religion \ninclude many presuppositions and\u0014\n require considerable interpretation; and sincere people can and \noften do appropriate truth\u0014\n claims in substantially different ways.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n That understanding, Kimball suggests, provides a healthy perspective \non even the most deeply\u0014\n held religious truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n While giving an honest -- though at times a bit frightening -- \nassessment of how religion can be\u0014\n corrupted for evil, Kimball does not leave his readers in despair. \nHe provides good tools for\u0014\n identifying and responding to destructive tendencies that can lead \nto evil being done in the\u0014\n name of religious faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"The more effective we are at identifying dangerous patterns of \ncorrupted religion, the more\u0014\n likely people of goodwill can avert disaster inspired or justified \nby religion,\" writes Kimball.\u0014\n\u0014\n And he reminds readers that growing religious diversity and global \ninterdependence call for\u0014\n mutual respect and understanding among people of different faith \ntraditions.\u0014",

From the introduction of the Cotton \nPatch Version of Paul's Epistles, Clarence explains his motivation:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why a \"cotton patch\" version? While there have been many excellent \ntranslations of the Scriptures into modern English, they still have \nleft us stranded in some faraway land in the long-distant past. We \nneed to have the good news come to us not only in our own tongue but \nin our own time. We want to be participants in the faith, not merely \nspectators...So, the \"cotton patch\" version is an attempt to \ntranslate not only the words but the events. We change the setting \nfrom first century Palestine to twentieth-century America. We ask our \nbrethren of long ago to cross the time-space barrier and talk to us \nnot only in modern English but about modern problems, feelings, \nfrustrations, hopes and assurances; to work beside us in our cotton \npatch or on our assembly line, so that the word becomes modern flesh. \nThen perhaps, we too will be able to joyfully tell of \"that which we \nhave heard, which we have seen with our eyes and have felt with our \nhands, about the word of life\" (1 John 1:1)\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Another reason for a \"cotton patch\" version is that the Scriptures \nshould be taken out of the classroom and stained-glass sanctuary and \nput out under God's skies where people are toiling and crying and \nwondering, where the mighty events of the good news first happened \nand where alone they feel at home...\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Perhaps the main reason, though, is that the major portion of my \nlife has been spent on a farm in southwest Georgia where I have \nstruggled for a meaningful expression of my discipleship to Jesus \nChrist. With my companions along the dusty rows of cotton, corn and \npeanuts, the Word of Life has often come alive with encouragement, \nrebuke, correction and insight. I have witnessed the reenactment of \none New Testament event after another until I can scarcely \ndistinguish the original from its modern counterpart...\"\u0014",

    "title": "CLARENCE JORDAN AND KOINONIA FARM",
    "words": "Clarence Jordon and Koinonia Farm\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in the 1960s, after we had moved to Voluntown in 1960, Clarence \nJordon invited me to visit Koinonia Farm in Americus, Georgia. I \nfirst met Clarence at one of the early organizational meetings of the \nCommittee for Nonviolent Action. He was a Baptist minister as well as \na successful farmer on 2000 acres of land, as much at home on the \nseat of a tractor as he was in the pulpit. In addition to his \ncredentials as a minister and farmer (a doctoral degree in theology \nand a graduate degree in agriculture), Clarence had a great gift for \nstorytelling, not only Bible stories that he translated into modern \nlanguage but also stories from his own life.\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia, an intentional community of sorts, had a constant flow of \nvolunteers from all over the countrypeople who came in spite of the \ndanger of violence to share in the witness. In its early days the \nfarm was comprised of three or four families, one of them black. The \nday before I arrived one of the buildings had been strafed with \nmachine-gun fire on the side facing the road. The bullets had passed \njust above some sleeping farm workers. This wasn't the first time \nKoinonia had been fired upon, although it may have been the closest \nescape from death.\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence Jordan, his family, and other co-workers on the farm had \nalready suffered dozens of attacks because of their insistence on \nliving as true Christians in a community that included both blacks \nand whites. Their suffering seemed endless. Shortly before I arrived, \nan interracial camp had been closed by court injunction. Local people \nstopped buying their produce and refused to sell them supplies or \nprovide services. Explosives destroyed the farm's roadside market and \nits walk-in refrigerator. Their insurance was canceled. And a store \nin Americus that continued to serve the farm was bombed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe community persevered through their strong faith in God and the \nbelief that people of different colors could live together. One of \nKoinonia's major sources of income was a mail-order business of pecan \nnuts and candies. People all over the country not only bought them \nfor their own consumption but also acted as voluntary \"middle men\" to \nincrease the volume of sales. The business was successful, and the \nviolence against them probably made it more so. In lieu of their \ncanceled insurance policy, friends from all over the world assisted \nby pledging money to be used specifically for fire or other damage. \nOver 2000 pledges came in. Thus, Koinonia survived and even thrived \nto some degree.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stress on the black members of the community took a heavy \npsychological toll. One of them became paranoid. Clarence asked us if \nwe (at the Voluntown farm) could take in the family on a temporary \nbasis. We agreed, and I went to Koinonia to accompany them on their \ntrip north. We had arranged stopping-off places on the way back with \nseveral of our friends. We traveled in an old bus someone lent us. \nThe family eventually located a permanent place in New Jersey where \nthey were able to recover.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pecan business became increasingly successful. As new members \njoined the farm, in the mid-1960s Clarence created a strategy he \ncalled the Partnership to find ways Koinonia could live up to its \npotential. He asked key people who had been close to Koinonia for \nmany years for advice and invited them to participate in developing a \nnew direction for Koinonia. I was one of those people, and I attended \na couple of meetings with the Partners, but as I became involved in \nthe New Communities project in Albany, Georgia, I had to drop out of \nthe Partnership.\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of the Partnership discussions grew a proposal to take a dozen \nacres of the farm's property and build twenty-four dwellings on \nhalf-acre plots for low-income families. To make the houses \naffordable they would be built by the eventual owners together with \nvolunteers. This low-income housing project later came to be called \nHabitat for Humanity. With the help of private grants at least 2000 \nhouses are built worldwide each year. The original idea goes back to \nClarence Jordan and Millard Fuller. It was Clarence who inspired \nMillard, but it was Millard who was the genius behind the success of \nHabitat.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------Robert Swann\u0014",

    "title": "CONSTANTINE'S SWORD-- BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews\u0014\nBY Mike Smith \u0014\n\u0014\nThe law of unintended consequences is well illustrated by the way in \nwhich Augustine's perspective on Jewish-Christian relations played \nout in history. Such is the thesis James Carroll articulates in his \nambitious book \"Constantine's Sword.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCarroll notes accurately that Augustine developed his thoughts in the \ncontext of a violent age that had grown increasingly dangerous for \nJews. Christianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire. \nChristian leaders such as Ambrose and John Chrysostom used rhetoric \nthat easily encouraged attacks on Jews. A consensus seemed to be \nemerging that the Jews could not be allowed to exist if they insisted \non remaining Jews rather than converting to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine intervened. While he, like other Christian leaders of the \nperiod, insisted that Jews ought to repent and become Christians, he \nwent further and developed a rationale for why \"unrepentant\" Jews \nshould be protected from violence. Augustine argued that the survival \nof the Jews was part of the providence of God. The Jews were not to \nbe slain. Instead, God permitted them to continue to survive as a \nliving witness to the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ. \nTheir dispersion, along with their biblical texts, among the nations \nwas part of God's plan to prepare the way for the expansion of \nChristianity. The \"homelessness and misery\" of the Jews ought to be \nseen not only as God's punishment, but as a positive witness to the \ntruth of Christian claims.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarroll correctly concludes that Augustine's approach was remarkable \nfor his time. He may overstate when he writes that \"Christianity \npermitted Judaism to endure because of Augustine,\" but not by much. \nIn his own time and throughout the Middle Ages, Augustine's dictum \nprovided theological justification for church officials to attempt to \nprotect Jewish populations from mob violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the same time, though, Augustine's scheme codified Christian \nambivalence toward the Jews. While the church was to ensure the \ncontinued survival of the Jews for the sake of the \"witness\" they \nbore to Christianity, it was not to allow them to live comfortably. \nAs Carroll puts it, church policy became \"Let them survive, but not \nthrive!\" Within such teaching lay the potential for explosions of \nviolence whenever and wherever Jewish populations began to prosper \neconomically or culturally. Carroll goes on to document several such \ncases, noting with sad irony that in most cases church leaders \nattempted to protect local Jewish populations but were unable to \nstand against Christian mobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarroll argues throughout the book that such failure was and is \ninevitable so long as the church clings to the idea that Christianity \nhas superseded Judaism. To his way of thinking, all efforts to have \nit both waysto believe that the Jews need to repent and become \nChristians yet allow for the preservation of an unrepentant \npopulationare doomed to failure. He argues that the church has \nfailed God in its treatment of the Jews and pleads for a new approach.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn essence, Carroll urges that the church see itself as the way in \nwhich \"God's promise to Israel\" is made available to gentiles, \nnothing more and nothing less. He insists that the church in no \"way \nsurpasses Israel or supersedes it.\" He calls upon the church to \nacknowledge that it has betrayed Jesus through its attitude toward \nand treatment of the Jews, and he asks the church to repent and to \nchange. To his way of thinking, both Jews and Christians are the \npeople of God, and the sooner we acknowledge this to be true, the \nbetter.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine's Sword is a must-read. I first read it in the context of \na small group composed of Christian ministers and a Jewish rabbi. The \nresulting conversations were among the most intense in my experience. \nFor most of the Christians in the group, Carroll's detailed treatment \nof Christian persecution of the Jews came as a devastating \nrevelation. My Jewish friend was introduced to the history of \nChristian theology and came away with a better appreciation of how \nChristian actions have been conditioned by our theology. Speaking \nonly for myself, I came away from the process convinced of Carroll's \nthesis and prescription.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarroll's work is not without flaws. The scholarship upon which he \ndraws is somewhat dated. His attempt to connect his personal journey \nwith the story of the church and the Jews sometimes feels contrived. \nStill, these minor criticisms aside, Constantine's Sword seems likely \nto become the most important and positive contribution to \nJewish-Christian dialogue published in my lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Smith is pastor of First Baptist Church in Murfreesboro, Tenn.\u0014",

    "title": "CREATING GOOD GOSSIP",
    "words": "CREATING GOOD GOSSIP\u0014\n   by Eric Reed, Leadership online editor\u0014\n\u0014\n   Henry Kissinger was a master at the press leak. He often spoke\u0014\n   to reporters with the stipulation that they cite only \"sources\u0014\n   close to the White House.\" He would tell them about some plan\u0014\n   the Nixon administration was considering, wait for them to\u0014\n   report it, and then gauge the support of the American people\u0014\n   before making a final decision and an official announcement.\u0014\n   Kissinger made the grapevine work for the president, rather\u0014\n   than against him.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Like it our not, the grapevine is part of leadership and\u0014\n   church life. If Christians can't drink, smoke, or chew, then\u0014\n   we'll just talk about those who do (and some who don't). The\u0014\n   question is, can we use fairly the human tendency to talk too\u0014\n   much for the benefit of the church?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Erwin McManus says his church had a huge gossip problem ten\u0014\n   years ago, but no longer. \"We created an environment where\u0014\n   people felt powerless to dissent,\" he says. \"Most church\u0014\n   business we kept secret among the top leaders. Gossip was an\u0014\n   ungodly response to powerlessness.\" McManus's Los Angeles\u0014\n   church, now named Mosaic, was a growing, multi-cultural\u0014\n   congregation. As in most congregations, people like to talk.\u0014\n   Sometimes that talk turned to the leadership. At one point, it\u0014\n   was not uncommon for people to call for prayer meetings where\u0014\n   there was little praying, but much discussion about what the\u0014\n   pastors were up to.\u0014\n\u0014\n   That's when McManus and the leaders realized they shared\u0014\n   responsibility in creating the problem. \"We decided if\u0014\n   information was going to be distributed freely, we want to be\u0014\n   the ones to distribute it. So now we share widely whatever is\u0014\n   appropriate. We try to create an environment where people can\u0014\n   be heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   You can make the grapevine work for you, McManus found. \"If\u0014\n   people are informed and empowered, then when they hear gossip,\u0014\n   they will stop it, because they know it's not true.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   And H.B. London and Neil Wiseman agree. In their book,\u0014\n   Becoming Your Favorite Church (Regal, 2002), these pastors\u0014\n   concede that people are going to gossip: \"Informers often use\u0014\n   loose talk to put themselves in the spotlight. In most\u0014\n   grapevine discussions, accuracy is compromised simply because\u0014\n   the talker seldom knows all the facts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   The authors reason, if people are going to gossip, why not\u0014\n   give them something good to gossip about? They advocate\u0014\n   \"Healthy Talk\" as one of seven habits of highly effective\u0014\n   leaders:\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Begin to transform the grapevine into a positive forum by\u0014\n   asking why church people talk so much. They may be intensely\u0014\n   interested but lack information; therefore, they converse to\u0014\n   find out if others know more than they do. If this idea has\u0014\n   validity, why not provide talkers with more information as a\u0014\n   starting point for using the grapevine to bless the church?\u0014\n   For example, one recreational talker questions leaders in\u0014\n   different settings and at different times; then like a private\u0014\n   investigator, he adds up the details and becomes the resident\u0014\n   informant who spreads the story. When you see this pattern,\u0014\n   give the self-appointed investigator the information you want\u0014\n   known. Then, let him talk.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Why not think of ways to make your church's grapevine useful?\u0014\n   Why not put significant facts on the grapevine? It is\u0014\n   wonderful fun to tell a positive story to a talker and then\u0014\n   wait to see how long it takes the information to get back to\u0014\n   you and to hear what embellishments have been attached along\u0014\n   the way. Sometimes the resident talker forgets who told her\u0014\n   the story and repeats it to the originator. Sometimes the tale\u0014\n   comes back in hours, but it almost always comes back within a\u0014\n   few days.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Since people are bound to talk, why not give them something\u0014\n   positive to discuss? Putting accurate messages on the\u0014\n   grapevine is easier than duplicating them on a copy machine,\u0014\n   recording them on someone's answering machine, or using e-\u0014\n   mail.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   So, our question is how do you use the grapevine in a positive\u0014\n   way?\u0014\n\u0014\n   As we prepare an issue of Leadership on ethics and integrity,\u0014\n   we would appreciate your input. Tell us your story of gossip\u0014\n   gone good.\u0014",

    "words": "Conflict inevitable for leadership\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent edition of \"The Pastor's Coach,\" Dan Reiland notes the \ninevitability of conflict in the life of church leaders:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Any pastor in church ministry or leader in any environment knows \nthat conflict is part of the reality of leadership. It is impossible \nto avoid conflict and be alive at the same time. Leaders cause motion \nand motion causes friction. Conflict happens. The goal is not to \navoid conflict, but to learn to resolve it. The absence of conflict \nis not a good sign. It only reflects the calm before the storm, or a \nchurch in the comfort zone. The churches I visit that are growing and \nseem to be relatively free of conflict are actually reflecting a \nmature ability to resolve conflict quickly and smoothly. The \nenvironment is so unified and filled with grace that conflicts are \nmerely momentary stumbling blocks. These churches have a deep and \nabiding sense of unity and maturity. . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The confrontation is usually not as bad as you anticipated. It's \nworse. Just kidding. Seriously, when handled correctly and with \nmaturity, conflict often results in individual and group health and \ngrowth. John and I had to release a staff member and it did not go \nsmoothly. Two of my close friends in the church dearly loved this \nstaff member and did not understand why the decision had been made. \nThey were not supportive at all and our friendship was tested. We \nwent through an awkward period, speaking only briefly in passing. \nFinally, we sat down for a long talk, and when eyes met eyes and \nhearts met hearts, even though we did not agree, the relationship was \nrestored. The meeting wasn't nearly as difficult as any of us had \nimagined. Lack of communication was far worse than difficult \ncommunication. When we are left to our imaginations and start to fill \nin the blanks on our own, we almost always fill them in incorrectly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n (This article is used by permission from Dr. Dan Reiland's free \nmonthly e-newsletter 'The Pastor's Coach'\u0014",

As parents and \npoliticians debate the merits of abstinence programs, heres what the \nkids have to say\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Lorraine Ali and Julie Scelfo  NEWSWEEK Dec. 9 issue   Theres a \nsexual revolution going on in America, and believe it or not, it has \nnothing to do with Christina Aguileras bare-it-all video Dirrty. \nThe uprising is taking place in the real world, not on The Real \nWorld.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIMG: Cover Story        VISIT ANY AMERICAN high school and youll \nlikely find a growing number of students who watch scabrous TV shows \nlike Shipmates, listen to Eminemand have decided to remain chaste \nuntil marriage. Rejecting the get-down-make-love ethos of their \nparents generation, this wave of young adults represents a new \ncounterculture, one clearly at odds with the mainstream media and \ntheir routine use of sex to boost ratings and peddle product.\u0014\n        According to a recent study from the Centers for Disease \nControl, the number of high-school students who say theyve never had \nsexual intercourse rose by almost 10 percent between 1991 and 2001. \nParents, public-health officials and sexually beleaguered teens \nthemselves may be relieved by this lets not trend. But the new \nabstinence movement, largely fostered by cultural conservatives and \nevangelical Christians, has also become hotly controversial.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n        As the Bush administration plans to increase federal funding \nfor abstinence programs by nearly a third, to $135 million, the \nAdvocates for Youth and other proponents of a more comprehensive \napproach to sex ed argue that teaching abstinence isnt enough. Teens \nalso need to know how to protect themselves if they do have sex, \nthese groups say, and they need to understand the emotional intensity \ninherent in sexual relationships.\u0014\n        The debate concerns public policy, but the real issue is \npersonal choice. At the center of it all are the young people \nthemselves, whose voices are often drowned out by the political \ncacophony. Some of them opened up and talked candidly to NEWSWEEK \nabout their reasons for abstaining from sex until marriage. Its \nclear that religion plays a critical role in this extraordinarily \nprivate decision. But there are other factors as well: caring \nparents, a sense of their own unreadiness, the desire to gain some \nsemblance of control over their own destinies. Here are their stories.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE WELLESLEY GIRL\u0014\n\u0014\n        Alice Kunce says shes a feminist, but not the \narmy-boot-wearing, shaved-head, I-hate-all-men kind. The \ncurly-haired 18-year-old Wellesley College sophomoreshe skipped a \ngrade in elementary school looks and talks like what she is: one of \nthe many bright, outspoken students at the liberal Massachusetts \nwomens college. Shes also a virgin. One of the empowering things \nabout the feminist movement, she says, is that were able to assert \nourselves, to say no to sex and not feel pressured about it. And I \nthink guys are kind of getting it. Like, Oh, not everyones doing \nit. \u0014\n\u0014\n   But judging by MTVs Undressed, UPNs Buffy the Vampire Slayer \nand just about every other TV program or movie targeted at teens, \neveryone is doing it. Alice grew up with these images, but as a \nsmall-town girl in Jefferson City, Mo., most teen shows felt alien \nand alien-ating. Youre either a prudish person who cant handle \ntalking about sex or youre out every Saturday night getting some, \nshe says. But if youre not sexually active and youre willing to \ndiscuss the subject, you cant be called a prude. How do they market \nto that? The friend from back home shes been dating since August \nasked not to be identified in this story, but Alice doesnt mind \ntalking candidly about what they door dont do. Which is \nacceptable? Oral, vaginal or anal sex? she asks. For me, theyre \nall sex. In high school, you could have oral sex and still call \nyourself a virgin. Now Im like, Well, what makes one less intimate \nthan the other? \u0014\n Alice, a regular churchgoer who also teaches Sunday school, says \nreligion is not the reason shes chosen abstinence. She fears STDs \nand pregnancy, of course, but above all, she says, shes not mature \nenough emotionally to handle the deep intimacy sex can bring. Though \nmost people in her college, or even back in her Bible-belt high \nschool, havent made the same choice, Alice says she has never felt \nostracized. If anything, she feels a need to speak up for those being \ncoerced by aggressive abstinence groups. Religious pressure was and \nis a lot greater than peer pressure, says Alice, who has never taken \npart in an abstinence program. I dont think there are as many teens \nsaying Oh come on, everybodys having sex as there are church \nleaders saying No, its bad, dont do it. Itll ruin your life. The \nchoices many religious groups leave you with are either no sex at all \nor uneducated sex. What happened to educating young people about how \nthey can protect themselves?\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE DREAM TEAM\u0014\n        Karl Nicoletti wasted no time when it came to having the \ntalk with his son, Chris. It happened five years ago, when Chris was \nin sixth grade. Nicoletti was driving him home from school and the \nsubject of girls came up. I know many parents who are wishy-washy \nwhen talking to their kids about sex. I just said, No, youre not \ngoing to have sex. Keep your pecker in your pants until you graduate \nfrom high school.\u0014\n\u0014\n Today, the 16-year-old from Longmont, Colo., vows hell remain \nabstinent until marriage. So does his girlfriend, 17-year-old Amanda \nWing, whose parents set similarly strict rules for her and her two \nolder brothers. Its amazing, but they did listen, says her mother, \nLynn Wing. Amanda has been dating Chris for only two months, but \ntheyve known each other for eight years. On a Tuesday-night dinner \ndate at Portabellos (just across from the Twin Peaks Mall), Amanda \nasks, You gonna get the chicken parmesan again? Chris nods. Yep. \nYou know me well. They seem like a long-married coupleexcept that \nthey listen to the Dave Matthews Band, have a 10:30 weeknight curfew \nand never go beyond kissing and hugging. (The guidelines set by \nChriss dad: no touching anywhere that a soccer uniform covers.)\u0014\n        Society is so run by sex, says Chris, who looks like \nMadison Avenues conception of an All-American boy in his Abercrombie \nsweat shirt and faded baggy jeans. Just look at everythingTV, \nmovies. The culture today makes it seem OK to have sex whenever, \nhowever or with whoever you want. I just disagree with that. Amanda, \nwho looks tomboy comfy in baggy brown cords, a white T shirt and \nchunky-soled shoes, feels the same way. Sex should be a special \nthing that doesnt need to be public, she says. But if youre \nabstinent, its like youre the one set aside from society because \nyoure not doing it.\u0014\n        The peer pressure in this town of 71,000 people in the shadow \nof the Rocky Mountains is substantially less than in cosmopolitan \nDenver, 45 minutes away. (It figures you had to come all the way out \nhere to find a virgin, one local said.) Chris joined a Christian \nabstinence group called Teen Advisors this year. We watched their \nslide show in eighth grade and it just has pictures of all these \nSTDs, he says. Its one of the grossest things youve ever seen. I \ndidnt want to touch a girl, like, forever. He now goes out once a \nmonth and talks to middle schoolers about abstinence. Amanda saw the \nsame presentation. Its horrible, she says. If that doesnt scare \nkids out of sex, nothing will. Could these gruesome images put them \noff sex for life? Chris and Amanda say no. Theyre sure that whoever \nthey marry will be disease-free. \u0014\nTo most abstaining teens, marriage is the golden light at the end of \nthe perilous tunnel of datingdespite what their parents experience \nmay have been. Though Amandas mother and father have had a long and \nstable union, Karl Nicoletti separated from Chriss mother when Chris \nwas in fifth grade. His fiancee moved in with Chris and Karl two \nyears ago; Chriss mother now has a year-and-a-half-old son out of \nwedlock. Chris and Amanda talk about marriage in the abstract, but \nthey want to go to college first, and theyre looking at schools on \nopposite sides of the country. I think we could stay together, \nChris says. Amanda agrees. Like we have complete trust in each \nother, she says. Its just not hard for us. Whether the bond \nbetween them is strong enough to withstand a long-distance \nrelationship is yet to be seen. For now, Chris and Amanda mostly look \nahead to their next weekly ritual: the Tuesday pancake lunch.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE SURVIVOR\u0014\n        Remaining a virgin until marriage is neither an easy nor a \ncommon choice in Latoya Hugginss part of Paterson, N.J. At least \nthree of her friends became single mothers while they were still in \nhigh school, one by an older man who now wants nothing to do with the \nchild. Its hard for her to finish school, Latoya says, because \nshe has to take the baby to get shots and stuff.\u0014\n        Latoya lives in a chaotic world: so far this year, more than \na dozen people have been murdered in her neighborhood. Its a life \nthat makes her sexuality seem like one of the few things she can \nactually control. I dont even want a boyfriend until after \ncollege, says Latoya, whos studying to be a beautician at a \ntechnical high school. Basically I want a lot out of life. My career \nchoices are going to need a lot of time and effort.\u0014\n  Latoya, 18, could pass for a street-smart 28. She started thinking \nseriously about abstinence five years ago, when a national outreach \nprogram called Free Teens began teaching classes at her church. The \nclasses reinforced what she already knew from growing up in \nPatersonthat discipline is the key to getting through your teen \nyears alive. Earlier this year she dated a 21-year-old appliance \nsalesman from her neighborhood, until Latoya heard that he was hoping \nshed have sex with him. We decided that we should just be friends, \nshe explains, before he cheated on me or we split up in a worse way.\u0014\n        So most days Latoya comes home from school alone. While she \nwaits for her parents to return from work, she watches the Disney \nChannel or chills in her basement bedroom, which shes decorated with \nconstruction-paper cutouts of the names of her favorite pop stars, \nsuch as Nelly and Aaliyah. She feels safe there, she says, because \ntoo many bad things are happening outside. But bad things happen \ninside, too: last year she opened the door to a neighbor who forced \nhis way inside and attempted to rape her. He started trying to take \nmy clothes off. I was screaming and yelling to the top of my lungs \nand nobody heard. Luckily, the phone rang. Latoya told the intruder \nit was her father, and that if she didnt answer he would come home \nright away. The man fled. Latoya tries not to think about what \nhappened, although she feels like dying when she sees her attacker \non the street. (Her parents decided not to press charges so she \nwouldnt have to testify in court.) Her goal is to graduate and get a \njob; she wants to stay focused and independent. Boys make you feel \nlike youre special and youre the only one they care about, she \nsays. A lot of girls feel like they need that. But my mother loves \nme and my father loves me, so theres no gap to fill.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE BEAUTY QUEEN\u0014\n        Even though she lives 700 miles from the nearest ocean, \nDaniela Aranda was recently voted Miss Hawaiian Tropic El Paso, \nTexas, and her parents couldnt be prouder. Theyve displayed a \npicture of their bikini-clad daughter smack-dab in the middle of the \nliving room. People always say to me You dont look like a \nvirgin, says Daniela, 20, who wears supersparkly eye shadow, heavy \nlip liner and a low-cut black shirt. But what does a virgin look \nlike? Someone who wears white and likes to look at flowers?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n        Daniela models at Harley-Davidson fashion shows, is a \ncheerleader for a local soccer team called the Patriots and hangs out \nwith friends who work at Hooters. Shes also an evangelical Christian \nwho made a vow at 13 to remain a virgin, and shes kept that promise. \nIt can be done, she says. Im living proof. Daniela has never \njoined an abstinence program; her decision came from strong family \nvalues and deep spiritual convictions.\u0014\n        Danielas arid East El Paso neighborhood, just a mile or so \nfrom the Mexican border, was built atop desert dunes, and the sand \nseems to be reclaiming its own by swallowing up back patios and \nsidewalks. The city, predominantly Hispanic, is home to the Fort \nBliss Army base, breathtaking mesa viewsand some of the highest \nteen-pregnancy rates in the nation. Theres a lot of girls that just \nwant to get pregnant so they can get married and get out of here, \nDaniela says.\u0014\n        But she seems content to stay in El Paso. She studies \nbusiness at El Paso Community College, dates a UTEP football player \nnamed Mike and works as a sales associate at the Agaci Too clothing \nstore in the Cielo Vista Mall. She also tones at the gym and \nreadsespecially books by the Christian author Joshua Harris. In Boy \nMeets Girl, shes marked such passages as Lust is never satisfied \nwith a pink highlighter. Shes also saved an article on A. C. Green, \nthe former NBA player whos become a spokesman for abstinence. My \nboyfriends coach gave it to him because the other guys sometimes \nsay, Are you gay? Whats wrong with you? Its proof that if a \nfamous man like Green can do it, so can he.\u0014\n        Daniela has been dating Mike for more than a year. Hes had \nsex before, but has agreed to remain abstinent with her. Hes what \nyou call a born-again virgin, she says. Or a secondary abstinent, \nor something like that. We just dont put ourselves in compromising \nsituations. If were together late at night, its with my whole \nfamily.\u0014\n        Daniela knows about temptation: every time she walks out \nonstage in a bathing suit, men take notice. But she doesnt see a \ncontradiction in her double life as virgin and beauty queen; rather, \nits a personal challenge. I did Hawaiian Tropic because I wanted to \nsee if I could get into a bikini in front of all these people, she \nsays. I wasnt thinking, Oh, Im going to win. But I did, and I \ngot a free trip to Houstons state finals. I met the owner of \nHawaiian Tropic. Its like, wow, this is as good as it gets.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE RING BEARER\u0014\n        Lenee young is trying to write a paper for her Spanish class \nat Atlantas Spelman College, but as usual she and her roommates \ncant help getting onto the subject of guys. I love Ludacris, Lenee \ngushes. I love everything about him. Morris Chestnut, too. He has a \nreally pretty smile. Just gorgeous. But Lenee, 19, has never had a \nboyfriend, and has never even been kissed. A lot of the guys in high \nschool had already had sex, she says. I knew that would come up, so \nId end all my relationships at the very beginning. Lenee decided \nback then to remain a virgin until marriage, and even now she feels \nlittle temptation to do what many of her peers are doing behind \nclosed dormitory doors. I feel that part of me hasnt been \ntriggered yet, she says. Sex is one of those things you cant miss \nuntil you have it.\u0014\n        Last summer she went with a friend from her hometown of \nPittsburgh to a Silver Ring Thing. These popular free events meld \nmusic videos, pyrotechnics and live teen comedy sketches with dire \nwarnings about STDs. Attendees can buy a silver ringand a Biblefor \n$12. Then, at the conclusion of the program, as techno music blares, \nthey recite a pledge of abstinence and don their rings. My friend, \nwhos also a virgin, said I needed to go so I could get a ring, \nLenee says. It was fun, like the music and everything. And \nafterwards they had a dance and a bonfire.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n        The idea of abstinence was not new to Lenee. In high school \nshe participated in a program sponsored by the University of \nPittsburgh Medical Center called Postponing Sexual Involvement. Her \nmother had discussed it with heroncethe week before she left for \ncollege. Two of her closest friends are also virgins; the trio \njokingly call themselves The Good Girls Club. But student life can \nsometimes be a shock to her sensibilities. Another friend of mine \nand this guy were talking about how they didnt use a condom. He \nsaid, I like it raw. I was like, Oh, my goodness.\u0014\n        And then there was the recent party that began with \ntruth-or-dare questions. The first one: have you ever kissed a boy? \nYoung was the only woman who said no, and everybody in the room was \nstunned. Are you serious? We gotta find you a boyfriend! But Lenee \nwasnt embarrassed. I dont feel like Ive missed out, she says. I \njust feel like my time will come. Until then, she sports that shiny \nsilver ring.\u0014\n       \u0014\nTHE RENEWED VIRGIN\u0014\n        Lucian Schulte had always planned to wait until he was \nmarried to have sex, but that was before a warm night a couple of \nyears ago when the green-eyed, lanky six-footer found himself with an \nunexpected opportunity. She was all for it, says Lucian, now 18. \nIt was like, Hey, lets give this a try. The big event was over \nin a hurry and lacked any sense of intimacy. In movies, if people \nhave sex, its always romantic, he says. Physically, it did feel \ngood, but emotionally, it felt really awkward. It was not what I \nexpected it to be.\u0014\n\u0014\n        While the fictional teens of American Pie would have been \nclumsily overjoyed, Lucian, raised Roman Catholic, was plagued by \nguilt. I was worried that Id given myself to someone and our \nrelationship was now a lot more serious than it was before, he says. \nIt was like, Now, what is she going to expect from me?  Lucian \nworried, too, about disease and pregnancy. He promised himself never \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Lucian, now an engineering major at the University of Alberta \nin Canada, is a renewed virgin. His parents are strong proponents \nof chastity, and he attended school-sponsored abstinence classes. But \nthe messages didnt hit home until hed actually had sex. Its a \npretty special thing, and its also pretty serious, he says. \nAbstinence has to do with Hey, are you going to respect this \nperson?  He has dated since his high-school affair, and is now \nhoping a particular cute coed from Edmonton will go out with him. \nBut Ill try to restrict myself to kissing, he says. Not because I \nthink everything else is bad. But the more you participate with \nsomeone, the harder its going to be to stop.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Its not easy to practice such restraint, especially when \nthose around him do not. Lucian lives in a single room, decorated \nwith ski-lift tickets and a Scooby-Doo poster, in an all-male dorm, \nbut he says most students get hitched up, sleep around and never see \neach other again. Meanwhile he does his best to push his own sexual \nurges from his mind. I try to forget about it, but I have to say it \nsucks. Homework is a good thing to do, and going out for a run \nusually works. He also goes to Sunday mass. Lucian figures he can \nhold out until hes married, which he hopes will be by the time hes \n30. Im looking forward to an intimate experience with my wife, who \nIll truly love and want to spend the rest of my life with, says \nLucian. Its kind of corny, but its for real.\u0014\n       \u0014\nWith Sarah Downey and Vanessa Juarez\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS",
    "words": "Christmas Traditions \u0014\n\u0014\nby Ted Olsen, former assistant editor of Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen my parents were getting ready to celebrate Christmas in their \nnew home in Denver after moving from Seattle several years ago, they \ntried to make a list of all our family's Christmas traditions. They \nwanted to make sure Christmas, even though it was in a new place, \nstill felt exactly like Christmas. So my whole family sat down to \nshare Christmas memories and discuss customs we carried out year \nafter year, knowingly and unknowingly. It took a long time, \nespecially since many of our traditions were detailed: how many \npresents to open on Christmas Eve (one), what to eat on Christmas \nmorning (scrambled eggs, bacon, and Pillsbury orange rolls), etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a fascinating experience, because we all had \"traditions\" that \nwere obvious to us, but which other family members had never even \nconsidered. Even more surprising, my brothers and I had considered \nsome practices \"traditions\" when in reality we had only done them \nonce or twice.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I've been reading about Christmas traditions this week, I've \nwondered how many of them have such dubious backgrounds. I can't \nrecount all the histories here, but several books available at your \nlibrary have already done so. The stories are fascinating. Christmas \ncards began instead as New Year's greetings. The Christmas tree was \nassociated with the Edenic Tree of Knowledge and decorated with \napplesforbidden fruit. Holly was thought to be the tree from which \nthe cross was made. Hanging mistletoe comes from an old Scandinavian \nmilitary custom: enemies encountering each other under the plant laid \ndown their arms in truce until the next day.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has also surprised me is how many times Francis of Assisi (c. \n1181-1226) has come up in these traditions. Apparently, Francis's \nfriars (and perhaps Francis himself) were the first to write simple, \nhappy, Gospel-based songs. These were much lighter and festive than \nhymns and are considered by historians as the first carols.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis also is the first person on record to create a Christmas \nnativity scene. On Christmas Eve 1223, in order to \"Set before our \nbodily eyes  how he [Jesus] lay in a manger,\" Francis and his \ncompanions worshiped in a cave near Greccio, Italy, surrounded by the \ntraditional oxen, sheep, and donkeys.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn early Francis biographer recounted, \"Neighborhood people prepared \nwith joy according to their capacity, bringing candles and torches to \nillumine the night that has been the light of the world through its \nstar. Finally, the saint of God arrived and saw it and was glad. The \nmanger was ready, hay was spread, and the ox and ass led in.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Thus, simplicity was honored, poverty exalted, humility praised. \nGreccio was made a new Bethlehem. The night became as day to the joy \nof men and animals. The people were happy at this great mystery. the \nforest echoed with the voices of the congregation; the rocks cried \nout in jubilation. The friars sang their debt of praise to God, and \nthe night echoed with their hymns. The saint of God stood near the \nmanger, overwhelmed with love and swelling with happiness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n* Christian History issue 42: Francis of Assisi, is available in the \nCH store.\u0014",

    "words": "In his best-selling book, The Jesus I Never Knew, Philip Yancey \ncontrasts the humility that characterized Jesus royal visit to \nplanet earth with the prestigious image associated with world rulers \ntoday:\u0014\n\u0014\nIn London, looking toward the auditoriums royal box where the queen \nand her family sat, I caught glimpses of theway rulers stride \nthrough the world: with bodyguards, and a trumpet fanfare and a \nflourish of bright clothes and flashing jewelry.\u0014\n\u0014\nQueen Elizabeth II had recently visited the United States, and \nreporters delighted in spelling out the logistics involved: her four \nthousand pounds of luggage included two outfits for every occasion, a \nmourning outfit in case someone died, forty pints of plasma, and \nwhite kid-leather toilet seat covers. She brought along her own \nhairdresser, two valets, and a host of other attendants. A brief \nvisit of royalty to a foreign country can easily cost twenty million \ndollars.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn meek contrast, Gods visit to earth took place in an animal \nshelter with no attendants present and nowhere to lay the newborn \nking but a feed trough. Indeed, the event that divided history, and \neven our calendars, into two parts may have had more animal than \nhuman witnesses. A mule could have stepped on him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Philip Yancey, The Jesus I Never Knew (Zondervan, 1995)\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTMAS AS IT SHOULD BE",
    "words": "Christmas As It  Should Be ! \u0014\n\u0014\nPa never had much compassion for the lazy or those who squandered \ntheir means and then never had enough for the necessities. But for \nthose who were genuinely in need, his heart was as big as all \noutdoors. It was from him that I learned the greatest joy in life \ncomes from giving, not from receiving. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Christmas Eve 1881. I was fifteen years old and feeling like \nthe world had caved in on me because there just hadn't been enough \nmoney to buy me the rifle that I'd wanted for Christmas. We did the \nchores early that night for some reason. I just figured Pa wanted a \nlittle extra time so we could read in the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter supper was over I took my boots off and stretched out in front \nof the fireplace and waited for Pa to get down the old Bible. I was \nstill feeling sorry for myself and, to be honest, I wasn't in much of \na mood to read Scriptures. But Pa didn't get the Bible, instead he \nbundled up again and went outside. I couldn't figure it out because \nwe had already done all the chores. I didn't worry about it long \nthough, I was too busy wallowing in self-pity. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon Pa came back in. It was a cold clear night out and there was ice \nin his beard. \"Come on, Matt,\" he said. \"Bundle up good, it's cold \nout tonight.\" I was really upset then. Not only wasn't I getting the \nrifle for Christmas, now Pa was dragging me out in the cold, and for \nno earthly reason that I could see. We'd already done all the chores, \nand I couldn't thnk of anything else that needed doing, especially \nnot on a night like this. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut I knew Pa was not very patient at one dragging one's feet when \nhe'd told them to do something, so I got up and put my boots back on \nand got my cap, coat, and mittens. Ma gave me a mysterious smile as I \nopened the door to leave the house. Something was up, but I didn't \nknow what. \u0014\n\u0014\nOutside, I became even more dismayed. There in front of the house was \nthe work team, already hitched to the big sled. Whatever it was we \nwere going to do wasn't going to be a short, quick, little job. I \ncould tell. We never hitched up this sled unless we were going to \nhaul a big load. \u0014\n\u0014\nPa was already up on the seat, reins in hand. I reluctantly climbed \nup beside him. The cold was already biting at me. I wasn't happy. \nWhen I was on, Pa pulled the sled around the house and stopped in \nfront of the woodshed. He got off and I followed. \"I think we'll put \non the high sideboards,\" he said. \"Here, help me.\" The high \nsideboards! It had been a bigger job than I wanted to do with just \nthe low sideboards on, but whatever it was we were going to do would \nbe a lot bigger with the high sideboards on. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter we had exchanged the sideboards, Pa went into the woodshed and \ncame out with an armload of wood---the wood I'd spent all summer \nhauling down from the mountain, and then all Fall sawing into blocks \nand splitting. What was he doing? Finally I said something. \"Pa,\" I \nasked, \"what are you doing?\" You been by the Widow Jensen's lately?\" \nhe asked. The Widow Jensen lived about two miles down the road. Her \nhusband had died a year or so before and left her with three \nchildren, the oldest being eight. Sure, I'd been by, but so what? \n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"Why?\" \"I rode by just today,\" Pa said. \"Little Jakey \nwas out digging around in the woodpile trying to find a few chips. \nThey're out of wood, Matt.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThat was all he said and then he turned and went back into the \nwoodshed for another armload of wood. I followed him. We loaded the \nsled so high that I began to wonder if the horses would be able to \npull it. Finally, Pa called a halt to our loading, then we went to \nthe smoke house and Pa took down a big ham and a side of bacon. He \nhanded them to me and told me to put them in the sled and wait. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he returned he was carrying a sack of flour over his right \nshoulder and a smaller sack of something in his left hand. \"What's in \nthe little sack?\" I asked. \"Shoes. They're out of shoes. Little Jakey \njust had gunny sacks wrapped around his feet when he was out in the \nwoodpile this morning. I got the children a little candy too. It just \nwouldn't be Christmas without a little candy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWe rode the two miles to Widow Jensen's pretty much in silence. I \ntried to think through what Pa was doing. We didn't have much by \nworldly standards. Of course, we did have a big woodpile, though most \nof what was left now was still in the form of logs that I would have \nto saw into blocks and split before we could use it. We also had meat \nand flour, so we could spare that, but I knew we didn't have any \nmoney, so why was Pa buying them shoes and candy? \u0014\n\u0014\nReally, why was he doing any of this? Widow Jensen had closer \nneighbors than us; it shouldn't have been our concern. We came in \nfrom the blind side of the Jensen house and unloaded the wood as \nquietly as possible, then we took the meat and flour and shoes to the \ndoor. We knocked. The door opened a crack and a timid voice said, \n\"Who is it?\" \"Lucas Miles, Ma'am, and my son, Matt. Could we come in \nfor a bit?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWidow Jensen opened the door and let us in. She had a blanket wrapped \naround her shoulders. The children were wrapped in another and were \nsitting in front of the fireplace by a very small fire that hardly \ngave off any heat at all. Widow Jensen fumbled with a match and \nfinally lit the lamp. \"We brought you a few things, Ma'am,\" Pa said \nand set down the sack of flour. I put the meat on the table. Then Pa \nhanded her the sack that had the shoes in it. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe opened it hesitantly and took the shoes out one pair at a time. \nThere was a pair for her and one for each of the children---sturdy \nshoes, the best, shoes that would last. I watched her carefully. She \nbit her lower lip to keep it from trembling and then tears filled her \neyes and started running down her cheeks. She looked up at Pa like \nshe wanted to say something, but it wouldn't come out. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We brought a load of wood too, Ma'am,\" Pa said. He turned to me and \nsaid, \"Matt, go bring in enough to last awhile. Let's get that fire \nup to size and heat this place up.\" I wasn't the same person when I \nwent back out to bring in the wood. I had a big lump in my throat and \nas much as I hate to admit it, there were tears in my eyes too. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn my mind I kept seeing those three kids huddled around the \nfireplace and their mother standing there with tears running down her \ncheeks with so much gratitude in her heart that she couldn't speak. \nMy heart swelled within me and a joy that I'd never known before, \nfilled my soul. I had given at Christmas many times before, but never \nwhen it had made so much difference. I could see we were literally \nsaving the lives of these people. \u0014\n\u0014\nI soon had the fire blazing and everyone's spirits soared. The kids \nstarted giggling when Pa handed them each a piece of candy and Widow \nJensen looked on with a smile that probably hadn't crossed her face \nfor a long time. She finally turned to us. \"God bless you,\" she said. \n\"I know the Lord has sent you. The children and I have been praying \nthat he would send one of his angels to spare us.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of myself, the lump returned to my throat and the tears \nwelled up in my eyes again. I'd never thought of Pa in those exact \nterms before, but after Widow Jensen mentioned it I could see that it \nwas probably true. I was sure that a better man than Pa had never \nwalked the earth. I started remembering all the times he had gone out \nof his way for Ma and me, and many others. The list seemed endless as \nI thought on it. \u0014\n\u0014\nPa insisted that everyone try on the shoes before we left. I was \namazed when they all fit and I wondered how he had known what sizes \nto get. Then I guessed that if he was on an errand for the Lord that \nthe Lord would make sure he got the right sizes. \u0014\n\u0014\nTears were running down Widow Jensen's face again when we stood up to \nleave.Pa took each of the kids in his big arms and gave them a hug. \nThey clung to him and didn't want us to go. I could see that they \nmissed their Pa, and I was glad that I still had mine. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the door Pa turned to Widow Jensen and said, \"The Mrs. wanted me \nto invite you and the children over for Christmas dinner tomorrow. \nThe turkey will be more than the three of us can eat, and a man can \nget cantankerous if he has to eat turkey for too many meals. We'll be \nby to get you about eleven. It'll be nice to have some little ones \naround again. Matt, here, hasn't been little for quite a spell.\" I \nwas the youngest. My two brothers and two sisters had all married and \nhad moved away. Widow Jensen nodded and said, \"Thank you, Brother \nMiles. I don't have to say, \"'May the Lord bless you,' I know for \ncertain that He will.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOut on the sled I felt a warmth that came from deep within and I \ndidn't even notice the cold. When we had gone a ways, Pa turned to me \nand said, \"Matt, I want you to know something. Your ma and me have \nbeen tucking a little money away here and there all year so we could \nbuy that rifle for you, but we didn't have quite enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen yesterday a man who owed me a little money from years back came \nby to make things square. Your ma and me were real excited, thinking \nthat now we could get you that rifle, and I started into town this \nmorning to do just that. But on the way I saw little Jakey out \nscratching in the woodpile with his feet wrapped in those gunny sacks \nand I knew what I had to do.

    "words": "Christmas Origins\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the December 21, 2002 issue of World magazine, Gene Veith points \nout, \"Critics of Christmas say that the Christian holiday is nothing \nmore than the old pagan celebration of the winter solstice. . . . For \nthe ancient pagans, the winter solstice meant the triumph of \ndarkness. The Druids called it the \"Death of the Sun.\" The fear was \nthat the light would never return, unless human beings brought back \nthe light with rituals and sacrifices. After the solstice, of course, \nthe days started to grow longer, which was a big relief and reason \nfor feasting and celebration. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"But whereas the pagans observed the solstice in terror, feverishly \nkeeping the fires going lest the darkness overcome them, Christians \nturned what was literally the dead of winter into the happiest time \nof the year. The time of year now meant that when darkness is at its \ngreatest, the light of God  Jesus Christ  is born. Gradually, \nthough the night is still longer than the day throughout the winter, \nthe light increases every day. Finally, the light surpasses the \ndarkness. This occurs just after the spring equinox, March 21, \nanother favorite time for holidays in the world's religions. Around \nthat time Christians celebrate Easter, the day Christ rose from the \ndead, marking His victory over sin, death, the devil, and every \ndarkness. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In their seasonal symbolism of light and darkness, Christmas and \nEaster go together. Christmas marks the beginning of the light, and \nEaster marks the triumph of the light, just as the birth of the \nChrist child marks the beginning of His work, which culminates in the \nvictory of His death and resurrection.\" (you can read Veith's entire \narticle at \nhttp://www.worldmag.com/world/issue/12-21-02/cultural_1.asp)\u0014",

    "title": "CIRCUMCISION OPPONENTS USE LEGAL SYSTEM",
    "words": "Circumcision Opponents Use the Legal System and Legislatures\u0014\nBy ADAM LIPTAK\u0014\n\u0014\nARGO, N.D., Jan. 16,2003, New York Times Josiah Flatt, like about 60 \npercent of other newborn American boys, was circumcised soon after he \nwas born here, in the spring of 1997. Two years later, his parents \nsued the doctor and the hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey did not contend that the circumcision was botched or deny that \nJosiah's mother, Anita Flatt, had consented to the procedure in \nwriting. They said, instead, that the doctor had failed to tell them \nenough about the pain, complications and consequences of \ncircumcision, removing the foreskin of the penis. \u0014\nThe suit will be heard by a jury next month. In declining to dismiss \nthe case here before trial, Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger acknowledged \nthat the case was unusual in that nothing \"went `wrong' during the \nprocedure.\" The main harm Josiah seeks compensation for, Judge \nRothe-Seeger noted, is \"diminished sexual sensation injury.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suit is but one effort by a small but energetic group of loosely \naffiliated advocates and lawyers to use the legal system to combat \nthe practice  most American newborn boys undergo the operation when \nthey are days old  which they liken to genital cutting in girls. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe advocates have been active in state legislatures, too. Ten states \nno longer allow Medicaid to pay for circumcision. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"They have reached the ears of legislators and insurance companies,\" \nDr. Thomas Wiswell, a professor of pediatrics at the State University \nof New York at Stony Brook and a proponent of the procedure, said \nabout the opponents. \"They are far more vocal than proponents of \ncircumcision.\"\u0014\nJ. Steven Svoboda, director of Attorneys for the Rights of the Child, \na group devoted to the issue, contends that circumcision is wrong as \na matter of law, medicine and philosophy. Children of both sexes, Mr. \nSvoboda said, should be entitled to \"bodily integrity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJosiah Flatt's case appears to be the first to go to trial based on \nthe theory that the absence of an exhaustive medical briefing about \nthe risks and benefits of circumcision is tantamount to a lack of \ninformed consent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the possible complications in the operation are excess \nbleeding, infection and ulceration and occasional permanent damage to \nthe penis. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This could be a very important test case,\" said Geoffrey P. Miller, \na professor of law at New York University who has written about legal \nand cultural issues of circumcision.\u0014\nJosiah's father, James, died in 2001 in an automobile accident, but \nthe boy's mother, Anita, 33, decided to proceed with the suit. The \nfamily's lawyer, Zenas Baer, said no sensible parent would willingly \nsubject a child to circumcision knowing what it entailed. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The practice is absolutely barbaric,\" Mr. Baer said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe doctor who performed the circumcision, Sunita Kantak, and \nrepresentatives of the hospital, the MeritCare Medical Center, issued \nthis statement: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Anita Flatt was given information about circumcision, and she asked \nto have her son circumcised. The circumcision was done because she \nrequested it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA hospital spokeswoman, Carrie Johnson, declined to elaborate.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn court papers, the hospital said the suit was part of a crusade.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This lawsuit is an attempt to abolish circumcision in North Dakota \nof newborn males with healthy foreskin,\" the hospital's lawyers \nwrote. \"Plaintiffs want to change public policy so that only a \ncompetent male once he reaches adulthood, and not his parent, should \nbe able to consent to circumcision.\"\u0014\nOnly 3 in 1,000 men not circumcised at birth choose to have the \nprocedure, experts say.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid J. Llewellyn, a Georgia lawyer who represents plaintiffs in \ncircumcision malpractice cases, said the hospital was correct in \nidentifying what would be the next step for opponents of the \npractice. \u0014\n\"The question of whether or not a parent can consent at all will come \nrather quickly,\" Mr. Llewellyn said.\u0014\nJudge Rothe-Seeger, who will preside over the trial in Cass County \nDistrict Court, seemed to agree in a pretrial decision. She suggested \nthat Josiah could sue his parents some day if he could show that they \nfailed to act in his best interests.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 1.2 million newborns are circumcised in the United States every \nyear, at a cost of $150 million to $270 million, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics says.\u0014\n\u0014\nCircumcision for other than religious reasons is a relatively recent \nphenomenon in the United States. It began in the late 19th century \nand peaked in the 1960's at 90 percent of newborns. Circumcision \nrates vary widely. They are highest in the Midwest, about 80 percent, \nand lowest in the West, under 40 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe procedure is not common elsewhere. In Canada, the rate is 17 \npercent and in Britain 5 percent. Elsewhere in Europe, in South \nAmerica and in non-Muslim Asia, the procedure is rare.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is powerful evidence, Dr. Wiswell said, that circumcision helps \nprevent urinary tract infections, penile cancer and sexually \ntransmitted diseases, including H.I.V. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, in a policy statement in 1999, \nsaid that the risks of infection and cancer were low even without the \nprocedure and that evidence on sexually transmitted diseases was \n\"complex and conflicting.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe academy noted that the procedure could involve complications, as \ncould any surgery. If performed without adequate anesthesia, it is \nvery painful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe academy concluded that \"existing scientific evidence demonstrates \npotential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"However,\" it added, \"these data are not sufficient to recommend \nroutine neonatal circumcision.\"\u0014\nIt added that it was \"legitimate for parents to take into account \ncultural, religious and ethnic traditions, in addition to the medical \nfactors, when making this decision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Rothe-Seeger wrote, \"One of the earliest purposes of \ncircumcision was to limit sexual intercourse and to curb sexual \nexcitement.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt has also been prescribed through the years as a remedy for \nalcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, gout, hysteria, malnutrition, night \nterrors, clubfoot, eczema and promiscuity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Circumcision is a medical procedure in search of something to cure,\" \nsaid Mr. Baer, the Flatts' lawyer. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the last year, Arizona, Missouri, Montana and North Carolina \njoined six other states  California, Mississippi, Nevada, North \nDakota, Oregon and Washington  that do not offer Medicaid \nreimbursement for circumcision for any reason, including religious \nbeliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid L. Gollaher, who wrote \"Circumcision: A History of the World's \nMost Controversial Surgery\" (Basic Books, 2000), said that trend \nwould \"be the bullet that kills this thing.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"If people have to pony up a couple of hundred bucks, at the margin, \nthey won't do it,\" Mr. Gollaher said. \"And insurance coverage signals \na certain attitude about medical appropriateness or necessity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is little legal scholarship in the area. That is partly \nattributable, Professor Miller said, to efforts intended to prevent \ngenital cutting in girls, a practice prevalent in Africa that reduces \nsexual pleasure. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's all tied up in the politics of feminism,\" he said. \"Some \nfeminists take offense at the idea that there is any comparison \nbetween a highly damaging assault committed by a patriarchal society \nand male circumcision. It's a dangerous topic to get into.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview, Ms. Flatt, who is a lawyer, said she was told next \nto nothing about circumcision before she consented to it. Asked what \nshe wished she had been told, she grew animated and her voice rose.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's healthy tissue,\" she said of the foreskin. \"It's useful. \nThere's bleeding risk. There's pain. There's infection risk. There's \ndeath risk. There's no medical benefit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You'd better give me a very good reason why, and it's got to be more \nthan he'll look like dad.\"\u0014",

    "title": "COINED BY GOD: WORDS AND PHRASES",
    "words": "In the spirit of the Vatican's attempt to recover older, more \nstraightforward uses of words, here's a quick look at a new book that \nexplores the Bible origins and subsequent history of certain \nimportant English terms.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoined By God: Words and Phrases That First Appear in English \nTranslations of the Bible, by Stanley Malless and Jeffrey McQuain, is \ndue out from W. W. Norton in February, 2003.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis small book's brief but informative entries touch on a mere \nsampling150of the myriad words and phrases that first emerged in \nEnglish translations of the Bible. The translations surveyed range \nfrom John Wycliffe's in 1382 to the 1611 King James Version. None of \nthe terms treated in this book, say the authors, have any previous \nrecorded existence on the printed English page, though some may have \npreceded their Biblical debuts with a history of spoken English usage.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere we find that the very word at the root of our \nproblem\"interpretation\"first appeared in Wycliffe's translation of \nDaniel 5:14. There, King Belshazzar asks the young prophet \"to show \nme the interpretation\" of the writing on his palace wall. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany centuries after Daniel, the postmodern theorists of the academic \n\"ivory tower\" (Wycliffe, 1382, Song of Solomon 7:4) have used \nprinciples of interpretation to obscure rather than make plain. \nMalless and McQuain can't resist quoting the incisive Montaigne on \nthis score: \"It is more of a job to interpret the interpretations \nthan to interpret the things.\" Fresh from one of those ivory towers \nmyself, I can only answer Brother Montaigne with a hearty \"amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are a few of the Biblical words and phrases listed by the Coined \nby God authors that have been born again with new political meanings:\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider \"born again\" itself, introduced by the venerable Wycliffe \ninas every evangelist knowsJohn 3:3. This familiar phrase has now \ngained, as Safire put it in the 1993 edition of his Political \nDictionary, a \"new political sense,\" viz: \"freshly convinced; or \nnewly returned to the fold.\" I suppose, under this new usage, one \ncould even be a born-again terrorist. Maybe once Charles Colson had \nbrought the phrase to the desks and minds of the nation's politicos \nin his 1976 biography of the same name, this shift was already \ninevitable.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr how about the seemingly theological term \"doctrine.\" Wycliffe \ncreated many English coinages by making more or less direct \ntransliterations from Jerome's Latin Vulgate version of the Bible. \nThis one he brought over from the Latin verb docere (\"to teach\"), to \nrender Jesus' quotation from Isaiah in Matt. 15:9: \"This people \nhonors me without cause, teaching the doctrines and commandments of \nmen.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries, this term has acquired a constrictive, even \ntotalitarian flavor, becoming something of a cuss word in the free \nair of America. Familiar in such phrases as \"Monroe doctrine,\" the \nterm, while still showing up in religious contexts today, is just as \nlikely to appear with the meaning Safire lists: \"policies that have \nhardened with acceptance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor readers who think I've strayed inexcusably far from the Vatican's \nnoble lexicographical effortO ye of little faith! (Wycliffe, Matt. \n8:26)let's look at a few of the \"sexy\" terms that have made their \nway into our language via the gates of Scripture. These include a few \nthat show up on the front lines of today's sex-and-family culture-war \nskirmishes.\u0014\n\u0014\nNever mind the postmodernist/feminist favorite, \"gender.\" The very \nterm \"female\" itself first made its appearance in Wycliffe's 1382 \nrendering of Genesis 1:27. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe biologically specific term \"puberty,\" toowhere would discussions \nof \"sexual education\" be without it?debuted in the same translation, \nin the Malachi 2:14 expression \"between you and the wife of your \npuberty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, one need look no further than that same 1382 translation to \nfind the very first printed use of the term nobody in these debates \ncan do without\"sex.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHere again, in rendering a passage from Genesis (the instruction to \nNoah in 6:19 \"that male sex and female\" of every animal be shipped \nout), Wycliffe followed the lead of the Vulgate, which used at that \nplace the Latin root term sexus. \u0014\n\u0014\nI can't resist a last word on the Vatican's effort to clear up and \nset \"right\" again terms obfuscated (or if you prefer plain \nAnglo-Saxon, muddied) by the radical left: Whatever their lexicon's \nsuccess, the many Catholic social scientists who have contributed can \nfind comfort in the fact that the term \"left wing\" itself first \nemerged in a Bible verse. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe source for this one was Coverdale's 1535 translation of the \ndeuterocanonical Book of Maccabees. There, a moment comes in the \nJewish patriot Judas Maccabaeus's military exploits when \"they which \nwere of the left wing [lefte wynge] saw that the right side was \ndiscomfited\" (1 Maccabees 9:16). \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it was only, as Malless and McQuain point out, 250 years later \nthat the term took on its modern political meaning in the French \nNational Assembly. But here again, as in every debate in every \ntimeleft wing, right wing, or somewhere in the middleour words \neventually come back to God. Not necessarily to some coinage in a \nparticular translation of the Bible (though the study of these is \nworth putting Coined by God on your bedside table), but to God sure \nenough.\u0014\n\u0014\nRead John 1:1, in whatever translation you'd like:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the \nWord was God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nObfuscate that.\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "Clouds darkening over India\u0014\n\u0014\nMilitant Hinduism has been growing in India over the last few years. \nThe South Asia Human Rights Documentation Center noted that just \nwithin the first seven months of 2000, there were 57 attacks on \nChristian communities and Christian missionaries. As the U.S. State \nDepartment Report on Human Rights Practices in India (just released \nFebruary 23) reports, those attacks have been on the increaseand \n\"enforcement of the law has been poor, particularly at the state and \nlocal levels.\" It may be about to get worse. Speaking to a group of \njournalists, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) president \nAshok Singhal has called for Hindus to take up weapons against \nmissionaries and other Christians. \"It his high time for the Hindus \nto arm themselves in self-defense against the evil designs of  the \nChurch,\" he said. The militant Hindu VHP has been accused of violence \nin the past, but this is the first time that Weblog knows of that the \norganizational leadership has been so brazen. And it couldn't come at \na worse time. Tensions are running high as Hindu militant leader Dara \nSingh stands trial for the murder of Australian missionary Graham \nStaines and his sons. Witnesses, including Staines's co-pastor and a \nlocal resident, testified over the weekend. Singh, meanwhile, \nasserted, \"I was there, watching it from a distance, but I did not \nset them ablaze.  I wanted to teach [Staines] a lesson, not kill \nhim.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Staines' widow, who quickly returned to work in India \nafter the incident, is facing increased persecution, says Global \nCouncil of Indian Christians. And in the state where Staines was \nkilled, fears by Christians are being realized. Under a controversial \nlaw passed in 1999, all conversions must be approved by the state \ngovernment. At the time Christians warned that officials would \nregularly delay or deny permission, and that seems to be what is \nhappening. \"Government officials are holding back the permission for \nthe tribal family to convert under pressure from Hindu fundamentalist \noutfits,\" reports Catholic World News. \u0014\n\u0014\nposted 3/6/01, Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "CAN REINCARNATION BE PROVEN?",
    "words": "Can Reincarnation Be Proven? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow researchers have investigated claims of past lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Laura Sheahen \u0014\n\u0014\n For most people, reincarnation is a matter of faith. Millions of \nHindus believe in it, and some polls show that over 20% of Americans \nwho self-identify as Christians do too, despite Christian doctrine's \nrepudiation of the idea. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat fewer people know is that reincarnation is actually being \nstudied scientifically. The research falls into three categories: \u0014\n\u0014\n1. Children's Claims of Past Life Memories\u0014\nSome feel that persuasive evidence for reincarnation is found in the \nwork of psychiatrist Dr. Ian Stevenson, who recently retired from his \npost in the Division of Personality Studies at the University of \nVirginia. Stevenson spent four decades traveling the globe, following \nup on thousands of cases of very young children who reported \nintricate memories of past lives. According to Stevenson's \ndocumentation, these children spontaneously recalled names, \nlocations, and intimate details of people they could not possibly \nknow. \u0014\n\u0014\nSample case: A five-year-old Indian boy, Parmod Sharma, remembered \nspecific details about a man named Parmanand, including street \ndirections in Parmanand's city and the man's \"special seat.\" The boy \nalso visited the factory Parmanand owned and gave directions for \nrepairing complicated machinery in it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nProponents say: Stevenson's work follows the scientific method; his \ncontrolled studies rule out connections between the child's family \nand the \"past life\" family. In 1975, in a review of Stevenson's \n\"Cases of the Reincarnation Type\" in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, Dr. Lester S. King concluded that Stevenson had \n\"painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases \nin India, cases in which the evidence for reincarnation is difficult \nto understand on any other grounds....[H]e has placed on record a \nlarge amount of data that cannot be ignored.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSkeptics say: Most of Stevenson's cases occurred in countries where a \nbelief in reincarnation is a cultural given, such as Thailand or \nIndia. In such cultures, children might be predisposed to make up \nstories about past lives--stories that are then positively reinforced \nor conditioned by family members. Stevenson himself says his studies \nare merely \"suggestive\" of reincarnation and declines to state \npositively whether reincarnation is real. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn additional source of concern is the fact that few other \nresearchers have studied children's claims. A skeptic deconstructs \nseveral of Stevenson's famous cases. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Birthmark Matches\u0014\nDr. Stevenson has also pioneered the study of birthmarks as a \npossible window into a person's past life. His work draws connections \nbetween birthmarks and injuries from past lives. For example, one of \nhis cases refers to a pronounced birthmark on the scalp of a Thai \nchild; the child remembers the life of a man who was killed by a \nknife wound to the head. In some cases, Dr. Stevenson has collected \nmedical records (such as X-rays) from the person believed to have \nreincarnated. \u0014\n\u0014\nSample case: An Indian boy with an unusually patterned birthmark on \nhis chest says he remembers the life of a man, Maha Ram, who was \nkilled with a shotgun fired at close range. An autopsy report of Maha \nRam showed the principal shotgun wounds, which appear to be in a \nsimilar pattern.\u0014\n\u0014\nProponents say: It's statistically improbable that the birthmarks are \ncoincidences, given their location and patterns; in addition, in some \ncases Stevenson has identified two separate birthmarks on one person, \ncorresponding to two different traumas undergone by the deceased \nperson. Stevenson documented the case of Necip nltaskiran of \nTurkey, who had seven birthmarks, six of which corresponded to wounds \ndescribed in a medical report. Necip also claimed that he had stabbed \nhis wife of a previous life in the leg; her scar was verified when \nshe was identified. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Past Life Regression by Adults\u0014\nSome believe that memories which surface during hypnotherapy sessions \noffer evidence of a person's past life. While hypnotized, adults have \nrelated details about past lives as Middle Eastern warriors, European \npeasants, and more. \u0014\n\u0014\nSample case: In one famous but oft-disputed case, a Colorado woman \nwas hypnotized and subsequently remembered the life of Bridey Murphy, \na 19th-century woman from Cork, Ireland. While under hypnosis, she \ntalked in an Irish brogue, sang Irish songs, and remembered being \nheld as she bent to kiss the Blarney Stone. Recordings of the \nhypnotic sessions were made and translated into more than a dozen \nlanguages. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a more recent case, previously skeptical psychiatrist Dr. Brian \nWeiss had been treating a young woman with traditional \"talk therapy\" \nfor over a year. Failing to identify the source of her chronic fears, \nhe decided to use hypnotherapy. While under hypnosis, his patient \nrecalled her life in the year 1863 B.C.E., when she was a 25-year-old \nnamed Aronda. \u0014\n\u0014\nProponents say: Some psychiatrists have found the level of detail and \nplausibility in their patients' accounts very persuasive. In Dr. \nWeiss' case, his patient had visited him for eighteen months before \nrecalling the past life. Weiss argues that if the patient had simply \nwanted to make the memories up, she would not have waited so long to \ndo so. \u0014\n\u0014\nSkeptics say: One skeptics' study states that a belief in \nreincarnation is the greatest predictor of whether a subject has a \npast-life memory while undergoing hypnotherapy, and that therefore a \nsubject's memories are most likely self-fulfilling prophecies. Dr. \nJim Tucker, who has continued Dr. Stevenson's work at the University \nof Virginia, says: \"In general, past-life regression work has lacked \nthe scientific rigor of Dr. Stevenson's work. A subject may describe \na life in ancient times with great emotion, but since the statements \ncannot be verified as accurate for a particular individual who \nactually lived, the evidenciary value of such a case is very limited \nat best.\"\u0014",

The situation was described in a recent story in London's \nDaily Telegraph (Feb. 10, 2003).\u0014\nAccording to the Telegraph, \"A recent report . . . said that on \npresent trends, adult attendance in 2030 would be 500,000, under half \nthe 1980 figure. Child attendance would be virtually nil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to such trends, the Anglican hierarchy has created a \nvideo, featuring the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, as part of a \n100,000 ($160,000) campaign to persuade clergy to meet people \"where \nthey are\" rather than waiting for them to come to church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe video will describe the dire state of the Church in parts of the \ncountry, but will not be aimed primarily at increasing church \nattendance.

    "words": "Coping \nWith Anxiety\u0014\nScience shows that meditation, massage, yogaeven laughtercan change \nbad habits in the brain\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Claudia Kalb\u0014\nNEWSWEEK\u0014\n \u0014\nFeb. 24 issue   Theres Cipro, potassium iodide and the smallpox \nvaccine to ward off biological agents. But is there an antidote to \nanxiety? Im very frightened, said Julie White, as she exited \nManhattans Sonic Yoga last week.  \u0014\n\u0014\nBUT SHE HAS a remedy: the stretching and deep breathing of yoga. The \npractice is so calming that after the terror upgrade, White made an \nupgrade of her ownfrom one class a day to two. Yoga, she says, is \nmy tranquilizer.\u0014\n\u0014\n        You may find the lotus pose hopelessly warm and fuzzy in the \nface of terror. But there are a host of activities, from working out \nto going for a massage, that can temper the anxiety. Many of these \ntechniques have been used for decades, if not centuries; now advances \nin science are showing they can reduce the hormones associated with \nstress and even affect brain activity. The common trait among all: \nmaintaining control and recognizing that our concerns are a natural \nresponse to the world we live in. Were justified in having this \nfear, says Dr. Herbert Benson, president of the Mind/Body Medical \nInstitute of Boston. Life was stressful before 9-11. Its gotten \nprogressively worse.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The first step toward combating fear is identifying it. Keep \nin mind that headaches, stomachaches, sleeplessness and rapid \nheartbeat are all symptoms of anxiety. Confront the emotion head-on \nby naming it, even saying, I feel fear about this, says Saki \nSantorelli, executive director of the University of Massachusetts \nMedical Schools Center for Mindfulness. Acknowledging anxiety makes \nus less passive, less vulnerable and, as a result, more able to cope.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Understand that fear is a component of stress, the complex \nfight-or-flight response ingrained in us since the cave days. When \nwere confronted with danger, epinephrine (adrenaline) starts \npumping, the heart speeds up, blood pressure increases, breathing \nquickens.\u0014\n       \u0014\nBREATHE EASY\u0014\n\u0014\n       One of the most efficient ways to reduce stress is to focus \ninward on one thing we can effectively control: our own breath. At \nthe Mind/Body Medical Institute, participants elicit a relaxation \nresponse, repeating a wordanything from om to Hail \nMarysilently as they exhale. In numerous studies, Benson has found \nthat the practice leads to lower blood pressure, slower breathing and \nan overall calm. Richard Davidson at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison recently found that a form of meditative breathing \npioneered at the Center for Mindfulness can affect the brain. In a \nsmall, soon-to-be-published study, Davidson took brain images of 25 \nmembers of a biotech firm who practiced meditation six days a week \nfor eight weeks. He found increased activation in the left side of \nthe prefrontal part of the brain, an area associated with lower \nanxiety, positive emotion and inhibition of the amygdala, the brains \nfear center.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf sitting in one position for more than five minutes sounds \nimpossible, you might try yoga. Concentrating on the physical \nintricacies of different poses forces you to filter out the endless \ntape loops of chatter and fear, says Dr. Timothy McCall, medical \neditor of Yoga Journal, allowing you to be present in the moment. In \nso doing, you begin to clear the mind of future worries.\u0014\n\u0014\n        You can also reduce angst by deliberately altering the way \nyou perceive the world. Cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses \non identifying and changing destructive thinking, is the gold \nstandard for treating anxiety disorders. Patients are encouraged to \nconfront their worst fearssuch as riding an elevatorto prove to \nthemselves that they can and will survive. That experience helps get \nrid of distorted thinking, says Stanford University psychiatrist Dr. \nDavid Burns. What to do in the face of terrorism? Accept your \nanxiety, but dont let it control you. And certainly dont ruminate \non your own. Anxiety feeds on itself, says Dr. Paul Appelbaum, \npresident of the American Psychiatric Association, so talk to family \nand friends. Sharing the concern with others can be enormously \nhelpful.\u0014\n       \u0014\nAN EXERCISE IN STRESS REDUCTION\u0014\n\u0014\n       Scientists are finding that it can help to get outside your \nhead completely. In a study of 60 schoolchildren traumatized by \nHurricane Andrew, Tiffany Field, director of the University of \nMiamis Touch Research Institute, found that depression dropped in \nkids who received 30 minutes of massage twice a week for a month; \nkids who watched a relaxing video showed no improvement. And cortisol \nlevels, the bodys marker for stress, declined significantly in the \nmassage group compared with controls. If massage isnt your thing, go \nfor a vigorous walk, swim or bike ride. Exercise is not only good at \nkeeping you fit, it reduces anxiety and depression, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt may be difficult, but in troubled times, researchers say, people \nneed to take comfort from lifes simplest pleasures. In a small study \nat the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Dr. O. J. Sahler \nfound that bone-marrow transplant patients who listened to music \nreported less pain and nausea, and their transplants took less time \nto become functional. And, yes, laughter may be good medicine, too. \nDr. Lee Berk, of the Loma Linda University School of Public Health, \ndiscovered that a group of students who watched a comic video for an \nhour had marked reductions in epinephrine and cortisol levels. If \nfear is too great, says Berk, send in the clowns. Now thats \nsomething we can all meditate on.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith Anne Underwood, Karen Springen and Vanessa Juarez\u0014\n       \u0014\n        2003 Newsweek, Inc.\u0014",

    "title": "CONVERTING 'AMAZING GRACE'",
    "words": "Converting 'Amazing Grace'\u0014\nThe story behind America's most beloved song shows the God-centered \nvision with which it was written.\u0014\nBy David Neff | posted 03/31/2003, Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nAmazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song \u0014\nSteve Turner \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Newton, the author of \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Glorious Things of \nThee Are Spoken,\" was remarkably thickheaded. If Calvinists believe \nin the \"perseverance of the saints,\" this future Calvinist devoted \nhimself to demonstrating the persistence of the sinner. The first few \nchapters of Steve Turner's engaging Amazing Grace chronicle Newton's \ndogged commitment to self-destructive vice to the point that this \nreader could not help scrawling in the margin of page 37, \"This man \nwas thick!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLike many a seafaring man of the 18th century, Newton repeatedly \nengaged in physically and spiritually destructive behaviors. He \ndeserted the Royal Navy, then was flogged for desertion and demoted. \nHe made up disrespectful songs about his ship's captain and was \ndemoted again. He frequently drowned himself in drink. He prided \nhimself in creative profanity and sharp attacks on Christian belief. \nEven though on several occasions he seemed to have been miraculously \npreserved when he should have lost his life, he persisted in the \ngodless philosophy he learned from the Third Earl of Shaftesbury's \nCharacteristicks (which book Alexander Pope said had \"done more harm \nto Revealed Religion in England than all the works of Infidelity put \ntogether\"). He hardened his heart against God's advances.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne definition of neurosis (variously attributed to figures ranging \nfrom Rudyard Kipling to Bill Clinton) is doing the same thing over \nand over and expecting different results. Though his stupid \npersistence might qualify him for that label and worse, Newton was \nnot just neurotic, he was spiritually sick. And God let that sickness \nrun its course until Newton was willing to be healed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of his conversion during an Atlantic storm is well known, \nand Turner tells it with exceptional drama. He seizes the moment to \noffer readers a lesson in what Wesley called experimental religion. \n\"Still at the [ship's] wheel he reasoned that the best way forward \nwas to ask for the power of the Spirit and then to start acting as \nthough the gospel was true. The proof would be in the living.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proof indeed came in the living, and Turner goes on to tell the \nstory of a man devoted to God, to the people of his parish, and to \nthe woman he loved. Indeed, his early persistence in vice was matched \nonly by the perseverance of his romantic longings for Mary Catlett, \nwhom he eventually married.\u0014\n\u0014\nParish poet\u0014\nWhat emerges from Turner's book is the picture of a man deeply \ndevoted to teaching the gospel to the people of Olney parish. He was \nalso devoted to the spiritual and emotional welfare of his depressive \nfriend, poet William Cowper. With Cowper, he produced an amazing body \nof hymnody, revolutionary for its time. Vibrant hymn singing was one \nof the earmarks of the 18th-century evangelical revival, but because \nof liturgical restrictions, the popular hymns were forced out of the \nconfines of the church's Sunday worship into less formal gatherings \noutside consecrated buildings. In the Olney parish, this meant extra \nmeetings in the vicarage on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on Sundays \nafter church. The hymns that Newton and Cowper wrote seem formal and \ndidactic by today's standards, but in their time they were marked by \na simplicity of language and straightforwardness of meaning designed \nto be sung by laborers and other \"plain people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOften Newton wrote hymns to match the biblical passage from which he \nwas planning to teach. One of these hymns was \"Amazing Grace,\" and we \ncan date the composition of the hymn because we know the text (1 \nChron. 17:1617) and the day he preached on it (Jan. 1, 1773). The \npassage records King David's response to God's promise to make his \nname like the greatest men of the earth. \"Who am I . . . that thou \nhast brought me hitherto?\" Turner recounts the main points of \nNewton's exposition of the passage and shows how the verses of \n\"Amazing Grace\" reinforce Newton's pastoral teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurner has much more to say about Newton, but his not-to-be-missed \npoint is this: Newton's conversion did not bring him immediately to \nsee the evils of slavery. Morally speaking, he was a slow learner. \nTurner remarks on the irony of the tenderness of this ship captain's \nletters home to his beloved Mary while he showed complete lack of \nconcern for the African families he was breaking up. A telling \npassage from one letter cites \"the three greatest blessings of which \nhuman nature is capable\" as \"religion, liberty, and love.\" But \nreferring to those he had helped to enslave, he wrote, \"I believe . . \n. that they have no words among them expressive of these engaging \nideas: from whence I infer that the ideas themselves have no place in \ntheir minds,\" as if blacks are not human!\u0014\n\u0014\nThough such moral blindness is obvious to us, it was hardly unusual \namong devout Christians of his time. And when in God's Providence it \ncame time for Newton to take a stand, it was again through ironic \nagency. Newton met William Wilberforce when the future politician was \na very rich orphan eight years of age. The two struck up a spiritual \nfriendship, and when as a young man Wilberforce had a spiritual \nawakening, he sought out Newton, like Nicodemus under cover of night. \nIt was Newton who moved Wilberforce to apply his Christian principles \nto his politics. But when it came to denouncing the slave trade, \nNewton would not commit himself publicly until the mid-1780snearly \n30 years after the issue was first broached in Parliament, 20 years \nafter the Countess of Huntingdon began campaigning for equal \ntreatment of the races, and 14 years after John Wesley wrote his \nThoughts on Slavery. Turner argues that it was Wilberforce who \nfinally got Newton to go public with his concerns about the slave \ntrade. The mentee challenged the mentor to consistent Christian \nprinciple.\u0014\n\u0014\nWedded to a perfect tune\u0014\nFor all its fascinating detail about John Newton, Turner's book is \nreally about \"Amazing Grace.\" And here the book provides additional \nhistory that is otherwise hard to find.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, it details the background of the hymn's most familiar tune. If \nyour denomination's hymnal was published before 1991, chances are it \nimproperly credits the tune to James Carrell and David Clayton's \nshaped-note songbook Virginia Harmony (1831). But Turner details the \nsleuthing done by Anglican hymnologist Marion Hatchett, whose 1991 \nessay revealed that two earlier forms of the tune were published in \nCharles Spilman and Benjamin Shaw's Columbian Harmony (1829). It \nremained, however, for William Walker's Southern Harmony (1835) to \nmarry Newton's text to the tune Americans grew to love. Turner \npraises Walker's choice as \"real genius\" and \"a marriage made in \nheaven.\" Turner cannot restrain his enthusiasm: \"It was as though the \ntune had been written with these words in mind. \"The music behind \n'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded \ngraceful. There was a rise to the point of confession, as though the \nauthor was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, \nbut a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe credit goes to Southern Harmony for much of the early popularity \nof this hymn. The book sold 800,000 copies in a time when the U.S. \npopulation was just over 23 million. And Southern Harmony's marriage \nof tune and text influenced in turn the compilers of The Sacred Harp \n(1844), which became the most influential tune book in the rural \nSouth's shape-note singing movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hymn moved from South to North and from agricultural to \nindustrialized settings when Ira D. Sankey, evangelist Dwight L. \nMoody's popular songleader, included it in his songbooks. Sankey used \nthree different tunes, none of them New Britain.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe definitive moment came about 1900 when Chicago hymnwriter and \npublisher Edwin Othello Excell refined the tune and muted the \ntheology. Excell moved the music a long way from its shape-note roots \nand made it acceptable to America's emerging middle class. He also \ndropped Newton's final lines and substituted a quatrain from the hymn \n\"Jerusalem, My Happy Home\"the now familiar \"10,000 years\" verse. \nHarriet Beecher Stowe had added that verse to Newton's text in Uncle \nTom's Cabin (1852), but until Excell substituted it, it had not \nappeared in a hymnbook as part of \"Amazing Grace.\" American religious \nculture had shifted from the Calvinism of Jonathan Edwards and the \nFirst Great Awakening to the Arminianism of Dwight Moody and Charles \nFinney. The emphasis was no longer on God choosing people, but on \npeople choosing God. And the substitution of that final verse made \nthe hymn less likely to offend the new sensibilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcell's updating of Newton was a key step in the gradual \ntransmogrification of the hymn into a self-help anthem. Seventy years \nlater, when folksingers like Judy Collins, Joan Baez, and Arlo \nGuthrie were popularizing the hymn in secular circles, the human \npotential movement was in full flower. With the words God and Lord \nmissing from the most common versions of the text, there was nothing \nto keep the new generation from treating grace as a term for the way \nlife seems to heal and reward those who pick themselves up and try \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurner devotes a chapter titled \"Into the Charts\" to the history of \nthe song's popularity in the latter third of the 20th century. He \nalso appends a fine discography for those who want to track down the \nmost important recordings. The most significant part of \"Into the \nCharts\" is his comparison of Judy Collins's simple a cappella folk \nrecording with Aretha Franklin's gospel rendition.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne night in New York, Collins was in an encounter group where the \nrage was getting out of hand. To calm the group's members, she began \nto sing the song she had knew from her Methodist childhood. \"Amazing \nGrace\" had its desired effect, and her producer, who was part of the \ngroup, urged her to include it on her next album. Thus was Judy \nCollins's interpretation of the song born out of the human potential \nmovement.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn another night in Watts, soul singer Aretha Franklin returned to \nher gospel roots to record an album live at the New Temple Missionary \nBaptist Church. Whereas Judy Collins took four minutes and four \nseconds to sing four stanzas and repeat the first verse, Aretha took \n14 minutes to wring every ounce of meaning and experience out of just \ntwo verses. Turner comments: \"Aretha's version went back . . . to the \nlong meter style of the Holiness churches where the tune is pulled \napart wide enough to let the spirit in. . . . In gospel music the \npoint is not clarity, precision, and faithfulness to the text but \nwitness to personal experience and faithfulness to the movement of \nthe spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the book Turner takes opportunities to give mini theology \nlessons: on the difference between Calvinists and Arminians, on the \ndifferences between Catholic and Protestant notions of grace, on \nexperimental religion, and on the progressive nature of the \nChristian's growth in holiness. None of this is gratuitous, but is \nthe essential framework for understanding the hymn.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan Baez told Turner that she didn't understand why anyone would \nthink of \"Amazing Grace\" as a religious song. If anyone takes the \ntime to read Turner's book, they will be well on the way to \nrecapturing the God-centered vision of John Newton and the spirit-led \nexperience of Aretha Franklin and the shape-note singers.\u0014",

    "title": "CAL THOMAS ON CHURCH AND STATE",
    "words": "Thomas Jefferson - whose greatest work, the Declaration of \nIndependence, was celebrated for the 227th time last Friday - \nobserved in 1774: \"The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the \nsame time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was one of those rare church-state moments that rings as true as \nthe Liberty Bell before it cracked. And yet we witness people in the \nworld and, I fear, increasingly in our country, who believe and act \nas if God not only gave us life but also required us to be in bondage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is something that has always bothered me about \"religion,\" and \nit applies to a lot of faiths, not just the one with which America \nmust contend and, in the case of the most radical among them, fight. \nIt is the notion that God needs puny, fallen and imperfect human \nbeings, who are around for an average of just 70 years, to carry out \nHis will. Does this make sense? A God who is said to have created the \nuniverse out of nothing and who controls the keys to life and death \n(not to mention hell and heaven) must rely on human beings to execute \njudgment - such as homicide bombers in Pakistan and Moscow - and \ndeliver blessings? What kind of weak, dysfunctional God is that? Why \ncan't He stand up and fight like, well, God?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis attitude is not unique to certain people who claim to speak for \nIslam. Like many other faiths, Islam comprises people with different \nbeliefs, interpretations and lifestyles. Certain fundamentalist \nChristians behave similarly (without the homicide bombers), telling \npeople what they can and must not drink, should and should not wear \nand, again, depending on interpretations, whether they must or must \nnot change their government to more accurately mirror what they see \nas the Kingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is sometimes confusing to the uninitiated. One cleric says you \nshould pray so many times a day, abstain from pork and have nothing \nto do with people who don't believe as he does. Another says pork is \nOK, but you can't drink anything with alcohol in it. Cough medicine \nwith a 12 percent alcoholic content apparently makes the approved \nlist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question remains: Why should I listen to a man (and it's always a \nman, isn't it?) with something on his head, or around his neck, or in \na robe or a suit? He is just like me. He gets angry. He sins. He is \nfallen. He will die. Why does he get to speak for God and I have no \nsay in the matter? Am I not allowed to read \"holy writ,\" think for \nmyself and behave accordingly? Are ordained people necessarily better \nspiritually than those who are not ordained? Recent Catholic and \nProtestant church scandals would seem to suggest otherwise.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jefferson spoke of God giving us liberty, he said a wise thing. \nHe echoed the Old Testament prophet Joshua, who said, \"Choose this \nday whom you will serve ...\" and he added \"as for me and my house, we \nwill serve the Lord\" (Joshua 24:15). God gave him a choice, and he \nexercised it, but he didn't impose that choice on others. There are \nbenefits for choosing wisely and consequences for choosing wrongly. \nBut liberty, not conformity, should be supreme.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, this is a biblical notion. So is \"Vengeance is mine, says \nthe Lord.\" When a mere human takes on the role of God, dispensing \nvengeance and judgment, and thus assuming the role God reserves for \nHimself, he becomes guilty of that worst of all sins: pride. He is \nsaying that only he knows what God wants. No human can fully know \nthat because we all \"see through a glass darkly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's going to be difficult to win consideration for Jefferson's noble \nobservation in Pakistan and Russia and in many other places, but we \nshould try. As Dinesh D'Souza wrote in The Washington Post (July 4), \nvirtue has great power, but not if it is imposed - only when it is \nchosen.\u0014\n2003 Tribune Media Services\u0014",

In that time, his 200 warriors fought four \nmajor battles and numerous skirmishes against 2,000 US soldiers. \nJoseph was praised by the famed Civil War general, William Tecumseh \nSherman, for his bravery and military prowess. In the ensuing \ndecades, Chief Joseph would become an eloquent spokesman against the \nUnited States' policies toward the American Indian. He would also \nattract the attention of a young photographer about to embark on a \nvastly ambitious project. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1903, Chief Joseph, elderly and exiled from his Nez Perc \nhomeland, agreed to sit for a society photographer in Seattle named \nEdward S. Curtis. Curtis had been visiting and photographing Indians \nin the Seattle area and parts of the West for several years. On one \nexpedition to Montana in 1900, he had witnessed the Sun Dance of the \nBlood, Blackfoot, and Algonquin tribes. The experience had a profound \nimpact on him, and in the years that followed, Curtis began to \nconceive of a more systematic study of the American Indian. The 1903 \nphotographs of Chief Joseph, in which he sits upright, staring at the \ncamera with wisdom and sadness, would prove to be the launching point \nfor Curtis's project. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1896 to 1930, Curtis crisscrossed the West, producing more than \n40,000 negatives in a photographic testimony of the people and \ncustoms of every major Native American tribe west of the Mississippi. \nHis monumental study of the American Indian was published in 20 \nleather-bound, gilt-edged volumes between 1907 and 1930 as The North \nAmerican Indian. The masterwork was priced at $3,000 for the complete \nset; Curtis managed to sell only 222 copies in his lifetime.\u0014",

Through his healing, exorcisms, concern for \nthe poor and oppressed, and raising people from the dead, Jesus \nindicates the arrival of the kingdom age.\u0014\n         \u0014\n                     Through Christ, God's kingdom\u2014the life of the \nage to come\u2014is breaking into the midst of this present evil age.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The dying thief on the cross grasped that which \nJesus' disciples had difficulty understanding. At Caesarea Philippi \nJesus began to teach that he must go up to Jerusalem, suffer, be \nrejected by the elders and teachers of the law, be killed, and after \nthree days rise from the dead (Mark 8:31).\u0014\n                      This message of a suffering, crucified Messiah \nmade little sense to Jesus' contemporaries. Neither Jesus' closest \ndisciples nor his enemies could comprehend how the anointed of God \ncould also be  the cursed of God. A crucified Messiah seemed to be a \ncontradiction in terms.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The crucified thief, though, possessed an \ninsight that almost everyone else at Jesus' execution lacked. The \nbelieving thief asks Jesus to remember him when he comes into his \nkingdom (Luke 23:42). As Maximus of Turin rightly preached, \"The \npenitent thief considered the cross of Christ not to be a stumbling \nblock.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus promised the thief that \"today you will \nbe with me in paradise.\" Paradise, then, seems to be a specific place \nor state of being. This is distinct from the kingdom of God\u2014a \nbroader reality referring to an age of God's reign as well as the \nplace of its full manifestation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Interestingly, immediate entrance into paradise \nis linked to faith in the coming of Christ's kingdom. As Leon Morris \nputs it, \"Jesus' words of reassurance gave [the thief] more than he \nhad asked for.\u0014\n                      Not only would he have a place in the kingdom, \nwhenever that would be established, but that very day he would enter \nParadise.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both modern scholars and the church fathers \nlink paradise with the Garden of Eden. I. Howard Marshall, for \ninstance, notes that the connection between Eden and paradise led \"to \nthe view\u0014\nthat [paradise] existed in between the creation and the final age in \nhidden form. It came to be\u0014\nregarded as the intermediate resting place for the souls of the \nrighteous dead. \u2026 In the present\u0014\npassage it represents the state of bliss which Jesus promises to the \ncriminal directly after death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not only does Christ's priestly work on the \ncross enable him as king to open the doors of paradise to the thief, \nbut it also reverses the horror of what took place in the Garden of \nEden. St. John\u0014\nChrysostom observes that when Christ \"wished to bring the thief into \nparadise, he immediately\u0014\nspoke the word and brought him in. Christ did not need to pray to do \nthis \u2026 . God put there the\u0014\nflaming sword to guard paradise (Gen. 3:24). By his authority Christ \nopened paradise and brought\u0014\nin the thief.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Entrance into paradise is available not only to \nthe thief but to all who put their trust in Christ.\u0014\nOrigen comments that Christ \"gave to all those who believe and \nconfess access to the entrance\u0014\nthat Adam had previously closed by sinning. Who else could remove \n'the flaming turning sword\u0014\nwhich was placed to guard the tree of life' and the gates of \nparadise?\" To enter paradise is to\u0014\nreturn, in Prudentius' poignant phrase, to \"our native country.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christ will return one day with all the \ninhabitants of paradise to consummate his reign on earth. In the \nmeantime, those who die confessing (with the believing thief) faith \nin Christ's kingdom can\u0014\nrest assured they will be with Christ in paradise during the strange, \nunexpected in-between time\u0014\nbetween Jesus' first and second coming.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christopher A. Hall is professor of biblical \nand theological studies at Eastern University in St. Davids, \nPennsylvania, and a CT editor at large.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright \u00a9 2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "CANTOR FITZGERLD LOST 658 OF 960 EMPLOYEES IN NEW YORK\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a name inextricably linked with Sept. 11 (2001), with huge, \ncatastrophic loss  Cantor Fitzgerald. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf the companies and organizations that lost people that day, none \nwas harder hit than the financial services firm that occupied the \n101st to 105th floors of the north tower at the World Trade Center. \u0014\n\u0014\nOut of 960 employees in New York, 658 were killed  no employee in \nCantor's offices at the time survived. Whole divisions were \ndevastated. \u0014\n\u0014\nLed by CEO Howard Lutnick, those who were still alive made a decision \n the company would survive. They wouldn't let what they had worked \nso hard to create crumble. And they would honor those they had lost. \u0014\n\u0014\nTen years later, Cantor has regained its size and then some. The \ncompany and a spinoff, BGC Partners, employ 1,500 people in New York \nCity and have other offices in countries around the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nCantor has kept its word to the families of those employees lost on \n9/11  distributing millions of dollars of the firm's profits to \nthem, and covering health care costs for the past 10 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The best way to show someone you love them is to care for the people \nthey love,\" Lutnick said. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the day of the attacks, Lutnick was delayed getting to the office \nbecause he had taken his son to his first day of kindergarten. That \ndelay spared him. \u0014\n\u0014\nOthers escaped the attacks because they happened to schedule an \nout-of-office trip for that day, or were in the building but hadn't \nyet made it up to the offices. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the first plane hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m., it destroyed \nthe stairwells, making it impossible for anyone above the point of \nimpact around the 94th to 98th floors to descend. The north tower \ncollapsed at 10:28 a.m. \u0014\n\u0014\nLutnick made it to the scene after the first plane hit and was there \nwhen the tower fell. He can still feel and see the horror of that \nday. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was black outside, there was no air outside, so I knew that \npeople inside the trade center couldn't possibly be alive,\" Lutnick \nsaid recently from the company's offices in midtown Manhattan. Among \nthem were his brother, Gary, and his best friend, Doug Gardner, \nCantor's CFO. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the smoke cleared, the towers lay in rubble. So did parts of \nCantor. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What we had was secretaries that had lost their bosses, divisions of \n86 who had only four remaining,\" Lutnick said. \"There were many \ndivisions we couldn't rebuild.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut they returned to work, even as families and friends grieved for \nthose who were suddenly gone, to get their systems running again. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We were faced with that horror in every moment of our day, but we \nhad this tremendous task in front of us,\" said Joseph Noviello, \nCantor's executive vice president and chief product architect, who at \nthe time was the chief technology officer and had been scheduled to \ngo on a day trip on Sept 11. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"You were looking for friends, you were hoping and praying that \npeople were just going to find their way and get in contact with you, \nand while that was going on we were working around the clock to bring \nback the systems,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were back online in days. As Cantor's surviving employees \nreturned to work, it was with a new purpose. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"My goal after 9/11 was to take care of the families of the people we \nlost, and that was the most important thing,\" Lutnick said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat translated into a big financial commitment  25 percent of \nCantor's profits for five years were set aside to be distributed to \nthe families, which in the end amounted to $180 million. Their \nhealth-care costs were to be covered for 10 years. And the company \nmarked every Sept. 11 as a day for charity, a day when every dollar \nmade would be given to good causes. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We all had to commit to doing something different,\" Lutnick said. \n\"It changed our outlook about what was important about business.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe attacks \"just created sort of that bang of what type of human \nbeing are you right here, right now,\" Lutnick said. \"I didn't think \nthere was a choice. Either we take care of our friends' families or \nI'm not a human being.\"\u0014",

    "words": "CRAWFORD TOY AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR\u0014\nFrom CivilWarBaptists.Com  A daily journal of Baptists during the \nCivil War\u0014\n\u0014\nOne hundred and fifty years ago this month, a Baptist \nscholar-in-the-making, whose recent appointment as a Southern Baptist \nmissionary to Japan was rescinded by war-related financial \ndifficulties, trains in Virginias Norfolk Light Artillery Blues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new enrollee has an impressive pedigree: he is a graduate of the \nNorfolk Academy (a military school) and the University of Virginia, a \nstudent of John A. Broadus (who baptized him), a former professor and \nadministrator at the Albermarle Female Institute, one of the first \nstudents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and a former \nprofessor of Greek at Richmond College. His interest in scholarly \npursuits, and languages in particular, is the product of his \nupbringing by his father, a Baptist deacon and druggist who taught \nhimself several languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nCrawford H. Toy is an ardent supporter of the Confederacy. An \ninfantryman, Toy in time also becomes a chaplain in General Lees \narmy. He serves in Longstreets Corps at Gettysburg. When the \nConfederates are forced to retreat, Toy remains on the front lines \nwith the surgeons, a choice that leads to his wounding and capture by \nUnion forces on July 4, 1863. Imprisoned at Fort McHenry, Toy is \nreleased in December in a prisoner exchange.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrior to his capture at Gettysburg, a friend observes that Toy is \nlooking very well and seems to be enjoying himself. His Syriac books \nare in Norfolk and he has, therefore, been compelled to fall back on \nGerman for amusement. While imprisoned at Fort McHenry, The tedium \nof this confinement was relieved by the glee club, the daily mock \ndress parade with tin pans for drums, and the class in Italian, \norganized and taught by him.\u0014\n\u0014\nToys love of books and languages is insatiable throughout the war. \nOne chronicler writes, In an interval of the suspension of \nhostilities at the Battle of Cold Harbor, a private soldier lies on \nthe ground poring over an Arabic grammar  it is Crawford H. Toy, who \nis destined to become the famous professor of Oriental languages at \nHarvard University. During a lull in the action at Seven Pines, Toy \ntramped all the way from Seven Pines battlefield to Richmond to \nconsult a Hebrew grammar.\u0014\n\u0014\nToy survives the war and the world remembers him as an outstanding \nHarvard professor. Yet Toys journey from the battlefield to Harvard \nis firstly a Baptist story. After a post-war stint of study in \nBerlin, the trustees of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in \n1869 hire the 33-year old Toy as a professor of Old Testament \ninterpretation and oriental languages. A popular professor and top \nbiblical scholar, Toy remains at SBTS until 1879, at which time his \nincreasingly liberal views concerning the historical accuracy of \nthe Old Testament lead to his firing, paving the way for his Harvard \ncareer.\u0014\n\u0014\nToy thus becomes representative of the next major salvo in the \nSouthern Baptist war over biblical literalism. An approach to \nbiblical interpretation that sanctioned African slavery then led the \nSouth to disunion from the North and the resulting Civil War to \ndefend the righteousness of slavery, biblical literalism in the \npost-war years trained its guns upon modern science as represented by \nCharles Darwin and the theory of evolution. This war continues to the \npresent day in Southern Baptist life, as 21st century Southern \nBaptist theologians and historians yet dismiss Toy as a heretic.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources: Dan Gentry Kent, The Saints Suitor: Crawford H.

For this argument, famously advanced by St. \nAnselm and Ren Descartes, divine existence is entailed by the very \nconcept of Godhood. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Cosmological Argument. This argument, famously advanced by St. \nThomas Aquinas, holds that the very existence of the world proves the \nexistence of God, without whom there could be no first cause for all \nof being. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Teleological Argument. This argument, articulated variously by \nthe psalmist, St. Paul, and William Paley, claims that the \nmagnificent design of the world necessarily implies the existence of \na designer. Paley argued that if we walk along a beach and find a \nclock, we assume that a clockmaker created it. \u0014\n\u0014\nDivine Encounter. This argument points to individuals who are said to \nhave had direct communication with God. If their reports are true, \nthen the other arguments are a sinful waste of time because we would \nhave direct evidence of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe review and testing of these four arguments yields a \"Scottish \nverdict\": not proved. \u0014\n\u0014\nArguments against God's Existence: The Problem of Evil \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter testing the arguments for God's existence, Professor Hall \nreverses the burden of proof and asks: \"Can humans know that God does \nnot exist?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYou study the argument that God cannot exist because nature or wicked \nhumans cause innocents to suffer. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd you learn the replies (theodicies) that the major religious \ntraditions have marshaled: \u0014\n\u0014\n There is no problem of evil because the world is perfect. \u0014\n\u0014\n Evil is simply the absence of good. \u0014\n\u0014\n Apparent evil exists to serve a larger good: God's purposes are \ninscrutable to us, and evil is only an apparition caused by our \nignorance. \u0014\n\u0014\n Evil done by humans is a necessary consequence of free will, and \nautonomy given us by God. Without the opportunity for evil, there \ncould also be no opportunity for virtue. An associated argument is \nthat demonic forces cause evil (and this, too, may be a consequence \nof their freedom). In either case, God is not the cause of evil. \u0014\n\u0014\n Those who suffer do so because they are being punished or elevated \nby suffering.\u0014",

    "words": "Christians' Views Differ about God-Inspired Scripture\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Drew Smith\u0014\nPosted: Wednesday, December 21, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nA person identifying himself as a professor of biblical studies sent \nme an email in which he said he was going to use my recent article in \nhis class on biblical interpretation as a demonstration of \"the \nfallacy of the liberal hermeneutic and mindset.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI took that as a complement, and not as a criticism, which I assume \nhe intended.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough I do not know this person, I assume that he and I have many \ndifferent views about the nature of Scripture and how we ought to \nread Scripture and to what extent Scripture should be authoritative \nin formulating Christian theology and practice\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the heart of the matter, I would assume, is perhaps our differing \nviews on what Christians mean by the inspiration of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn talking about the inspiration of Scripture, the go-to text is 2 \nTimothy 3:16, where the author writes, \"All scripture is inspired by \nGod.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe word translated as \"inspired\" literally means \"God-breathed,\" and \nalthough the author of these words would have been speaking \nspecifically about the Hebrew Scriptures, Christians have long \nrecognized that inspired Scripture also includes the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, saying that the texts that make up the canon of Scripture \nare inspired raises the question concerning what this means.\u0014\n\u0014\nAddressing such a question has led to various theories that have been \nproposed to describe the action of divine inspiration.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom those theories that view the Scriptures as produced by gifted \nhuman authors, to the idea that God gave a message to the author, who \nthen used his own words in writing the text, to the theory that God \ndictated every particular word of the text, each hypothesis has been \ndebated by theologians across the spectrum of Christian thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the verse from 2 Timothy clearly states that \"All scripture is \nGod-breathed,\" this does not mean that we must accept the idea that \nevery word was dictated by God to each human author, who then \nrecorded those words.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany may hold to the idea that God inspired every word of the text, \nbut this is a matter of one's personal faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is certainly not compulsory to believe this, and one's critical \napproach to Scripture or to any theory of divine inspiration does not \nin and of itself negate one's faith in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo suggest that the text is as much a human creation as a divine one \ndoes not make one less faithful in one's belief in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, since we must work in the realm of historical probability, \nthe texts of the Bible actually give more evidence of human \ninvolvement in their production than they do of divine inspiration.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean that we need to throw out divine inspiration \naltogether; it does mean we ought to rethink what we mean.\u0014\n\u0014\nA fundamental question concerns why the writers of the books of the \nBible wrote these texts, and why they wrote what they wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we have are these texts, and from these texts we can, at least \nat some level, try and answer the question of the purpose for the \nexistence of these texts, which may help us understand how these \ntexts came forth from the religious experiences of the authors and \ncommunities that formulated them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo answer these questions, it might be helpful to consider why the \ntwo communities that produced the two portions of what is now the \nChristian Bible would have done so.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, we must speak here in generalities when we talk about \nancient Israel, from whom we received the Hebrew Bible, and early \nChristianity, from whence comes the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nAcross the history of both of these communities, but particularly the \nlonger history of ancient Israel, there was much diversity that is \nwoven into the text of Scripture  diversity that offers us somewhat \ndifferent views about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people of Israel viewed themselves as different from the other \nnations that surrounded them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, they were distinctly different from these nations, \nparticularly when it came to religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no known ancient civilization that was not religious, but \nIsrael may have been the first ancient people who were monotheistic \n(some have argued that Zoroastrianism, another monotheistic religion, \nmay have predated Israel's adoption of monotheism).\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael believed their god was supreme over other gods, and that their \ngod had created the physical world from nothing and had chosen them \nas a covenant people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis belief certainly influenced their understanding of the world and \nother peoples, and it most assuredly influenced the texts they \nproduced.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo put it succinctly, the text of the Hebrew Bible came forth from \nthe people of Israel in response to what they believed about God and \nwhat God was doing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, they were theologically interpreting their own \nhistory, and they were telling their history from a theological point \nof view.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir understanding of God and the world influenced the way they told \ntheir stories, from the creation story, to the flood story, to the \nExodus story, to the stories of conquering the land of Canaan through \nviolence, and the stories of their exile and their return.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn approaching an understanding of the writing of the New Testament \nbooks, we must remember two things.\u0014\n\u0014\n*The earliest followers of Jesus were Jewish, as was, of course, \nJesus, and hence any faith that would develop from their experiences \nmust have some connection to ancient Israel and its texts. \u0014\n\u0014\n*Because these earliest followers of Jesus believed him to be God's \nSon, the promised Messiah of Israel, they must be able to explain \nthis in relation to what is expressed about the Messiah in the Hebrew \nBible.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn holding onto these two important ideas, the authors of the books \nthat would become the New Testament searched the Hebrew Bible in an \nattempt to understand and explain Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some like to think that the Hebrew Bible foretold the coming of \nJesus, it is probably more accurate to say that those earliest \nbelievers in Jesus saw in him what they believed was described about \nthe Messiah in the Hebrew Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese early Christian authors were doing what one scholar refers to \nas \"messianic exegesis,\" which means that they were creatively \nreading the Hebrew Bible in ways that were probably not intended by \nthe original authors of those texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese early Christians formulated their stories about Jesus to define \nhis life, teachings, death and resurrection as the fulfillment of \nGod's ancient promises to Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, their experience of Jesus influenced their reading of the Old \nTestament and their writing of the texts that would become the New \nTestament\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nWhat all of this means is that the text of Scripture, what we call \nthe Bible, is the inspired Word of God in the sense that it contains \nthe stories of how God's ancient peoples believed God to be working \nin the world, Smith says.\u0014\n\u0014\nA person identifying himself as a professor of biblical studies sent \nme an email in which he said he was going to use my recent article in \nhis class on biblical interpretation as a demonstration of \"the \nfallacy of the liberal hermeneutic and mindset.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI

view.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir understanding of God and the world influenced the way they told \ntheir stories, from the creation story, to the flood story, to the \nExodus story, to the stories of conquering the land of Canaan through \nviolence, and the stories of their exile and their return.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn approaching an understanding of the writing of the New Testament \nbooks, we must remember two things.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest followers of Jesus were Jewish, as was, of course, \nJesus, and hence any faith that would develop from their experiences \nmust have some connection to ancient Israel and its texts. \u0014\nBecause these earliest followers of Jesus believed him to be God's \nSon, the promised Messiah of Israel, they must be able to explain \nthis in relation to what is expressed about the Messiah in the Hebrew \nBible.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn holding onto these two important ideas, the authors of the books \nthat would become the New Testament searched the Hebrew Bible in an \nattempt to understand and explain Jesus.\u0014\nWhile some like to think that the Hebrew Bible foretold the coming of \nJesus, it is probably more accurate to say that those earliest \nbelievers in Jesus saw in him what they believed was described about \nthe Messiah in the Hebrew Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese early Christian authors were doing what one scholar refers to \nas \"messianic exegesis,\" which means that they were creatively \nreading the Hebrew Bible in ways that were probably not intended by \nthe original authors of those texts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese early Christians formulated their stories about Jesus to define \nhis life, teachings, death and resurrection as the fulfillment of \nGod's ancient promises to Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, their experience of Jesus influenced their reading of the Old \nTestament and their writing of the texts that would become the New \nTestament.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat all of this means is that the text of Scripture, what we call \nthe Bible, is the inspired Word of God in the sense that it contains \nthe stories of how God's ancient peoples believed God to be working \nin the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is the explanation of the mysteries of God envisioned by \nthese historically situated humans. Their religious experiences, \nwhether these can or cannot be verified, led them to write these \ntexts in response to what they believed about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis means that the Bible that comes down through history to us was \nat every point along its development a human enterprise that is \nlimited in what it can define about God.\u0014\n\u0014\nA book cannot contain all there is to know and say about God, and the \nvarious texts that make up the Bible reveal God and God's will \ndifferently.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is, none of them sees God in exactly the same way, and none of \nthem can express the full nature of God's being.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean we should throw out these ancient texts, for they \nstill serve to reveal many things about God, particularly for \nChristians who see Jesus as the revelation of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, it does mean that as modern readers of these ancient texts, who \nhave different kinds of experiences and who see the world vastly \ndifferent from these ancient authors and communities, we must \napproach these texts critically in order to assess how they are \nGod-breathed today.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrew Smith, an ordained Baptist minister, is director of \ninternational programs at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, \nArk. He blogs at Wilderness Preacher.\u0014",

Workmen obeyed; and \nYahia ibn Sa`id, an Islamic historian, wrote: \"...the holy deed \ncommenced on Tuesday, the fifth day before the end of the month of \nSafar of the year 400 of the Egira.\" Converting from the Muslim \ncalendar would place the destruction on or about this day, October \n17, 1009.* \u0014\n\u0014\nThe demolition of this site, so holy to Christians, began with the \nempty tomb where Jesus had allegedly been buried, and continued with \nthe dome. Destruction was not total, however, because as the high \nparts fell, rubble blocked the workmen from getting at lower parts. \nFor close to forty years, Christians were forbidden to visit the \nsite. \u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine, the first emperor to identify with Christianity, built \nthe original Church of the Holy Sepulcher, acting on the researches \nof his mother Helena. When she identified the cave in which Christ \nwas thought to have lain, her son ordered the bishop of Jerusalem to \nbegin building. \"It will be well, therefore, for your sagacity to \nmake such arrangements and provision of all things needful for the \nwork, that not only the church itself as a whole may surpass all \nothers whatsoever in beauty, but that the details of the building may \nbe of such a kind that the fairest structures in any city of the \nempire may be excelled by this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his biography of Constantine, Eusebius wrote, \"This monument, \ntherefore, first of all, as the chief part of the whole, the \nemperor's zealous magnificence beautified with rare columns, and \nprofusely enriched with the most splendid decorations of every kind.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Persians destroyed the magnificent edifice in 614, but it was \npartly restored--to be smashed again by the Caliph al-Hakim four \nhundred years later.\u0014\n\u0014\nA treaty between Byzantium and the Muslims allowed Christians to \nrebuild the Church of the Holy Sepulcher about forty years after \nal-Hakim's \"holy deed.\" The new structure was much more modest than \nthe original. Crusaders later rebuilt the whole under one roof and \nadded some other buildings, but their work fell into disrepair over \nthe centuries and had to be renovated in the 1960s.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, the Palestine Authority has attempted to gain \ncontrol of several Christian sites, including the Church of the Holy \nSepulcher, as a means of bringing political pressure to bear on the \ngovernments of Christian nations.\u0014\n\u0014\n-------\u0014\n*Islamic months vary in length according to sightings of the moon. I \nhave not been unable to ascertain whether Safar had an extra day that \nyear.

Those attacks prompted a series \nof retaliatory raids by the Lou Nuer in Pibor county beginning \nDecember 23.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Murle official has said that 3,000 Murle died in those attacks. \nNeither the central government or the UN has confirmed that figure, \nbut scores are feared to have died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government of South Sudan recently declared Jonglei state a \ndisaster area. The UN mission in South Sudan estimates at least \n60,000 people have been affected by the ongoing violence. The UN \noperation says it has launched one of the most \"complex and \nexpensive\" humanitarian operations since the end of the Sudanese \ncivil war in 2005.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouth Sudan became the world's newest country last year after decades \nof war with Sudan, but it is now experiencing massive internal \nviolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut with retaliation attacks occurring more and more frequently, \nthere is little hope for an end to these clashes. Cattle raiding is \nat the heart of the tribal clashes. The Lou Nuer are said to have \nstolen tens of thousands of cattle from the Murle in the December \nattack.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Arms are still in the hands of the civilian population,\" said \nJonglei Gov. Kual Manyang Juuk. \"And these attacks will continue, \ndefinitely.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJuuk said the government is sending police to patrol the area, but \nJonglei's extreme underdevelopment makes securing the area difficult. \n\"This is a challenge for the government. They don't live in formal \ntowns,\" he said.\u0014",

But years would pass \nbefore the lines took their place in worship services around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1861, a publisher rediscovered the words. He asked John Bacchus \nDykes to furnish him with a tune. It made sense for him to turn to \nJohn who had a natural aptitude for music (he graduated with a music \nmaster that same year). John had been a church organist since he was \nten-years-old and was co-founder and president of the Cambridge \nUniversity Musical Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn accepted the words. Within thirty minutes he wrote the tune \n\"Nicea,\" which carried the praise of the Trinity to Christians \neverywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty\u0014\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; \u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty! \u0014\nGod in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he composed this famous tune, John was appointed vicar \nof St. Oswald.

John's people came \nto love him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis bishop, however, did not care for John's views. John was \n\"high-church.\" This meant that he stressed the continuity of the \nChurch of England with the Roman Catholic church from which it had \nsprung. He believed that church and monarchy had divine rights which \nwere being washed away by modern changes. There was long-lasting \ndisagreement between John and his bishop because of this.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Baring, his bishop, refused to give John any help with his \nlarge parish unless he would agree to conduct his services in a more \n\"low-church\" style. He had to get rid of colorful collars, stop \nburning incense and not turn his back on his congregation at times \nduring the service. John wouldn't agree and so he had to handle the \nwhole parish himself, a job which exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, in addition to his regular duties, he managed to write \nover 300 hymn tunes. These included some for our favorite hymns, such \nas \"Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee\" and less familiar songs such as \n\"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand\" and \"Lead, Kindly Light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWorn out with his labors and constant friction with his bishop, John \ndied on this day, January 22, 1876.

    "title": "COUNCIL OF TRENT ON JUSTIFICATION",
    "words": "January 13, 1547 \u0014\nThe Roman Catholic Council of Trent on Justification\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you ever assembled an engine kit? If you have, you can \nunderstand what the Council of Trent accomplished on this day, \nJanuary 13, 1547 when it approved a decree on justification (the way \nGod puts us right with him when we have sinned). It took them months \nof hard work and was more difficult to assemble than a complicated \nmodel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Trent, held in an Italian city of that name, came \nabout largely because of Martin Luther. Luther protested that the \nRoman church was corrupt. Christians were taught things that had no \nsupport in scripture, such as that they could buy indulgences to get \nsouls of loved ones out of purgatory. Against this, Luther argued \nthat justification is by faith alone. As a result, whole nations left \nthe Catholic church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe popes saw that Luther needed to be answered, but they had trouble \nassembling enough bishops to hold a council. Twenty years passed. \nWhen a council finally met at Trent, it was because Emperor Charles \nV, who ruled much of Europe, insisted on it. He thought that the best \nchance of winning the Protestants back to Catholicism was for the \nchurch to clean up its act. The pope did not agree. Seeing Protestant \nideas as heresy he wanted only to define Catholic doctrine and \ncondemn the heretics. The council finally did a bit of both, \nswitching back and forth between theology and reform.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustification was the toughest theological question that the \nassembled bishops tackled. A few wanted to condemn Luther's views \nwithout any explanation, but the rest felt that if you condemn \nsomeone else's theology, you should explain why. They knew that this \nwas going to be hard to do, because Catholics themselves did not \nfully agree on justification. Thomists emphasized God's action, \nScotists human feeling, and Augustinians faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were personality clashes making it hard to obtain agreement, \ntoo. Sanfelice overheard Grechetto mutter that he was either a knave \nor a fool. Sanfelice asked him what he had said. Grechetto repeated \nhis remark aloud. Sanfelice seized him by the beard and shook him so \nhard that hair came out in his hand. He was locked up and \nexcommunicated, but Grechetto pleaded for his liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nOfficials put six questions to the council. (1)What is meant by \njustification? (2)What brings it about--what is God's part and what \nis man's? (3)What does it mean to say a man is saved by faith? (4)Do \nworks play a role before and after justification, and what is the \nrole of the sacraments? (5)Describe the process of justification, \nwhat precedes, accompanies and follows it. (6)What proofs support \nCatholic doctrine? Another question also arose: is it possible to \nknow with certainty that one is saved?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took sixteen congregations (meetings where each bishop stated his \nopinion and cast a vote) to reach a decree. (By contrast, the \ndoctrine of original sin took only three congregations.) The doctrine \nof Justification was issued as sixteen chapters followed by \nthirty-three binding statements or canons, aimed against Protestant \nideas. All the same, Luther's thought influenced the work. The \ncouncil had read his books. Luther had been an Augustinian and it was \nan Augustinian who drafted the council's final position.\u0014\nThe council decided that grace is necessary at each step of \njustification. However, man's free will must cooperate. Justification \nis more than forgiveness of sins: it is God's ongoing process of \nmaking a person new and good. Faith is not the only condition of \nsalvation although it is its beginning, foundation, and root. In \norder for the grace of justification to grow, we must obey God's \ncommands. The council also decided that justification can be lost by \ncertain sins and that no man can be sure that he will be finally \nsaved.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nFroude, James Anthony.

    "title": "CHARLES MAMRTEL VS. ISLAM AT TOURS",
    "words": "October 10, 732 \u0014\nMartel vs. Islam at Tours\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 610 Mohammed received his call. He began to preach and after many \nhardships developed a significant following. Within a hundred years \nIslam had grown into a mighty empire. It conquered much of the Middle \nEast, North Africa, Spain and Southern Italy. The Mediterranean \nbecame an Islamic lake. This had tremendous implications for \nChristianity, because those areas had formerly been Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Islam did not capture all of Europe and wipe out Christianity is \nowing in part to the Franks' Mayor of the Palace, Charles Martel, his \nsturdy Merovingian knights and a courageous infantry. On this day, \nOctober 10, 732* Charles met the Islamic invaders between Poiters and \nTours in a battle that lasted either two days (Arab sources) or seven \n(French sources). The Muslims were mounted and their cavalry employed \nan innovation--the stirrup. The Franks were on foot. Yet the Franks \nstood like a wall and the Muslims withdrew defeated. Their leader, \nAbd-ar-Rahman was killed. In their rout, the Arabs suffered heavy \nlosses of men. Europe would remain Christian territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that time, Europe was not wholly Christian. The great mission work \nwhich brought it into the Christian fold was still in process. The \nchurch appreciated Charles Martel because he supported Christian \nexpansion among the German races, protecting the notable missionaries \nBoniface and Willibrord. The church also appreciated his willingness \nto challenge the Islamic invaders. The church gladly loaned the \nCarolignian leader church lands to help defray the costs of the \nresistance against the Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his victory, however, Charles incurred ecclesiastical wrath. He \nrequired his knights to provide themselves with horses, saddles and \nspurs; in order that they might pay for these costly innovations, \nCharles presented them with church lands. Even more exasperating to \nthe church, he awarded its positions to ungodly, untrained laymen. \nChurch discipline declined as is the recurring pattern when it is \nmade into a branch of the civil service.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one time it seemed unlikely Charles would ever amount to anything. \nHe was an illegitimate son, not entitled to authority. When his \nfather died he was even imprisoned, but managed to escape and build \nhis power base in four short years. He solidified his holdings with \nunceasing effort, battling the Frisians, Saxons, Alamanni, Bavarians \nand Aquitanians until the most of modern France was brought under his \ncontrol. After beating the Muslims at Poiters, Charles also conquered \nBurgundy. Later the title \"Martel\" was added to his name. Martellus \nmeans \"hammer.\" Charles' prowess won him that name. Charles' \ndescendants had great influence on European history. Pepin the Short, \nhis son, aided the popes at crucial moments. His grandson was the \nfamous emperor Charlemagne.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Islam, for centuries it continued its assaults on Europe \nthrough the East.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------\u0014\n*This is the date usually given, although consensus is not universal.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nArnold-Baker, C. and Dent, Anthony.

    "words": "October 12, 1492 \u0014\nColumbus Landed in America\u0014\n\u0014\nTierra! Tierra! The men had been on the sea for over thirty days \nwithout sight of land. Now land was in plain view. All the despair \nand gloom immediately gave way to excitement and hope as the three \nlittle ships drew closer and closer to the shore on this day, October \n12, 1492.\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably every American school child old enough to study history has \nheard the little rhyme, \"In October, 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean \nblue\", and the story has often been told of Columbus' dream of \nfinding the East or Asia by sailing west. Columbus is often held up \nas an example of someone who set goals for himself and would not give \nup when obstacles to achieving those goals came his way -- he waited \nat the Spanish court six years before King Ferdinand and Queen \nIsabella agreed to sponsor his voyage. He persuaded his men to \ncontinue their westward voyage even when they threatened mutiny \nbecause they had not yet reached the expected islands of the Orient. \nCertainly Columbus is a model of determination and courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, the man was much more complex than the stories often reveal. \nChristopher was a very devout Catholic who observed all the fasts of \nthe church and prayed regularly. His very name Christopher, which \nmeans Christ-bearer, he understood as a title of his destiny to carry \nthe message of the gospel to far-off lands. He diligently searched \nthe Scriptures and thought he found assurance for a call to sail to \nthe far reaches of the globe with the Christian message. Zechariah \n9:10 said that \"he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his \ndominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to \nthe ends of the earth. And Psalm 107:23-24 promised that \"They that \ngo down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These \nsee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher was particularly concerned with the power of the Ottoman \nTurks who controlled the eastern Mediterranean and were threatening \nEurope. If a way could be found of reaching India by sailing West, \nthe Turks could be attacked from behind and perhaps the Holy Land \nitself could be rescued from their hands. Yes, Columbus was \ninterested in trade and riches, but Christian concern also lay behind \nhis plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen land was sighted on this day October 12, 1492, in recognition of \nthe divine aid in his voyage, Columbus named the land San Salvador, \nwhich means Holy Savior, and prayed,\u0014\n\u0014\nO Lord, Almighty and everlasting God, by Thy holy Word Thou hast \ncreated the heaven, and the earth, and the sea; blessed and glorified \nbe Thy Name, and praised be Thy Majesty, which hath designed to use \nus, Thy humble servants, that Thy holy Names may be proclaimed in \nthis second part of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn keeping with the Christian motive underlying his mission, Columbus \nat first showed great concern for how the natives, whom he called \nIndians, were treated. He wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that they might be well-disposed towards us, for I knew that they \nwere a people to be delivered and converted to our holy faith rather \nby love than by force, I gave to some red caps and to others glass \nbeads, which they hung around their neck, and many other things...I \nbelieve that they would easily be made Christians, for it seemed to \nme that they had no religion of their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the same, Columbus' concern for the salvation of these people was \ncoupled with an attitude of superiority which saw nothing wrong in \nforcibly capturing the people and making them slaves of the \nEuropeans. And the missionary drive which was prominent during his \nfirst voyage, in later voyages became subordinate to his love of \nwealth and position. Unfortunately, Columbus was not the last to lose \nsight of his spiritual goals when tempted with wealth and power.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBandelier, Ad.

England was still \nwithout a complete Bible in the English language. Who would finish \nthe work?\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing Tyndale's work as his starting point, Miles Coverdale stepped \nin and filled in the gaps with his own translations based on the \nVulgate (the Latin Bible of the Middle Ages) and Luther's German \nBible. He worked quickly to piece together a complete English Bible. \nIt is thought to have been published on this day, October 4, 1535, \nprobably in Zurich, Switzerland.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several years after that heroic effort, Coverdale was busy with \nother versions of the English language Bible. He made a fresh \ntranslation of the New Testament three years later (1538) based on \nthe Vulgate. In 1539, he helped put out the Great Bible, so called \nbecause of its size. This was the Bible King Henry VIII of England \nordered placed in every parish church.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoverdale began his religious life as an Augustinian friar, becoming \na reformer thanks to the influence of his prior, Robert Barnes. \nDuring Mary's reign he fled for safety to the European continent. \nAfter her death, he came home and was made bishop of Exeter.

His rough past and hardy constitution \nserved him well, for he faced floods, thieves, hunger and disease, \nmeeting every challenge head on.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Peter warned General Andrew Jackson (future President of the \nUnited States) that he would be damned to Hell just as quickly as any \nother man if he did not repent. Another preacher apologized for \nPeter's bluntness. Jackson retorted that Christ's ministers ought to \nlove everybody and fear no mortal man, adding that he wished he had a \nfew thousand officers like Peter.\u0014\n\u0014\nRowdies often interrupted Peter's meetings. When one thug promised to \nwhip him, Peter invited the man to step into the woods with him. The \ntwo started for the trees. Leaping over a fence at the edge of the \ncampground, Peter landed painfully and clutched his side. The bully \nshouted that the preacher was going for a dagger and took to his \nheels.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother time Peter charged a group of rowdies in the dark, yelling to \nimaginary forces, \"Here! here! Officers and men, take them!\" The \ntroublemakers bolted in panic. Such events gave him a name. A story \nspread that he had fought legendary river boatman Mike Fink.\u0014\n\u0014\nCrowds flocked to hear him. Throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and \nIllinois, Peter preached to hosts of men and women, three hours at a \nstretch, several times a week. Women wept and strong men trembled. \n10,000 came to Christ in meetings that sometimes ran day and night. \nPeter baptized thousands, adding them to the church. He urged new \nconverts to build meeting houses. To meet a desperate need for \npreachers, he championed the creation of Methodist colleges. Wherever \nhe went he left behind religious books and tracts to convert and \nstrengthen souls. The joy of soul-winning compensated him for all his \nhardships.\u0014\n\u0014\nHardships were many. Several times Peter went days without food. Once \nhe returned from his circuit with just 6 borrowed cents in his \npocket. His father had to re-outfit him with clothes, saddle and \nhorse before he could ride again. Traveling preachers were paid a \nmeasly $30- 50 a year. Nonetheless Peter married and raised children. \nHis family experienced tragedy. Forced to camp in the open one night, \nthey were startled awake when a tree snapped in two; Peter flung up \nhis arms to deflect the falling timber, but it crushed his youngest \ndaughter to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1823 Peter Cartwright sold his Kentucky farm. He feared his \ndaughters would marry slave owners. Slavery, he felt, sapped \nindependence of spirit. His family readily agreed to the change and \nhis bishop appointed him to a circuit in Illinois.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Illinois, Peter braved floods. Once he had to chase his saddle \nbags which were swept downstream. In every circumstance, the Lord \nbrought him to safety. In Illinois he ran for a seat in the Illinois \nlegislature against Abraham Lincoln, beating him. But later Lincoln \nbeat him in a race for the U.S. Congress. Peter died at eighty-seven, \nleaving behind an autobiography which has become a classic as much \nfor the exploits it recounts as for the pictures it paints of \nfrontier life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from \"Peter Cartwright: Perhaps America's Most Colorful \nCountry Preacher;\" Glimpses #85.

    "words": "September 22, 1931 \u0014\nC.S. Lewis' Sidecar Conversion\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIndividuals have surrendered their lives to Christ in all sorts of \nplaces. The revivalist Charles G. Finney converted in a woods; John \nNewton, author of the hymn \"Amazing Grace,\" repented while lashed to \na ship's wheel in a storm; Chuck Colson, founder of Prison \nMinistries, asked God into his life while crying in a car on a \nroadside. C. S. Lewis converted while riding to a zoo in his \nbrother's motorcycle side car.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When we set out I did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God and \nwhen we reached the zoo I did.\" Jack (as he preferred to be called) \nhad earlier become a theist--one who believes there is a God. He was \nconverted to full Christianity on this day, September 22, 1931 \nfollowing a long talk he'd had on the 19th with two Christian \nfriends: J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson.\u0014\n\u0014\nTolkien, who was soon to create the most imitated fantasy of our \ncentury, The Lord of the Rings, argued that even some myths can \noriginate in God, preserving truth, however distorted. One might do \nGod's work by writing myths. Lewis doubted myths embodied truth at \nall. The three argued until 3 A.M. when Tolkien went home. Dyson and \nLewis walked and talked some more. Dyson insisted Christianity works. \nIt puts the believer at peace, frees him of sin, and provides outside \nhelp to straighten him out.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Day, C. S. Lewis joined the church and took communion. \nHe felt that faith had given him a solid footing; he had lacked a \nsense of direction for his talent. By the middle of 1932 he had \nwritten the first of the many books which made him one of the \nbest-loved 20th century Christian apologists: The Pilgrim's Regress. \nHe would go on to create his own wonderful fantasy world: Narnia.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked to present a series of radio talks, he gave the broadcasts \nwhich were brought together in his book Mere Christianity.These \ninclude probably the most famous quotation of all apologetics: \"A man \nwho was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not \nbe a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic--on the level \nwith a man who says he is a poached egg--or else he would be the \ndevil of hell. You must make your choice. Either he was and is the \nSon of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up \nfor a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can \nfall at his feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with \nany patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He \nhas not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis married an American divorcee, Joy Gresham. She contracted a \npainful cancer. The story of her dying and his grief has twice been \nfilmed as Shadowlands.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nGresham, Douglas H. Lenten Lands; My childhood with Joy Davidman and \nC. S.

    "words": "The fact is that the Sermon on the Mount is not in our creeds. As the \nApostles Creed now stands, you can accept every word of it and leave \nthe essential self untouched.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuppose we had written it in our creeds and had repeated each time \nwith conviction: I believe in the Sermon on the Mount and in its way \nof life, and I intend, God helping me, to embody it! What would have \nhappened? I feel sure that if this had been our main emphasis, the \nhistory of Christendom would have been different. With emphasis on \ndoctrines which left unaffected our way of life, the Christian Church \ncould accept Constantine as its prize convert. And yet Constantine, \nafter his alleged conversion, murdered his conquered colleague and \nbrother-in-law Licinius; sentenced to death his eleven-year-old \nnephew, killed his eldest son, Crispus; brought about the death of \nhis second wife; took the nails that were supposed to come from the \ncross of Christ and used one in his war helmet and another on the \nbridle of his war horse.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet he was canonized by the Greek Church and his memory celebrated \nas equal to the apostles. He talked and presided at the opening of \nthe Council of Nicaea, which was called to frame a creed, and he was \nhailed as a bishop of bishops. Could this have happened if the men \nwho had gathered there had made the Sermon on the Mount an essential \npart of the Creed? It had no place in it, so Constantine could be at \nhome. What had happened was that the Christian Church had been \nconquered by a pagan warrior. And the church allowed itself to be \nthus conquered, for this ideal of Christ did not have possession of \nits soul. For the same reason, a bishop could kick another to death \nin the cathedral of Constantinople to prove his orthodoxy, and the \nMonophysites of Alexander could cry, As thou hast divided, so shalt \nthou be divided, and then proceed to butcher those who believed in \nthe dual nature of Christ in order to prove that the nature of Christ \nwas one and indivisible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                              ----E.

We follow the \nConfederate and Union armies as they lock horns during the Battle of \nFredericksburg. The Confederate army gained a stronghold atop a hill \ncalled Marye's Heights and slaughtered the Union army below with \nrelative ease. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, one young Confederate soldier, Sergeant Richard Kirkland \nwrestled with his conscience. He simply could not bear the carnage \nbefore him. Finally, he approached his superior officer and asked if \nhe could he go out on the field and carry water to the suffering men, \nmost of whom were members of the Union Army. The officer, though \nmystified by his sergeant's request, granted his permission. And thus \nConfederate soldier Richard Kirkland bravely stepped forward to \nassist the legions of dying men he saw on the battlefield. He knew \nthe great risk he was taking as he entered the field of conflict, but \nhis act of courage had a sobering effect on both armies. \u0014\n\u0014\nUpon entering the battlefield, the intense gunfire suddenly ceased. \nThe shock of an enemy offering aid to the opposition struck both \narmies with amazement. Back-and-forth Kirkland went from battlefield \nto water station, aiding every soldier along his path. Each time he \nstepped back on the field of battle, fighting ceased.\u0014\n  \u0014\nSergeant Kirkland earned a nickname that day, says Redding, 'The \nAngel of Marye's Heights.' Later, he would be killed in the war. \nThose who witnessed his death said that he died a hero, thinking of \nthe men under his command up until the very end. \u0014\n\u0014\nDo you understand that this was why Christ came into the world? It \nwas to create a world of Sergeant Richard Kirklands . . . people who \nknow how to love . . . people who know how to put compassion before \npersonal security . . . people who do not divide others into friends \nand enemies . . . but who see all people as children of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat is what the Gospel is about. That is what the kingdom of God is \nabout. For we are God's handiwork, writes St. Paul, created in \nChrist Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us \nto do.\u0014",

Seeing \nadults trying to pass that hatred on to children is a sad sight, no \nmatter how sophisticated and sanitized the effort might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am reminded of the Anne Lamont quote, \"You can safely assume that \nyou've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates \nall the same people you do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe God of the New Testament is not one of hate, not one that desires \nto be used to bully students into feeling left out, isolated and \nalone. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe God of the New Testament is one who took on flesh and came to \ndwell among us so that we would know that we are loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat same God promised to never leave us alone, but to always be with \nus. That God calls us into the world to love with the same radical \nlove with which we ourselves have been loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we find ourselves loving someone we never thought we could, then \nwe may find ourselves approaching the love that Christ has for us. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we discover ourselves loving someone we never had any reason to \nnotice, then we may be getting close to the love Christ has for us. \nChrist's love for us is unconditional, unwarranted, unearned, yet \nfreely given. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe are called not just to receive it, but to share it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEd Sunday-Winters is pastor of Ball Camp Baptist Church in Knoxville, \nTenn\u0014",

This is undoubtedly an early Christian hymn, well known \nto Paul's readers, which the apostle embeds in the text of his \nletter. The word kenosis, or self-emptying, refers to verse 7, in \nwhich we read that Christ \"emptied himself, taking the form of a \nslave, being born in human likeness.\" This early hymn displays a \ndramatic movement of descent, followed by ascent. Christ begins in \nthe heavenly places, but sheds every heavenly prerogative in order to \ntake on human life. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe becomes not only human, but steps into the lowest position \nimaginable in human society: a slave and a criminal, suffering \ncapital punishment imposed by the state. Then, from the low point, \nthe ascent begins. God lifts him up, exalting him to the heights, so \nthat heaven and earth will one day bow the knee before him. Christ is \ndescribed as the actor in the first, \"descent\" portion of the poem -- \nthis is self-sacrifice, after all -- but after that, it is God who is \nthe actor, raising up this completely self-emptied individual and \nfilling him once again.\u0014",

    "words": "Roman Catholic Church official convicted of endangerment in \npriest-abuse trial\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NBC News and news services \u0014\n\u0014\nUPDATED AT 2:17 p.m. ET: PHILADELPHIA -- A Roman Catholic church \nofficial was convicted Friday of child endangerment but acquitted of \nconspiracy in a groundbreaking clergy-abuse trial, becoming the first \nU.S. church official convicted of a crime for how he handled abuse \nclaims.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonsignor William Lynn helped the archdiocese keep predators in \nministry, and the public in the dark, by telling parishes their \npriest was being removed for health reasons and then sending the men \nto unsuspecting churches, prosecutors said. \u0014\n\u0014\nLynn, 61, had faced about 10 to 20 years in prison if convicted of \nall three counts he faced  conspiracy and two counts of child \nendangerment. He was convicted on one of the endangerment counts, \nleaving him with the possibility of 3 1/2 to seven years in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nLynn was on trial with Rev. James Brennan. Brennan, 49, was charged \nwith the attempted rape of a 14-year-old boy in 1996, along with \nchild endangerment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrennan did not testify during the trial, while \\Lynn spent three \ndays on the witness stand saying that he did what he could to stop \nmolestation by clergy but that he was only doing his job when he \nreassigned suspected clergy.\u0014\nOn cross-examination, Lynn acknowledged that he had not helped the \n10-year-old altar boy raped by the Rev. Edward Avery in 1999, seven \nyears after Lynn met with another Avery accuser.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I'm sorry about that, Lynn said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAvery is in prison after admitting the crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier on Friday, jurors were ordered back to work after telling a \njudge they were deadlocked on four of five charges.\u0014\n\u0014\nJurors previously asked for a half-dozen exhibits, including a gray \nfolder found in a locked safe at the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The \nfolder contains a list of 35 suspected predator-priests -- and was \ncompiled by Lynn in 1994. At least one priest on the list was a \nparish pastor until this year.\u0014\n\u0014\nLynn, the former secretary for clergy, testified that he created the \nlist fromsecret church files containing hundreds of child sex-abuse \ncomplaints. He said he hoped Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and other \nsuperiors would address the growing crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's unclear who put the surviving copy of Lynn's list in the safe. \nLynn denied doing so, or owning the safe. The gray file was found \nwhen the safe was smashed open in 2006, two years after Lynn left his \narchdiocese job. An in-house lawyer said he put the gray folder in \nhis files in 2006 without realizing the list -- sought by a grand \njury in 2004 -- was inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new team of lawyers for the archdiocese turned it over to \nprosecutors in early February, days after Bevilacqua died. Lynn's \ntrial started March 26.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe jury heard from more than a dozen alleged victims, including a \nnun, a former priest and a series of troubled adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nLynn said he did more than his colleagues to help victims and advance \nthe church's response to both accusers and the accused priests, who \nwere often sent for evaluation or treatment before transfers to new, \nunsuspecting parishes. Lynn said that only Bevilacqua had the power \nto remove priests from ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut prosecutors say Lynn could have quit or called police. Instead, \nhe stayed in the job for 12 years -- and acknowledged he never once \ncontacted authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article by NBC10.com includes reporting from The Associated \nPress.\u0014",

Hammar\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important for employers to have an appropriate computer policy. \nSuch a policy will minimize or eliminate employees' expectations of \nprivacy in employer-provided computers, thereby providing a viable \ndefense against alleged Fourth Amendment violations and invasions of \nprivacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are several important issues that should be addressed in a \nchurch's computer policy, including the following:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should cover employer-owned and provided computers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should clearly describe authorized and unauthorized use \nof church-provided computers, and give examples of both. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe computer policy should describe the possible consequences of \ninappropriate use of church-provided computers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should clearly authorize the employer to access, \nmonitor, analyze, and inspect its computers at any time, with or \nwithout permission or advance notice. The policy should specify which \nofficers or employees are authorized to inspect church-owned \ncomputers. These may include the senior pastor, board members, church \nadministrator, denominational officials, law enforcement officials, \ncomputer specialists (whether or not employed by the church), or \nanyone authorized by the senior pastor or board. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should state that employees have no \"expectation of \nprivacy\" in their church-provided computer, or its contents. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should advise employees that the church will cooperate \nfully with law enforcement officers in the detection of criminal \nactivity involving church-provided computers. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAll church-provided computers should have a start screen that \nreminds employees of the terms of the employer's computer policy. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe policy should explain the reasons for the employer's right to \naccess computers. These may include some or all of the following, \ndepending on the circumstances: (1) monitoring inappropriate use of \nthe Internet; (2) monitoring excessive use of the Internet; (3) \naccess to information on employees' computers in their absence; (4) \npreventing copyright violations by employees who copy computer \nsoftware without authorization; (5) minimizing the risk of computer \nviruses; (6) updating church-owned software; (7) detection of \ncommunications among employees that may constitute sexual or other \nforms of harassment for which the church may be liable. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tExplain the policy to all new employees at the time of hiring. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHave all new employees sign a statement acknowledging that they \nunderstand and agree to the policy \"in consideration of their \nemployment.\" Alternatively, they can sign a statement agreeing to be \nbound by the church's employee policy manual, if it contains the \nchurch's computer policy. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tIt is not clear whether a church's computer policy can apply to \ncurrent employees unless the church provides them with something of \nvalue in return for their consent to the policy. This is a result of \nthe basic principle of contract law that no contractual commitment is \nbinding unless a party receives something of value in exchange for \nhis or her commitment. This problem may be avoided by having current \nemployees sign a written form (agreeing to the policy) at the time \nthey receive a pay raise. This is an issue that should be addressed \nwith a local attorney. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe computer policy should state that the church retains ownership \nof both its computers and the data stored on them.\u0014",

    "words": "Can Capitalism Be Compatible with Christianity?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Mike Ruffin,  August 31, 2012 Ethics Daily\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a natural born U.S. citizen; I am practically a natural born \nChristian, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was, after all, born on U.S. soil to American parents who took me \nto church for the first time when I was 10 days old.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy growing-up years were marked by a seemingly natural and \ncomfortable alliance between love for God and love for country.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Vacation Bible School, we pledged allegiance to the United States \nand Christian flags with absolutely no sense of irony.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was made clear to me that good Christians supported their country, \neven if its actions ran counter to the teachings of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was born in that little window that kept me from even having to \nregister for the draft.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I ever had to kill \npeople because of my devotion to country, I would be honored. I also \nknew if I refused to kill people because of my devotion to Christ, I \nwould be vilified.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's just one (and an extreme one, at that) example of the tensions \nthat can arise for someone trying to be both a faithful Christian and \na faithful U.S. citizen.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years, I began to try to think seriously and critically \nabout those tensions; specifically, I began to think about how I and \nothers could appropriately live in the United States as Christian \ncitizens.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe position that I developed could be summarized as follows: \"A \nChristian's allegiance to Jesus Christ should always come before any \nother allegiance, including the allegiance to country.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo put it negatively, \"A Christian should never put being American \nahead of being Christian.\"\u0014\nThings get complicated pretty quickly, though.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake, for example, the matter of a Christian's stance toward U.S. \neconomic policies and practices.\u0014\nIt seems to me that many Christians in the United States are much \nmore \"American\" when it comes to economics than they are \"Christian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI am neither an economist nor the son of an economist, but we all \nknow that the heart and soul of the U.S. economic system is \ncapitalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"Capitalism is an economic system that is \nbased on private ownership of the means of production and the \ncreation of goods or services for profit. Competitive markets, wage \nlabor, capital accumulation, voluntary exchange and personal finance \nare also considered capitalistic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIdeally, everyone has the chance to profit in and from such a system. \nIf I operate a successful business, everyone associated with my \nbusiness (shareholders, employees, vendors and so on) might reap the \nbenefits.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, if I am a Christian operating a business, then ideally grace, \nlove and generosity will be churned out along with profits.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, it is difficult to make a case that capitalism is a Christian \nsystem or is even particularly compatible with Christian practice, \ngiven that it is based on competitiveness that all too often \ndegenerates into making a profit at any cost  even if that cost is a \nhuman one  and into an atmosphere of greed and selfishness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Jesus who said, \"You cannot serve God and money,\" and \nsuccessful capitalism practically necessitates, when push comes to \nshove, having God be the one eliminated from the equation if the \nchoice has to be made.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems to me, too, that many professed followers of Christ who put \ncapitalism ahead of their Christianity do not take seriously enough \nthe very clear bias of God  as God is revealed in the Bible  toward \nthe poor and the helpless.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I do think that many folks sincerely believe that, left to \nitself and to the hard work of business owners and operators and of \ntheir employees, the free market will eventually create a situation \nin which the rising waters of profit will float all boats.\u0014\n\u0014\nI also know that many people try very hard to participate in the \ncapitalist system in a way that honors Christ; I know that many such \nfolks do everything they can to be honest, fair and charitable in \nways that they make and invest their profits.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us find ourselves wanting a U.S. society that cares for the \npoor and the helpless as much as, and maybe even more than, it does \nfor the preservation of wealth (although, in the interest of full \ndisclosure, let me make it clear that I am doing what I can to \npreserve enough wealth to be able to eat after I retire, if I ever \ndo).\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not convinced that we couldn't have it both ways  that is, that \nwe couldn't foster a robust business climate that still finds a way, \nthrough the combined efforts of government, churches and nonprofits, \nto protect and care for the poor and helpless among us.\u0014\n\u0014\nI furthermore believe that Christians could and should be in the \nforefront of such an effort.\u0014\nMy thoughts on this subject are complicated by my belief, as \nexpressed elsewhere, that a nation is not capable of being Christian, \nand thus to talk about a \"Christian America\" is to employ a misnomer.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am aware of the tension between that conviction and my desire to \nhave my nation display in its policies and practices the emphases \nthat characterize basic Christianity, namely, \"to care for orphans \nand widows\" (James 1:27) and robust prophetic religion (note the \nconsistent emphasis of the Hebrew prophets on the responsibilities of \nthe \"haves\" toward the \"have nots,\" of the 1 percent to the 99 \npercent, if you will).\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving said that, though, I think it's fair to observe that what I \nwant my nation to practice is basic kindness, fairness and \ncompassion, emphases that bleed across religious lines and indeed are \na part of just being decent human beings. So yes, \"secular humanists\" \ncould and can participate, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis much I know: if we follow Christ, our priority is our \nfaithfulness to him and to his ways, ways that are best described by \nthe words \"service\" and \"sacrifice,\" words that are difficult to \napply and concepts that can be difficult to live out if we buy \nwholeheartedly into any other way, even if it is the American way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Ruffin is pastor of First Baptist Church in Fitzgerald, Ga\u0014",

They were holding \nhands when they died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple left their home in Marshalltown, Iowa, to run some errands \nin town, but they never made it. A car accident sent the couple to \nthe emergency room with broken bones and other injuries. When they \nwere transferred to intensive care the nurses knew not to separate \nthem. But, even in the hospital, they were more concerned about each \nother.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir son Dennis Yeager said, \"She was saying her chest hurt and \nwhat's wrong with Dad? Even laying there like that, she was worried \nabout Dad. And his back was hurting and he was asking about Mom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it became clear that their conditions were not improving, the \nnurses moved them into a room together in beds side-by-side so they \ncould hold hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nGordon died at 3:38 P.M. holding hands with his wife as the family \nthey built surrounded them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir son Dennis said,\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was really strange, they were holding hands, and dad stopped \nbreathing but I couldn't figure out what was going on because the \nheart monitor was still going. But we were like, he isn't breathing. \nHow does he still have a heart beat? The nurse checked and said \nthat's because they were holding hands and it's going through them. \nHer heart was beating through him and picking it up.\u0014\nAt 4:38 p.m., exactly one hour after Gordon died, Norma passed away \ntoo.\u0014\n\u0014\nDennis Yeager said, \"They just loved being together . They were \nold-fashioned. They believed in marriage till death do you part.\" \nDennis also added, \"I don't believe there was a big secret to their \nmarriage.

Instead, \nthey attended so-called medical schools, many of which were condemned \nin the press AND the government as 'substandard.' \u0014\n\u0014\nSugar cost four cents a pound. \u0014\nEggs were fourteen cents a dozen. \u0014\nCoffee was fifteen cents a pound. \u0014\nMost women only washed their hair once a month, and used Borax or egg \nyolks for shampoo. \u0014\nCanada passed a law that prohibited poor people from entering into \ntheir country for any reason. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Five leading causes of death were: \u0014\n1.

While \nyoure at it, might as well pick a particularly polarizing topic. Why \nnot evolution?\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, that probably wasnt exactly how the conversation went down over \nat the marketing offices of Dr. Pepper, but a recent ad for the soft \ndrink posted on Facebook  with the slogan Evolution of Flavor  \nsparked a healthy dose of controversy nonetheless. Based on the \niconic evolution diagram March of Progress, the ad features an ape \nwho, after drinking Dr. Pepper, turns into a man. The ad went up \nThursday, and by Friday had garnered more than 26,000 Likes and \nover 4,000 comments.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is, of course, still the Internet  so plenty of comments in \nquestion are loaded with snark from people who mainly appear to be \nprovoking for the sake of provocation. Several commenters, however, \nexpressed disapproval of Dr. Pepper  believing, apparently, that the \nad showed support for the scientific theory of evolution  and vowing \nto boycott the product. I aint no freaking chimp. No more Dr Pepper \nfor my household. God Bless yall, one user wrote. Another chimed in \nwith, I have lost all respect for Dr Pepper and if Dr Pepper wants \nbusiness from thousands of people they will need to apologize.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the debate roiled on, pro-evolution commenters expressed their \nsupport of the company, vowing to stand by Dr Pepper no matter what. \nOne person, for example, promised hed continue drinking the soda \neven if they announced they pissed in the formula.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo matter what you believe regarding evolution, creationism, \nChristianity, Dr. Pepper, unicorns, cyborgs, narwhals or anything \nelse, the campaign was a huge if inadvertent win for the soft drink \ncompany. As one Facebook commenter points out, DR Pepper scored with \nthis one. Its all over the internet now. The Creationists just made \nthis ad famous. Sweet, sweet irony.\u0014",

    "words": "October 14, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nChristian Group Finds Gay Agenda in an Anti-Bullying Day\u0014\n\u0014\nBy KIM SEVERSON\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Mix It Up at Lunch Day, schoolchildren around the country are \nencouraged to hang out with someone they normally might not speak to. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe program, started 11 years ago by the Southern Poverty Law Center \nand now in more than 2,500 schools, was intended as a way to break up \ncliques and prevent bullying. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this year, the American Family Association, a conservative \nevangelical group, has called the project a nationwide push to \npromote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools and is urging \nparents to keep their children home from school on Oct. 30, the day \nmost of the schools plan to participate this year. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe charges, raised in an e-mail to supporters earlier this month, \nhave caused a handful of schools to cancel this years event and has \ncaught organizers off guard. \u0014\n\u0014\nI was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day \nis, said Maureen Costello, the director of the centers Teaching \nTolerance project, which organizes the program. It was a cynical, \nfear-mongering tactic. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe swirl around Mix It Up at Lunch Day reflects a deeper battle \nbetween the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil-rights group founded \n41 years ago in Montgomery, Ala., and the American Family \nAssociation, a Bible-based cultural watchdog organization in Tupelo, \nMiss. The association says its mission is to fight what it calls the \nincreasing ungodliness in America. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe law center recently added the group to its national list of \nactive hate groups, which also includes neo-Nazis, black separatists \nand Holocaust deniers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAssociation leaders, in return, have gone on the offensive, calling \nthe law center a hate group for oppressing Christian students and \nclaiming its aim is to shut down groups that oppose homosexuality. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe reality is we are not a hate group. We are a truth group, said \nBryan Fischer, director of issue analysis for the association. We \ntell the truth about homosexual behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the suggested activities for Mix It Up at Lunch Day do not \nexpressly address gay and lesbian students, the law center itself \npromotes equal treatment for gays and lesbians and that philosophy \nthen informs the school program, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnti-bullying legislation is exactly the same, Mr. Fischer said. \nIts just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual \nagenda. No one is in favor of anyone getting bullied for any reason, \nbut these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing \nChristian students who believe that homosexual behavior is not \nsomething that should be normalized. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe program is not about sexual orientation but rather about breaking \nup social cliques, which are especially evident in a school \ncafeteria, Ms. Costello said. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn some schools, cliques are socioeconomic. In others they are ethnic \nor religious or based on sexual orientation. By giving students a way \nto mix with other students, self-imposed social barriers can be \nbroken down and bullying can be curbed, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the targets of bullying are kids who are either gay or are \nperceived as gay, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the idea that the program is intended as homosexual \nindoctrination is simply wrong, Ms. Costello added. \u0014\n\u0014\nWeve become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks, she said, \nbut this one was complete misrepresentation. \u0014\n\u0014\nParents who are on the American Family Association e-mail list were \nencouraged to keep their children home on that day and to call school \nadministrators to tell them why.\u0014",

Emil Schrer advanced a\u0014\nbroad interpretation. Because the high priesthood\u0014\nwas passed down for generations among a few\u0014\npriestly families, Schrer contended, the mere fact\u0014\nof belonging to one of the privileged families must\u0014\nhave conferred a particular distinction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe chief priests in the New Testament and Josephus would\u0014\nhave included high Priests in the strict sense, i.e.\u0014\nthe High Priest in office and his predecessors, and\u0014\nsecondly, members of the noble families from which\u0014\nthe High Priests were selected. The chief critic of\u0014\nthis view was Joachim Jeremias, who offered a\u0014\nnarrower interpretation. The chief priests were\u0014\ndefined not by genealogy but only by rank: They\u0014\nwere the permanent chief priests of the Temple,\u0014\nwho by virtue of their office had seats and votes in\u0014\nthe Sanhedrin where they formed a well-defined\u0014\ngroup. . . . The minimum number of this chief\u0014\npriestly group . . . amounted to one high priest, one\u0014\ncaptain of the Temple, and one Temple overseer (a\u0014\npriest), and three treasurerssix in all, to which\u0014\nwere added the retired high priests, and those\u0014\npriests who were employed as overseers and treasurers.\u0014\n\u0014\nGottlob Schrenk followed Jeremias,\u0014\nexplaining the frequency of the occurrence of the\u0014\nterm as emphasizing that when opposition arose\u0014\nagainst Jesus, it was not the work of a single individual\u0014\n. . . but of the religious authorities in general.\u0014\nGeza Vermes, who edited the revised edition of\u0014\nSchrer, offered a mediating view, saying that the\u0014\nreal difference between the two theories may be\u0014\nsmaller than Jeremias and his followers believe.\u0014\nThe priestly aristocracy on the one hand and the\u0014\npresent and past High Priests and their heirs on the\u0014\nother are bound to have been substantially the\u0014\nsame.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEmil Schrer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of\u0014\nJesus Christ (rev. and ed.

    "title": "CALIMS ABOUT JESUS AS KING OF THE JEWS",
    "words": "\u0014\nOne of the charges that had been brought against Jesus was that he \nclaimed to be king of the Jews. Actually, we have no record of Jesus \never making that claim, but others said it about him. Even as early \nas the time of his birth, the Magi came asking, \"Where is the child \nwho has been born king of the Jews?\" (Matthew 2:2). At the beginning \nof Jesus' public ministry, when he called Nathanael to be a disciple, \nNathanael replied, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King \nof Israel!\" (John 1:49). And as recently as a few days before his \narrest, as Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem, the crowds welcomed \nhim, shouting, \"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the \nLord!\" (Luke 19:38). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews, however, were not a free people. They had no political \nright to proclaim their own king. Palestine was a province of the \nRoman Empire, and for anybody other than Caesar to rise up and \ndeclare himself king would be perceived by the Romans as a threat to \ntheir rule. Thus Governor Pilate, as the local representative of \nRome, had to be concerned about anyone rumored to have made such a \nclaim. So his first question to Jesus, in chains before him, is \"Are \nyou the king of the Jews?\" Pilate wants to determine whether the \nprisoner is a threat to the state. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere follows an exchange where Jesus asks whether Pilate is really \nconcerned that he is threat or whether someone, meaning the religious \nauthorities, is manipulating the governor. Eventually, though, Jesus \nanswers Pilate's question by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this \nworld.\" Pilate responds, \"So you are a king?\" missing altogether that \nJesus is defining king and kingdom differently from how the empire \nviews it. Jesus' answer, \"You say that I am a king,\" tells Pilate \nthat his understanding of kingship is inadequate to describe Jesus' \nrole, which Jesus goes on to explain this way: \"For this I was born, \nand for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone \nwho belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\" This then led to \nPilate's mocking reply, \"What is truth?\"\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTMAS --  WHY DECEMBER 25?",
    "words": "CHRISTMAS\u0014\nWhy December 25?\u0014\nFor the church's first three centuries, Christmas wasn't in \nDecemberor on the calendar at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman         August 8, 2008\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the church's first three centuries, Christmas wasn't in \nDecemberor on the calendar at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's very tough for us North Americans to imagine Mary and Joseph \ntrudging to Bethlehem in anything but, as Christina Rosetti memorably \ndescribed it, \"the bleak mid-winter,\" surrounded by \"snow on snow on \nsnow.\" To us, Christmas and December are inseparable. But for the \nfirst three centuries of Christianity, Christmas wasn't in \nDecemberor on the calendar anywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf observed at all, the celebration of Christ's birth was usually \nlumped in with Epiphany (January 6), one of the church's earliest \nestablished feasts. Some church leaders even opposed the idea of a \nbirth celebration. Origen (c.185-c.254) preached that it would be \nwrong to honor Christ in the same way Pharaoh and Herod were honored. \nBirthdays were for pagan gods.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all of Origen's contemporaries agreed that Christ's birthday \nshouldn't be celebrated, and some began to speculate on the date \n(actual records were apparently long lost). Clement of Alexandria \n(c.150-c.215) favored May 20 but noted that others had argued for \nApril 18, April 19, and May 28. Hippolytus (c.170-c.236) championed \nJanuary 2. November 17, November 20, and March 25 all had backers as \nwell. A Latin treatise written around 243 pegged March 21, because \nthat was believed to be the date on which God created the sun. \nPolycarp (c.69-c.155) had followed the same line of reasoning to \nconclude that Christ's birth and baptism most likely occurred on \nWednesday, because the sun was created on the fourth day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eventual choice of December 25, made perhaps as early as 273, \nreflects a convergence of Origen's concern about pagan gods and the \nchurch's identification of God's son with the celestial sun. December \n25 already hosted two other related festivals: natalis solis invicti \n(the Roman \"birth of the unconquered sun\"), and the birthday of \nMithras, the Iranian \"Sun of Righteousness\" whose worship was popular \nwith Roman soldiers. The winter solstice, another celebration of the \nsun, fell just a few days earlier. Seeing that pagans were already \nexalting deities with some parallels to the true deity, church \nleaders decided to commandeer the date and introduce a new festival.\u0014\n\u0014\nWestern Christians first celebrated Christmas on December 25 in 336, \nafter Emperor Constantine had declared Christianity the empire's \nfavored religion. Eastern churches, however, held on to January 6 as \nthe date for Christ's birth and his baptism. Most easterners \neventually adopted December 25, celebrating Christ's birth on the \nearlier date and his baptism on the latter, but the Armenian church \ncelebrates his birth on January 6. Incidentally, the Western church \ndoes celebrate Epiphany on January 6, but as the arrival date of the \nMagi rather than as the date of Christ's baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother wrinkle was added in the sixteenth century when Pope Gregory \ndevised a new calendar, which was unevenly adopted. The Eastern \nOrthodox and some Protestants retained the Julian calendar, which \nmeant they celebrated Christmas 13 days later than their Gregorian \ncounterparts. Mostbut not allof the Christian world now agrees on \nthe Gregorian calendar and the December 25 date.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pagan origins of the Christmas date, as well as pagan origins for \nmany Christmas customs (gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman \nSaturnalia; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; \nYule logs and various foods from Teutonic feasts), have always fueled \narguments against the holiday. \"It's just paganism wrapped with a \nChristian bow,\" naysayers argue. But while kowtowing to worldliness \nmust always be a concern for Christians, the church has generally \nviewed efforts to reshape cultureincluding holidayspositively. As a \ntheologian asserted in 320, \"We hold this day holy, not like the \npagans because of the birth of the sun, but because of him who made \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2000 by the author or Christianity Today/Christian \nHistory magazine.\u0014",

After he \nreturned, Israel Keyes photographed Koenig for a ransom note and then \ndismembered her body.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose details were released by the FBI on Tuesday, two days after \nKeyes was found dead in his Anchorage jail cell in an apparent \nsuicide. It's the most comprehensive account yet of a crime at the \nhands of a man who confessed to the slaying and told authorities he \nkilled at least seven other people across the country over the past \ndecade.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These details are being provided both to fully explain the courage \nand resolve Samantha displayed in the final hours of her life, as \nwell as in the hopes that the release of additional details will help \ninvestigations of other murders committed by Israel Keyes,\" the FBI \nsaid in a statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce home from his trip, Keyes posed Koenig's body to make it appear \nshe was still alive and took a Polaroid photo of her tied up, along \nwith a newspaper dated Feb. 13  12 days after the abduction from a \ncoffee stand, according to the FBI. Keyes later typed a ransom note \ndemanding $30,000 from Koenig's family on the back of a photocopy of \nthe photo and sent a text message to the woman's boyfriend on her \ncellphone with directions where he'd left the note at a local dog \npark.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeyes dismembered Koenig's body and disposed of the remains in a \nfrozen lake north of Anchorage after he cut a hole in the ice with a \nchain saw, authorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nNewly released video including a jailhouse interview reveal more \ninsight into the mind of the late self-confessed serial killer Israel \nKeyes. KING's Chris Daniels reports.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeyes, 34, was arrested in March in Texas, after using Koenig's \nstolen debit card at ATMs there and in Alaska, Arizona and New \nMexico. He was facing a March trial in Koenig's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his arrest, Keyes confessed to killing Koenig and at least \nseven other people. His other known victims were Bill and Lorraine \nCurrier of Essex, Vt., who disappeared in June 2011. Keyes told \nauthorities he also sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple's bodies have not been found.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeyes did not identify the other victims or say where their remains \nwere, other than that four were killed in Washington state and one \nwas killed on the East Coast with the body disposed of in New York. \nKeyes had lived in Washington state and had property in upstate New \nYork.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe told one of the lead FBI investigators in the case that his first \nvictim was a teenage girl in Oregon that he sexually assaulted but \ndid not kill, the Anchorage Daily News reported. FBI special agent \nJolene Goeden told the newspaper that Keyes admitted that he was a \nteen at the time and that \"he had the intention, he said, of killing \nher but but did not. And he did let her go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSurveillance video\u0014\nAlso Tuesday, authorities released video footage of Keyes abducting \nKoenig, caught by a surveillance camera. Another video sequence shows \nhim returning for Koenig's cellphone late that night, leaving Koenig \nbound in his truck, followed four minutes later by a man identified \nby the FBI as Koenig's boyfriend, who was looking for her. Keyes \nwould use the cellphone to send text messages to the boyfriend and \ncoffee stand owner that purported to be from Koenig saying she had a \nbad day and was leaving town for the weekend.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first video sequence, Keyes walks up to the small coffee stand \nand orders an Americano coffee, which Koenig makes. He then pulls out \na gun and Koenig is then seen putting her hands up several times. At \nsome point, Keyes makes her turn off the light. The light switch was \nclose to a panic button, but Koenig never pushed it, probably because \nshe was too afraid, police said.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeyes then climbs into the kiosk and, police said, used zip ties to \nbind Koenig's hands behind her back before leading her out. He told \nKoenig he would let her go if her family paid a ransom, but that was \nnever his intention, police said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He knew all along he was going to kill her,\" Anchorage homicide \nDetective Monique Doll said.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice said Keyes removed the battery from Koenig's cellphone to \navoid being tracked.\u0014\n\u0014\nKoenig's body was recovered from the lake in April after Keyes told \nauthorities of its location.\u0014",

    "title": "CHURCHES ARE IN A MINORITY AT CHRISTMAS",
    "words": "Churches Are in Minority at Christmas  And That's Good\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOur current Christmas celebration habits are a uniquely post-World \nWar II phenomena. Much of the excess we experience stands at odds \nwith the way Western society approached the holiday only a few years \nago. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis shift has lessons for any congregation attempting to manage \nexpectations and change as it tries to embrace the new realities of \nthe 21st century.\u0014\n\u0014\nWikipedia tell us that following victory during the English Civil \nWar, England's Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey did so because of the secular nature of the celebration: way too \nmuch alcohol, bands of young men going from house to house demanding \nfood, and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nPro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities, and for weeks \nCanterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with \nholly and shouted royalist slogans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Restoration of Charles II in 1660 ended the ban, but many \nclergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Colonial America, the Puritans of New England disapproved of \nChristmas. Celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681. At \nthe same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed \nthe holiday freely.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoravian settlers in Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz in Pennsylvania \nand the Wachovia settlements in North Carolina were enthusiastic \ncelebrators of Christmas. The Moravians in Bethlehem had the first \nChristmas trees in America as well as the first nativity scenes.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas fell out of favor in the United States after the American \nRevolution, when it was considered an English custom.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver in England, by the 1820s sectarian tension had eased and British \nwriters began to worry that Christmas was dying out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese writers imagined Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration, \nand efforts were made to revive the holiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Dickens' book, \"A Christmas Carol,\" published in 1843, played \na major role in reinventing Christmas as a holiday emphasizing \nfamily, goodwill and compassion as opposed to communal celebration \nand hedonistic excess.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn America, interest in Christmas was revived in the 1820s by several \nshort stories by Washington Irving. Irving's stories depicted \nharmonious, warm-hearted holiday traditions that were widely imitated \nby his American readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement Clarke Moore's 1822 poem, \"A Visit From St. Nicholas,\" \n(popularly known by its first line: Twas the Night Before Christmas) \ncreated great interest in the man in the red suit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poem popularized the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal \nChristmas shopping began to assume economic importance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her 1850 book, \"The First Christmas in New England,\" Harriet \nBeecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true \nmeaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas was eventually declared a United States federal holiday in \n1870.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, for more than 200 years, the celebration of Christmas ebbed and \nflowed in the life of the average American home as societal forces \nfought for dominance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs there not something here for us to learn about our efforts to find \n21st-century relevance and meaning in the life of our congregations?\u0014\n\u0014\nThink about it: Each Advent season, our churches have the opportunity \nto offer an alternative understanding of reality to the American \npublic.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe insist that this time of year is filled with powerful spiritual \nlessons if one is willing to push through the noise and static of \nculture and look beneath the surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a privilege and a joy to be a truth-teller amid the cultural \nlies that surround us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe understand the massive disadvantage we have as we face off against \nthe retail economic engine that drives two-thirds of the American \neconomy. We acknowledge that we speak a word of moderation in a \nseason of excess.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe find meaning in offering an alternative celebration rich in power \nand history, even if it seems seriously outdated. We sing songs \nothers have never heard. We use words that need interpretation. We \ntell stories overlooked by most.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe declare our smallness in this divine story while others revel in \nthe attention they draw to themselves. At our best, we stand \nalongside culture and offer a prophetic critique and a \nreinterpretation of reality they find nowhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is our future, is it not? Being a minority voice in a larger \nconversation is not just for Christmas; it is the future of the \nAmerican church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe no longer are in a position to dominate and dictate to culture how \nit will behave or believe. Instead, we are now free to be salt and \nlight, as we seek to influence rather than rule.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany find this minority status traumatizing and debilitating. They \nmistakenly try to conform themselves to the culture, and in doing so \nlose their identity and voice.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think Heaven is rejoicing and celebrating that we no longer hold a \nplace of dominance, but assume an attitude of humility and \ndependence. On such a spirit was His kingdom founded, and on such is \nit sustained.\u0014\n\u0014\nMerry Christmas!\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson is president of the Center for Congregational Health in \nWinston-Salem, N.C.\u0014",

He used to share with us about \nJesus.\" She said he had received messages on his mobile phone \nstating, \"We know what you are doing, and you must stop, otherwise \nyou risk your life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA Christian source in Mogadishu confirmed the killing, and a Muslim \nresident of the Beledweyne area also said Siadwas killed for leaving \nIslam. \"Siad deserved to die because he was not committed to the \nIslamic religion,\" the resident said.Siad's 42-year-old wife, three \ndaughters and two sons have fled the area, fearing for their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 12/21/12\u0014",

Flannery points to the Spanish \nInquisition-style campaign as indicative of the conservative shift \nof the Church under Pope Benedict XVI. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                Tony Flannery is \nthreatened with excommunication \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRedemptorist Fr. Tony Flannery is threatened with excommunication \nfrom the Catholic Church for suggesting that, in the future, women \nmight become priests and calling for this and other matters to be \nopen for discussion. Fr. Flannery, (66) who joined the Redemptorists \nin 1964 at seventeen and was ordained ten years later, has been told \nthat if he is to remain in the Church and in his Congregation, he \nmust also guarantee not to attend meetings of the Association of \nCatholic Priests (ACP) until he has publicly agreed to the conditions \nlaid down.\u0014\n\u0014\nFr. Flannery was forbidden to minister as a priest for most of the \npast year, and this will continue until he meets the requirements of \nthe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have been ordered not to engage with the media or publish any \nbooks or articles,\u0014\nhe told a press briefing in Dublin today. I have also been ordered \nnot to have any involvement, public or private, with the ACP. I was \nput under a formal precept of obedience not to attend the AGM of the \nACP last November by Michael Brehl, Superior General of the \nRedemptorists. But he made it clear hed been instructed by the CDF \nto issue it.\u0014\n\u0014\nFr Flannery will be allowed back into ministry only if he writes, \nsigns and publishes an article (pre-approved by the CDF) accepting \nthe Catholic Church can never ordain women to the priesthood and \naccepting all Church stances on contraception, homosexuality, and the \nrefusal of the sacraments to people in second relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nI could not possibly put my name to such an article without \nimpugning my own integrity and conscience, he said today. The \nCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is orchestrating all this \nwhile refusing to communicate with me. I have had no direct \ncommunication with them. I have never been given an opportunity to \nmeet my accusers, or to understand why this action is being taken \nagainst me when Ive raised the same issues, consistently, for \ndecades.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe documentation Fr Flannery received, apparently from the CDF took \nthe form of a typed A4 page (not a letterhead) which was unsigned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only reason that I can be sure that this came from the CDF is \nthat Michael Brehl, the head of the Redemptorists, told me it did, \nhe said. All requests for direct communication with the CDF have \nbeen ignored.\u0014\n\u0014\nFr. Flannery described as frightening, disproportionate and \nreminiscent of the Inquisition the actions against him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have served the Church, the Redemptorists and the People of God \nfor two thirds of my life, he pointed out. Throughout that time, I \nhave in good conscience raised issues I believed important for the \nfuture of the Church in books and essays largely read by practicing \nCatholics, rather than raising them in mainstream media. Im hardly a \nmajor and subversive figure within the Church deserving \nexcommunication and expulsion from the religious community within \nwhich I have lived since my teens.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe choice facing him, he stated at a press briefing today, Sunday \n20th January, was between deciding between Rome and his conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nI must also question if the threats are a means, not just of \nterrifying me into submission, but of sending a message to any other \npriest expressing views at variance with those of the Roman Curia, \nhe added. Submitting to these threats would be a betrayal of my \nministry, my fellow priests and the Catholic people who want change.\u0014\n\u0014\nFr. Flannery said that because he believes he is being subjected to \nunfair treatment, he has taken legal advice under Canon and Civil law \nto help him defend his rights as a member of the Church and as an \nIrish citizen.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nACP - Association of Catholic Priests    1/20/13\u0014",

But I didn't know I was an angry man. I didn't \nthink I was perfect, and, yes, I knew I needed others in my life, but \nI lived as though I didn't. When my wife, Luella, would approach me \nwith yet another instance of this anger, I would always do the same \nthing: wrap a robe of righteousness around me, activate my inner \nlawyer, and remind her once again of what a great husband she had. I \nwould go through my well-rehearsed and rather long list of all the \nthings I did for her, all the ways I made her life easier. On one \noccasion, I got on a roll and actually said, \"Ninety-five percent of \nthe women in our church would love to be married to a man like me!\" \nLuella quickly informed me that she was in the five percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was a man headed for disaster. The gracious and patient pastor our \ncongregation saw in public ministry was a very different guy from the \nirritable and impatient man at home. I was increasingly comfortable \nwith things that should have haunted and convicted me. I just didn't \nsee the spiritual schizophrenia that personal ministry life had \nbecome. Little did I know that God would expose my heart in a \npowerful moment of rescuing grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy brother Tedd and I had been on a ministry training weekend and \nwere on our way home. Tedd suggested that we try to make what we had \nlearned over the weekend practical to our own lives. He said, \"Why \ndon't you start?\" and then proceeded to ask me a series of questions. \nAs Tedd asked me questions, it was as though God was ripping down \ncurtains and I was seeing and hearing myself with accuracy for the \nfirst time. I couldn't believe that the man I was now looking at and \nhearing was actually me. It was a pointed and powerful discussion, a \nbigger moment than I was able to grasp at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are three underlying themes that operated in my life, which I \nhave encountered in the lives of many pastors to whom I have spoken. \nThese themes functioned as the mechanism of spiritual blindness in my \nlife, and I'm convinced they also do in the lives of countless other \npastors.\u0014\n\u0014\nLetting ministry define my identity\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one is more influential in your life than you are, because no one \ntalks to you more than you do. You are in an unending conversation \nwith yourself, and the things you say to you about you are formative \nof the way that you live. Smack-dab in the middle of your internal \nconversation is what you tell yourself about your identity. There are \nonly two places to look for identity: vertically, from who you are in \nChrist, or horizontally, in the situations, experiences, and \nrelationships of your daily life. This is true of everyone, but I am \nconvinced that getting one's identity horizontally is a particular \ntemptation for those in ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinistry had become my identity. I didn't think of myself as a child \nof God, in daily need of grace, in the middle of my own \nsanctification, still in a battle with sin, still in need of the body \nof Christ, and called to pastoral ministry. No, I thought of myself \nas a pastor. That's it, bottom line. The office of pastor was more \nthan a calling and a set of God-given gifts that had been recognized \nby the body of Christ. \"Pastor\" defined me. It was me in a way that \nproved to be more dangerous than I would have thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one celebrates the presence and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ \nmore than the person who has embraced his desperate and daily need of \nit. But in ways I now find embarrassing, ministry told me that I was \nnot like everyone else, that I existed in a unique category. And if I \nwas not like everyone else, then I didn't need what everyone else \nneeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nA while back Tedd and I attended a large Christian-life conference. A \nwell-known pastor told stories of the zeal, discipline, and \ndedication of the great fathers of our faith to personal and family \nworship. He painted lengthy pictures of what their private and family \ndevotions were like. It was all very convicting and discouraging. I \nfelt the weight of the crowd's burden as they listened. I found \nmyself whispering, \"Comfort us with grace, comfort us with grace,\" \nbut the grace never came.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the way back to the hotel, we rode with the speaker and another \npastor, who drove. The driver had clearly felt a similar burden and \nasked the speaker a brilliant question: \"If a man in your \ncongregation came to you and said, 'Pastor, I know I'm supposed to \nhave devotions with my family, but things are so chaotic at my house \nthat I can barely get out of bed and get the child fed and off to \nschool,' what would you say to him?\" The speaker answered, \"I'd say, \n'I'm a pastor, which means I carry many more burdens for many more \npeople than you do, and if I can pull off daily family worship, you \nshould be able to do so as well.'\" Maybe it was because he was with a \ngroup of pastors, but he actually said it! There was no identifying \nwith the man's struggle, no ministry of grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I heard his response, I became angry, until I remembered that I \nhad done the very same thing again and again to my wife and children. \nAt home it was all too easy to mete out judgment without grace. I had \nlet my ministry become something that it should never be (my \nidentity), and I looked to it to give me what it never could (my \ninner sense of well-being).\u0014\n\u0014\nLetting theological knowledge define my maturity\u0014\n\u0014\nI was an honors graduate of a seminary. I won academic awards. I \nassumed I was mature and felt misunderstood and misjudged by anyone \nwho failed to share my assessment. In fact, I saw those moments of \nconfrontation as part of the persecution that anyone faces when he \ngives himself to gospel ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut maturity is not merely something you do with your mind (although \nthat is an important element of it). No, maturity is about how you \nlive your life. It is possible to be theologically astute and be very \nimmature. It is possible to be biblically literate and be in need of \nsignificant spiritual growth.\u0014\n\u0014\nSin is not first an intellectual problem. (Yes, it does affect my \nintellect, as it does all parts of my functioning.) But sin is first \na moral problem. It is about my rebellion against God and my quest to \nhave for myself the glory that is due to him. So it's not just my \nmind that needs to be renewed by sound biblical teaching, but my \nheart needs to be reclaimed by the powerful grace of the Lord Jesus \nChrist. Biblical maturity is never just about what you know; it's \nalways about how grace has employed what you have come to know to \ntransform the way you live.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink of Adam and Eve. They didn't disobey God because they were \nintellectually ignorant of God's commands. No, they knowingly stepped \nover God's boundaries because they quested for God's position. The \nspiritual war of Eden was fought at a deeper level than mere \nknowledge. Consider David. He didn't claim Bathsheba as his own and \nplot to get rid of her husband because he was ignorant of God's \nprohibitions against adultery and murder. David did what he did \nbecause at some point he didn't care what God wanted. He was going to \nhave what his heart desired, no matter what.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though I didn't know it, I had walked into pastoral ministry \nwith an unbiblical view of biblical maturity. I thought I had \n\"arrived.\" So when Luella lovingly and faithfully confronted me, I \nwas convinced that she was the one with the problem. I didn't see \nmyself as needy, I was not open to correction, and I used my biblical \nand theological knowledge to defend myself. I was a mess.\u0014\n\u0014\nConfusing ministry success with God's endorsement of how I lived\u0014\n\u0014\nPastoral ministry was exciting in many ways. The church was growing \nnumerically, and people seemed to be growing spiritually. People were \ncommitting to this vibrant spiritual community, and we saw battles of \nthe heart taking place in their lives. We founded a Christian school, \nwhich was growing and expanding its reputation and influence. I \nstarted out my days with a deep sense of privilege that God had \ncalled me to these things.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I held these blessings in the wrong way. I took God's \nfaithfulness to his people, to the work of his kingdom, to his plan \nof redemption, and to his church as an endorsement of me. I would say \nto Luella (and this is embarrassing), \"If I'm such a bad guy, why is \nGod blessing everything I put my hands to?\" God was acting as he was \nnot because he was endorsing my manner of living but because of his \nzeal for his own glory and his faithfulness to his promises of grace \nfor his people. And God has the authority and power to use whatever \ninstruments he chooses in whatever way he chooses to use them. The \nsuccess of a ministry is always more a picture of God than a \nstatement about the people he is using.\u0014\n\u0014\nI took credit that I did not deserve for what I could not do. I made \nit about me, so I didn't see myself as a man headed for disaster and \nin deep need of the rescue of God's grace. I had it all wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nReleasing my anger\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter my convicting talk with Tedd, I couldn't wait to get home and \ntalk with Luella. When I walked into the house, I think Luella knew \nright away that something was up. I looked different. I asked her if \nwe could sit down and talk, even though it was late. \"I know you have \nbeen trying for a long time to get me to look at my anger, and I have \nbeen unwilling,\" I said. \"I have always turned it back on you. But I \ncan honestly say for the first time that I am ready to listen to you. \nI want to hear what you have to say.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuella began to cry. She told me that she loved me, and then she \ntalked for two hours. In those two hours God began the process of \ntearing down and rebuilding my heart. The most important word of the \nprevious sentence is process. I wasn't zapped by lightening. I didn't \ninstantly become an un-angry man. But now I was a man with eyes, \nears, and heart open.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next few months were incredibly painful. It seemed that my anger \nwas visible everywhere I looked. At times it seemed the pain was too \ngreat to bear. That pain was the pain of grace. I was in the middle \nof spiritual surgery.\u0014\n\u0014\nMonths after that night, I was coming down the stairs into our living \nroom, and I saw Luella sitting with her back to me. And as I looked \nat her, it hit me that I couldn't remember the last time I had felt \nthat old ugly anger toward her. By no means was I perfect, but that \nold, life-dominating anger was gone. Praise God! I walked up behind \nLuella and put my hands on her shoulders, and she put her head back \nand looked up at me. I said to her, \"You know, I'm not angry at you \nanymore.\" Together we laughed and cried at the same time at the \nbeauty of what God had done.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you view yourself? Do you see yourself as a minister of grace \nin need of the same grace? Are there disharmonies between your public \nministry persona and the details of your private life? Do you use \nyour knowledge or experience to keep confrontation at bay? You don't \nhave to be afraid of what is in your heart, and you don't have to \nfear being known, because there is nothing in you that could ever be \nexposed that hasn't already been covered by the precious blood of \nyour Savior king, Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted from \\Dangerous Calling: Confronting the Unique Challenges \nof Pastoral Ministry (Crossway, 2012).\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTIANS ADDRESSING MENTAL ILLNESS",
    "words": "Last weekend, the nation, and particularly the evangelical community, \nwas stunned by the news that Rick Warren's youngest son, Matthew, had \ndied by suicide after a lifelong battle with mental illness. We can't \nsay what Matthew Warrena young man with access to mental health \ncare, a loving family, and a relationship with Christwas thinking \nand feeling as he took his own life, but we can honor this family's \npain by considering how we interact with the people in our own lives \nwho suffer from mental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the wake of his son's death, Rick Warren has already addressed the \n\"haters\" who celebrate his family's loss and blame Warren himself. \nFor most people, such a response is unfathomable. To celebrate a \nperson's tragic death takes a special kind of evil. But in responding \nto mental illness, even well-meaning people can do harm so easily.\u0014\n\u0014\nExperts say more than 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a \nmental disorder; while most people with mental illness do not die \nthis way, Matthew Warren is not the only sufferer to experience that \nimpulse or to act on it. He's one of about 38,000 in the U.S. to die \nby suicide each year, and thousands more attempt to do so, imagine \nit, or live out a number of other frightening symptoms of mental \nillness.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople with mental illness sometimes behave in ways other people \ndon't understand and can't make sense of. People with severe \ndepression sometimes stay in bed all day, unable to manage the most \nbasic motivation to move. People with anxiety disorders can be \ngripped by irrational or even unidentifiable fears that don't \nincapacitate other people. Those affected by psychotic disorders may \nsee things that aren't real, hear voices that don't exist, and \nsometimes lose the ability to discern reality at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes people with mental illness mistreat or hurt the people they \nloveor themselves. Some who need medication stop taking it or won't \nstart. Some who seem to be doing well suddenly start showing symptoms \nagain. And yes, some try to end their lives. When they succeed, their \nloved ones are left with a gaping devastation that cannot be patched \nwith a Hallmark card or niceties about God wanting another angel in \nheaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this can be hard for us to understand. I've done my share of \ntrying. When I was a teenager, I tried to communicate with my mother, \nwho suffers from schizophrenia, during psychotic episodes. I \ndesperately tried to understand why she was so afraid and how to help \nher. Later, I tried to understand after she spent two years believing \nshe was receiving special insights during church servicesthen she \nwalked away from the church and into the occult. Another time, she \nwas convicted of a crime and spent time in prison. These incidents \nwere so far removed from her true character. My family agonized over \nthem, but we couldn't prevent or \"fix\" any of them, any more than we \ncould understand them. And I still haven't understood what to do with \nmy own emotions when I once again feel that old bubbling sludge of \nanger, pity, horror, and sorrow when one of the people I love most \nmakes another terrible choice, repeats a mistake, or hurts other \npeopleand may or may not be responsible for her behavior. If she \nisn't, who is?\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, I've spent a lot of time writing and speaking up on behalf \nof people affected by mental illness and their families. I want to \nsee the church embrace these people as we never have before, in \nkeeping with our mission in this life. People who have mental illness \ncan be a difficult group to reach, as their symptoms, efforts to cope \nwith pain, and even side effects from medication can cause behaviors \nthat make us uncomfortable or even alarm us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we see symptoms of mental illness, here's how we often respond:\u0014\n\u0014\n Interpret their behavior through the lens of our own experience and \nassume their symptoms mean they're selfish, lazy, self-absorbed, \nundisciplined, or simply failing to trust God.\u0014\n\u0014\n Distance ourselves, hoping that something prosperity, clean \nliving, more faith, a strong familyseparates us from them and \nguarantees we are not vulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\n Ignore them and hope someone else will help.\u0014\n\u0014\n Reject them.\u0014\n\u0014\n Fear them, usually with no rational basis.\u0014\n\u0014\n Blame them for their problems and shame them into silence.\u0014\n\u0014\n Tell them to go get help and come back when they're \"cured.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Try to cure them with spiritual practices like Bible reading and \nprayer, which by themselves are inadequate for people who need \nmedical intervention.\u0014\n\u0014\n Try to solve the problem with pat answers and unhelpful advice.\u0014\n\u0014\n Try to \"fix\" them with amateur counseling.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we respond in these ways, we make ourselves irrelevant to people \nwho need our help. We send the message that our faith has no answer \nor explanation for this kind of suffering. We suggest there is an \neasy answer to their suffering, yet it remains elusive to them for \nsome reason, probably because they don't deserve it and we do. We \nimply that God himself is ready to walk away from people in pain. All \nthis from people who mean well but just don't know what to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy Simpson is author of Troubled Minds: Mental Illness and the \nChurch's Mission (InterVarsity Press).\u0014",

    "words": "Trinity Church Split on How to Manage $2 Billion Legacy of a Queen\u0014\nBy \\SHARON OTTERMAN  April 24, 2013\u0014\nNew York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has never been any doubt that Trinity Church is wealthy. But \nthe extent of its wealth has long been a mystery; guessed at by many, \nknown by few. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, however, after a lawsuit filed by a disenchanted parishioner, \nthe church has offered an estimate of the value of its assets: more \nthan $2 billion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Episcopal parish, known as Trinity Wall Street, traces its \nholdings to a gift of 215 acres of prime Manhattan farmland donated \nin 1705 by Queen Anne of England. Since then, the church has parlayed \nthat gift into a rich portfolio of office buildings, stock \ninvestments and, soon, mixed-use residential development. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe parish's good fortune has become an issue in the historic \ncongregation, which has been racked by infighting in recent years \nover whether the church should be spending more money to help the \npoor and spread the faith, in New York and around the world. \nDifferences over the parish's mission and direction last year led \nnearly half the 22-member vestry  an august collection of corporate \nexecutives and philanthropists  to resign or be pushed out, after at \nleast seven of them asked, unsuccessfully, that the rector himself \nstep down. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years, the church has sold or given away much of the \noriginal 215 acres from Queen Anne, but it has 14 acres, including \n5.5 million square feet of commercial real estate. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt reported $158 million in real estate revenue for 2011, the \nmajority of which went toward maintaining and supporting its real \nestate operations, the financial statement indicates. Of the $38 \nmillion left for the church's operating budget, some $4 million was \nspent on communications, $3 million on philanthropic grant spending \nand $2.5 million on the church's music program, church officials \nsaid. Nearly $6 million went to maintain Trinity's historic \nproperties, including the main church building, which was built in \n1846; St. Paul's Chapel; and several cemeteries, where luminaries \nincluding Alexander Hamilton and Edward I. Koch are buried. The \nremainder went into the church's equity investment portfolio. \u0014\n\u0014\nCritics argue that the church could have a higher profile as a beacon \nof charity and Episcopal belief. I felt that the church was being \ntoo corporate and wasn't acting on its values, said Jeremy C. Bates, \nthe congregant who filed the lawsuit and a former leader of the \nchurch's \\Congregational Council. \u0014\nBut not all parishioners agree. \u0014\n\u0014\n For full article, see Word/My Documents/Trinity Church Split\u0014",

    "words": "I Tim. 3:1 \"Overseer\" - office of overseer. This word is used in this \nsense in one other passage in the NT (Acts 1:20). Overseer is most \noften translated \"bishop\" (from episcopos-episcopal, like Episcopal \u0014\nChurch, a system of bishops. \u0014\n\u0014\n(Refer here to Acts 20:28.) \"Elders\" (prebyteros) and \"Bishop\" were \nthe same person. Proof of that is found in Acts 20. In v. 17 Paul \nsent for \"elders\" of the church at Ephesus. But in v. 28, he calls \nthem \"overseers\" or \"bishops\" -- the same people. \u0014\n\u0014\nVss. 8-13: Deacon (diakonos) - servant. Not servant of the pastor but \nservant of the church. The term is \u0014\nfirst used in a technical sense in Phil.1:1 to \"all the saints in \nChrist Jesus at Philippi, together with \u0014\nthe overseers and deacons .... \"\u0014\n\u0014\n===================================================\u0014\n\u0014\nElder = pastor, not a separate office from pastor. Used \ninterchangeably with \u0014\n\"overseer. \" \u0014\n\u0014\nOverseer = In the Greek culture the word was used of a presiding \nofficial in a civic or \u0014\nreligious organization. Here it refers to a man who oversees a local \ncongregation. The \u0014\nequivalent word from the Jewish background of Christianity is \n\"elder.\" The terms \u0014\n\"overseer\" and \"elder\" are used interchanqeably in Ac 20:17,28; Tit 1 \n:5-7; 1 Pe 5:1-2. \u0014\nThe duties of an overseer were to teach and preach (3:2; 5: 17), to \ndirect the affairs of \u0014\nthe church (3:5; 5:17), to shepherd the flock of God (Ac 20:28) and \nto guard the church \u0014\nfrom error (Ac 20:28-31). \u0014\n\u0014\nDeacon = In its nontechnical usage, the Greek for this word means \nsimply \"one who \u0014\nserves.\" The men chosen in Ac 6:1-6 were probably not only the first \ndeacons \u0014\nmentioned in the NT but also the first to be appointed in the church. \nGenerally, their \u0014\nservice was meant to free the elders to give full attention to prayer \nand the ministry of \u0014\nthe word (Ac 6:2, 4). The only two local church offices mentioned in \nthe NT are \u0014\nthose of overseer (also called elder) and deacon (see Php 1: 1).\u0014",

    "words": "Christians and Civil Disobedience\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished in the March/April 2012 Magazine\u0014\nby Haven Bradford Gow\u0014\n\u0014\nHouston Baptist University scholar/educator Louis Markos, writing in \nFrom Achilles to Christ (InterVarsity Press), gives the example of \nSophocles play Antigone as an affirmation there is a higher, \nuniversal, immortal law written in humanitys heart, mind, and \nconscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Antigone Creon, the governor of the state, has commanded that no \none may bury his nephew, Polyneices, brother of Antigone. Antigone, \nthough, defies her uncle Creons command and proceeds to spread \nburial dirt on Polyneices body.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually Creon encounters his niece Antigone and accuses her of \nbreaking the law; Antigone responds that she was obeying a higher law \nwritten in our hearts, minds, and consciences: For me it was not \nZeus who made that order. Nor did that Justice who lives with the \ngods below mark out such laws to hold among mankind. Nor did I think \nyour orders were so strong that you, a mortal man, could overrun the \ngods unwritten and unfailing laws. Not now, nor yesterdays they \nalways live, and no one knows their origin in time. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Protestant scholar/clergyman William Watley observes in Root of \nResistance: The Nonviolent Ethic of Martin Luther King Jr. (Judson \nPress), Martin Luther King was affirming the reality of this higher \nlaw recognized by Sophocles when he urged others to support Rosa \nParks, who had been arrested for defying a local law requiring Black \npeople to walk to the back of the bus to be seated. Rosa Parks said \nthat she had been tired after work and had decided to sit in the \nfront, instead of walking all the way to the back. King said \nChristians should disobey unjust laws and follow a higher law, a \nuniversal and immortal moral law.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Terrence Rynne, founder of the Marquette University \nCenter for Peacemaking and author of Gandhi & Jesus (Orbis), Martin \nLuther Kings espousal of non-violent civil disobedience echoes \nsentiments expressed by Gandhi: Civil disobedience, for Gandhi, \nwrote Rynne, was the direct disobeying of particular laws with the \nwillingness to accept punishment that came with the contravention of \nthe laws. When a government itself became lawless and unjust, Gandhi \nunderstood that civil disobedience became not only the recourse of \nthe populace but a duty. . . . For civil disobedience to be civil, \nit required that the resistance be carried out nonviolently.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience also has roots in the \nNew Testament. For example, the apostles were warned that if they \ncontinued preaching and practicing the teachings of Christ, they \nwould be imprisoned and perhaps executed; despite the warnings, the \napostles continued preaching and living the teachings of Christ, and \nthey were unjustly imprisoned. The New Testament tells us they \nsuffered imprisonment joyfully, for they were suffering for the sake \nof Christ. One might say the earliest Christians taught and practiced \nnonviolent civil disobedience.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, as the New Testament teaches, Christians ought to obey God \nrather than men (Acts 5:29).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHaven Bradford Gow is a TV and radio commentator and writer who \nteaches religion to children at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, \nGreenville, Mississippi.\u0014",

    "words": "Seven (Plus One) Deadly Sins of a Church Website\u0014\nTom Rainer\u0014\n\u0014\nMost church leaders dont grasp the value of a website to get guests \nto their churches to hear the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost church websites are terrible.\u0014\n\u0014\nI just finished looking at over 100 websites from a variety of \nchurches of a variety of sizes. I am not an expert in either design \nor technology, so my primary purpose was to look at the sites from \nthe perspective of a person considering visiting the church. Forgive \nmy judgmental words, but I was not impressed with most of the sites.\u0014\n\u0014\nI do not have confirmation of these statistics, so I am hesitant to \nput them in writing. Nevertheless, the unconfirmed numbers indicate \nthat between 75% and 90% of potential guests to your church will \nfirst look at the churchs website before making a final decision to \nattend.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you get that? As many as nine out of ten prospective guests will \nget their first impression of your church based on what they see when \nthey go to the church website. Thats huge! It may be the most \noverlooked outreach tool we have. The church that minimizes the value \nof its website is the church that is missing many opportunities to \nreach people.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly the website should have features for the members, but its \nthe guests who are often overlooked. Allow me to share the greatest \nomissions on the websites; what I humorously call the seven deadly \nsins.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe website is dated in both design and content. You are \ncommunicating an uncaring attitude and a sloppy approach to ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe website was built cheaply and looks like it. From a ministry \nperspective, the church is missing many opportunities. From a \nstewardship perspective, one guest who becomes a member will pay for \nthe cost of a good site. Though some web designers and builders are \ntoo expensive, it makes absolutely no sense to try to get by with a \ncheap-looking site.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe service times are either hard to find or non-existent. This \ninformation is probably the first information a guest tries to find. \nIf the times are not clear and apparent, you probably have already \nlost the guest.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe physical address of the church is either hard to find or \nnon-existent. Most of your guests will likely put the address in \ntheir GPS system. They wont be seeking your church in the Yellow \nPages. You are probably missing out on the majority of your guests if \nyou dont have a clearly marked physical address.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot enough information on childcare. Youve lost your young families \nwith this omission.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinimal information on your staff. Guests want to know as much as \npossible about the staff of the church. The best sites Ive seen \ninclude personal statements from the staff along with their photos.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo place to listen to recent sermons. A number of your prospective \nguests will listen to an entire sermon before deciding to visit. They \nmay assume that you are not very proud of the preaching ministry of \nthe church if you dont have podcasts easily available.\u0014\n\u0014\n(Plus One). In recent years, more prospective guests have wanted to \nknow the basic beliefs of the church. If you dont have a statement \nof faith on the website, you will miss out on some of your more \ndiscerning guests.\u0014",

Murad, 49, who was setting up a \nmonastery in Gassanieh, in northern Syria, was attacked at the \nmonastery last Sunday by extremist militants trying to topple \nPresident Bashar Assad. While earlier reports suggested Murad may \nhave been shot to death, Catholic Online reported Saturday: \"The \nVatican is confirming the death by beheading of Franciscan Father \nFrancois Murad, who was martyred by Syrian jihadists on June 23.\" The \nCatholic news service quoted local sources who reported that the \nradical al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, or Al-Nusra Front, was \nbehind the savage killing. In video posted by Live Leak purporting to \nshow the execution, dozens of men and boys are seen cheering on as \nthree men are seated on the ground awaiting their grisly fate. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe men are methodically beheaded one at a time by men holding what \nappears to be a simple kitchen knife, after which the heads are \nplaced on top of the bodies. According to Catholic Online, the first \nvictim was Murad. A frenzy ensues, with dozens drawing out their \nsmartphones to capture the bloody scene, as a chorus of Allahu Akbar \n(\"Allah is the greatest\") is sung. Several observers are seen moving \nwithin inches of the bodies in an effort to capture close-up photos. \nCatholic Online is raising alarm that western nations are providing \nsupport to the rebels who have shown a proclivity toward persecuting \nChristians: \"This should make it clear to Christians around the world \nwhat jihadists are about. Make no mistake. Catholics and [other] \nChristians around the globe are under dire threat, particularly from \nthe spread of militant Islam.

    "words": "China Clamps Down on Families Who Rescue Abandoned Babies \u0014\n\u0014\n(WNS) -- Orphaned children hold on to their toys at the Bethel foster \nhome for the care and education of blind and disabled children in Lan \nFang, China.\u0014\n\u0014\nChina has banned groups and individuals from privately adopting \nabandoned infants, making it much harder for babies without families \nto find good homes. The country's Ministry of Civil Affairs announced \nTuesday that people who find an abandoned child must immediately tell \nlocal residential committees and the police and not adopt the child \nat will.\u0014\n\u0014\nTens of thousands of infants are abandoned each year in China due \nprimarily to its strict one-child policy, which limits most urban \ncouples to one child and rural couples to two. A traditional \npreference for male heirs leads many families to abandon the girls \nand disabled children that have not been aborted, hoping to have a \nboy. Poverty and the social stigma for unwed mothers are also factors.\u0014\n\u0014\nChina's adoption law forbids baby trafficking, including in the name \nof adoption, but did not specify whether individuals could keep \nabandoned babies. The new rules that forbid keeping such babies are \noutlined in a document from several government departments that was \nposted on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' website.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new rules mean people who want to adopt Chinese children \ndomestically must meet the requirements leveled under official \nchannels, including being healthy, over 30, and childless.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who use abandoned children for illegal and profitable ends \nwill be severely punished, the rules say, without specifying what \nthat entails.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe document also sets out measures police should take when an \nabandoned baby is found, requiring them to try to find the parents or \nguardians. The police are to transfer children to a \ngovernment-sanctioned nursing home for temporary care. The homes only \ntake the children under official care if no guardian is found within \na certain period.\u0014\n\u0014\nChina's chronically underfunded state orphanage system has been \nunable to adequately provide shelter for many of the children who \nhave been abandoned. Often, such services have been left to private \ncitizens with few resources and no legal authority. In January, the \nissue was highlighted when a fire at an illegally run orphanage \nkilled six children and one young adult.\u0014\n\u0014\nZhou Xiaozheng of Renmin University's School of Society and \nPopulation Studies said around 200,000 babies are abandoned in China \neach year, mostly girls whose parents wanted to try again for a boy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's good for the government to strengthen its management of \nabandoned children, but it will also bring revenue to the government \nbecause any potential adopters must pay a handsome adoption fee, \nZhou said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the revenue will only come if families are willing to pay the fee \nto adopt. In a country where thousands of children are orphaned, some \nquestion whether making the process more difficult and expensive is \ngoing to remedy the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nc. 2013 WORLD News Service.

A nineteenth-century \nsociety woman has come to the monastery to talk with Father Zosima, \nwho has encouraged her to do acts of love. She tells him about her \nlifelong dream to give up everything and become a hospital nurse:\u0014\n\u0014\nI close my eyes and let my imagination wander, and during those \nminutes I feel an irresistible strength within me. No wounds, no \ninfected sores, however terrible, could frighten me away then. I \nwould clean them with my own hands. I would look after those \nsufferers. I would be ready to kiss their sores....\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then she has second thoughts about such a life of service:\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, but how long do you think I could live such a life? ... What if \na patient, whose sores you were cleaning, instead of being grateful \nto you, tormented you with his whims and had no appreciation \nwhatsoever for your services to mankind, talked rudely to you, or \neven complained about you to your superiors, as people who are in \npain so often do? What would happen then? Would you go on loving him \nor not? And I must tell you that, to my own dismay, I have come to \nthis conclusion: if anything could dampen my \"active love\" for \nmankind, it is ingratitude. In other words, I'm willing to work if \nI'm paid for it. But I want to be paid at once. I mean I want to be \npraised and paid for love with love.

They love their churches and the members. The metaphor of \nshepherd is truly appropriate for these pastors. They care deeply \nfor those they serve. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. They work hard. The typical workweek of these pastors is about 60 \nhours, a number I hope to verify in a future poll. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. Many are hurting from conflict and hurtful church members. Noted \none pastor, I hate that I find myself running from her, but every \ntime I see her she blasts me! \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Most would like more practical training. This quote was a common \ntheme: I feel prepared to study the Bible and theology; but I am \nstill ill-prepared to deal with leadership issues, money, and \nstrategies. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Many are struggling financially. They are struggling with their \nown personal finances; and they are struggling to understand church \nfinances.\u0014\n \u0014\n7. They are challenged greatly by the pace of change in culture. Some \nof the older pastors (50 and up) particularly lament how different \nthe world and serving the church is today than just a decade ago. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. They are stressed for time. Sixty hours a week, noted above, is \nnot sufficient time to meet all the demands upon them. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. Many have struggling families. This comment came on another post \nas I was preparing this post: I have pastored my church for 13 years \nnow, and I am looking for a secular job. My kids have abandoned the \nchurch as they became adults as I have fought a small group of power \npeddlers the entire time. I am tired of seeing my family treated as \nhired help and employees not to mention myself. I will never leave \nthe ministry. I know more than ever God has called me to the \nministry. I will always serve Him in whatever capacity I am in. I \nlove preaching and will continue to do so as the opportunity arises. \nBut I just cant deal with this situation any longer. \u0014\n\u0014\n10.Some pastors are experiencing true depression. \u0014\n\u0014\nTom Rainer, Lifeway\u0014",

    "words": "Lifetime of love: Couple married 75 years die \na day apart\u0014\n\u0014\nRebecca Ruiz TODAY contributor   7/30/13\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Les and Helen Brown became high school sweethearts more than 75 \nyears ago, their parents didnt believe the match would last.\u0014\n\u0014\nLes father was a businessman and prosperous landowner in Southern \nCalifornia. Helens father worked on the railroad. Both families \nwere not too thrilled about the union, their son Les Brown Jr. told \nTODAY.com. The good news is they proved them wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\nLes and Helen, who were born on the same day in 1918, celebrated 75 \nyears of marriage in September with a quiet gathering over cake. \nThey really enjoyed each others company, Les Jr. said. They were \nreally inseparable and were never apart. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat bond was so strong that neither Les nor Helen wanted to live \nwithout each other, though they knew that the end might be imminent. \nLes had been sick with Parkinsons disease for some time, and Helen \nwas battling stomach cancer. \u0014\n\u0014\nLes recently slipped into a coma at the couples Long Beach, Calif., \nhome, and hospice workers said he might live for just a few more \ndays. Helen, who was expected to survive for some months, became very \nweak. She passed away on July 16. Les died the following day  he \nnever knew about his wifes death. They were 94 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nLes and Helens love story, first reported by the Long Beach \nPress-Telegram, has since gone viral. Their son Daniel told TODAY.com \nthat his parents wouldnt have shared the same opinion of the ensuing \nattention.\u0014\n\u0014\nMom hated notoriety. I dont think she would have enjoyed it, he \nsaid. His father, though, was a photographer and perhaps had an \nappreciation for a warmhearted story. He would have loved it. \u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel said such differences are what made his parents so well \nmatched. Helen was very sweet but particular about how things should \nbe done. Les, on the other hand, was easygoing, a man of simple \npleasures who loved coffee and donuts. Helen kept the family humming \nalong while Les helped her relax when life became hectic or \ncomplicated. What one lacked, the other made up for, Daniel said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple loved to travel and often took road trips up the \nCalifornia coast to San Francisco and Monterey. They doted on their \nmany grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They also shared a deep \nreligious faith as Jehovahs Witnesses, which helped them weather a \ndifficult period of their marriage in the 1950s. They were very \nforgiving of each others foibles and weaknesses. They were so \nwilling to work at making themselves happy.\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel said that their marriage was a testament to the power of love: \nIt knows no barriers and seems to know no bounds. They were from \ndifferent sides of the tracks and it didnt seem to matter to them. \nAfter 78 years, they were very much in love.\u0014",

She was murdered when she tried to sound an alarm. Witnesses \nsaid she suffered multiple stab wounds to her torso and was strangled \nwith her own sari. The following morning, the child's cries were \nheard by her grandmother, who found her daughter-in-law's body and \ncalled the police. Two suspects, both Hindus, were arrested, but have \nboth been released and it is unclear whether they will face further \nofficial charges. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe local Christian community has been shocked by the event and \nexpressed concerns about its vulnerability to local authorities. It \nis uncertain whether the attack took place because of the woman's \nfaith, but Christian women often report threats in the area. \nChristians comprise a tiny fraction of the population of Madhya \nPradesh (0.3 percent) and just 2.3 percent of the total population of \nIndia.

Carri \nWilliams was also found guilty of homicide by abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHana Williams was found dead May 12, 2011, in the backyard of the \nfamily home in Sedro-Woolley, about 60 miles north of Seattle. The \nautopsy said she died of hypothermia, with malnutrition and a stomach \ncondition as contributing factors.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarri Williams was sentenced Tuesday to just under 37 years, the top \nof the standard sentencing range, by Judge Susan Cook who said she \nprobably deserved more time in prison, the Skagit Valley Herald \nreported. Her husband received a sentence of nearly 28 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nCook vacated Carri Williams' manslaughter conviction because she was \nconvicted of homicide by abuse for the same conduct.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth also were found guilty of assault of a child for punishing a boy \nthey adopted in 2008 from Ethiopia at the same time as Hana.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth appeared in court in red jail uniforms and were led away in \nhandcuffs after the sentencing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe courtroom was filled with many Ethiopians and nine of the jurors \nwho convicted Larry and Carri Williams after a seven-week trial. \nDefense lawyers told jurors that questionable parenting practices \ndidn't necessarily amount to a crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the rainy night Hana died, Carri Williams called emergency \nservices and reported Hana was not breathing, saying the girl had \nrefused to come into the house.

    "words": "Christmas Truce Reflects Humanity at Its Best\u0014\nBy: Seth VopatPosted: Monday, December 2, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nA century has almost passed, but it is perhaps one of the most \nremarkable events to ever occur amid so much hatred and animosity. \nThe significance of the event can only be stated in terms of the \nmiraculous. \u0014\n \u0014\nAll of Europe had been swept up into World War I in the summer  a \nconflict that at one time was thought to be the \"war to end all \nwars.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFrance, along with its allies, was in a stalemate with Germany and \nits allies. \u0014\n\u0014\nA war some thought would be over in a matter of months would turn \ninto years, as each side began digging in, creating mile after mile \nof muddy, disease-ridden trenches. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn between these trenches were some of the most desolate, barren and \nhopeless ground ever scorched by the drums of war. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be caught in this \"no man's land\" was an automatic death sentence. \nAnd yet, this barren wasteland would become one of the most \nincredible stories of hope that humanity has ever witnessed. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one knows for sure how it all started. But, as the legend goes, on \nthe eve of Christmas 1914, the carol \"Silent Night\" was sung. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy morning, those who had been shooting at each other the day before \nwere in the middle of \"no man's land\" sharing photos, playing soccer \nand celebrating Christmas. \u0014\n\u0014\nA truce between the French and Germans was called, at least for a \nday. This truly amazing event, which seems almost too good to be \ntrue, is often heralded as a triumph of the Christmas spirit. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvents such as this that point to the eschatological hope found in \npassages like Isaiah 2:4, Joel 3:10 and Micah 4:3. The day when \nswords are no longer needed and are beaten into plowshares. \u0014\n\u0014\nA dream of peace and joy for everyone. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the very best of what we celebrate during Advent as we await \nthe birth of a baby in a manger. \u0014\n\u0014\nI love to read stories about remarkable moments in history where, for \nhowever brief a time, humanity chooses to see the best in each other \ninstead of the worst. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet I wonder if we should read these stories not only for the hope \noffered, but also for the caution provided. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis truce on Christmas was remarkable, but at the same time \ninimitable, as the war would drag on for several more years. The \ntruce only lasted one day. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdvent is a beautiful time in the Christian year to celebrate and \nrejoice. At the same time, it's a fragile beauty that culminates in \nthe hope of a baby born in a manger. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are no assurances and annuities to fall back on. No guarantees \nthat come from being born to a powerful political family. At any \nmoment, hope could be wiped out, as King Herod tried to do. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hope and promise Advent anticipates cannot be taken for granted. \nThey have to be nurtured and cultivated if they are to endure in \ntimes of uncertainty. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor me personally, this is why the Christian calendar has become \nessential to my own faith walk. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot because I want to protest and show I am defiant to the world \naround me. Rather, I lean into the rhythms of the calendar because I \nfind it is the best way to nourish my spirit as I strive to see and \nseek the best in humanity instead of becoming cynical as I experience \nand see the worst. \u0014\n\u0014\nI imagine this is what makes the difference between my reading \nstories like this truce on Christmas, thinking they are myths and \nbelieving it is possible for us to rise above our hatred. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is what allows me to continue to hope for the day when swords \nand spears are no longer needed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the hope I nourish during Advent and celebrate on Christmas \nmorning, which the Scottish poet Frederick Niven captured so well: \u0014\n\u0014\nO ye who read this truthful rime \u0014\nFrom Flanders, kneel and say: \u0014\nGod speed the time when every day\u0014\nShall be as Christmas Day.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSeth M.

    "title": "CAPTURED WORLD WAR II SOLDIER LEARNED TO FORGIVE",
    "words": "Captured World War II Soldier Learned to ForgiveBy: Leroy Seat\u0014\nPosted: Friday, December 6, 2013 EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA year ago at this time, I wrote about \"God's Samurai.\" That was what \nCapt. Mitsuo Fuchida, the lead pilot of the Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor, was called after he later became a Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis column is more about that same story, but it centers on Jacob \nDeShazer, a member of the U.S. Army Air Corps on that fateful day of \nDec. 7, 1941.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeShazer, born in Oregon in 1912, enlisted in the Air Corps in 1940 \nand rose to the rank of sergeant in 1941.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was stationed in Washington at the time of the Pearl Harbor \nattack, but shortly thereafter he, along with other members of the \n17th Bomb Group, volunteered to join a special unit that was formed \nto attack Japan.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat group soon acquired the name \"Doolittle's Raiders\" after their \nfamous commander, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn April 1942, DeShazer and his fellow crew members were forced to \nparachute into enemy territory when their B-25 ran out of fuel.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was captured the very next day by Japanese soldiers and \nconsequently spent some 40 months in prisoner-of-war camps (both in \nJapan and China)  and 34 of those months in solitary confinement.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his long, painful ordeal as a prisoner, in May 1944 he was \nable to get a copy of the Bible. Reading it brought about a great \nchange in his way of thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the war in August 1945, DeShazer was freed and able to \ngo back to the U.S. He soon decided that he wanted to go into \nmissionary work; he began to prepare for that ministry at Seattle \nPacific College.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this time, he wrote a short account of his experiences, \ncalling it \"I Was a Prisoner of Japan.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDeShazer's story was printed as a Christian tract, and more than a \nmillion copies of his testimony were distributed to the Japanese \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a copy of DeShazer's tract that Timothy Pietsch gave to Capt. \nFuchida that eventually led to his becoming a Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I wrote last year, Pietsch was the son-in-law of C. K. Dozier, \nfounder of Seinan Gakuin, the school complex where I taught in Japan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn May of this year, I heard this story directly from Pietsch's son, \nKelsey, who was visiting Seinan Gakuin at the same time I was.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"From Pearl Harbor to Calvary\" is the title of the English \ntranslation of Fuchida's autobiography.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlorence DeShazer wrote the introduction and refers to her husband as \nJake. Florence concludes: \"The autobiography that follows tells the \nfull story of my husband's dear friend, Mr. Mitsuo Fuchida, a man \nwho, like Jake, was completely transformed by the Lord and preached \nand lived a message of forgiveness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book, Fuchida tells that after he finished reading DeShazer's \nstory, he thought, \"If a Bible could change his life, it might change \nmine.\" So the next day, he bought a Bible and began reading it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Fuchida then read about the crucifixion of Jesus, he realized \nthere was \"the source of this miracle of love that can forgive \nenemies!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Forgiving Everything\" is the subtitle of the story of DeShazer as \ntold by Ace Collins in his book, \"Stories Behind Men of Faith.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe is also the subject of a children's book written by Janet and \nGeoff Benge and published with the subtitle \"Forgive Your Enemies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDeShazer lived to be 95 years old, passing away in March 2008. His \nlong life of loving and forgiving is worth considering well as we \nonce again recall the tragic events of 12/7/41.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat was a missionary to Japan from 1966-2004 and is both \nprofessor emeritus of Seinan Gakuin University and pastor emeritus of \nFukuoka International Church\u0014\n-\u0014",

    "words": "C.S. Lewis on Christmas\u0014\nLewis summed up Christmas in one sentence: 'The Son of God became a \nman to enable men to become the sons of God.'\u0014\n\u0014\nKathryn Lindskoog      December 1, 1999  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nOur earliest description of Christmas from C.S. Lewis is a bitter \none. The year was 1922. As usual, C.S. Lewis and his brother Warren \nspent the holidays with their widowed father in his big house outside \nBelfast.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was a dark morning with a gale blowing and some very cold rain,\" \nLewis reported in his diary. Their father Albert awakened his two \nsons, both in their midtwenties, to go to early Communion service. As \nthey walked to church in the dawn light, they started discussing the \ntime of sunrise. Albert irritated his sons by insisting that the sun \nhad already risen or else they would not have any light. He was an \nillogical and argumentative man.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Mark's church was intensely cold. Warren wanted to keep his \ncoat on during the service, and his father disapproved. \"Well, at \nleast you won't keep it on when you go up to the Table,\" Albert \nwarned. Warren asked why not and was told that taking Communion with \na coat on was \"most disrespectful.\" Warren took his coat off to avoid \nan argument. Not one of the three Lewis men had any interest in the \nmeaning of Communion. The two sons hadn't believed in Christianity \nfor years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Christmas dinner, a rather deplorable ceremony, at quarter to four, \nLewis continued in his diary. After dinner the rain had stopped at \nlast, and Albert urged his two sons to take a walk. They were \ndelighted to get out into the fresh air and head for a pub where they \ncould get a drink. Before they came to the pub, however, some \nrelatives drove by on the way to their house for a visit and gave \nthem an unwelcome ride right back home.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter too much sitting and talking and eating and smoking all day in \nthe stuffy house, Lewis went to bed early, dead tired and headachy. \nHe felt like a flabby, lazy teenager again. It had been another bad \nChristmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1929 Albert Lewis suddenly died of cancer. There would be no more \ncoming home for Christmas. Within a couple of years of their father's \ndeath, both Warren and C.S. Lewis privately made some major shifts in \ntheir ideas about religion. They were separately moving toward \nChristian faith.\u0014\nFor full article, see Word\\My Documents\\C. S. Lewis on Christmas\u0014",

They \nsought genetic counseling in the matter as Brocks cousin was born \nwith a chromosomal disorder.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Rhea became pregnant, Valley Medical Center in Renton sent \ntests to LabCorp in North Carolina to determine whether the child had \nany abnormalities. As the tests came back normal, the family was \nassured that the baby was fine.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when Rhea gave birth in July 2008, it was discovered that \nthe infant had unbalanced chromosomal translocation. The Wuths then \nfiled suit against Valley Medical Center and LabCorp in 2010, \nadvising that had they known that the childa boy, who they named \nOliverhad defects, they would have sought an abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Times-News, attorney Todd Gardner cited the birth of \nthe baby and the care that he now requireslikely for the rest of his \nlifeas damages that required compensation. He asserted that Valley \nMedical Center had failed to inform LabCorp of all of the pertinent \ninformation, including that Brock Wuth carried a genetic abnormality \nfrom his family history. Gardner also blamed LabCorp for not \nfollowing up with the Medical Center when it did not provide details \non where to look for the possible defect.\u0014\n\u0014\nValley messed it up at the beginning; Lab Corp. should have got it. \nThey both failed, he told local television station KOMO. You have a \ndisaster.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this month, a jury selected by the King County Superior Court \nagreed with Gardner and the Wuths, and awarded the Wuths $50 \nmillion$25 million to the couple and $25 million to Oliver.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian News\u0014",

    "words": "Henry Alford - Author of Thanksgiving Hymn \"Come Ye Thankful People \nCome\"\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn November 18, 1827, sixteen-year-old Henry Alford wrote in his \nBible: \"I do this day, as in the presence of God and my own soul, \nrenew my covenant with God, and solemnly determine henceforth to \nbecome His, and to do His work as far as in me lies.\" The rest of his \nlife, this serious and holy young man showed that he meant what he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt college, he chummed with the noblest men of his day, among them \nAlfred Lord Tennyson. One of the deans said, \"I really think he was \nmorally the bravest man I ever knew. His perfect purity of mind and \nsingleness of purpose, seemed to give him a confidence and \nunobtrusive self-respect which never failed him.\" Rejecting \nparticipation in the sins that were so common among young men at \nCambridge, he became an outstanding scholar. It did not go to his \nhead. For example, he wrote in his journal, \"I went up to town and \nreceived the Holy Orders of a Priest; may I be a temple of chastity \nand holiness, fit and clean to receive so great a guest; and, on so \ngreat a commission as I have now received, O my beloved Redeemer, my \ndear Brother and Master, hear my prayer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the person in the pew, Henry Alford is best known as the author of \nthe Thanksgiving hymn \"Come Ye Thankful People Come.\" Among scholars, \nhe is better known for his commentary on the Greek New Testament, on \nwhich he labored for eighteen years. He did much of this work while \ncarrying on the duties of a vicar to the small parish of Wymeswold. \nIt had been neglected and he rebuilt it, visiting every soul in his \nkeeping. One of his major undertakings was a series of Sunday \nafternoon sermons in which he taught through books of the Bible, \nexplaining their meaning. He had a knack for explaining things in a \nway the simple people could understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, explaining that Paul expected Christ to return in his \nown lifetime, he wrote, \"Nor need it surprise any Christian that the \napostles should in this matter of detail have found their personal \nexpectation liable to disappointment respecting a day of which it is \nso solemnly said that no man knoweth its appointed time, not the \nangels in heaven, not the Son, but the Father only (Mark xiii. 32).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter many years of hard work, chiefly at Wymeswold, he accepted a \nposition at Canterbury Cathedral that allowed him more time to write. \nAt Canterbury, he began a series of Sunday afternoon services as he \nhad done at Wymeswold. Again these attracted large crowds. His \npreaching was evangelical. Formal church leaders considered him a bit \nradical but his good humor and friendliness won their affection. He \nwas notable for being able to see the best points in all Christian \npositions, however much he might disagree with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry died rather unexpectedly in 1871. In addition to Bible work and \nhymns, he edited the poems of John Donne and translated Homer's \nOdyssey.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nAlford, Henry.

    "title": "CONSTANTINE: CHRISTIAN OR OPPORTUNIST",
    "words": "The Birth of Christendom \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of his (Constantine's) first acts was to draft a proclamation \nthat ended official persecution of Christians. Called the Edict of \nMilan, it placed Christianity on a par with the other faiths that \nenjoyed freedom under Rome, in order \"that we may not seem to detract \nfrom any dignity or any religion.\" For the first time since the year \n64, when the emperor Nero declared war on the Christians of Rome, and \nburned them as human torches in his garden, they had reason for hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe full notion of Christendom--a political world entirely dominated \nby Christianity--was slow to take shape, however. Not until after \n380, under the emperors Theodosius I in the East and Gratian in the \nWest, would pagan temples be forcibly closed, and all Roman subjects \nrequired to become Christian. Nonetheless, Constantine gradually \ninfused his empire's legal structure with significant Christian \nvalues. He made Sunday an official day of rest. New laws forbade the \npractice of divination and other magic. Confiscated Christian \nproperties were restored. Magnificent churches rose in all major \ncities. He moved the imperial capital from pagan Rome to a new site, \nspecifically built as a Christian city and named Constantinople \n(today, Istanbul). Christian clergy administered an imperial welfare \nprogram. In time, the emperor ceased paying the traditional homage to \nJupiter on Rome's Capitoline Hill. Coins no longer bore images of \npagan deities.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, state and church were inescapably fusing. Constantine held \nthe title Pontifex Maximus, highest priest, with the duty of \noverseeing religion in the empire. After 313, he promoted \nChristianity as the favored faith of the empire. Although he was \nunbaptized and had little patience with theological wrangling, he \nassumed the authority to arbitrate church disputes. Thus he presided \nover the crucial council at Nicea that formally declared the divinity \nof Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Conundrum \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy then do historians question his genuine Christian commitment? \nCould it be his actions toward his family? When informed that his \nbeloved eldest son Crispus was plotting against him, Constantine flew \ninto a towering rage and had the young man executed. He later \ndiscovered that the \"evidence\" was completely fabricated. Soon after, \nhe had his second wife, Fausta, put to death. Such conduct may be \nfine for pagan emperors, his detractors note, but hardly for a \nChristian.\u0014\nThe twentieth-century Christian essayist Dorothy L. Sayers offers a \nfascinating explanation for this puzzling emperor. Piecing the clues \ntogether in her play, Constantine, she theorizes that Fausta, seeking \nto secure the succession for her own son, had convincingly framed \nCrispus. She was then exposed, and summarily executed. The play \ndepicts a despairing Constantine writhing with guilt on his own \ndeathbed. The wrongful execution of his cherished and loyal Crispus \nwas the ultimate evil, he mourns. Nothing and no one could possibly \natone for such a sin.\u0014\nSuddenly the light dawns. This, he realizes, is what those \ntheologians at Nicea had been arguing about! It was true enough--no \nman could atone for him. But God his creator, God become man in the \nperson of Jesus Christ, could indeed do so. At last, Constantine \nfully grasps the meaning of that Christian term, \"the Gospel.\" This \nindeed is \"the Good News!\" With that, he is baptized. He dies a few \ndays later.\u0014\nWhen religion is despised, great dangers are brought upon public \naffairs; but when legally adopted and observed, it affords the most \nsignal prosperity to the Roman name, and remarkable felicity to all \nthe affairs of men. -- Constantine\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/Constantine\u0014",

    "words": "Cohabitation Is \nnot Like a Test Drive\u0014\n\u0014\nTThe Census reports a 72 percent increase in the number of cohabiting \ncouples since 1990. For many people in our culture, living together \nbefore marriage has been compared to taking a car for a test drive. \nThe \"trial period\" gives people a chance to discover whether they are \ncompatible. After all, the argument goes, you wouldn't buy a car \nbefore taking it for a test drive?\u0014\n\u0014\nYet here's the implication of the \"test drive\" metaphor: I am going \nto drive you around the block a few times, withholding judgment and \ncommitment until I have satisfied myself about you. Pay no attention \nto my indecision, or my periodic evaluations of your performance. Try \nto act as if we were married, so I can get a clear picture of what \nyou're likely to be like as a spouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, research shows that this test drive approach isn't \njust an equal alternative to marriage. Cohabiting couples report \nlower levels of satisfaction in the relationship than married \ncouples. Studies have shown that cohabitation is correlated with \nunhappiness and domestic violence. And if a cohabiting couple \nultimately marries, they have a higher propensity to divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo here's the problem with the car analogy: the car doesn't have hurt \nfeelings if the driver dumps it back at the used car lot and decides \nnot to buy it. The analogy works great if you picture yourself as the \ndriver. It stinks if you picture yourself as the car.\u0014\n\u0014\nJennifer Roback Morse, \"Why not Take Her for a Test Drive,\" Boundless \n(12-19-12)\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTIAN MASTERS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARD SLAVES",
    "words": "According to John Bragg, a Virginia minister, slave owners agreed \nthat conversion would result in the slaves \"being and becoming worse \nslaves when Christians.\" Some even believed \"A slave is ten times \nworse when a Christian than in his state of paganism.\"\u0014\n........\u0014\nIn 1829, the South Carolina Methodist Conference appointed William \nCapers to superintend a special department for plantation \nmissionsthe first official and concerted effort of the sort. Four \nyears later, Charles Jones began a ministry to evangelize slaves and \nto convince others to do likewise.\u0014\nJones, called \"the apostle to the negro slaves\" was, in fact, a slave \nowner. He came from a distinguished Georgia family and eventually \nowned three plantations and 129 slaves. A man with one compassionate \neye and another fierce with purpose, Jones urged his southern \nbrethren to \"look to home\" first. \"The religious instruction of our \nservants is a duty,\" he wrote in 1834. \"Any man with a conscience may \nbe made to feel it.\"\u0014\n..........\u0014\nThe gospel presented to slaves by white owners, however, was only a \npartial gospel. The message of salvation by grace, the joy of faith, \nand the hope of heaven were all there, but many other teachings were \nmissing.\u0014\nHouse servants often laughed among themselves when summoned to family \nprayers because the master or mistress would read, \"Servants obey \nyour masters,\" but neglect passages that said, \"Break every yoke and \nlet the oppressed go free.\" \u0014\n......\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if you do the least thing in the world they [the owners] don't \nlike; they will mark it down against you, and Monday you have got to \ntake a whipping.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome didn't wait until Monday. One slave reported that his master \nserved him Communion at church in the morning and whipped him in the \nafternoon for returning to the plantation a few minutes late. Susan \nBoggs recalled the day of her baptism: \"The man that baptized me had \na colored woman tied up in his yard to whip when he got home.  We \nhad to sit and hear him preach, and [the woman's] mother was in \nchurch hearing him preach.\"\u0014\n..........\u0014\n\u0014\nBut blacks were also bolstered by their trust in a coming judgment at \nwhich slaveholders would receive recompense. Moses Grandy remembered \nhow during violent thunderstorms whites hid between their feather \nbeds, whereas slaves went outside and, lifting up their hands, \nthanked God that judgment day was coming at last.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was, in the end, a confidence in a God who would set things right, \neither in this age or in the age to come. At age 90, Jane Simpson \nrecalled, \"I used to hear old slaves pray and ask God when would de \nbottom rail be de top rail, and I wondered what on earth, dey talkin' \nabout. Dey was talkin' about when dey goin' to get from under \nbondage. 'Course I know now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article,see: Word/The Inconceivable Start of \nAfrican-American Christianity  byMark Galli\u0014",

    "title": "CONRAD GREBEL DREW CROWDS IN ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",
    "words": "When Conrad Grebel arrived at St. Gall Switzerland, on this day March \n25, 1525, he began to speak on the need for repentance and baptism. \nHundreds turned out to hear him preach and over the next few months, \nhe baptized five hundred. What was significant about this was that \nmost of them had already been baptized as infants.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrebel was in exile from Zurich. Well-educated, he had studied the \nBible with Uhlrich Zwingli, the reformer of Zurich, and stood by him \nas he made changes in the city. However, Grebel thought that Zwingli \nmoved too slow in implementing reforms based on the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Conrad Grebel became convinced from Scripture that infant baptism \nwas wrong. In order to exercise faith, a person had to be old enough \nto understand the Gospel. Baptism could only have meaning for a \nperson who understood why he or she was being baptized. Those who \nthought this way were called Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli and Grebel held public debates on the issue, but Zwingli \nstuck with infant baptism and so did Zurich. Consequently, Conrad \nGrebel and a number of others decided to obey their consciences. \nGrebel is often called the \"Father of the Anabaptists\" because on \nJanuary 21, 1525, he re-baptized George Blaurock, a former priest. It \nwas the first such adult baptism in Zurich.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately the Zurich authorities forbade the Anabaptists to speak \nabout their beliefs on adult baptism. Shortly afterward, they drove \nthe Anabaptists out. Soon they would be killing them, often by \ndrowning. Grebel went to St. Gall, where he found immediate success.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventh months later, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life in \nprison. Friends helped him escape, but his life was destined to be \nshort all the same. He could not outrun the plague, which carried him \noff less than two years after he baptized George Blaurock. He was \nonly about 29 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Conrad Grebel left few writings, he left many converts. A \ncollege in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is named for Conrad Grebel. It \nwas founded by Mennonites--spiritual offspring of the early \nAnabaptist reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBautz, Friedrich William. \"Grebel, Konrad.\" \n(http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/g/grebel_k.shtml).\u0014\nBender, Harold S.

    "title": "CAIN'S WIFE -- A FUNDAMENTALIST VIEW",
    "words": "\"Where did Cain get his wife?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThis question has been asked over a period of many years \u0014\nand for a variety of reasons. The answer really is quite sim- \u0014\nple. Cain married one of his sisters. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage between brothers and sisters is not practiced in \u0014\nour society and there is a good reason for this. Undesirable \u0014\nhereditary traits tend to be \"recessives.\" This means that in \u0014\norder to be manifest, hereditary factors for these traits must \u0014\nbe received from both parents. Since closely related persons \u0014\nare more likely to be carrying the same hereditary factors, \u0014\nclose marriages tend to bring out undesirable characteristics. \u0014\nBut in the beginning, God created everything good. There is \u0014\nno reason to believe that the first parents had undesirable \u0014\nhereditary factors to transmit to their children, and hence \u0014\nbrother-sister marriages would not be detrimental. \u0014\n\u0014\nUndesirable hereditary factors may accumulate in a popu- \u0014\nlation as time goes on, for the hereditary factors or genes may \u0014\nchange 01' mutate at any time, and nearly all mutations are \u0014\nless beneficial than the original gene. A large proportion of \u0014\nthem are strongly detrimental. The hereditary condition in \u0014\nwhich it is difficult to stop bleeding, known as hemophilia, \u0014\nhas been traced back in the royal families of Europe to \u0014\nQueen Victoria. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf highly desirable traits are found in a family and defects \u0014\ndo not occur, intermarriages will concentrate the good traits.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was considerable intermarriage in the Bach family, \u0014\nand as a result there were more musicians in that family \u0014\nthan there would have been if they had married outside the \u0014\nfamily.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Darwin family was rather much intermarried. Charles \u0014\nDarwin married his cousin, Emma Wedgewood, whose fa- \u0014\nther made the famous Wedgewood Chinaware. He had some \u0014\nreason for concern about the closeness of intermarriage in \u0014\nhis family, and he had a defective child that died young. \u0014\nBut also there were persons of outstanding ability among \u0014\nhis descendants. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was much intermarriage among the Roman Caesars \u0014\nand also considerable insanity. The Ptolemies of Egypt were \u0014\nGreeks and they practiced brother-sister marriage. The fa- \u0014\nmous Cleopatra was in this lineage. Apparently she was \u0014\nrather superior in some ways, but there were others in the \u0014\nfamily about whose deeds the general public graciously has \u0014\nbeen spared knowledge. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham married his half-sister Sarah. Isaac married Re- \u0014\nbekah, a daughter of Abraham's cousin. Their son, Jacob, mar- \u0014\nried Leah and Rachel, his cousins. From these close mar- \u0014\nriages came the Hebrew people. They were strong and vig- \u0014\norous and favored by the Lord. Many promises were made to \u0014\nthem by God. Some of these promises have been fulfilled \u0014\nand some remain to be fulfilled in the future. The most won- \u0014\nderful of these will occur when they recognize and accept \u0014\ntheir Messiah. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible says that Adam was created as an individual \u0014\nand therefore there was no mate for him. To remove any \u0014\npossible grounds for quibbling, SCripture describes how the \u0014\nfirst woman was produced from a portion of his side. For \u0014\nthose who do not accept this - and they are legion today- \u0014\nthere is no problem as to where Cain got his wife, for they \u0014\nconsider Cain to be a part of a myth. But some of them \u0014\nlike to try to embarrass believers by asking them where Cain\u0014\n. But there is no problem here for believers be- \u0014\ncause under the circumstances laid down in the Bible, the \u0014\nwife of Cain could only have been his sister. \u0014\n\u0014\nJosephus, the great historian of the Jews, wrote about \u0014\nAdam's children, His writing, of course, was not inspired and \u0014\ncame from tradition. He says that Adam \"was solicitous for \u0014\nposterity and had a vehement desire for children, . . . He \u0014\nhad many other children.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn those days people lived a long time and, no doubt, could \u0014\nproduce many children in a lifetime. The Bible tells us that \u0014\nafter the birth of Seth, Adam lived eight hundred years and \u0014\n\"begat sons and daughters\" (Gen. 5:3, 4). God gave them in- \u0014\nstructions and the ability to \"be fruitful and multiply and re- \u0014\nplenish [correctly translated fill] the earth\" (Gen. 1: 28) .\u0014\n\u0014\nTaken from \"Science and the Bible\" (1971) by Bolton Davidheiser, p. \n59-52    Purely a fundamentalist view.\u0014",

    "words": "Commencement disinvitations\u0014\nMay 17, 2014  \u0014\nPaul Greenberg\u0014\n \u0014\nLITTLE ROCK  Condoleezza Rice, our former secretary of state, is the \nlatest public figure to be chased off a university campus by the \nbullies, formally known as student protesters. She had been scheduled \nto deliver this years commencement address at Rutgers, but decided \nto call it off rather than face the mob. So she gets to join the \nranks of heroines who have been sacrificed to the type of thinkers \nwhose response to any idea they dont like is not to debate it but \ncensor it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe academy, which ought to be the last refuge of free expression, \nhas now become the first place where its shut down in 2014 America. \nThis contemporary version of the trahison des clercs, the treason of \nthe intellectuals, is now in full and odious flower on our most \nprestigious campuses. For another example, see Brandeis University. \nIt rescinded its offer of an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, \nwhose whole life has been a struggle for the values that ought to \nmark a real university. Values like respect for human dignity and the \nfree exchange of ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiographical sketch: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, born in Somalia, evaded the \nusual arranged marriage with a stranger, and began speaking out \nagainst the suppression of women in general in that traditionally \nIslamic society. She had to flee to Holland, where she was elected to \nparliament and worked with Theo van Gogh (yes, a descendant of the \nfamous painter) on Submission, a film exposing the treatment of \nwomen in Islamic societies.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheo van Goghs reward for his art and courage was to be shot down on \nthe street, and then almost decapitated by an Islamic fanatic \nwielding a butcher knife, who plunged another knife into his \nbullet-riddled body. Attached to it was a five-page screed that \nthreatened Hirsi Ali, who had to be put into police custody for her \nown protection  until the Dutch took away her safe house.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats when she fled to this country, formerly the Land of the Free \nand the Home of the Brave, became an American citizen, and continued \nto speak her mind unafraid and unintimidated. Like any true American. \nFor more details see her autobiography, Infidel.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo wonder any American university would honor the lady. But then the \nthought police went after her. Her crime? Telling some inconvenient \ntruths about Islamic societies, and Brandeis decided to rescind its \noffer of an honorary degree to someone whose honor has impressed \nfreedom-loving people everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo appreciate, and apprehend, the full extent and irony of Brandeis \ncapitulation to the worst sort of intellectuals on American \ncampuses, it might help to recall whom that university was named for, \nand when and why it was founded. Louis Dembitz Brandeis was a \nfighting lawyer and visionary advocate of human rights out of \nLouisville, Ky., who gave his name to a reliance on facts and \nstatistics in legal argument: the Brandeis Brief. He would go on to \nbe appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States by Woodrow \nWilson, and become one of the great justices in modern American \nhistory thanks to his combination of eloquence, logic and \nindependence.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Mr. Justice Brandeis joined both the courts \nconservatives and liberals when, in a unanimous decision, all of \nthem, from left to right, struck down the National Industrial \nRecovery Act as unconstitutional in 1935. By then the National \nRecovery Administrations ubiquitous Blue Eagle had become the symbol \nof the New Deals ambitious attempt to remake the American economy in \nthe image of Mussolinis corporate state, complete with price-fixing \ntrusts for every industry and trade. Thats right: for every sector \nof the American economy. Not just medical care, which is what \nObamacare has set out to take over.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it was only natural that, in the post-World War II years, when a \nnew, instantly great university was founded by largely Jewish donors, \nthat it would be named for Brandeis, for its founders had finally \ngrown tired of watching the Ivy League set quotas on Jewish \nadmissions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now that same university has caved in to the kind of intimidation \nBrandeis fought all his life. An honorable historian and once proud \nBrandeis alumnus, Jeffrey Herf, wrote an open letter in response to \nits presidents cowardice and appeasement in snubbing Hirsi Ali, \nanother great crusader for human rights. Its a letter worth quoting \non this sordid occasion:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat the president of a university founded by Jews in the immediate \naftermath of the Holocaust should have rescinded an honor to a woman \nwho has had the courage to attack the most important source of \nJew-hatred in the world today is a disgraceful act and a failure of \nleadership. To say the least.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of suppression of any idea that doesnt fit into todays \nlockstep liberalism is all too typical of an attitude that isnt \nliberal at all. No wonder those intent on foisting their own \nprejudices on the rest of us would prefer some other name to go under \n like progressives. Although theres a better, simpler name for them \nthat might sum up their whole approach to the issues of the day: the \nilliberals.\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Paul Greenberg at pgreenberg@arkansasonline.com.  2014, \nTribune Content Agency, LLC\u0014",

His sentencing hearing \nis set for Aug. 14.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn emotional testimony that began Monday, the victims recounted how \nMorales used his position as a trusted member of Covenant Life Church \nin Gaithersburg, Md., to get them alone and force them into unwanted \nsexual relationships. According to WJLA, the ABC affiliate in \nArlington, Va., Morales led Bible studies, directed worship teams, \nand attended sleepovers with teen boys he was supposed to be \nmentoring.\u0014\n\u0014\nChild advocacy groups said the pastoral team at Covenant Life helped \nenable Morales abuse by not reporting allegations to the police in \nthe mid 1990s. Morales disappeared shortly after his victims told \ntheir parents what was going on, but he later went on to work as a \npastor in Las Vegas and married a woman with five sons from a \nprevious relationship\u0014\n.\u0014\nDuring the trial, former Covenant Life pastor Grant Layman admitted \nhe should have reported what he knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you have an obligation to report the alleged abuse, public \ndefender Alan Drew, who represented Morales, asked during \ncross-examination. I believe so, Layman replied. And you didnt, \nDrew followed-up. No, Layman said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to police reports collected before the trial, Layman and \nanother pastor, Ernest Boisvert, confronted Morales at some point but \nits not clear whether they attempted to warn church members or other \ncongregations about the allegations. In a statement released last \nyear, the church said it didnt know about the abuse until many \nyears later.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil last year, Covenant Life was a member of Sovereign Grace \nMinistries, which has faced accusations of covering up child abuse in \nseveral of its member congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a statement issued after the verdict, state officials said abuse \nin the church is particularly heinous. Sexually abusing boys who \ntrust you because of your prominence in your faith community is \nunforgivable, said Ramon Korionoff, spokesman for the state \nattorneys office. These grown men have shown a lot of courage to \ncome forward in reporting these incidents of sexual abuse during \ntheir childhoods. It lets other victims of abuse in our community \nknow that they can come forward and justice will be served.\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTIAN ROCKER REVEALS HE IS AN ATHEIST",
    "words": "Christian Rocker Convicted of Murder \nPlot Reveals He Is Atheist\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NBCSanDiego.com   6/19/14\u0014\n\u0014\nThe embattled frontman of a Christian metal band sentenced to prison \nfor plotting to have his wife killed recently confessed that he and \nother band members had become atheists, but continued to pose as \nChristians so they could keep selling records, according to a report \nby The Christian Post. \u0014\n\u0014\nTim Lambesis, 33, lead singer and founder of the band As I Lay Dying, \nwas sentenced to six years behind bars on May 16 for his role in a \nmurder-for-hire plot involving his estranged then-wife, Meggan \nLambesis. Lambesis tried to hire a hitman in an attempt to have his \nwife murdered. \u0014\n\u0014\nLambesis arrest, case, trial and conviction took many of his \nfaithful fans by surprise. Many took to social media to express their \ndisbelief over the allegations and, ultimately, the singers \nsentencing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I Lay Dying frontman, Tim Lambesis, 33, was sentenced to six \nyears in prison last month for his role in a murder-for-hire plot \ninvolving his estranged then-wife. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut according to the Christian Post's report, those fans may have had \nmore faith in Lambesis than he did in the Christian religion, citing \nwhat Lambesis said during an extensive interview with Alternative \nPress conducted shortly before his sentencing. \u0014\nIn that interview, Lambesis talked about a YouTube video he made \nabout a month before his arrest in which he addressed fans who felt \nhis new side project, Pyrithion was satanic. \u0014\n\u0014\nLambesis admitted that at the time, he never really gave a straight \nanswer as to whether he was still Christian. He said he was afraid of \nrevealing his true beliefs about God, or lack thereof, because he \ndidnt want to impact his bands record sales, so he chose to say \nIm not a satanist instead. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as the [YouTube] video I did explaining 'Pyrithion''s lyrics \nI was trying to put out a fire. I was afraid it would affect As I Lay \nDying sales, which would affect my overall income. I was trying to \nput out the fire by saying the easiest thing, 'I'm not a satanist!'\" \nhe explained in the Alternative Press interview. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Truthfully, I was an atheist. The 'strategy' I had at the time was \ncowardly. Two of the songs on that record were about coming to grips \nwith the idea that life has no purpose, no meaning. These were \nnegative themes I wasn't 'allowed' to deal with in As I Lay Dying \nsongs. I thought making As I Lay Dying darker would be bad for my \ncareer. That was my thinking,\" he continued. \u0014\n\u0014\nLambesis went on to say that many of the Christian bands he had \ntoured with over the years had a similar stance and werent exactly \ndevout Christians either. He said a few of his fellow As I Lay Dying \nband members were also no longer Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a while, the charade became awkward, he said, like the time \nwhen an interviewer at a Christian festival asked one of the band \nmembers to share his testimony, but he froze on the spot. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe laughed about it afterward, but we were only laughing because it \nwas so awkward,\" said Lambesis in the interview. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When kids would want to pray with us after shows, I'd be like, 'Um, \ngo ahead and pray!' I would just let them pray. I'd say 'Amen.' If \npraying while I have my hand on their shoulder makes them feel \nbetter, I didn't want to take that away from them. When they would \nspecifically ask me to pray for something, I'd say, 'I don't really \nlike to pray out loud, but I'll take that with me to the bus,\" the \nsinger added. \u0014\n\u0014\nLambesis shocking fall from grace began when he was arrested in May \n2013 in connection with the murder-for-hire plot. \u0014\n\u0014\nUntil that point, he had enjoyed a successful and lucrative musical \ncareer with his San Diego-based heavy metal band, which formed more \nthan a decade ago and released eight albums, including the 2007 \nGrammy-nominated \"An Ocean Between Us.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nBeside the many albums, the band was also a mainstay of the San Diego \nMusic Awards (SDMA), nominated in 2012 for Best Hard Rock Album for \n\"Decas\" and winning for Best Hard Rock the year before that. In 2005, \n2007 and 2008, the band took home the SDMA statuettes for Artist of \nthe Year.The band was slated to go on a cross-country tour with the \nMassachusetts metal band Killswitch Engage until Lambesis arrest \nlast year. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen news of his arrest broke, it perplexed members of the San Diego \nmusic community, including SoundDiego contributor Tim Pyles of FM \n94/9. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hes not the idealistic young Christian kid he once was, \napparently,\" Pyles said last spring. \"Because thats what [As I Lay \nDying] are: a straight-edged Christian metal band. He was a nice \nguy. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt his sentencing last month, the courtroom was wrought with drama as \ncharacter witnesses, including his ex-wife took to the stand to ask a \njudge to hand down the maximum sentence. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"My name used to be Meggan Lambesis. And up until two years ago, my \nheart was entirely devoted to him,\" said Meggan, who now goes by \nMeggan Murphy. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I trusted him with everything, including my life,\" she added. \"When \nthe one person who you've been most vulnerable with and the most \nintimate with, who you've entrusted with every aspect of your life, \nwho has not only desired but planned your murder -- you're left \nfeeling completely exposed and unprotected. Who can I trust now? How \ncan I feel safe? \u0014\n\u0014\nMurphy said the ordeal will haunt her for the rest of her life, \nleaving her always looking over her shoulder. She said many of his \nfans had sent her threatening messages on social media since his \narrest. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The question of who Tim talked to or will talk to will forever haunt \nme, she said in that San Diego courtroom. The scariest thing is \nTim's notoriety. He has followers that will do anything for him. It's \nterrifying to think there are people out there motivated to kill me \non his behalf.\"\u0014",

However, \nthe demolition team is usually made up of unidentified personnel, \npolice, and SWATa clear violation of procedure and the rights of the \nbelievers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is reported that over 360 churches in Zhejiang Province have been \ncompletely or partially demolished under the guise of removing or \nmodifying illegal constructions. The government of Zhejiang Province \nsays it is removing or modifying illegal buildings for urban \ndevelopment.\u0014\n\t\tConnect with Christian News \u0014\n\tICC reports, however, that the target has been religious buildings \nat the exclusion of all others, and has received a list of 15 \nchurches in Pingyang County alone that are facing cross demolition by \nthe end of this month.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tIt is widely believed that the campaign is exclusively targeting \nChristian churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe campaign has been unbridled and the government demolishes church \ncrosses recklessly, said a local church member, according to the \nrelease.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot long after the public letter was published, ICC received \ninformation that the cross of Yahui Church in Pingyang County was \nforcibly removed. The video sent to ICC from local believers shows \nthat when the cross was slowly lowered down by governments \nconstruction machine, believers burst into a tear-filled hymn, \nsinging, cross, cross, be my glory forever; all my sins have been \nwashed away by the blood of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nZhejiang provincial authorities have carefully planned and carried \nout their systematic attack against Christianity and churches. No one \nshould have their property targeted for destruction based on their \nfaith, stated Sooyoung Kim, ICCs Regional Manager for Southeast \nAsia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chinese are told they can live the Chinese Dream, but this is \nnot possible for the citizens of China when the local government \nbreaks the law with impunity. We call on the Chinese central \ngovernment to no longer turn a blind eye, and instead, to clearly \nexpress its disappointment in the local government and put a stop to \ntheir illegal activities.

    "title": "CREATION-EVOLUTION DEBATE: HUXLEY VS. WILBERFORCE",
    "words": "Creation-Evolution Debate, Huxley vs. Wilberforce\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the publication of the Origin of Species, Englishman Charles \nDarwin unloosed a storm of controversy which has not subsided to this \nday. Religion and science clashed head-on over the theory. Believers \nresented what they perceived as Darwin's attempt to rule God out of \ncreation. Many scientists resented inaccurate and closed-minded \nreactions from the religious community. Darwin had amassed an \nenormous quantity of detail which showed that micro-evolution had \noccurred--evolution within kinds. From this he conjectured that \nmacro-evolution, evolution across kinds, had taken place.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, Saturday, June 30th, 1860, six months after the \npublication of the Origin of Species, evolution was the topic of a \nmeeting of the British Association. Seven hundred people showed up. \nAn American, Dr. Draper, was to speak on the \"Intellectual \nDevelopment of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views of Mr. \nDarwin.\" He spoke for an hour, and then other speakers took off on \nthe theme. A number of churchmen were on the platform, among them \nBishop \"Soapy Sam\" Wilberforce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowd called for this popular speaker. Wilberforce, after \nattempting to defer to another speaker, rose to speak. The great \nanatomist, Sir Richard Owen, had coached him. However, Wilberforce \nwas not deeply grounded in the sciences. He castigated the theory \nwith good humor and made it appear absurd. The crowd loved it. In \nhindsight, the tactic was ill-advised. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe agnostic Thomas Huxley had been coaxed into attending the \nmeeting. Wilberforce, carried away with words, turned to Huxley with \na mocking question. Was it through his grandfather or grandmother \nthat he claimed descent from a monkey?\u0014\n\u0014\nHuxley slapped his knee and whispered a very un-agnostic comment: \n\"The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands.\" Wilberforce sat down \nto applause. The audience called on Huxley. He rose with defiance. \nExplaining Darwin's key ideas, he exposed what he claimed was \nWilberforce's ignorance and error. He would not be ashamed of a \nmonkey in his ancestry, he said. He would be ashamed to be \"connected \nwith a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.\" The crowd \napplauded. Wilberforce was humiliated. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat was over 135 years ago. The debate still goes on. And sadly \nChristians have often tried to oppose evolution without a full grasp \nof the scientific arguments that they must address and answer. But in \nrecent years even from within the scientific community new questions \nare being raised that seem to assure that the evolution debate is far \nfrom over.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDenbigh, Kenneth G.

In 1976, the \nUnited States issued a stamp commemorating the Lutheran nurse. \nLutherans honor her on this day, August 13, calling her a \"Renewer of \nSociety.\" What did she do to attain these honors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of ten children in a German immigrant family, Clara became \na caring person. She worked as a mother's helper during her high \nschool years, then in an orphanage. At seventeen, she entered the \nnewly opened Christina Trefz Training School of Nurses and was one of \nits first graduates. She must have been very good at what she did, \nfor by the age of 21, she had become the school's head nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, life held out a chance \nof even greater service to Clara. She became a contract nurse with \nthe American armies. Her competent presence was felt in Georgia, \nFlorida, Cuba, and the Philippines. She found herself fighting \nmalaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases more often than \ngunshot wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, the United States set out to find the cause of \"yellow \njack\"-- yellow fever. Clara, having nursed patients with this deadly \ndisease, and she wanted to see it overcome. She volunteered to be \npart of an experiment to understand the fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo rival theories held the field. The first considered yellow fever \nthe result of filthy conditions. The second attributed it to mosquito \nbites.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder experiments conducted by Walter Reed, a team tested both \ntheories. Men lived in filth without exposure to mosquitoes. They did \nnot contract yellow fever. Other subjects offered themselves to be \nbitten by mosquitoes. Some of them came down with fever. One of them \nwas Clara, who contracted a mild case.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas she now immune? Some thought so. Others thought the case was too \nmild to build immunity. On August 14th, 1901, Clara submitted to a \nsecond mosquito bite. Soon she had a bad case of the fever. Ten days \nlater she died. Her case clinched the matter: a mosquito was the \ncarrier of the disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Clara was buried with military honors, no fuss was made over \nher until thirty years later when another nurse stumbled across the \nfacts, researched her story and raised funds for a memorial. Much \nlater, in honor of her brave self-sacrifice, the United States issued \na stamp in her honor. Clara, by the way, was the first nurse honored \non a U.S. postage stamp. If yellow fever does not threaten the world \ntoday as it did a century ago, it is in part owing to the Christian \ncourage of Clara Maass.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Clara Maass.\" Their Stamp on History. \nhttp://www.stamponhistory.com/people/maass.html\u0014\nDock, Lavinia L and Stewart, Isabel M.

    "words": "Can You See Too Much Jesus in the Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy one seminary thinks so and is sending an Old Testament scholar \ninto early retirement. \u0014\n\u0014\nKevin P. Emmert/ August 26, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout history, Christians have affirmed that Jesus is the focus \nof Scripture. But one Bible scholar is being forced to take early \nretirement by a conservative seminary for seeing too much Jesus in \nthe Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament anticipates a Messiahone who would fulfill the law \nand redeem Israeland the New Testament presents Jesus as the \nfullness of God's revelation. Evangelical scholars agree on that \nmuch. But they debate the extent to which the Old Testamentand which \nof its passagescan be read Christologically.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, some believe Psalm 23 describes only the relationship \nbetween David and God, while others say the psalm also anticipates \nChrist's ministry as the Good Shepherd (John 10:1118). Douglas \nGreen, professor of Old Testament and biblical theology at \nWestminster Theological Seminary (WTS) in Philadelphia, goes further. \nHe argues that Christ is also the sheep.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreen argues that the psalm is messianic prophecy. \"'David' is no \nlonger historical King David, but rather 'eschatological David.'  \nThe psalm now predicts that Yahweh will be faithful to his promise to \nprotect and preserve his Messiah at every point in his life's \njourney,\" he wrote in one published paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeminary trustees were troubled by Green's interpretation because it \nclashed with WTS's standards. But in 2009 it unanimously approved a \npaper he wrote as containing \"acceptable clarifications and allowable \nexceptions\" to the school's document on biblical interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn November, the trustees reversed their decision, stating that \nportions of Green's interpretive methods were \"inconsistent with the \nseminary's confessional standards.\" His \"Christotelic\" hermeneutic, \nthey said, \"severs the organic link between the Old Testament and New \nTestament.\" In essence, the school wants to prioritize authorial \nintent: If you can read Jesus as the sheep when that wasn't what \nDavid was thinking about, then you open the door to making a passage \nabout anything you want.\u0014\n\u0014\nWTS offered Green, who has been at the seminary for 22 years, the \nchance to modify his statement and revise and republish his Psalm 23 \narticle. Green declined. On June 6, WTS announced Green's \"honorable \nretirement,\" effective October 1, 2015.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I recognize the seminary's right to draw distinctions between its \nviews and mine and to determine that mine are confessionally \nunacceptable,\" Green told CT. Still, he believes his views are \ntraditional and conservative.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians should interpret the Old Testament with the same stance as \nthe New Testament writers, \"with the conviction that the Old \nTestament is read correctly only when it is read with Christ as the \ngoal or telos of Israel's story,\" said Green. \"Christian \ninterpretation of the Old Testament is ultimately an act of \nre-reading or reinterpreting that section of the Bible through the \nlens of what God has done in Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTremper Longman III, professor of biblical studies at Westmont \nCollege, supports Green's approach. \"Though I don't see \ncontradictions between the divine and human authorship, I believe \nthere is a deeper divine intention that the human authors are not \nconscious of,\" he said. \"It's not that you can't know certain things \nuntil the death and resurrection of Christ. But in the light of \nChrist, it all becomes a lot clearer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut WTS New Testament and biblical theology professor G. K. Beale \nthinks we shouldn't assume New Testament writers held new ideas that \ncontradicted or diverged from the Old Testament passages they quoted. \n\"The Old Testament writers were aware of an implicit meaning (known \ncompletely by God) that New Testament writers expressed more fully \nand explicitly,\" he said. The New Testament authors were simply \n\"unpacking\" what the Old Testament passages meant, especially in \nlight of the revelation in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Walton, professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College, says the \nfocus should be on the original intent of the Old Testament authors. \n\"We don't want to ignore that the biblical text is ultimately taking \nus to Christ. But our first step is to understand its [immediate] \ncontext, and that could be totally independent of reading it in light \nof Christ,\" he said. \"People point to Luke 24, where Jesus says the \nOld Testament speaks about him. But unless he or the New Testament \nauthors tell us which Old Testament passages speak about Christ, then \nwe don't know what they are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNot every text is specifically about Jesus, said Walton. \"Any given \nportion of Scripture might be revealing more about God the Father or \nGod the Spirit than God the Son.\"\u0014",

    "title": "CHURCH GIVING DROPS AND CHARITABLE GIVING INCREASES",
    "words": "Church Giving Drops Even as Charitable Giving Increases \u0014\nBrian Kaylor\u0014\nSeptember 5, 2014 EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nA recent report noted that even though overall charitable giving in \nthe U.S. is increasing, giving to churches is dropping. Trends among \nBaptist groups echo the findings. \u0014\n\u0014\nResearched and written by the philanthropy school at Indiana \nUniversity, the Giving USA 2014 report looks at philanthropy trends \nin 2013 and compares it to annual data collected since 1956.\u0014\n\u0014\nOverall charitable giving by individuals increased 4.2 percent in \n2013 (or 2.7 percent when adjusted for inflation), but giving to \nreligion declined 0.2 percent (or 1.6 percent when adjusted for \ninflation).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe religion category includes churches, denominational groups, \nmissions societies and religious media.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, religious groups still received the largest chunk of \ncharitable giving, hauling in 31 percent of all charitable \ncontributions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next largest categories were education (16 percent) and human \nservices (12 percent).\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The recent declines in religious giving are, in part, attributed to \na decline in the percentage of Americans who consider themselves \nreligious and attend congregations,\" the report concludes. \"These \ndemographic changes directly impact the ability of congregations to \nmeet their revenue needs in the form of tithes and offerings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Washburn, treasurer for the Virginia Baptist Mission Board, \nalso noted declining church attendance as a factor for the trends. \nHowever, he added other possible explanations not offered by the \nGiving USA report.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As it relates to the churches, there are fewer people attending so \nthere are fewer people giving,\" he told EthicsDaily.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashburn, a former pastor and banker, added that among younger \nChristians, it could be they are giving more to other charitieseven \nfaith-based onesinstead of just churches and denominations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Especially with younger givers, they're very cause-driven givers, \nwhether it's clean-water or malaria eradication or some other cause,\" \nhe explained. \"They want to change the world and they want their \ndollars to do it. They see some of these specific causes as the \nplatforms where they can see that happen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Giving USA report, contributions to faith-based groups \ninvolved in healthcare, education, social services, disaster relief \nor other areas are not included in the religion category but in the \nareas of their specialization.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, giving to faith-based groups might be increasing even as giving \nto the religion category of churches and denominations declines.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the report notes that religious Americans also give to \nnon-religion organizations, it does not highlight faith-based cause \ngiving as a possible reason for the decline in giving to churches and \ndenominations.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Perry, Congregational Health Team Leader for Churchnet, also told \nEthicsDaily.com that various shifts could account for the findings, \nincluding cause-driven giving by younger Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Much church giving in past generations was based on funds that were \nchanneled through denominational-directed ministries,\" Perry \nexplained. \"With the decline in loyalty to denominations, more funds, \nespecially from younger givers, are going to non-denominational \ncauses that are frequently involved in direct services to needy \ncommunities within the U.S. and around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Givers have become more discriminating in the causes which they \nsupport,\" he added. \"Scandals related to the misconduct of clergy and \nmisuse of funds have caused many to distrust religious denominations \nand doubt their reliability. American Christians are generous, but \ntheir giving patterns are changing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Giving USA report, giving to religion had grown 3.9 \npercent between 2011 and 2012, raising questions if the 2012-13 \ndecline is an anomaly or the start of a new trend. Total charitable \ngiving increased 7.5 percent between 2011 and 2012, meaning the \noverall percentage increase dropped in 2012-13 with religious groups \nseeing much of that decline.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith giving to religious groups declining even as overall charitable \ngiving increases, religion no longer dominates charitable giving as \nmuch as in the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile less than one-third of charitable giving currently goes to \nreligion, it used to be 57 percent in the mid-1980s.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptist groups have often matched the trends as receipts have fallen \nin recent years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeading into the last quarter of its fiscal year, the Southern \nBaptist Convention has seen a 0.55 percent decline in Cooperative \nProgram giving and a 1.89 decline in designated giving compared to \nlast year.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches have cut their average percentage giving to the Cooperative \nProgram nearly in half since the early 1980s.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith flat budgets in recent years, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship \n(CBF) devoted a large section of its 2012 Task Force Report to \ndescribing the need for \"a new funding strategy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the reasons given for why CBF needed to rethink how it raises \nmoney was that \"giving trends indicate a preference for directed \ngiving (as opposed to institutional support) among younger \ngenerations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Giving USA report offers suggestions for churches hoping to avoid \nthe declining trend, including creating multiple ways for donors to \ngive (not just in the offering plate) and offering transparency on \nhow the gifts were used and their impact.\u0014\n\u0014\nWashburn of the Virginia Baptist Mission Board offered similar \nsuggestions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe noted that churches and denominations cannot expect people to give \njust \"for the sake of the institution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They will support the institution if there is a clear and compelling \nidentity as well as a clear and compelling mission,\" he explained.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You've got to develop multiple streams of revenue,\" he added. \n\"Churches have to think creatively. The only source of income can't \nbe people in the pew, passing the plate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe suggested churches consider creating endowments, searching for \ngrants, charging for some camps or other ministries, partnering with \nlocal businesses for support, or reducing costs by working with other \nchurches or nonprofits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Washburn and Perry agreed that the findings in the report are \nimportant issues for churches and denominations to consider.\u0014\n\u0014\nIgnoring the trends or hoping for a shift back to past institutional \nloyalty will not work for congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Washburn explained, \"It's a whole new day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002Brian Kaylor is a contributing editor for EthicsDaily.com\u0014",

The person who could get him those rights \nwas Napoleon III. The only problem was, Napoleon III was on the \nbattlefield in Italy. Dunant did not let that deter him, but set out \nfor Napoleon's headquarters at Solferino in Northern Italy. Thanks to \nthat bold venture, this Christian-influenced businessman became the \nfirst person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe arrived in Solferino in time to witness one of the bloodiest \nbattles of the 19th century. About 40,000 men died in the fighting on \nJune 24, 1859, and another 40,000 perished afterwards because of \ninadequate medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenri Dunant had been reared in active Christian faith. His father \nwas involved in social work and Dunant himself had labored for the \nSwiss arm of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was a \nman of action. Appalled by the suffering he witnessed at Solferino, \nhe immediately organized the local peasants to gather the wounded and \ncare for them in homes and churches. Had he not done so, even more \nmay have died. He persuaded Napoleon III to issue an order freeing \ndoctors and surgeons attached to the Austrian armies. But more was \nneeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant saw that modern weapons would kill increasing numbers of men. \nSomething had to be done. He wrote a book titled A Memory of \nSolferino. In it he called all nations to set up commissions to deal \nwith war casualties. Everyone who could should be trained to care for \nthe wounded. His idea sparked interest. In 1863 a committee of five, \nincluding Dunant, met in Geneva to see if his plan could be \nimplemented. It called for a conference. This was also held in \nGeneva. On this day, October 29, 1863, the conferees founded the \nInternational Red Cross (not yet called by that name). The following \nyear, the concerned committee drew up the Geneva Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant never got his water rights. As a consequence, his business \nfailed. Genevans lost money through him and shunned him. He was \naccused of homosexuality and died obscure and impoverished in a \nhospice, bitter and refusing to spend the international awards that \nshowered upon him. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nRich, Josephine.

    "title": "CHRISTMAS EVE",
    "words": "For centuries, Christmas was celebrated not as a single day, but as a \nwhole season in parts of the world, beginning with this day, December \n24, Christmas Eve. Perhaps the practice of celebrating the evening \nbefore the big day is an echo from ancient Jewish reckoning. Among \nearlier Jews, a day began at six in the evening and ran until six the \nfollowing evening. Had not Moses written: \"An evening and a morning \nwere the first day\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas means \"Christ mass.\" Although the date is a guess, the \ntradition of observing it goes back to at least the fourth century. \nUnder the influence of the church, Christian traditions replaced \npagan solstice festivals throughout Europe. Often the more innocent \npagan practices (such as bringing in a Yule log, decorating with \nholly and the like) were carried over into the Christmas observance, \ntransfigured with new meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas Eve (the evening before Christmas day) was then celebrated \nwith roaring fires, story-telling, feasting, drinking, dancing, and \nsometimes clowning. Sir Walter Scott described its festive air in a \npoem: \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Eve, the bells were rung;\u0014\nOn Christmas Eve, the mass was sung. \u0014\n\u0014\n... \u0014\nThe damsel donned her kirtle sheen, \u0014\nthe hall was dressed with holly green; \u0014\n\u0014\n... \u0014\nAll hail'd with uncontroll'd delight, \u0014\nAnd general voice the happy night\u0014\nThat to the cottage, as the crown, \u0014\nBrought tidings of salvation down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThings weren't always so pleasant, however. On Christmas Eve, 1521, \nwith the Reformation gaining steam in Germany, crowds rioted in \nWittenberg. Against the orders of Elector Frederick, Andreas \nCarlstadt had given them both the bread and wine at mass. Zealous for \nmore \"reformation,\" the mob smashed church lamps, sang ridiculous \nsongs to drown out the choir and intimidated the priests.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther is supposed to have cut the first Christmas tree. The story \nmay be apocryphal, but we know that on Christmas Eve, 1538, he was in \na jolly mood, singing and talking about the incarnation. Then he \nsighed, saying, \"Oh, we poor men, that we should be so cold and \nindifferent to this great joy which has been given us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Luther's lament, others would make warm memories on Christmas \nEve. In his memoirs, Sir John Reresby told how he invited his poor \ntenants for a feast on Christmas Eve, 1682. During World War I, the \nfamous Christmas Truce began for many troops on Christmas Eve, 1914, \ndemonstrating the power for good that is inherent in the season.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "CHARLEMAGNE CROWNED AS HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR",
    "words": "When the people of western Europe awoke on this day, December 26, \n800, they had an emperor again. On Christmas Day, as King Charles of \nFrance knelt in prayer before the altar of the church of St. Peter's \nin Rome, Pope Leo III suddenly placed a golden crown on his head.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman people shouted three times, \"To Charles Augustus, crowned \nby God, the great and pacific emperor of the Romans, life and \nvictory!\" Charles was reverenced by the pope and called Emperor and \nAugustus, after the manner of the leaders of ancient Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat led up to this dramatic event? Three hundred years and more had \npassed since the collapse of the Roman Empire in western Europe. Many \nelements were at work. For one thing, the popes owed the Franks a \ngreat debt for their preservation in recent years. Charles Martel had \nturned back the Muslim invasion of Europe and Peppin had subdued the \nLombards. Another reason for the pope to crown Charles was to show \nRome's independence from the Greek Empire in Constantinople. Since \nthe days of Constantine in the fourth century, the eastern part of \nthe Roman Empire had increased in authority and power. In Charles, \nKing of the Franks, the pope had found a new Constantine to head a \nrevived western empire. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, Charles was an empire-builder. He had become master of \nthe French kingdom in 768 and used his military might to forcibly \nbring the German tribes under his authority, forcing them to accept \nbaptism and become Christians. His cruelty has been blamed for the \nViking invasions which troubled Europe for over a century. His \ndominion stretched from the Baltic Sea to the British Channel to Rome \nitself. Charles worked diligently to provide a good, unified \norganization for his vast empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen King Charles returned to France after being crowned emperor, he \nforced his subjects to take an oath to him as Caesar. He \nre-established the Roman Empire on a Teutonic base.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe coronation of Charles sparked much debate during the middle ages. \nAt issue was what relationship of church to state. Did the act of \ncrowning the emperor show the pope's superior authority as giver of \nthe empire to King Charles? Charles didn't think so. He continued to \nrule as the divinely appointed protector of the church, appointing \nbishops as well as counts to office.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was not only the first, but possibly the greatest of the emperors \nfrom the eighth through the nineteenth century. He restored \neducation, improved law, supported the church, backed Alcuin's \nattempts to produce an accurate Bible and in many other ways did much \nthat was good. In France, his name was blended with his greatness, \nand he is known as Charlemagne.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur.

    "words": "Cotton Mather, Scion of a Noble Heritage\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn every country there are family names which everyone recognizes, \nnames which are keys to understanding that country's history. For New \nEngland, such a name belonged to the Mathers.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Mather brought the family seeds to America. A well-educated \nminister in the Church of England, he had been suspended from his \npulpit for refusing to conform to the mandatory practices of the \nestablished church. He migrated to Boston in August 1635 where he \nbecame a Puritan pastor, exerting his influence not only from the \npulpit but through production of the Bay Psalm Book. His son, \nIncrease Mather, was likewise a pastor and author, whose life is \nclosely intertwined with the history of Massachusetts. Perhaps his \ngreatest service was to act as an agent of the colony in resisting \nCharles II's revocation of its charter. He also served as president \nof Harvard and earned America's first Doctor of Divinity degree.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third person of this Mather trilogy was perhaps the most notable \nof all. Cotton was born on this date, February 12, 1663. Like his \nfamous father and grandfather he entered the ministry. Acutely aware \nof sin in himself, from a young age he subjected his body to fasts \nand vigils and his mind to periodic self-examination. Six times a day \nhe broke off business to pray and meditate. As a man he was unusually \nintrospective. One wonders if he placed trust in works or in Christ. \nSometimes he claimed direct illumination from God and at other times \ngroaned or swooned. Often he felt plagued by demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nConvinced from his own experience of the real power of Satan, he \nsupported witch hunting. At the urging of the Salem court, he wrote \nWonders of the Invisible World which described the Salem witch \ntrials. It is unfortunate that he did not pay more heed to his \nfather's opposite views. Cotton's name is forever blemished by the \nSalem witch trials, which show how badly superstition can warp an \notherwise intelligent man.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor he was an intelligent man. 444 of his works were printed in his \nday, including a fascinating and valuable history of God's workings \nin New England. The Royal Society of London elected him a member and \nread his scientific papers. The Christian Philosopher was his foray \ninto apologetics. \"The works of the Glorious GOD in the Creation of \nthe World are what I now propose to exhibit; in brief Essays to \nenumerate some of them, that He may be glorified in them...\" He \nquoted often from his large and valuable personal library.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton was not merely a scholar. His pastoral care and rapport with \ntroubled teens won admiration. He actively participated in the hour's \npolitical roly poly, for example, justifying the seizure and \nimprisonment of the colonial governor Edmund Andros.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died February 13, 1728. With him the Mathers fade from New \nEngland's center stage. However, the first three were so great that \ntheir name remains inseparable from the history of the region.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Literature; an anthology with critical introductions. \nEditors Carl Bode, Leon Howard and Louis B.

    "title": "CREATION-EVOLUTION DEBATE, HUXLEY VS WILBERFORCE",
    "words": "Creation-Evolution Debate, Huxley vs. Wilberforce\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch History Timeline\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWith the publication of the Origin of Species, Englishman Charles \nDarwin unloosed a storm of controversy which has not subsided to this \nday. \tReligion and science clashed head-on over the theory. \nBelievers resented what they perceived as Darwin's attempt to rule \nGod out of creation. Many scientists resented inaccurate and \nclosed-minded reactions from the religious community. Darwin had \namassed an enormous quantity of detail which showed that \nmicro-evolution had occurred--evolution within kinds. From this he \nconjectured that macro-evolution, evolution across kinds, had taken \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn this day, Saturday, June 30th, 1860, six months after the \npublication of the Origin of Species, evolution was the topic of a \nmeeting of the British Association. Seven hundred people showed up. \nAn American, Dr. Draper, was to speak on the \"Intellectual \nDevelopment of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views of Mr. \nDarwin.\" He spoke for an hour, and then other speakers took off on \nthe theme. A number of churchmen were on the platform, among them \nBishop \"Soapy Sam\" Wilberforce.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe crowd called for this popular speaker. Wilberforce, after \nattempting to defer to another speaker, rose to speak. The great \nanatomist, Sir Richard Owen, had coached him. However, Wilberforce \nwas not deeply grounded in the sciences. He castigated the theory \nwith good humor and made it appear absurd. The crowd loved it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe agnostic Thomas Huxley had been coaxed into attending the \nmeeting. Wilberforce, carried away with words, turned to Huxley with \na mocking question. Was it through his grandfather or grandmother \nthat he claimed descent from a monkey?\u0014\n\u0014\nHuxley slapped his knee and whispered a very un-agnostic comment: \n\"The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands.\" Wilberforce sat down \nto applause. The audience called on Huxley. He rose with defiance. \nExplaining Darwin's key ideas, he exposed what he claimed was \nWilberforce's ignorance and error. He would not be ashamed of a \nmonkey in his ancestry, he said. He would be ashamed to be \"connected \nwith a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.\" The crowd \napplauded. Wilberforce was humiliated. \u0014\nThat was over 135 years ago. The debate still goes on. And sadly \nChristians have often tried to oppose evolution without a full grasp \nof the scientific arguments that they must address and answer. But in \nrecent years even from within the scientific community new questions \nare being raised that seem to assure that the evolution debate is far \nfrom over.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDenbigh, Kenneth G. An Inventive Universe. New York: Braziller, 1975. \nThis is mentioned as a representative sample of books which defend \nevolution. Many more could be mentioned, such as Dawkin's The Blind \nWatchmaker.\u0014\nDent, Michael. Evolution, a Theory in Crisis. Bethesda, Maryland: \nAdler and Adler, 1985.

    "title": "CHECKING OUT AT THE STORE AND \"GREEN THINGS\"",
    "words": "Checking out at the store, the young cashier suggested to the much \nolder lady that she should bring her own grocery bags, because \nplastic bags are not good for the environment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman apologized to theyoung girl and explained, \"We didn't have \nthis 'green thing' back in my earlier days.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nThe young clerk responded, \"That's our problem today. Your generation \ndid not care enough to save our environment for future generations.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe older lady said that she was right -- our generation didn't have \nthe \"green thing\" in its day. The older lady went on to explain:\u0014\n\u0014\nBack then, we returned milk bottles, soda bottles and beer bottles to \nthe store. The store sent them back to the plant to be washed and \nsterilized and refilled, so it could use the same bottles over and \nover. So they really were recycled. But we didn't have the \"green \nthing\" back in our day. \u0014\n\u0014\nGrocery stores bagged our groceries in brown paper bags that we \nreused for numerous things. Most memorable besides household garbage \nbags was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for our school \nbooks. This was to ensure that public property (the books provided \nfor our use by the school) was not defaced by our scribblings. Then \nwe were able to personalize our books on the brown paper bags. But, \ntoo bad we didn't do the \"green thing\" back then.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe walked up stairs because we didn't have an escalator in every \nstore and office building. We walked to the grocery store and didn't \nclimb into a 300-horsepower machine every time we had to go two \nblocks. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut she was right. We didn't have the \"green thing\" in our day.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack then we washed the baby's diapers because we didn't have the \nthrow away kind. We dried clothes on a line, not in an \nenergy-gobbling machine burning up 220volts. Wind and solar power \nreally did dry our clothes back in our early days. Kids got \nhand-me-down clothes from their brothers or sisters, not always \nbrand-new clothing. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that young lady is right; we didn't have the \"greenthing\" back in \nour day. \u0014\nBack then we had one TV, or radio, in the house -- not a TV in every \nroom. And the TV had a small screen the size of a \nhandkerchief(remember them?), not a screen the size of the state of \nMontana. In the kitchen we blended and stirred by hand because we \ndidn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we \npackaged a fragile item to send in the mail, we used wadded up \noldnewspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. \nBack then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut \nthe lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised \nby working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on \ntreadmills that operate on electricity. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut she's right; we didn't have the \"green thing\" back then. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe drank from a fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup \nor a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled \nwriting pens with ink instead of buying a new pen, and we replaced \nthe razor blade in a r azor instead of throwing away the whole razor \njust because the blade got dull. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut we didn't have the \"green thing\" back then. \u0014\n\u0014\nBack then, people took the streetcar or a bus and kids rode their \nbikes to school or walked instead of turning their moms into a \n24-hour taxi service in the family's $45,000 SUV or van, which cost \nwhat a whole house did before the\"green thing.\" We had one electrical \noutlet in a room, not an entire bank of sockets to power a dozen \nappliances. And we didn't need a computerized gadget to receive a \nsignal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to \nfind the nearest burger joint. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut isn't it sad the current generation laments how wasteful we old \nfolks were just because we didn't have the \"green thing\" back then? \u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't like being old in the first place, so it doesn't take much \nto tick us off... Especially from a tattooed, multiple pierced \nsmartass who can't make change without the cash register telling them \nhow much.\u0014",

    "words": "Clara Maass Died to End Yellow Jack\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nClara Maass was just 25 when she died in Cuba in 1901. In 1976, the \nUnited States issued a stamp commemorating the Lutheran nurse. \nLutherans honor her on this day, August 13, calling her a \"Renewer of \nSociety.\" What did she do to attain these honors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of ten children in a German immigrant family, Clara became \na caring person. She worked as a mother's helper during her high \nschool years, then in an orphanage. At seventeen, she entered the \nnewly opened Christina Trefz Training School of Nurses and was one of \nits first graduates. She must have been very good at what she did, \nfor by the age of 21, she had become the school's head nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, life held out a chance \nof even greater service to Clara. She became a contract nurse with \nthe American armies. Her competent presence was felt in Georgia, \nFlorida, Cuba, and the Philippines. She found herself fighting \nmalaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases more often than \ngunshots wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, the United States set out to find the cause of \"yellow \njack\"-- yellow fever. Clara, having nursed patients with this deadly \ndisease, and she wanted to see it overcome. She volunteered to be \npart of an experiment to understand the fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo rival theories held the field. The first considered yellow fever \nthe result of filthy conditions. The second attributed it to mosquito \nbites.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder experiments conducted by Walter Reed, a team tested both \ntheories. Men lived in filth without exposure to mosquitoes. They did \nnot contract yellow fever. Other subjects offered themselves to be \nbitten by mosquitoes. Some of them came down with fever. One of them \nwas Clara, who contracted a mild case.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas she now immune? Some thought so. Others thought the case was too \nmild to build immunity. On August 14th, 1901, Clara submitted to a \nsecond mosquito bite. Soon she had a bad case of the fever. Ten days \nlater she died. Her case clinched the matter: a mosquito was the \ncarrier of the disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Clara was buried with military honors, no fuss was made over \nher until thirty years later when another nurse stumbled across the \nfacts, researched her story and raised funds for a memorial. Much \nlater, in honor of her brave self-sacrifice, the United States issued \nthe stamp shown here. Clara, by the way, was the first nurse honored \non a U.S. postage stamp. If yellow fever does not threaten the world \ntoday as it did a century ago, it is in part owing to the Christian \ncourage of Clara Maass.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Clara Maass.\" Their Stamp on History. \nhttp://www.stamponhistory.com/people/maass.html\u0014\nDock, Lavinia L and Stewart, Isabel M.

George Armstrong Custer that radically changes \nour view of the man and his turbulent times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this magisterial biography, T. J. Stiles paints a portrait of \nCuster both deeply personal and sweeping in scope, proving how much \nof Custers legacy has been ignored. He demolishes Custers \nhistorical caricature, revealing a volatile, contradictory, intense \npersoncapable yet insecure, intelligent yet bigoted, passionate yet \nself-destructive, a romantic individualist at odds with the \ninstitution of the military (he was court-martialed twice in six \nyears). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key to understanding Custer, Stiles writes, is keeping in mind \nthat he lived on a frontier in time. In the Civil War, the West, and \nmany areas overlooked in previous biographies, Custer helped to \ncreate modern America, but he could never adapt to it. He freed \ncountless slaves yet rejected new civil rights laws. He proved his \nheroism but missed the dark reality of war for so many others. A \ntalented combat leader, he struggled as a manager in the West. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHe tried to make a fortune on Wall Street yet never connected with \nthe new corporate economy. Native Americans fascinated him, but he \ncould not see them as fully human. A popular writer, he remained \napart from Ambrose Bierce, Mark Twain, and other rising \nintellectuals. During Custers lifetime, Americans saw their world \nremade. His admirers saw him as the embodiment of the nations \ngallant youth, of all that they were losing; his detractors despised \nhim for resisting a more complex and promising future. Intimate, \ndramatic, and provocative, this biography captures the larger story \nof the changing nation in Custers tumultuous marriage to his highly \neducated wife, Libbie; their complicated relationship with Eliza \nBrown, the forceful black woman who ran their household; as well as \nhis battles and expeditions. It casts surprising new light on a \nnear-mythic American figure, a man both widely known and little \nunderstood.\u0014\n\u0014\n-\u0014\nAs with many American icons, we really dont know much about General \nGeorge Armstrong Custer. Born poor in Ohio, educated at West Point, \nwhere he barely graduated, Custers reputation expanded quickly \nduring the Civil War. He was brave, he could lead, and he possessed \nthat Custer luck. We all know where that luck ended. Or do we? T.J. \nStiles, who won a National Book Award and a Pulitzer for his \nbiography of Cornelius Vanderbilt, illustrates how Custer, who \nfamously extended his military career by fighting in Indian country, \nlived on a chronological frontier even more than a geographical \none. He wanted to be a hero. He wanted to be able to fight with a \nsword. But he came of age at the onset of modernitywhere the new \norder was industrial, corporate, scientific, and legal. Custer \nrepresents something to each of uswhether brave fighter or ruthless \nIndian killer who got what he deservedbut he was flesh and blood, \nand he lived a real life that was buoyed by ambition and hope and \nriddled with contradictions. T.J. Stiles writing and research is as \nmuch hero here as Custer, and it sets this biography apart from so \nmany others.  Chris Schluep\u0014\n\u0014\n------------------------------------\u0014\nIf anyone could make a reader forget Custers last stand, at least \nfor a few hundred pages at a time, it would be T.J.

Thomas Powers, author of The Killing of Crazy \nHorse\u0014\n \u0014\nThis magnificent biography lifts the shroud of myth that has long \nhovered over Custer. Well-written, exhaustively researched, and full \nof fresh insights, it does a superb job of re-creating not only his \nlife but even more the world in which he lived. Building on the work \nof previous writers, Stiles surpasses them all with his breadth of \ndetail and depth of analysis. Maury Klein, author, Days of \nDefiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War\u0014\n \u0014\nT.J. Stiles has done it again.

Jon Meacham, author of Destiny \nand Power: The American Odyssey of George H. W. Bush\u0014\n\u0014\n T. J. Stiles has written another splendid book. He portrays a real \nCuster, full of flaws but possessed of outstanding combat skills and \nleadership. This biography easily overshadows its many predecessors, \noffering new facts and interpretations as well as a wonderful read. \nRobert Utley, author of Cavalier in Buckskin: George Armstrong \nCuster and the Western Military Frontier\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the numerous works on Custer, this thoroughly researched and \nriveting book is new.  It is the first to interpret him as a \nrepresentative of his times. Shirley Leckie Reed, author of \nElizabeth Bacon Custer and the Making of a Myth\u0014\n \u0014\nGeorge A. Custer has proven an enduring metaphor for the American \nWest, an exaggerated American seen as flamboyant military hero, \nicon of national expansion, or doomed oppressor of Native Americans. \nMore even than his compelling portrait of this central figure of \nAmerican history, T. J. Stiles brilliantly examines Custer within \ntransforming national eventscivil war, slaverys end, and economic \nand social modernization that privileged the powerful under guise of \ndemocratic triumphproving yet again why he is this generations \nfinest biographer. Christopher Phillips, author of The Civil War in \nthe Border South \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In this definitive reconsideration of an icon, Stiles reminds us why \nCuster remains such a fascinating fixture in our national \nconsciousness: To understand Custer is to understand a significant \nsequence in the American DNA. Hampton Sides, author of Blood and \nThunder and In the Kingdom of Ice.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------\u0014\nExcerpt.  Reprinted by permission. .\u0014\n\u0014\nA voice called out to Custer, telling him to come see the observation \nballoon. He stepped out of the large tent that he shared with three \nother officers and his dogs and looked up. It was aloft, floating \nover the Union encampment. He found his field glass in his hand, so \nhe put its twin lenses to his eyes. He was stunned to see two young \nwomen from Monroe seated in the basketwomen in whom he had a certain \ninterest. He dropped his field glass and ran to the balloons base a \nshort distance away. Let me go up too, he begged the men in charge \nof it. They agreed. In a moment he somehow reached the basket high \nabove, but my friends had gone, much to my disappointment.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe awoke. Unusually, he remembered the dream. I always deal with \nrealities, he wrote to his sister. I am not a believer in \ndreamsunlike his motherbut on the contrary think it absurd to pay \nany attention to them. The more he disavowed any significance, the \nmore he implied that the dream haunted him. Two attractive young \nwomen appear in his most isolated post, a basket in the air; he \nsuddenly, inexplicably, rises to that great height; they vanish the \ninstant he reaches them. He corners what he desires, yet it escapes \nhim, leaving him bewildered and alone.\u0014\nWhen he stepped outside of his tent in the morningawake, this \ntimehe found himself at Harrisons Landing, the James River bivouac \nwhere the Army of the Potomac had retreated after the victory at \nMalvern Hill. McClellan established his headquarters at Berkeley \nPlantation, virtually the birthplace of the slaveholding aristocracy \nin the South. Out of respect, McClellan did not occupy the brick \nmanor house, but ordered tents erected on the grounds. There he \nbrooded on his enemies in the administration.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust after the Battle of Gainess Mill, McClellan had sent a \nremarkable telegram to Secretary Stanton. If I save this Army now I \ntell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or any other persons in \nWashingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army. He knew \nhis accusation was shocking, but, he wrote to his wife, Lincoln was \nentirely too smart to give my correspondence to the publicit would \nhave ruined him & Stanton forever. His delusion was not tested. In \nWashington the telegraph supervisor excised that last sentence, and \nso McClellans anger grew unchecked.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 8, in stifling heat and humidity, Lincoln came to Harrisons \nLanding. McClellan and staff, including Custer, met his steamer at \nthe pier and conducted him on a review of the army. Afterward the \ngeneral and the president sat together under an awning on the deck of \nLincolns vessel. McClellan handed the president a letter. Lincoln \nopened it and read as the general waited.\u0014\nI earnestly desire .?.?. to lay before your excellency, for your \nprivate consideration, my general views concerning the existing state \nof the rebellion, McClellan wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of \nany State in any event. It should not be at all a war upon \npopulation, but against armed forces and political organizations. \nNeither confiscation of property, political executions of persons, \nterritorial organization of States, or forcible abolition of slavery \nshould be contemplated for a moment.?.?.?. Military power should not \nbe allowed to interfere with the relations of servitude, either by \nsupporting or impairing the authority of the master.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe argued that the owners of contrabands should be compensated. And \nhe backed his political lecture with an implicit threat: A \ndeclaration of radical views, especially upon slavery, will rapidly \ndisintegrate our present armies.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln said nothing, a silence that McClellan took as vindication. \nThe general even saw his defeat as a fine thing, reversing his \nearlier analysis. God has helped me, or rather has helped my army & \ncountry, he told his wife on July 10. If I had succeeded in taking \nRichmond now the fanatics of the North might have been too powerful & \nreunion impossible. He wrote to Samuel L. M. Barlow, the Democratic \nParty insider, I have lost all regard & respect for the majority of \nthe administration, & doubt the propriety of my brave mens blood \nbeing spilled to further the designs of such a set of heartless \nvillains.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe self-absorbed general did not see the rising anger at his \nperformance, in the North and even in his own army. Senator Zachariah \nChandler of Michigan, an influential Radical on the Joint Committee \non the Conduct of the War, wrote to his wife on July 6, I can hold \nmy temper no longer & will not try.?.?.?. McLelland is an awful \nhumbug & deserves to be shot. McClellan airily wrote to Barlow, I \ndo not think it best to reply to the lies of such a fellow as \nChandlerhe is beneath my notice.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcClellan also misread Lincoln. The recent setbacks had convinced the \npresident that victory required farther-reaching policies. On July \n13, he told two cabinet members, We must free the slaves or be \nourselves subdued. The slaves were undeniably an element of strength \nto those who had their service, and we must decide whether that \nelement should be with us or against us. But McClellan was blind to \nthese shifts in politicsand blind to himself as well.\u0014\nCuster was more complicated. In the weeks that followed Lincolns \nvisit, he did two things that illustrated his inner \ncontradictionsactions that were true to himself, yet pointed to two \nvery different possible futures.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of his deeds was to take part in a Confederate wedding. His old \nfriend John Gimlet Lea had been paroled after the Battle of \nWilliamsburgallowed to go free as long as he did not return to \nmilitary service before being formally exchanged. Prisoners on both \nsides obeyed the terms of paroles with remarkable faithfulness. \nCuster had heard that a family in Williamsburg was caring for his \nbadly wounded friend, and McClellan gave permission to go to look for \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nCuster found Lea restored to health. Lea said that he was engaged to \nthe daughter of his hostvery beautiful to say the least, Custer \nwroteand asked Custer to serve as best man. He agreed. During the \nwedding ceremony they stood together in uniform, one in blue and one \nin gray, opposite the bride and her attractive cousin Maggie. As \nCuster escorted Maggie out of the room, he told her she couldnt be a \nvery strong secessionist to agree to take the arm of a Union officer. \nYou ought to be in our army, she said. I asked her what she would \ngive me if I would resign in the Northern army and join the \nSouthern, he wrote. She replied, You are not in earnest, are you?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe remained with Lea for two weeks, flirting with Maggie. The four \nspent each evening in the parlor, playing cards or listening to \nMaggie on the piano, playing Dixie, For Southern Rights Hurrah, \nand other rebel tunes. Custer did not mind; he was more interested in \nher beauty than her politics. In a sense, though, his very presence \nwas political, in a way McClellan fully endorsed.\u0014\nThe other thing he did set a different tone, an implacable tone. He \nvowed that he would not cut his hair until he entered Richmond, \nTully McCrea wrote to a friend. You may think from this that he is a \nvain man, but he is not; it is nothing more than his penchant for \noddity.?.?.?. He is a gallant soldier. He would let his curly blond \nhair grow and grow until the Union achieved total victorya sign that \nhe wanted total victory, a sign that became more visible with each \nday.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain! Captain! Custer heard the cry from the far side of some \nnearby bushes. It was the bugler, still just a boy. Two secesh are \nafter me! Custer reined his horse around and found the lad firing \nhis carbine at two Confederates approaching on horseback. Custer drew \nhis revolver and spurred toward them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was August 5, 1862, on the Peninsula. Two days earlier he had \ncrossed the James River on a raid with Col. William W. Averell, who \ncommended him for his impetuous dash. Now he rode with Averell \nagain in a probe of the rebels near White Oak Swamp. He and about 400 \nUnion cavalrymen had charged a few dozen troopers of the 10th \nVirginia Cavalry, dispersing them. Custer had galloped off to the \nleft after some escaping Confederates, away from the main body, when \nhe heard the bugler.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeing Custer, the two rebels turned and fled. Custer rode one of \nthem down; at his call to surrender, the Confederate hesitated, then \nreined in his horse and handed over his carbine. Custer took him back \nto the rest of his detachment and put him under guard, then rode out \nagain, accompanied by a lieutenant and ten men. We had not gone far \nuntil we saw an officer and fifteen or twenty men riding toward us \nwith the intention of cutting their way through and joining their \nmain body, he wrote. When they saw us coming toward them however, \nthey wheeled suddenly to the left and attempted to gallop around us.\u0014\n\u0014\nCuster picked out the officer and spurred his fine black horse into a \ngallop. The rebels mount was at least as fast, so Custer angled to \ncut him off at a rail fence ahead. The Confederate jumped his horse \ncleanly over it. Custer followed, his own horse clearing the top \nrail. He had never felt such a surge of adrenalineexciting in the \nextreme, he wrote. The enemy landed on soft ground, wet after a \nrecent rain, which slowed his progress. Custer guided his horse to \nmore solid footing and rapidly drew closer, hooves thudding the \nearth, freshly loaded revolver in hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurrender, he yelled. Surrender or I will shoot. He paid no \nattention, Custer wrote. He fired and missed. I again called on him \nto surrender, but received no reply. He cocked his revolverthe six \nchambers in its cylinder hand--packed with lead balls, powder \ncharges, and percussion capsand leveled the barrel as he rode. I \ntook deliberate aim at his body and fired. The hammer snapped down \non the percussion cap, sparking the gunpowder, which exploded in a \njet of flame and smoke, propelling the ball on a spiraling path \nthrough the rifled barrel until it burst out \u0014\nof the muzzle. The other rider suddenly relaxed, sat upright in his \nsaddle for an instant, and toppled heavily to the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow Custers strange sense of isolation, his temporary tunnel \nuniverse of only him and his prey, evaporated. His party appeared all \naround him, firing wildly at the rest of the escaping Confederates. \nThe bugle call of rallythe command to return to the main \nforcewarbled through the trees. Custer spotted a cluster of five \nriderless horses. He recognized a bright bay, a blooded \nthoroughbred. An exceptional straight steel sword swung from a black \nmorocco saddle ornamented with silver nails and a red morocco breast \nstrap. It was the horse of his victim, a perfect beauty. Custer \ntook its rein and led it behind him. A splendid trophy, he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe did not see the man he had shot. The lieutenant who fought with \nCuster told me that he saw him after he fell, and that he rose to \nhis feet, turned around, threw up his hands and fell to the ground \nwith a stream of blood gushing from his mouth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain Averell commended Custer, for his gallant and spirited \nconduct. But this skirmish was unique. It was the first time he had \nkilled a manrather, that he knew he had killed a man. He had ridden \nin charges and ordered at least one himself; he had shot at the enemy \nand commanded that volleys be fired; but never had he selected an \nindividual and destroyed his life. He had passed through a doorway \nwith no return.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was his own fault, he explained to his sister and \nbrother-in-law. I told him twice to surrender, but was compelled to \nshoot him. He was answering a silent questiona question no one had \nasked but himself. Often he had expressed his willingness to die for \nhis country; though not a devout man, his statements reflected the \nfaith in which he had been raised, a religion that worshipped Him who \nhad given His life that others may live. But Custer had never written \nabout killing. It was a soldiers defining function, of course, what \nset him apart from the civilian, even the constable, detective, or \narmed guard. Now he faced its reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe enemy soldier had been riding away, trying to escape. Custer \ntracked him, calculated his approach, and took careful aim. He shot \nhim in the back. He had picked a man and erased his memories, \ncanceled his hopes. He had wiped from existence his victims taste \nfor his favorite food, his habit of how he wore his hat, his \nsuperstitions, his most secret fear, the way he laughed. He took the \nman from his parents and children and friends forever. I tried not to \nkill him, Custer told himself. I tried twice. And then I had no \nchoice. Whether the answer satisfied him or not, he never asked the \nquestion again.\u0014",

    "title": "CONFRONTING THE CITIES WITH THE GOSPEL",
    "words": "Confronting the cities\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no doubt about that need. As long ago as 1969, Newsweek \nheadlined its March 17 issue with the theme The Sick, Sick Cities. \nThe Cities are truly America's last frontier, and life in the urban \nwilds has never seemed more precarious or more preposterous, it \nsaid. The problems of the cities have only mushroomed since that \nstatement, but they are cities where the redeeming message of Jesus \nChrist needs to be lived while it is being told. Those who go to tell \nthat story must be supported by other believers. You         don't \ntake offerings in the ghetto. We have the highest crime rate and the \nhighest drug use of any civilized country in the world. Our \ncitiesall of themneed our witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nChallenging the protective shells that people in our day are \ngathering around them. \u0014\n\u0014\nOurs is becoming a lonely culture. People live in a crowd and die on \nthe installment plan and few people notice. Calloused or bitter, \nfrightened or simply bemused by it all, the big-city dweller or the \nsuburban citizen more and more has little or no support system. \nHe/she desperately needs someone with no ax to grind and no motive to \nhide who will care as Jesus cared.\u0014\n\u0014\nA British medical doctor named Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, in December \n2010, shared a story about his interaction with Doris, an 82-year-old \nhospital patient. Two days before Christmas, Doris seemed healthy and \nready for discharge. But for some reason she kept complaining about \ninexplicable health issues. Dr. Kar-Purkayastha wrote: \"Yesterday it \nwas her arm that was hurting, before that her hip. Truth is, Doris is \nan incredibly healthy 82-year-old, and we can't find anything. I have \nno doubt that it will be the same today.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the X-rays came back normal, he told Doris that he would have to \nstick to the plan of sending her home. Doris looked down at the floor \nand quietly said, \"I don't want to go home . It's just that I'm all \nalone and there are so many hours in the day.\" Then after a long \npause, she sighed and asked, \"Doctor, can you give me a cure for \nloneliness?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Kar-Purkayastha reflected on this incident:\u0014\n\u0014\nI wish I could say yes. I wish I could prescribe her some \nantidepressants and be satisfied that I had done my best, but the \ntruth is she's not clinically depressed. It's just that she has been \nleft behind by a world that no longer revolves around her, not even \nthe smallest bit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are thousands like her, men and women  for whom time stands \nempty as they wait in homes full of silence . They are no longer \ncoveted by a society addicted to youth.\u0014\n\u0014\n[Doris] is alone, and it brings home the truth of this epidemic that \nwe have on our handsan epidemic of loneliness . The most difficult \npart is that I don't know how to solve this, although I wish I could. \nFor now, I simply retract my diagnosis. Sheepishly, I insist that \nDoris spends her Christmas this year on the ward, and I can see her \nmood lift. But as I steel myself for the inevitable influx of \nunwanted grandparents whom I know will arrive, I cannot help but \nwonder how it is that things could have gone so badly wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are lonely right around us. Many have lost the enthusiasm of a \nfaith they once experienced. Many have dropped out of the practice of \nthe faith because they don't feel that there are those who care. Part \nof our evangelism needs to include a ministry of caring.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoing where the people are.\u0014",

    "title": "CAT'S IN THE CRADLE - BY HARRY CHAPIN  -- WHAT IT MEANS",
    "words": "My curiosity got me to look up what we talked about. Take a look at \nthis explanation. It kinda makes sense and makes the song make more \nsense.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cat's in the cradle\u0014\nand the silver spoon\u0014\nthe little boy blue\u0014\nand the man in the moon\u0014\n\u0014\nThe son doesn't only represent the child. He also represents the \nfamily as a whole. The father is too busy with work and doesn't have \nthe time to spend with his family. As the lyrics say \"the cats in the \ncradle\" - the family is at home - \"and the silver spoon\" which is a \nsymbol of wealth the father has to earn. The \"little boy blue\" is the \nchild that is sad because his father is away, while the father is \nrepresented by \"the man on the moon\" - the one far away who is \nunreachable, idealized by the child who sees the father as his male \nrole model. So this is the metaphorical way of describing the pairs \nof opposition the song is talking about. The family which is in \ncontrast to work and the sad and left-alone boy in contrast to his \nnever-having-time-for-him father and role model.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nhttps://www.lyricinterpretations.com/harry-chapin/cats-the-cradle\u0014\n\u0014\nAngela S Layne\u0014\n\u0014\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nContemporary additions to the song:\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some lyrics that the music leader form the contemporary \nchurch added. He felt that the son had many truths but there was an \nupside to parents who cared and worked for a living:\u0014\n\u0014\nI saw my dad just yesterday\u0014\nhe came with mom to watch the grandkids play\u0014\nI was coaching the team and they couldn't stay\u0014\nbut we spoke a few minutes 'fore they went away\u0014\nAnd I thought of all the times when I was a kid\u0014\nand remembered all the things we did\u0014\nso many things we did\u0014\n\u0014\nRoad trips in the summer, playing in the yard\u0014\nlistening to the radio, eye spy in the car\u0014\nChurch every Sunday and Wednesday and more\u0014\nBoy Scout camp and trips to the store\u0014\nBut he also had to travel and got home late\u0014\nbut that's not what I thought about yesterday\u0014\nand it's not what I remember today\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd as I look at my kids I pray most of all\u0014\nwe'll take time to make memories both big and small\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nFurther research on the story of the song.\u0014\n\u0014\nInteresting interpretation. And a very good one. I couldn't help but \nwonder what Cat's in the Cradle was. Apparently, it is a string game \nplayed by cultures around the world originally called cratch-cradle \nor an old saying that no one really knows the origin, other than cats \nlike to get in the cradle with babies and can do so more easily than \ndogs. Silver spoon is representative of a gift given to a child at \nbirth, usually by families who could afford such and Little Boy Blue \nwas a poem written about the death of a child and Man on the moon was \na poem about getting children to bed. What amazes me is the number of \nvariations of each of these stories. However, what amazed me the most \nis how the stories of history can be changed. Google Cat's in the \ncradle and you will read how it originated in a 1974 song written by \nHarry Chapin. Almost all of the articles state this and it is simply \nnot true. The interpretation that you sent was written by Anonymous. \nIt is a very good one but you will find nothing about this in Harry \nChapin's writings or his wife's writings. If you are interested, here \nis the basic story as how the song was inspired and written:\u0014\n\u0014\nBehind the Song:\u0014\nCat's in the Cradle\u0014\n\u0014\nby Mike Grayeb\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's been 29 years since Harry first sang the song that his brother \nTom said, \"put more fathers ill at ease than any other song in \nhistory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Cat's in the Cradle\" reached the top of the Billboard music charts \nin December of 1974. It sold millions of copies and earned Harry a \nGrammy nomination for Best Song.\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren bought the record for their parents, and wives played it for \ntheir husbands. Ministers used the story in their sermons; and \nbusiness leaders, school teachers and newspaper columnists cited the \nsong's lyrics on Father's Day. Even pop culture television icons like \n\"The Simpsons\" and \"Saturday Night Live\" have featured \"Cat's in the \nCradle\" in their storylines.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, the song was covered by Judy Collins, the late \nJohnny Cash, the rock group Ugly Kid Joe, and country singer Ricky \nSkaggs. This year, Darryl McDaniels, a founding member of the \nlegendary rap group Run-DMC, joined singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan \nand recorded the song to tell his personal story of adoption(see \naccompanying story).\u0014\nSo how did \"Cat's in the Cradle\" come to be?\u0014\n\u0014\nHarry often described a poem his wife Sandy had written about him not \nbeing around enough for his newborn son Josh. But that was only part \nof the story behind the song.\u0014\n\u0014\nSandy recalled two sources of inspiration for the poem: the \nrelationship between her first husband and his father, and a country \nmusic song she'd heard on the radio.\u0014\n\u0014\nSandy's first husband, James Cashmore, was the only child of John \nCashmore, who was the longtime President of the Borough of Brooklyn, \nNew York.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[John] was a wonderful and interesting man; he was one of 11 \nchildren, and he never went past the fifth grade in school,\" Sandy \nsaid. \"He started an office furniture company and built a successful \nbusiness. Then he went into politics and was Borough President of \nBrooklyn for 25 years.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn wanted his son to be a judge, which he considered to be the most \nhonorable profession, she said. \"He was trying to engineer the kind \nof career for his son that he couldn't have himself because of his \nlack of education.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen James went away to college, his father gave him a membership to \nthe country club, a baby blue car and plenty of credit cards, she \nsaid. \"His father had spoken to a Senator to get him into law school. \nHis father arranged for him to be sworn into the service the day he \nwas supposed to take the bar exams. In those days, if you were called \ninto service the day of the bar exam, you didn't have to take the bar \nexam-you automatically passed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These things made James feel like his life was a fix,\" she said. \"He \nwasn't the energetic, charismatic person that his father was. By the \ntime I met him, even though he was an intelligent person and was \naccomplished at so many things, he had no sense of himself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in their marriage Sandy and James lived temporarily with his \nparents while they were apartment hunting in New York City. It was \nduring this period that the awkward relationship between father and \nson became even more apparent to Sandy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"During dinner, my father-in-law would speak to his son through me. \n'Tell Jimmy I'd like him to show up at the club on Tuesday, he'd \nsay.' I just thought it was the most incredible thing I'd ever seen. \nIt's not that they weren't speaking. They were polite to each other, \nbut they didn't really communicate with each other.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later, after she and James were divorced, Sandy reflected on \nwhat she'd seen. \"It struck me in hindsight, and I realized that you \nhave to be in communication with your children from the time they're \ntwo years old.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, after Sandy married Harry, she was writing poems and helping \nHarry to write songs for the television show \"Make a Wish\" when a \ncountry music song on the radio caught her attention.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was about a man and a woman sitting at their kitchen table and \nlooking out to the backyard. They had a swing set and a sandbox and \nbicycle in the corner,\" she said. \"They were talking about how it all \nwent by so fast and how they could have spent more time, and now the \nkids are gone. That song put me in the mood for writing a lyric.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInspired, Sandy scratched out three verses about a child getting \nolder, the story of which Harry eventually used as the basis for \n\"Cat's in the Cradle.\" \"He came home and I showed him the poem, and \nhe sort of brushed it aside,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout a year later, after Josh was born, Harry picked up the poem \nagain. \"He said, 'Hey, this is great; I'm going to put some music to \nit,'\" she recalled. \"I'm assuming he was looking at things \ndifferently after Josh was born, but he didn't really talk about it \nto me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo create the chorus, Harry reworked lines from various nursery \nrhymes and drew especially from the rhyme The Cat and the Fiddle:\u0014\n\u0014\nHey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle\u0014\nThe cow jumped over the moon.\u0014\nThe little dog laughed to see such sport\u0014\nAnd the dish ran away with the spoon.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Harry wrote exactly the right upbeat melody over a sad lyric, and it \nwas very catchy and repeatable so people could sing it,\" she said. \n\"The other thing is there is probably a twitch in people's brain from \ntheir childhood, a familiarity. It was a happy combination of \ncircumstances.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Harry's album \"Verities and Balderdash\" was about to be \nreleased, David Geffen, the interim president of Geffen Records, \nselected \"Cat's in the Cradle\" as the album's lead single.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Harry came home and told me that, and I said you can't do that; it's \nridiculous. That song will only appeal to 45-year-old men, and they \ndon't buy records,\" said Sandy. The song went to number one, and it \nwas Harry's only number one record. \"It just goes to show how wrong \nyou can be,\" she added.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think the reason people responded and continue to respond is \nbecause it is a real life story, and everybody has a piece of that \nexperience,\" said Sandy. \"We still get letters about that song today. \nParents responded by deciding they were going to do better and be \nhome for their kids more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The whole point of the story is that we learn our lessons in life by \nmaking mistakes, by trial and error, by experience,\" she said, \nadding, \"It would be great if we could learn about the future ahead \nof time, but we have to learn the hard way. It's like the old \nsaying--too old too soon, too wise too late.\"\u0014",

    "title": "CHANGES IN CHURCHES",
    "words": "As the church goes through this time of transition, there will be \nmany changes. I'm convinced the church will look much different 20 \nyears from now than it does today. (6/16)\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite not having a crystal ball, I will venture to suggest seven \nchanges I believe are likely to occur:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. More churches will be led by bivocational pastors and/or \nbivocational teams. Some of this will be driven by economics but not \nall of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Seminary training will not be a requirement for a growing number \nof churches.\u0014\nGrowing numbers of seminary students will earn their degrees online. \nPersons going into pastoral ministry will often pursue degrees other \nthan the traditional master of divinity. They will want more \npractical master of arts degrees offering courses that will speak \nmore to the needs of pastors. Look for the master of divinity degree \nto be the degree of choice for those planning to earn a doctorate.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Midsize churches will face a lot of pressure to compete with much \nlarger churches in the programs and ministries they offer.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome will be able to meet those expectations and will grow. Others \nwill not and will begin to lose people to the larger churches.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. The current trend of a lower commitment to the denomination in \nwhich people were raised will continue and even increase.\u0014\n\u0014\nA growing number of people simply won't care about the name of the \nchurch as much as what ministries the church offers.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Lay people will be much more involved in ministry that they are \ntoday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is be partially due to their churches calling bivocational \nministers, but mostly due to more people realizing they have been \ngifted and called to do ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Churches will become more creative in raising funds.\u0014\nThis will become critical in the next few years as the Builder \ngeneration continues to decline. Churches that are effective in \nteaching sound stewardship will see more of their people supporting \nthe church financially.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing numbers will begin offering online giving if they want the \nMillennial generation to support their church financially.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Expect to see more home churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nZoning restrictions in some communities, the cost of new \nconstruction, and a desire to plant new churches rather than erect \ngreat buildings will cause many to decide to meet in homes. Some \ndenominations will be forced to determine how they will recognize \nthese churches.\u0014\nDenominations will also have to make some major changes as their \nchurches go through their transitions. The same is true of seminaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nDennis Bickers\u0014",

There were the four white ranchers \nwho tracked down a band of Yana to a cave, butchering 30. In the \ncave with the meat were some Indian children, reported a chronicle \npublished later. One of the whites could not bear to kill these \nchildren with his 56-calibre Spencer rifle. It tore them up so bad. \nSo he did it with his 38-calibre Smith and Wesson revolver.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere have been books written about the systematic slaughter of \nCalifornia Indians, but none as gruesomely thorough as Benjamin \nMadleys An American Genocide, from which the above accounts come. He \nestimates that between 9,000 and 16,000 Indians, though probably many \nmore, were killed by vigilantes, state militiamen and federal \nsoldiers between 1846 and 1873, in what he calls an organized \ndestruction of the states largely peaceful indigenous peoples.\u0014\n\u0014\nI calculated the death toll using conservative estimates, Madley \ntells me. I did not want to be accused of exaggeration. His book \nshows that the intent to rid California of its indigenous inhabitants \nwas openly and repeatedly voiced, and that the means to achieve these \nends were unambiguously brutal: mass deportations, slavery, \nmassacres. He argues that what happened to California Indians was, \naccording to the most widely accepted definition of genocide, not all \nthat different from what happened to Jews, Armenians or Rwandans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate over genocide in Native American history often turns to \nCalifornia, where the Native American population fell dramatically, \nfrom about 150,000 to 30,000, in the middle decades of the 19th \ncentury. It has since rebounded, so that California has the largest \nNative population in the United States today, with about 723,000 \nIndians, including many who belong to the states 110 federally \nrecognized tribes. The state is a microcosm of Indian countryand it \nis there, many believe, that Manifest Destiny culminated in the only \nway possible, with historians Robert Hine and John Faragher calling \nit the clearest case of genocide in the history of the American \nfrontier.\u0014",

Her name was \nCarolina Sandell Berg, and she was born on October 3, l832. She grew \nup to become Sweden's most celebrated author of Gospel hymns, and \nwrote so many that she is often called \"the Fanny Crosby of Sweden.\"*\u0014\n\u0014\nLike many Christians, Carolina learned that when pain and tragedy \nstrike, God may use that experience to deepen our faith. When she was \n26, Carolina--or Lina (pronounced Lie-nah) as she liked to be \ncalled--experienced a tragedy which profoundly affected the course of \nher life. She was with her father, a Lutheran pastor, crossing a \nSwedish lake. Suddenly the ship lurched, and before her eyes, her \nfather was thrown overboard and drowned. Lina had written hymns \nbefore, but now she poured out her broken heart in an endless stream \nof beautiful songs. Her hymns mightily influenced the revival that \nswept across Scandanavia after l850.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words of Lina Berg's hymns were all the more popular because of \nthe simple, beautiful melodies written for them, especially those of \nOscar Ahnfelt who played his guitar and sang her hymns throughout \nScandanavia. Lina Berg once said that Ahnfeld sang her songs \"into \nthe hearts of the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Jenny Lind, the world-famous concert vocalist, visited factories \nand sang Lina's beautiful hymns. In Matthew l2:34, Jesus said: \"Out \nof the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.\" Lina Sandell \nBerg's voice spoke more than 650 hymns from a heart filled abundantly \nwith love for her Saviour. In one of them, \"Day by Day,\" she had this \nto say:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Day by day and with each passing moment,\u0014\nStrength I find to meet my trials here;\u0014\nTrusting in my Father's wise bestowment,\u0014\nI've no cause for worry or for fear.\"\u0014\n-----------\u0014\n\u0014\n* Fanny Crosby was a blind American hymnwriter who wrote the \nequivalent of seventeen books of hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.

    "title": "CHRISTIAN RESPONSES TO DARWIN'S \"ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES?\"",
    "words": "How have Christians responded \nto Darwins Origin of Species?\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before Darwin published The Origin of Species in 1859, many \nChristians had already accepted an old Earth. One of the first \nsupporters of evolutionary science in AmericaHarvard biologist Asa \nGraywas a devout Christian. Conservative theologian B. B. Warfield \nalso accepted the science of evolution, and both he and Asa Gray \nrejected the idea that evolution leads to atheism. Even the authors \nof The Fundamentals, published between 1910 and 1915, accepted an old \nearth. It wasnt until a century after Darwin that a large number of \nevangelicals and fundamentalists began to accept the combination of \nflood geology and 6-day creation promoted by Seventh-day Adventists.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntroduction\u0014\n\u0014\nMany believe that before Darwin published The Origin of Species in \n1859, Christians as a whole maintained an entirely literal, six-day \ninterpretation of Genesis in which the earth was only a few thousand \nyears old. In fact, however, the idea of an old earth had already \nbecome increasingly popular among Christians throughout the half \ncentury leading up to The Origin of Species.1\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother misconception is that the arrival of Darwins theory led the \nscientific and theological communities to immediately take up \npositions opposing each other. But history reveals that one of the \nearliest supporters of evolutionary theory in the American scientific \ncommunity was a devout Christian botanist named Asa Gray. And among \ntheologians, BB Warfieldan architect of the contemporary evangelical \nunderstanding of biblical inerrancybelieved that certain forms of \nevolution were also compatible with a high view of Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe First Christian Response to Origin of Species in America\u0014\n\u0014\nDarwin did not invent the idea of evolution. By the time The Origin \nof Species was published, the idea of evolution in many natural \nprocesses was already popular, and the term development was used in \nits place for discussions of societys change or the history of the \nsolar system.2 Whats more, it was widely accepted that the earth was \nmuch older than previously thought. Most of the groundwork for this \nunderstanding resulted from geological work done earlier that \ncentury. Through meticulous study of the fossil record, naturalists \nhelped spread the view that the earth was old rather than young.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough many people like to focus on Christian hostility to \nevolutionary theory, a careful look at history reveals some \nsurprising facts. For instance, the first American scientist to \ncarefully review and publicly support Darwins Origin of Species was \na devout Christian named Asa Gray, now regarded as one of the most \nprominent American biologists of the 19th century. A shy person who \navoided politics, Gray worked quietly and does not have the same name \nrecognition as scientists like Louis Agassiz and T.H. Huxleyboth \nflamboyant self-promoters who provoked public debate. But, his \nbrilliant research during his 30-year career at Harvard University \nhelped usher in the era of modern biology in the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsa Gray made his commitment to Christ in 1835, a few years after \ncompleting medical school (much like Francis Collins of our own \nera).3 As a professing Christian, Gray was a committed churchgoer and \nmember of a local congregation in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a \nprofessional scientist, he insisted that science was neutral in \nmatters of religion and metaphysics. Gray found evolutionary theory \nincredibly stimulating to his scientific research, but never found it \nthreatening to his faith. Both before and after reading Origin of \nSpecies, Gray remained firmly grounded in the Nicene Creed, a \nprofession of faith that Christians have shared since the early \nChurch.4\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happened when Origin of Species burst onto the scene? Grays \nextensive research on American and Japanese plantswhich he published \nafter corresponding with Charles Darwinhad already convinced him \nthat species and genera found in both countries resulted from common \nancestry, not separate creations. He responded to Darwins book by \nwriting the first major review5 of Origin on his side of the \nAtlantic, and he defended Darwins scientific theory in a series of \nmeetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science \nin 1859 and 1860. Gray was determined that Origin would get a fair \nreading from the scientific community, and he even took a leading \nrole in negotiations to reprint Origin in the United States in 1860, \nensuring that Americans could have the most accurate edition in their \nhands.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegarding the theological implications of evolution, Gray believed \nthat Darwins theory was not atheistic, although he recognized that \nsome would use it as an excuse for unbelief. Henceforth, he \nconcluded, we need to reshape the argument from design in such \nwise as to harmonize our ineradicable belief in design with the \nfundamental scientific belief of continuity in nature, now extended \nto organic as well as inorganic forms, to living beings as well as \ninanimate things. The question of whether or not life evolves should \nnot be confused with the issue of Gods existence. Instead, Gray \nthought that each issue should be investigated using methods \nappropriate to the subject of inquiry. His refusal to argue for \neither extreme in this contentious debate upset both \nanti-evolutionists and radical popularizers of science, both of whom \nwere eager to believe that evolution implied atheism.6\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Theological Concerns with Evolution\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the decades after Origin of Species was published, theologians \nbegan to ponder the compatibility of Darwins theory and Christian \ndoctrine. Some of them adopted Grays view that evolution was Gods \nmethod of creation.7 Others argued that since Darwin explained away \nthe apparent design in nature, it was compatible only with atheism.8 \nSome scholars accepted Darwins argument for common ancestry, but \nrejected the idea of natural selection, either for scientific, \nphilosophical, or theological reasons.9 Others resisted evolution \nspecifically for the human species, partly due to concerns that \nevolution could conflict with Christian claims that human beings are \ncreated in the image of God.10\u0014\n\u0014\nWith time, however, even some of the more conservative theologians \nbecame comfortable with evolution. B.B. Warfield, for instance, \ndeveloped a powerful and enduring legacy in American evangelicalism \nfor his belief that the Bible communicates revelation from God \nentirely without error. Yet while he defended biblical inerrancy, \nWarfield was also a cautious proponent of the possibility that God \ncould have brought about life through evolution. His basic stance was \na doctrine of providence that saw God working in and with the \nprocesses of nature, rather than completely replacing them. In \nWarfields mind, a high view of biblical authority was fully \ncompatible with a divinely guided process of evolution.11\u0014\n\u0014\nRise of Young Earth Creationism\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough many Christians were concerned about the implications they \nfound in Darwins theory of evolution, by the end of the nineteenth \ncentury very few Christian authors argued for a young earth. \nEnthusiasm for this was largely confined to the Seventh-day \nAdventists, who followed the writings of their founding prophet, \nEllen G. White. She claimed to have seen the creation of the earth in \na vision from God. In another vision, God revealed to her that Noahs \nflood produced the fossil record.12 Early Adventists thus explained \nthe geological data found in the early nineteenth century with their \ninterpretation of the flood story of Genesis 6-8.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 1910 and 1915, a group of conservative Christians wrote a \nlarge collection of papers titled The Fundamentals.13 They clarified \nthe beliefs of conservative Christians intent on preserving the faith \nfrom the threats of their time. Interestingly, The Fundamentals put \nno emphasis on Noahs flood as an explanation of geological data and \nthe contributors accepted an old earth. Even William Jennings Bryan, \na fundamentalist who crusaded against the teaching of evolution in \npublic schools, accepted an old earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, the modern Creationist campaign gained traction as an \nanti-evolution movement in the decades that followed. The 100th \nanniversary of Darwins publication in 1959 brought with it a cry \nfrom academics to make the public more aware of Darwins theory. \nAround the same time, the federal government funded the Biological \nSciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), which produced a series of \ntextbooks that taught evolution without reservation. Many \nconservative Christians at the time saw this as an attempt to ram \nevolution down the throats of children.14\u0014\n\u0014\nAs if in response to this outcry, John Whitcomb and Henry Morris \nupdated Adventist flood geology in their 1961 book, The Genesis \nFlood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications.15 \nWhitcomb and Morris gave an explanation for how Noahs flood could \naccount for the geological evidence for an older earth. Soon after, \nsmall groups of conservative Christian scientists began to form in \nsupport of this research. They came to be known as Young Earth \nCreationists and referred to their flood geology as scientific \ncreationism. The movement continued to grow, and by the 1970s the \nterm Creationism increasingly came to mean only the narrow belief \nthat God created in 6 days and the earth is young, not the larger, \nfoundational belief that God is the Maker of heaven and earth, \nregardless of the time scale involved.\u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014\n\u0014\nGoing back to the original publication of Origin of Species in 1859, \nwe have seen that the original Christian reception of Darwins theory \nwas not universally hostile, and that Asa Gray even found it \nscientifically insightful. With his faith firmly grounded in the \ncreeds of the early church, Gray conducted brilliant scientific \nresearch and maintained an unwavering commitment to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was actually not until the second half of the 20th century that \nYoung Earth Creationism became a mainstream view within the \nevangelical community. Knowing this, many Christians today have \ndecided to stop perpetuating a war with science. Prominent scholars \nlike Asa Gray and BB Warfield demonstrate that it is indeed possible \nto maintain a high view of scripture and accept scientific evidence \nof evolution.\u0014",

Great numbers \nof white people were coming over the mountains from the east. Not \nonly did the invaders grab land, they brought diseases new to the \nIndians, including the measles that were killing many of them.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMarcus Whitman, a doctor who had settled among them to teach them \nabout Christ, seemed to be at the root of many of the problems. Had \nhe not guided a large party of the white invaders to the land \nhimself? Did not the white people visit his home continually and \nreceive any help they needed from his hands and the hands of his \nwife, Narcissa?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAs for Narcissa, although she had crossed the entire continent to \nbring the gospel to Oregon's Indians (becoming one of the first white \nwomen to cross the Rockies), she disliked the Cayuse. She did not \nwant them in her house and both of the Whitmans considered the tribal \nritual of gift giving to be extortion. The Cayuse practice of killing \nunwanted babies tore at Narcissa's heart--already broken with the \naccidental drowning of her only child. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sad truth is that Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, while teaching \nabout Christ and giving medical help to the Indians out of love and \nconcern for them, never studied the Indian culture with an eye to \npresenting the truth in terms the Cayuse could understand. Their \nideas of Christianity were culture-bound. The Cayuse must adopt the \nways of civilized New England to be Christian. Christianity could not \nbe adapted to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the final straw came when Marcus Whitman attempted to \ninoculate the Indians against measles. Many who received the \ninoculations not only took the disease but died of it, whereas most \nof the white children he treated lived. This suggested treachery. By \ntribal law, he must pay with his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, November 29, 1847, eleven Cayuse braves attacked the \nWhitman station at Walla Walla. They butchered Marcus, Narcissa and \ntwelve others. This led to a war with the whites in which the Cayuse \ncame out badly.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years after the massacre, five of its leaders voluntarily gave \nthemselves up, in order to end further retribution against their \ntribe.

    "words": "When Christmas Meets \nthe Umbrage Industry\u0014\n\u0014\nIf history is any guide, theres no escaping the hostilities that \nerupt every December. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Kidd/ November 23, 2016    Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas in the Crosshairs: Two Thousand Years of Denouncing and \nDefending the World's Most Celebrated Holiday \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no easier way for politicians or pundits to rally the base \nthis time of year than hyping the War on Christmas by liberal \nelites. Donald Trumps son Eric told evangelist James Robison in an \nAugust interview that one reason Trump decided to run for president \nwas because the White House Christmas tree was now called the \nholiday tree. (Multiple outlets noted that no such change had \noccurred.)Hostility toward Christmas, Santa Claus, and the Christmas \ntree has a long history, as does disgust with the holidays \nappropriation by politicians, marketers, and lobbyists. Gerry \nBowlers often hilarious, sometimes tedious Christmas in the \nCrosshairs: Two Thousand Years of Denouncing and Defending the \nWorlds Most Celebrated Holiday (Oxford University Press) chronicles \na mind-boggling array of conflicts stretching from the ancient world \nto today. Ever ready with wry zingers for Christmass legions of \nopponents or another quote illustrating the quixotic zeal of its \nappropriators, at times Bowler gives the impression of someone who \nloves his subject a little too much.\u0014\n\u0014\nBowler begins with the fascinating history of how the early church \nchose December 25 as the day to observe Christmas. The Bible gives \nlittle guidance, and Bowler is not convinced by the common argument \nthat the church just decided to Christianize a pagan holiday. \nInstead, he attributes the date to obscure assumptions the early \nchurch made about the timing of Jesuss conception, and the belief \nthat great people sometimes died on the same date they were conceived \n(around mid-March, in Jesuss case). Still, Christmass proximity to \nolder pagan festivals would plague its reputation for millennia.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the medieval era, Christmas became a fixture of Catholic festive \nculture, which sometimes featured drunken celebrations and social \ninversions such as the Feast of Fools and Feast of the Ass (that \nis, the donkey that carried Mary). These rites made Christmas a prime \ntarget for many Reformers, who viewed them as an unbiblical popish \nriot. In the 1640s, the Puritan-dominated English Parliament banned \nChristmas and all other festival days commonly called Holy-days.  \nA century and a half later, radical French revolutionaries renamed \nDecember 25 dog day, viewing citizens who stayed home from work as \npotential enemies of the secular regime.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1800, Christmas was in bad shape, associated largely with \nworking-class drunkenness and violence. But in the early 19th \ncentury, Christmas revivalists like Washington Irving and Charles \nDickens began recasting it as a generically religious, culturally \nwholesome, and family-centered holiday. Clement Clarke Moore made \nperhaps the most significant contribution with his 1822 Account of a \nVisit from St. Nicholas, better known as  Twas the Night Before \nChristmas. A friendly Santa Claus supplanted St. Nicholass \ntraditional threats of wrath against disobedient children. Other \nmenacing nocturnal visitors who had been fixtures of medieval \nChristmases, such as central Europes Perchta the Disemboweller, \nsoon vanished before Santas kindly image. The gift-giving Santa also \ntransformed Christmas into the merchants holiday par excellence.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the mid-19th century, Christmas had come to signify charity, \nfamily togetherness, reunion, and the importance of parental love for \nchildren. It is this version that has become the biggest single \nevent on the planet, in Bowlers estimation.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmass singular prominence encourages not only critics, but \ninnumerable appropriators. Bowler provides a thorough rundown of the \ngroups, from totalitarians to atheists to animal rights activists, \nwho have used Christmas as a platform for one cause or another. The \nNazis replaced Jesus with Der Fuhrer in the hymn Silent Night. \n(Adolf Hitler is Germanys star, showing us greatness and glory \nafar.) The ultra-fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church replaced \nSanta Claus is Comin To Town with Santa Claus Will Take You To \nHell. Planned Parenthood produced a version of the Twelve Days of \nChristmas in which a lover showers his beloved with gifts related to \nfamily planning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last chapter covers the barrage of lawsuits filed by the ACLU and \nother secularists who seek to eliminate all vestiges of Christmas \nfrom American public life. Bowler is (rightly) frustrated with the \nrelentlessness of their litigious flood. He sees complaints like \nthose of the two Caro, Michigan, atheists who professed to be \noffended, affronted, intimidated, and distressed when they saw a \ncrche on the town square in 2003, as furthering an umbrage \nindustry. But he also has little patience for hyper-sensitive rage \nagainst the War on Christmasand for those who exploit it to make \nmoney or build political capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a cure for our Christmas ills, Bowler recommends the old-fashioned \nvirtue of genuine tolerance, a commitment to abide with ones fellow \ncitizens choices. If Starbucks produces an unadorned seasonal red \ncup, or the Wal-Mart cashier merely says happy holidays, theres no \ncause for a Moral Majoritarian freakout. Likewise, if baby Jesus \nshows up on a courthouse lawn somewhere in Middle America, theres no \nreason to get lawyers involved. When it comes to Christmas, Bowler \npleads, cant we just live and let live?\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas S. Kidd is distinguished professor of history at Baylor \nUniversity and the author of George Whitefield: Americas Spiritual \nFounding Father (Yale University Press).\u0014",

You somehow learned how \nto roll your eyes. We have no idea where you learned it, but we can't \nkeep a straight face when you do it even though we try!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most exciting milestone this month was when Mommy and Daddy were \nbowing our heads to pray before eating dinner and you bowed your head \ntoo. My heart melted. \u0014\n\u0014\nStrangers who try to talk to you get a major dose of side eye. It is \nalmost embarrassing because those big pretty eyes are super \nexpressive. It is easy to tell you aren't amused with their antics \nand you would like them to go about their way. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou discovered the movie Frozen this month. You are completely \nobsessed with it and especially Elsa. You clap at the end of the \nmovie. That is pretty cute, but it is also making our daily routine \ndifficult. You want to watch the movie all the time starting first \nthing in the morning and immediately when you get home from school. \nWe limit TV time in this house, so you usually cry when we tell you \n\"no\". It is hard to say no to your sweet requests, but I promise we \nare trying to keep your best interest at heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaths have become extremely challenging right now. You will stand in \nthe tub, which is very dangerous, but you really don't want to sit \ndown in it. Tears are usually involved and mommy and Daddy are trying \nto come up with any idea possible to make you enjoy your baths again. \nYou used to love playing in the bath. We can't figure out what \nchanged. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou can FINALLY say your own name! Sometimes it is as clear as a \nbell. Sometimes it sounds like \"Duckie\", which is totally adorable. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs your speech continues to develop, you are using your manners more \nby saying please and thank you. That makes us so proud. You are still \nthe best cuddler around. We love you Sassy pants!  with \u0002Justin \nIngram.\u0014",

    "words": "Cranmer Got the Top Job but Didn't Want it!\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Thomas Cranmer learned he had been named Archbishop of \nCanterbury by King Henry VIII, he balked. Visiting Germany at the \ntime to promote the King's interest in a divorce, he dawdled seven \nweeks getting back to England. Although the King's word was law, \nCranmer hesitated to accept the position.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English church was in a turmoil over the question of Henry's \ndesired divorce from Catherine. Having presented him with no male \nheir, the queen, once so charming to Henry, was now repugnant. Yet he \ncould not get the Pope to agree to an annulment.\u0014\n\u0014\nCranmer had come to the King's attention when, in conversation with \ntwo of Henry's men, he had suggested that the universities could just \nas well settle the question as the Pope. Henry swore Cranmer had \"the \nright sow by the ear.\" He earmarked the priest to become Archbishop \nof Canterbury, England's highest religious post. Cranmer was \nconsecrated on this date, March 30, 1533.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving himself subject to the King, Cranmer promptly granted Henry \nthe annulment. Throughout his tenure as archbishop, he would do \npretty much whatever the King commanded. Henry's continual shifts of \npolicy often made Cranmer appear wishy-washy. For example, he ruled \nHenry's marriage to Anne of Cleve lawful and six months later \nannulled it as unlawful.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlready leaning toward Protestantism, Cranmer became the chief \narchitect of the English Reformation. He urged the King to place \nBibles in England's churches and it was done. He wrote the first Book \nof Common Prayer. In only a few things did he resist Henry. At some \njeopardy to himself, he pleaded for the lives of Thomas More and \nBishop Fisher and testified for three days against Henry's Six \nArticles which went back to Roman Catholic forms. However, he sat \nwith the persecutors of John Frith and Joan of Kent, both of whom \nwere executed by fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy his twisting and turning, Cranmer escaped execution under Henry. \nHenry trusted him above all his other prelates and on his deathbed \nclung to Cranmer's hand. Under Edward, Cranmer advanced \nProtestantism, helping draft doctrines which became the basis for the \nChurch of England's Thirty Nine Articles.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder pressure, Cranmer supported Lady Jane Gray to succeed Edward. \nIt was not to be. Mary took the throne and charged him with treason \nand heresy. In face of death he recanted his Protestant opinions. \nWhen he learned he was to die anyway, he publicly renounced his \nrecantation. \"As for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy and \nAntichrist, with all his false doctrine.\" When the fire was lit, he \nheld the hand that had signed the recantation into the flame, burning \nit off before the fire touched his body, saying, \"This unworthy right \nhand.\" As death approached he repeated several times, \"Lord Jesus, \nreceive my spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\"Cranmer, Thomas.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

Could the \nIsraelites, newly out of slavery in Egypt, have possessed the \nnecessary artistic skills to produce such a structure when Solomon \nlater had to hire the Phoenicians to build the Jerusalem temple (1 \nKings 5:1-6).  Where would they gotten the raw materials and fabrics \nto make this furniture and priestly garments?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere and when did they get the raw materials to build such an \nedifice? Where did they get the money to purchase them? Estimates are \nthat they would to have had at least 1 ton of gold, 3 tons of silver \nand 2.5 tons of bronze to do the job. Such resources were not brought \nout of Egypt since they left in such a hurry. There were no such \nresources available in the wilderness simply because it was a \nwilderness. Could such a massive and heavy structure been dismantled \nand reassembled with any practicality? Why is there no mention of \ncarrying the tabernacle over the Jordan and into the Promised Land \n(Joshua 3)?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow is the tabernalce, situated in the center of the tribal camp and \nguarded by thousands of Levites, related to the wilderness tent that \nwas pitched outside the camp, guarded by a single individual and used \nto communicate with the deity (Exodus 33:7-11)?

    "words": "GROUNDBREAKING STUDY OF CLERICAL CELIBACY, AND THE VIOLATIONS OF IT\u0014\nBySteven H Propp\u0014\n\u0014\nA. W. Richard Sipe (born 1932) is a former Benedictine monk-priest of \n18 years (he resigned his priesthood, and is now married), a \nsociologist and author/coauthor of books such as Sex, Priests, And \nPower: Anatomy Of A Crisis and Sex, Priests, and Secret Codes: The \nCatholic Church's 2,000 Year Paper Trail of Sexual Abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe begins this 1990 book, \"The potential value of this study lies in \nthe questions that it addresses: What is celibacy? How is it really \npracticed by those who profess it? What is the process of celibacy? \nWhat is the structure of celibate achievement? In short, this is a \nsearch for a structural and dynamic model of an ancient practice that \ncrosses cultural and religious boundaries... The time period spanned \nby this search is the quarter-century that has marked the 'sexual \nrevolution.' ... there is also much to be learned about sexuality \nfrom sexual restraint and abstinence... What better examples of \nsexual control are there than those who publicly profess a life full \nof meaning yet devoid of sex---Roman Catholic priests?\" (Pg. 3-4)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe explains, \"Whereas confession can be accomplished in the dark and \nanonymously, spiritual direction and psychotherapy are two areas in \nwhich a priest can reveal his intimate life-style and deal openly and \nyet in a privileged manner with issues of sexuality. During the \nperiod of our study, priests increasingly talked more openly to \nfriends or in small groups about their sexual struggles... Individual \nrevelations and collections of data can make the penetration of the \nveil of secrecy possible and useful both to those who wish to \nunderstand sexuality better and to those who wish to live celibacy \neffectively.\" (Pg. 5) He admits that his study's \"estimates of \ncelibate practice and achievement are made on the basis of the life \nexperience of 1500 men. 'They are the sick ones,' or 'They are the \nexceptions,' may be the first line of defense against the simple \nfacts... I am confident that if we have erred at all, it is on the \nside of conservative percentages.\" (Pg. 9)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe reveals, \"In my mid-thirties, I experienced a depression I could \nnot shake or explain... Two years into analysis, I became convinced \nthat celibacy was no longer a goal I wished to pursue. My religious \nsuperior was understanding of the struggle and helpful in directing \nme toward an ecclesiastical dispensation from the vow of celibacy. \nSoon after I made my internal resolve about my own celibate goal, I \nmet a missionary nun psychiatrist. I consciously pursued the \nrelationship. Three years later, after she too was dispensed from her \nvows, we were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony.\" (Pg. 14)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe suggests, \"Celibacy cannot be kept in place without sublimation. \nIf sexual activity is chosen by the celibate, some other mental \nmechanism must be employed to keep him psychically in place while he \ncompromises the incompatibles---direct sexual activity and no sexual \nactivity. Without such a mechanism, celibacy is a sham and a \npretense, and does not really involve the attempt to channel sexual \nenergy into nonsexual outlets. Periodic sexual abstinence is not \ncelibacy.\" (Pg. 70)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe states, \"About 20 percent of priests vowed to celibacy... are at \nany one time involved either in a more or less stable sexual \nrelationship with a woman or, alternatively, with sequential women in \nan identifiable pattern of behavior. An additional 8 to 10 percent or \npriests are at a stage of heterosexual exploration that often \ninvolves incidental sexual contacts... A failed relationship can \nresult in the priest's avoiding a subsequent relationship, but not \nnecessarily sexual activity.\" (Pg. 74) Later, he adds, \"Generally, 18 \nto 22 percent of clergy... are either involved in homosexual \nrelationships, have a conflict about periodic sexual activity, feel \ncompelled toward homosexual involvements, identify themselves as \nhomosexual, or at least have serious questions about their sexual \norientation or differentiation. Not all of these men act out any \nsexual behavior with others... Between 1978 and 1985, the reporting \nof homosexual behaviors increased significantly and ... almost \ncoubled to between 38 and 42 percent... Between 1982 and 1985, \nseveral informants... estimated the homosexualities in their \ndistricts approached 50 percent.\" (Pg. 107)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe observes about the attitudes of seminary officials in the \nmid-1960s, \"Limited homosexual experience in a candidate's background \ncould be better tolerated than an experience of heterosexual \nintercourse; the logic was that if one had experienced coitus, one \nwas not likely to complete the course of studies... The shame and \nguilt of an isolated homosexual encounter, plus the structure of the \nseminary schedule, were presumed to be positively motivational rather \nthan a deterrent to celibacy.\" (Pg. 105)\u0014\n\u0014\nHe states, \"Homosexual behavior does not coincide exactly with \nhomosexual orientation... Approximately half of the priests who would \ndescribe themselves as homosexual either practice celibacy ... and \ngenerally have done so in the same proportion as priests who have a \nheterosexual orientation... A percentage of homosexually oriented men \ndo not involve themselves with others, but nonetheless act out sexual \nfantasy, often via pornography and compulsive masturbation. Of the 6 \npercent of priests involved with children or minors, 4 percent have a \nhomosexual orientation... but 3 percent are so clearly dominated by \ntheir paraphilias that the sexual orientation is secondary. We hold \nto the estimate that approximately 20 percent of all clergy have some \nhomosexual orientation. Approximately 10 percent of clergy... involve \nthemselves in homosexual activity. Four percent of clergy have a \nstable homosexual orientation and have more or less consistent \nrelationship with little or no guilt attached to their behavior... \nAlso within this homosexual group are those who are vocal and \nradically active and feel it is a part of their vocation to be honest \nabout their sexual orientation and that sexual activity is their \nGod-given right... This small but growing faction is truly part of \nthe gay subculture that has been incorporated into clerical life.\" \n(Pg. 133-134) He adds, \"We estimate that 80 percent of clergy \nmasturbate at least occasionally.\" (Pg. 139)\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times both enlightening and disturbing, this fascinating and \ninsightful will be \"must reading\" anyone wanting to know about the \ncontemporary priesthood, homosexuality and Catholicism, the clergy \nsex abuse crisis, or related issues.\u0014",

    "title": "COMMON TECHNIQUES COUPLES USE TO STAY TOGETHER",
    "words": "A Guy Read 50 Years Worth of Relationship Studies. He Came Up With 17 \nStrategies \u0014\nBy Belinda Luscombe   Time Magazine  9/6/17\u0014\n\u0014\nA psychology professor narrowed it down to the most common techniques \nthat most couples use \u0014\n\u0014\nOgolsky also found that both individuals and couples have a role to \nplay. That is, sometimes its what individuals do and sometimes its \nwhat the couple does that keeps the flame going.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are the 17 most common strategies he identified.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat individuals do to avoid breaking up:\u0014\n\u0014\nBelittle or ignore the alternatives: When people are in a \nrelationship, they often discount other possible romantic partners. \nHalf of it could actually be I think that guys ugly, says Ogolsky, \nand another is actually trying to turn that off, and not attending \nto that guy at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nIdealize their partner and the relationship: Partners often choose \nimagine their other half is hotter or more macho than s/he really is, \nor speculate that their relationship is special in some way. Most \ncouples like to maintain the illusion that their connection is above \naverage. If they dont, the writing is on the wall, says Ogolsky. \nThis makes sense: the belief that youre better at what you do than \nothers motivates you to keep doing it.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterpret their lovers behavior in a positive way: Lovers often give \ntheir partners the benefit of the doubt and attribute the best \npossible motives to their behavior. For example if your partner \ncheats on you, you can make an number of attributions about that, \nsays Ogolsky. You could say My partner is a dirtbag and I really \nhate him. Hell probably do that again. If thats the case, the \nrelationship likely wont succeed. But sometimes people try to give \ntheir partners more credit than that, he points out: You could \nreinterpret it as that hed made a mistake and it was one-time thing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat couples do to avoid breaking up:\u0014\n\u0014\nManage conflict: Couples who want to stay together find a way to \nsettle their differences, whether it be by compromising, \naccommodating, acceding to their partners way of seeing things, \nagreeing to disagree or apologizing. Those who stonewall or decline \nto engage have less chance of staying together.\u0014\n\u0014\nForgive: There are a lot of studies, books and romantic comedies that \nextol the importance of forgiveness for a relationship. But, Ogolsky \nsays, its subject to a law of diminishing returns. If youre a \nconstant forgiver, there comes a point where its not great for your \nrelationship because someone is taking advantage of you, he says. \nThat can actually erode mental health. Doormats dont get across \nthe threshold.\u0014\n\u0014\nSacrifice: A willingness to forgo self-interest and desired \nactivities for the good of a partner or relationship is an important \naspect of maintaining relationships, according to the study. But, \nOgolsky notes, it has to come from both sides. We want some balance \nin sacrifice. People dont like to over-benefit in relationship, \neither.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelp one another out: The academics call this facilitation. It can \ninclude helping your significant other make plans, complete tasks, \nachieve goals or manage their time. And it often leads to \ninterdependence, as partners begin to coordinate their behavior to \ntry to bring their long-term bigger goals to fruition.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlleviate each others stress: Trouble at work, financial crises or \nfamily drama can all push a couple apart. Couples who can respond to \neach others stress in a way that is soothing rather than in a way \nthat exacerbates it tend to be able to weather the tenser times.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat individuals do to improve the partnership: \u0014\n\u0014\nThink in terms of the team: Couples who switch over from figuring out \nwhats best for them as individuals to whats best for them as a \ncouple last longer. Additionally, says Ogolsky spending your own \ntime thinking about your relationship, is a sign that its going to \nlast longer. It can be spending time thinking about partner, it can \nbe reminiscing, it can be thinking about the things youre going to \ndo.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre generous: An example of this would be any random act of kindness \ntoward your partner, says Ogolsky. Such unasked-for gifts might be \nsigns of affection or acts of service, like making the bed or washing \nup when its not your turn.\u0014\n\u0014\nAre grateful and show it: Gratitude  for relationship and for your \npartner  has been shown time and time again to help build a \nrelationship. However, the partner has to recognize the gratitude. \u0014\n\u0014\nPray for their partner: Yep, prayer. Several peer-reviewed studies \npublished in respected journals suggest that praying for your partner \nmakes relationships last. The guys who are doing this work are \npretty well-known in the relationship realm and are not at religious \ninstitutions, says Ogolsky. If youve had asked me what I thought \nabout this five years ago, I would have said ah no. This is not one \nof the things I would have ever thought would have been quite as \nrobust as it is. Apart from the supernatural explanation, prayer \nmight work like mindfulness, or help the person doing the praying to \nthink compassionately about their partner.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat couples do to improve the partnership:\u0014\n\u0014\nKeep lines of communication open: On a day-to-day basis, couples are \nmaking sure there are no barriers to each other. This usually means \ntheyre being positive, being open, providing partners with some \nassurance youll be around, splitting labor in the household and \ndoing it together, says Ogolsky. Thats right, folks, evenly \ndividing chores is a communication imperative.\u0014\n\u0014\nTalk about their relationship: Couples in it for the long haul \nperiodically reflect on how their union is going. They discuss where \nthey think they are, where they are going and what their issues are.\u0014\n\u0014\nRespond to each other: This is different from No. 13, in that couples \ndont just make sure they can talk freely, but they actually engage \nwith each other when the time comes. When someone wants to talk about \ntheir day, for example, you put down your personal communication \ndevice and listen.\u0014\n\u0014\nUse humor: People who are funny in the right way can keep their \nrelationship going. Its not about a funniness gradient, says \nOgolsky, but whether or not thats one of the tools in your tool bag \nthat you pull out typically during stress. Those who demonstrate \nhumor have a way of defusing the situation and making it easier to \nhandle. However, negative humor like sarcasm and mocking can be \ndetrimental to the relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo fun things together: An oldie but a goodie. Engaging in leisure \nactivities with a partner is theorized to increase communication, \ndefine roles, and increase marital satisfaction when leisure \nsatisfaction is high or when partners are positive and have strong \nsocial skills, says the study. A good time with your partner often \nleads to more togetherness.\u0014\n\u0014\nOgolsky stresses that his findings are descriptive, not prescriptive. \nHe sees his paper as a research tool rather than a blueprint for \nsuccess. Thats at least partly because many of these studies were \nconducted using college students as the participants  and they are \nnot perhaps the finest avatars of functioning relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, since this is what has worked for other people in \nmore than a thousand studies, it might work for you.\u0014",

    "words": "Individuals have surrendered their lives to Christ in all sorts of \nplaces. The revivalist Charles G. Finney converted in a woods; John \nNewton, author of the hymn \"Amazing Grace,\" repented while lashed to \na ship's wheel in a storm; Chuck Colson, founder of Prison \nMinistries, asked God into his life while crying in a car on a \nroadside. C. S. Lewis converted while riding to a zoo in his \nbrother's motorcycle side car.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When we set out I did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God and \nwhen we reached the zoo I did.\" Jack (as he preferred to be called) \nhad earlier become a theist--one who believes there is a God. He was \nconverted to full Christianity on this day, September 22, 1931 \nfollowing a long talk he'd had on the 19th with two Christian \nfriends: J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson.\u0014\n\u0014\nTolkien, who was soon to create the most imitated fantasy of our \ncentury, The Lord of the Rings, argued that even some myths can \noriginate in God, preserving truth, however distorted. One might do \nGod's work by writing myths. Lewis doubted myths embodied truth at \nall. The three argued until 3 A.M. when Tolkien went home. Dyson and \nLewis walked and talked some more. Dyson insisted Christianity works. \nIt puts the believer at peace, frees him of sin, and provides outside \nhelp to straighten him out.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Day, C. S. Lewis joined the church and took communion. \nHe felt that faith had given him a solid footing; he had lacked a \nsense of direction for his talent. By the middle of 1932 he had \nwritten the first of the many books which made him one of the \nbest-loved 20th century Christian apologists: The Pilgrim's Regress. \nHe would go on to create his own wonderful fantasy world: Narnia.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked to present a series of radio talks, he gave the broadcasts \nwhich were brought together in his book Mere Christianity. These \ninclude probably the most famous quotation of all apologetics: \"A man \nwho was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not \nbe a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic--on the level \nwith a man who says he is a poached egg--or else he would be the \ndevil of hell. You must make your choice. Either he was and is the \nSon of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up \nfor a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can \nfall at his feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with \nany patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He \nhas not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis married an American divorcee, Joy Gresham. She contracted a \npainful cancer.

    "words": "Swiss-born Henry Dunant needed water rights for a business venture in \nFrench-controlled Algeria. The person who could get him those rights \nwas Napoleon III. The only problem was, Napoleon III was on the \nbattlefield in Italy. Dunant did not let that deter him, but set out \nfor Napoleon's headquarters at Solferino in Northern Italy. Thanks to \nthat bold venture, this Christian-influenced businessman became the \nfirst person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe arrived in Solferino in time to witness one of the bloodiest \nbattles of the 19th century. About 40,000 men died in the fighting on \nJune 24, 1859, and another 40,000 perished afterwards because of \ninadequate medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenri Dunant had been reared in active Christian faith. His father \nwas involved in social work and Dunant himself had labored for the \nSwiss arm of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was a \nman of action. Appalled by the suffering he witnessed at Solferino, \nhe immediately organized the local peasants to gather the wounded and \ncare for them in homes and churches. Had he not done so, even more \nmay have died. He persuaded Napoleon III to issue an order freeing \ndoctors and surgeons attached to the Austrian armies. But more was \nneeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant saw that modern weapons would kill increasing numbers of men. \nSomething had to be done. He wrote a book titled A Memory of \nSolferino. In it he called all nations to set up commissions to deal \nwith war casualties. Everyone who could should be trained to care for \nthe wounded. His idea sparked interest. In 1863 a committee of five, \nincluding Dunant, met in Geneva to see if his plan could be \nimplemented. It called for a conference. This was also held in \nGeneva. On this day, October 29, 1863, the conferees founded the \nInternational Red Cross (not yet called by that name). The following \nyear, the concerned committee drew up the Geneva Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant never got his water rights. As a consequence, his business \nfailed. Genevans lost money through him and shunned him. He was \naccused of homosexuality and died obscure and impoverished in a \nhospice, bitter and refusing to spend the international awards that \nshowered upon him. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nRich, Josephine.

    "words": "Churches and gun violence: 7 practical preparation tips\u0014\nNovember 7th, 2017    By Rebekah Simon-Peter\u0014\n\u0014\nGunshots rocked yet another church over the weekend. Sunday services \nin Sutherland Springs, Texas turned into a bloodbath, with at least \n27 dead. Before that horrifying incident, the folks of this small \ntown felt protected by their rural setting. But as were discovering, \neven those things dont prevent gun violence from unfolding.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhats a church to do? I want to share with you seven practical tips \nfrom Rev. Derrek Belase, a former certified police officer turned \npastor, with two degrees in criminology. He is now the Director of \nDiscipleship of the Oklahoma Annual Conference. His current portfolio \nincludes coordinating the Safe Sanctuary Training.\u0014\n\u0014\nDerrek believes that you cant completely prevent gun violence from \nerupting. Even with the best laid plans or the best legislation. Then \nwhat? How can a church adequately protect itself? Here are seven \npractical tips that can help any church prepare for the unexpected.\u0014\n\u0014\nEstablish relationships with the first responders and other key \npeople in your community. Get to know the sheriff, chief of police, \nchief of the fire department as well as the mayor and county \ncommissioners. Let them get to know you and exchange cell phone \nnumbers. That way, theyll know if they get a call from you on a \nSunday morning, its a bonafide emergency. That doesnt mean you \nshouldnt call 911 if violence or threats of violence break out in \nyour sanctuary. But also call them. \u0014\n\u0014\nInvite them to come tour the church buildings. Let them see the lay \nof the land, and the way your buildings are set up. If they have a \nmental picture of your facilities, theyll be able to respond with \nforeknowledge, if the need should arise. \u0014\n\u0014\nBe sure to have ushers, as well as greeters. Greeters can keep an eye \nout for folks who may look troubled. They can alert the pastor, or if \nneed be, the authorities. Once worship begins, greeters are seated. \nThats when ushers take over. Once ushers are done seating people, \nthey can serve as a vital link between the worshipping congregation \nin the sanctuary with its closed doors and the outside world. They \ncan walk down the hall to the nursery and make sure everythings okay \nthere. They can keep an eye out for stragglers, suspicious looking \nfolks or someone with a gun. Make sure they can access the church \noffice and a landline phone if need be. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the layout of the building and the property, and what might \nhappen if How far is the nursery from the sanctuary? Do they have a \nlandline where they could make phone calls out? Do you have a \nlandline in the sanctuary? Do cell phones work in the sanctuary? Do \nyou have a lot of doors that are unnecessarily open during worship? \nAre there places outside that people could hide? Your first \nresponders can give you helpful feedback on that. \u0014\n\u0014\nDoes your church building have an accurate sign on it so first \nresponders can respond quickly? You may be known as First Church to \nyour own people, the Methodist church to the larger community and the \ndowntown community church with the big spire to the neighborhood \nlocals. Make sure your sign matches your website, Facebook page and \nbulletin. Also, make sure you have your street address handy. Thats \nhow ambulances will find you. \u0014\n\u0014\nResist bringing in a security expert. Theyll suggest things most \nchurches cant afford, whether thats a security guard or metal \ndetectors, which will ratchet up expectations and fears. Instead, \nmake these practical moves. \u0014\n\u0014\nFocus on what youre there to do: preach the gospel, build the \nKingdom, help people grow spiritually, connect with the community and \nwith God, give hope, share love, pray and practice the presence of \nChrist.\u0014",

Great numbers of \nwhite people were coming over the mountains from the east. Not only \ndid the invaders grab land, they brought diseases new to the Indians, \nincluding the measles that were killing many of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarcus Whitman, a doctor who had settled among them to teach them \nabout Christ, seemed to be at the root of many of the problems. Had \nhe not guided a large party of the white invaders to the land \nhimself? Did not the white people visit his home continually and \nreceive any help they needed from his hands and the hands of his \nwife, Narcissa?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Narcissa, although she had crossed the entire continent to \nbring the gospel to Oregon's Indians (becoming one of the first white \nwomen to cross the Rockies), she disliked the Cayuse. She did not \nwant them in her house and both of the Whitmans considered the tribal \nritual of gift giving to be extortion. The Cayuse practice of killing \nunwanted babies tore at Narcissa's heart--already broken with the \naccidental drowning of her only child. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sad truth is that Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, while teaching \nabout Christ and giving medical help to the Indians out of love and \nconcern for them, never studied the Indian culture with an eye to \npresenting the truth in terms the Cayuse could understand. Their \nideas of Christianity were culture-bound. The Cayuse must adopt the \nways of civilized New England to be Christian. Christianity could not \nbe adapted to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the final straw came when Marcus Whitman attempted to \ninoculate the Indians against measles. Many who received the \ninoculations not only took the disease but died of it, whereas most \nof the white children he treated lived. This suggested treachery. By \ntribal law, he must pay with his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, November 29, 1847, eleven Cayuse braves attacked the \nWhitman station at Walla Walla.

    "title": "CORINTHIANS, COMMUNITY IN A CULTURE WAR",
    "words": "Paul wrote 1 Corinthians to a community in the middle of a culture war\u0014\nThe church at Corinth had many problems. Some simple kindness would \nhave helped. \u0014\n\u0014\nby Douglas A. Campbell   Jan. 3, 2018\u0014\nPaul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians, now lost, in the fall \nof 50 CE. The Corinthians pushed back quite hard. They wrote a reply \nto Paul with a number of questions. In the spring of 51 CE he wrote a \nlong letter back, our 1 Corinthians. This is where we start to build \nup a more detailed picture of the community, and it is not a pretty \nsight. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe church at Corinth was a mess. I count 15 distinguishable problems \nthat Paul addresses in 1 Corinthians: partisanship, with the \nCorinthians factionalizing behind rival leaders (1:104:21; \n16:1018); incest (5:113); prostitution (6:1221); celibacy within \nmarriage (7:17); Christians married to one another asking about \ndivorce (7:811, 39); Christians married to pagans asking about \ndivorce (7:1216); questions surrounding marriage and remarriage \n(7:2540); lawsuits (6:111); idolatry (8:111:1); concerns about \nwomen praying and prophesying in immodest ways (11:216); chaos in \nworship, with speaking in tongues and competing voices (chapter 14); \ninequality in the communal meal (11:1734); denials of the bodily \nresurrection of Jesus and of Christians (15:158); the collection of \na large sum of money to be sent to Jerusalem (16:14); and a change \nin Paul's travel plans (16:59).\u0014\n\u0014\nChapter 12 uses the image of the body of Christ to lay out the way \nthe community should relate together. No part of the Christian body \nis unimportant. Every part is linked to every other part, no matter \nhow humble it might seem to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul applies this advice especially to the disorders in the \nCorinthians' communal meeting. This was a meal together at which the \nLord's Supper was celebrated, followed by a period of worship with \nsinging and the use of spiritual gifts. People spoke in tongues, \nprophesied, and prayed for one another's healing (11:214:40). We \nhave already noted how many problems are evident here. It is \nnevertheless amazing to observe how many of these problems would \ndisappear if the Corinthians would just be nicer to one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/Corinthians, a Communty in a \nCulture War\u0014",

    "words": "Chanting \"Glory Be \nto the Father\" Bede Died \u0014\n\u0014\nSuffering from a lung infection, Bede sang, and prayed, and urged his \npupils to learn quickly, for he did not have much time left to live. \nWhat a fearful thing it is to fall unprepared into the hands of the \nliving God, he warned them. Then he divided his few prized \npossessions, including a little precious pepper, among his fellow \nmonks. His sufferings did not make him bitter; on the contrary, he \nthanked God, believing his pains were a scourging at the hands of a \nloving Father. He labored hard to complete the Gospel of John and to \nmake some extracts from the works of Isidore.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this evening, May 26, 735, his secretary, a lad named Wilbert, \nsaid, \"Dear master, there is one sentence still unfinished.\" \"Very \nwell,\" he replied, \"write it down.\" After a short while, the lad \nsaid, \"Now it is finished.\" \"You have spoken truly,\" Bede replied. \n\"It is well finished. Now raise my head in your hands, for it would \ngive me great joy to sit facing the holy place where I used to pray, \nso that I may sit and call on my Father.\" Chanting \"Glory be to the \nFather, and to the Son,\" he died. So passed one of the noblest men \nwho lived.\u0014\n\u0014\nBede is known as \"the venerable,\" a name rarely applied to major \nfigures of history. He is also called the Father of English History. \nNo student need dig deep to appreciate why both names are deserved. \nHis life was filled with piety and his Ecclesiastical History of the \nEnglish Nation is almost our only satisfactory source of material on \nthe early history of the Anglo-Saxons in England. Bede selected his \nanecdotes with care, crediting his sources when possible. Although \nfilled with miracles, the history has narrative interest and \nlucidity. Its events are reported without prejudice, but with wide \nlearning in a dignified tone.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an autobiographical sketch, he tells of many of his other \nwritings, the bulk of them scriptural interpretations. He informs us \nthat he was a servant of Christ and priest at the monastery of Peter \nand Paul at Wearmouth and Jarrow. \"I was born on the lands of this \nmonastery, and on reaching seven years of age, I was entrusted by my \nfamily first to the most reverend Abbot Benedict and later to Abbot \nCeolfrid for my education.\" There is speculation his parents died \nwhile he was very young. \"I have spent all the remainder of my life \nin this monastery and devoted myself entirely to the study of the \nscriptures. And while I have observed the regular discipline and sung \nthe choir offices daily in church, my chief delight has always been \nin study, teaching and writing. I was ordained deacon in my \nnineteenth year, and priest in my thirtieth... .\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man he survived a plague which wiped out most of the \nchoir. He had cheated death once, but not again. The prayer with \nwhich he closed his history would aptly fit his death: \"I pray you, \nnoble Jesus, that as you have graciously granted me joyfully to \nimbibe the words of Your Knowledge, so You will also of Your bounty \ngrant me to come at length to Yourself, the fount of all wisdom, and \nto dwell in Your presence forever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac. \"Bede.\" Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science \nand Technology; the living stories of more than 1000 great scientists \nfrom the age of Greece to the space age, chronologically arranged. \nGarden City, New York: Doubleday, 1964. \u0014\nBede.

    "title": "CHARLES WESLEY LACK THE HOLY SPIRIT NO MORE",
    "words": "Charles Wesley Lacked Holy Spirit no More\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles and John Wesley longed for a deeper walk with God. With some \nother men at Oxford, including George Whitefield, they formed a \"Holy \nClub.\" Through rigorous spiritual exercises, they sought peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles was ordained in 1735. With his brother John, he labored for \nChrist, seeking to win souls in Georgia. Ill health forced Charles to \nreturn to England after only a year in the New World. Something \nseemed lacking in his life. The work he had done was not fruitful. He \nwas unable to escape a sense of emptiness. Inside he felt hollow.\u0014\n\u0014\nSick with pleurisy, Charles lay upon a bed at the home of Thomas \nBray, a Christian brazier. Charles felt that what he needed was the \nwitness of the Holy Spirit and began to pray for him to come. On \nPentecost Sunday, this day, May 21, 1738, Charles woke up, hoping \nthat this would be the day. John and some friends came to him and \nsang a hymn to the Holy Spirit. This increased Charles' hopefulness \nand when they had left, he began to pray, reminding Christ of his \npromises to send a comforter. He cast himself solely on Christ in \nreliance of his promise to be sent at his time and hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he lay back to rest, he heard a friend's voice saying, \"In the \nname of Jesus of Nazareth, arise, and believe, and thou shalt be \nhealed of all thine infirmities.\" Charles lay still, hardly daring to \nhope, his heart palpitating, but he murmured, \"I believe, I believe.\" \nIn his journal he credits that day as the day he received the witness \nof the Holy Spirit. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis brother John was converted a few days later. Afterward, John \ntraveled about teaching and organizing renewal groups within the \nChurch of England. These were known as Methodists. Although still \nconnected with the Church of England, these groups usually met \nseparately. Their worship services differed, too, for whereas the \nChurch of England sang mostly psalms, the Methodist groups sang \nhymns. Most of those hymns were penned by Charles. Some of his well \nknown songs include \"And Can it Be that I Should Gain,\" \"Arise, My \nSoul, Arise,\" \"A Charge to Keep Have I,\" \"Hark, The Herald Angels \nSing,\" and \"Depth of Mercy, Can There Be... .\" Many others of his \nverses have also blessed the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year after his conversion, Charles Wesley commemorated the event by \nwriting what is possibly his best known hymn:\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, for a thousand tongues to sing\u0014\nMy great Redeemer's praise;\u0014\nThe glories of my God and king\u0014\nThe triumphs of his grace. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDallimore, Arnold A.

This supports and extends the devotional cult of Mary in the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nearly 8th century: Germanus of Constantinople (d. 733) says, \"There \nis no one to whom the gift of grace is given except through Mary.\" \nThis is the earliest explicit testimony to the idea that Mary \ndispenses graces to the church on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n8th century: The title Mediatrix, as applied to the Mother of God \n(indicating a belief that Mary shared in the saving mission of her \nson), is first used by Andrew of Crete (d. 740), Germanus of \nConstantinople (d. 733), and Tarasius (d. ca. 807).\u0014\n\u0014\n9th century: From the East, the title \"Mediatrix\" is introduced into \nthe West through a translation by Paul the Deacon of the Life of \nTheophilus, in which the term is used. From the 12th century on, it \nis applied to Mary with ever-increasing frequency until it becomes \ngenerally accepted in the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century.\u0014\n\u0014\n12th century: Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) popularizes the teaching \nthat Mary is dispenser of grace to Christians, which becomes widely \naccepted during the Middle Ages. His statement \"God has willed that \nwe should have nothing that did not pass through the hands of Mary\" \nwas oft-repeated in that period.late \u0014\n\u0014\n14th century: The title \"Coredemptrix\" first appears in Catholic \nliterature.\u0014\n\u0014\n1477: Sixtus IV, in his apostolic constitution Cum praecelsa, becomes \nthe first pope to allude to the \"spiritual motherhood\" of Mary: as \nshe was mother of Christ, she remains the mother of all members of \nhis \"body.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n19th century: Cardinal Newman rediscovers Irenaeus's image of Mary as \nthe new Eve, leading to renewed attention to the Mary-church analogy \nand typology.\u0014\n\u0014\n1950, November 1 - Pope Pius XII released his \"Munificentissimus Deu \nBull\" proclaiming the body and soul assumption of Mary into heaven \nafter her death.\u0014\n\u0014\n1954: Pius XII orders the universal observance of Mary's queenship \n(and dispensing of all graces to the faithful) on May 31.\u0014\n\u0014\n1956: In his encyclical Haurietis aquas, Pius XII affirms that \"in \nbringing about the work of human Redemtion, the Most Blessed Virgin \nMary was, by the will of God, so indissolubly associated with Christ, \nthat our salvation proceeded from the love and sufferings of Jesus \nChrist intimately joined with the love and sorrows of His Mother.\"\u0014",

    "title": "CONRAD GREBEL DREW CROWDS IN SWITZERLAND",
    "words": "Conrad Grebel Drew Crowds in Switzerland\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Conrad Grebel arrived at St. Gall Switzerland, on this day March \n25, 1525, he began to speak on the need for repentance and baptism. \nHundreds turned out to hear him preach and over the next few months, \nhe baptized five hundred. What was significant about this was that \nmost of them had already been baptized as infants.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrebel was in exile from Zurich. Well-educated, he had studied the \nBible with Uhlrich Zwingli, the reformer of Zurich, and stood by him \nas he made changes in the city. However, Grebel thought that Zwingli \nmoved too slow in implementing reforms based on the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Conrad Grebel became convinced from Scripture that infant baptism \nwas wrong. In order to exercise faith, a person had to be old enough \nto understand the Gospel. Baptism could only have meaning for a \nperson who understood why he or she was being baptized. Those who \nthought this way were called Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli and Grebel held public debates on the issue, but Zwingli \nstuck with infant baptism and so did Zurich. Consequently, Conrad \nGrebel and a number of others decided to obey their consciences. \nGrebel is often called the \"Father of the Anabaptists\" because on \nJanuary 21, 1525, he re-baptized George Blaurock, a former priest. It \nwas the first such adult baptism in Zurich.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately the Zurich authorities forbade the Anabaptists to speak \nabout their beliefs on adult baptism. Shortly afterward, they drove \nthe Anabaptists out. Soon they would be killing them, often by \ndrowning. Grebel went to St. Gall, where he found immediate success.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventh months later, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life in \nprison. Friends helped him escape, but his life was destined to be \nshort all the same. He could not outrun the plague, which carried him \noff less than two years after he baptized George Blaurock. He was \nonly about 29 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Conrad Grebel left few writings, he left many converts. A \ncollege in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is named for Conrad Grebel. It \nwas founded by Mennonites--spiritual offspring of the early \nAnabaptist reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBautz, Friedrich William. \"Grebel, Konrad.\" \n(http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/g/grebel_k.shtml).\u0014\nBender, Harold S.

Church historians put it this \nway:\u0014\n               \u0014\n\t\t      It is hard to miss the perplexing irony that a church  that \nhad been largely pacifist, that long survived as a suffering body, \nnever cooked up any subversive political plots, and had never taken \nup arms, would find its right to exist established through a \npolitical and military conquest. \u0014\n\t\t     \u0014\n                             The church began to savor the first \nsweet taste of secular power.

But a dramatic new course had been set.  \nChristianity had prevailed.  It became the authorized faith of the \nRoman Empire by the end of the fourth century. And the more the \npolitical power of the empire waned, the more the church became the \nstabilizing and unifying source for the Roman society, outlasting the \nempire, and in a sense replacing the empire.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t             Constantines adoption of Christianity was more of a \npolitical than a religious decision.

I had a speaking engagement in Punjab, \nin North\u0014\n         India on Monday night. My flight from Bombay was to get me \nthere about\u0014\n         1:00 p.m. after connecting with another flight in New Delhi.\u0014\n         Unfortunately, as often happens in India, where time tables \nare not\u0014\n         considered urgent, my flight was one hour and forty minutes \nlate.\u0014\n         Consequently, I missed my flight to Punjab. I was desperate \nto arrive\u0014\n         there because my friend was expecting me, I had a speaking \nengagement\u0014\n         that night, and I had made no plans to spend the night in \nNew Delhi.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I frantically sought help for another flight, but there was \nnone until\u0014\n         the next day. The flight attendant said that there was a \nflight to\u0014\n         Srinagar in the North Indian state of Kashmir leaving \nshortly and that I\u0014\n         might possibly make a certain connection there to bring me \nback to\u0014\n         Punjab. Srinagar is approximately three hundred miles north \nof Punjab,\u0014\n         but I thought I should take the chance; otherwise, I would \nhave no chance\u0014\n         of making it. I took the flight. After arriving in Srinagar, \nI looked\u0014\n         hurriedly for where the connecting flight might be leaving \nfrom and how I\u0014\n         could get on it. The flight was full, and I had no chance to \ngo and no\u0014\n         other choice but to stay in Srinagar for the night and try \nto get out the\u0014\n         next morning.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I found a gracious taxi driver--Abdul Qadir Bismati--who \ntook me into the\u0014\n         city, found a hotel for me, and helped me get my ticket for \nthe next\u0014\n         flight out. That flight would be at 1:30 p.m. He asked if I \nhad ever\u0014\n         seen Srinagar, which has a reputation for being in the most \nbeautiful\u0014\n         part of India, an area with the beauty one typically sees in \nthe valley\u0014\n         of Virginia in the Spring. He offered to escort me around to \nthe major\u0014\n         attractions of the area and then to go on to the \nairport--for a fee, of\u0014\n         course. I took him up on the offer.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         The next morning we headed out to see some of the mountains, \nthe\u0014\n         beautiful houseboats and the castles of the historic \nMaharajahs of the\u0014\n         past. Then Abdul asked if I would like to see the carpet \nmills where\u0014\n         they make the world famous silk rugs sold all over the \nworld, and I\u0014\n         certainly did. The mill was impressive in its structure and \nsize. Abdul\u0014\n         asked if I would like to see how they are made. Of course, I \ndid. I had\u0014\n         read how in Persia women worked at the looms tying each \nthread by hand\u0014\n         for many years until most went blind doing their tedious \nwork.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         We went into a large room, something like the average \nbasketball court\u0014\n         one sees in the United States, in which there were rows and \nrows of looms\u0014\n         approximately five feet tall and varying in size, depending \nupon the rug\u0014\n         being made. The majority of the ones I saw would ultimately \nbe living\u0014\n         room, bedroom full-sized rugs. A representative of the \nfactory met me and\u0014\n         dramatically explained how the looms were divided into \nsections for\u0014\n         weaving. One large rug may have six or seven sections. At \neach section\u0014\n         there were spools of thread, one of blue, gold, green, etc., \nwhatever\u0014\n         would used in that rug. These spools were placed on a pole, \nthrough the\u0014\n         opening in the spool, so that the spools appeared to sit one \non the other\u0014\n         up to a height of approximately five feet. From the top of \nthe loom to\u0014\n         the bottom, there were thousands of strings of silk \nsecured so that\u0014\n         they were tight. There was some padding, much like a thinly \nstuffed\u0014\n         pillow, on the floor at each of the sections, and then the \nsurprise.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Sitting on their knees, cutting one small piece of some \ncolor and tying a\u0014\n         knot with it on one of the long strings, trimming off the \nextra pieces of\u0014\n         the silk that had made the knot, and doing so quickly with a \nvery sharp,\u0014\n         curved blade, rug knife was a worker. That worker would tie \nanother knot\u0014\n         and trim it, use another color, tie it and trim it on and on \nfor twelve\u0014\n         hours with a thirty minute lunch break and two five minute \nbathroom breaks.\u0014\n         They worked on their knees all that time. They could not \nstand up to\u0014\n         work except when they were knotting at a place on the loom \nwhich\u0014\n         required their standing. My host explained thoroughly how \nthe process\u0014\n         worked and how tedious it was and how there could be no \nmistakes since\u0014\n         six people were working on this rug at one time. He said, \nThey have to\u0014\n         work together; they cant be messing up other peoples work \nwith lot of\u0014\n         mistake, as he used the term. He went to great pains to \nexplain how\u0014\n         precise this work was and how skilled the workers needed \nto be. Every\u0014\n         knot had to be tied tightly so that it wouldnt come loose \nyears later and\u0014\n         ruin the carpet.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         And the workers? They were all children. I saw one child who \nlooked to\u0014\n         be about six years old. The rest of the children in that \nsection were\u0014\n         ten or under. There was a boy fourteen who was the \nsupervisor of all\u0014\n         the sections on the rug I was watching being made. He \nconstantly and\u0014\n         quickly checked knots being tied. There was not an adult \nanywhere to\u0014\n         be found. I asked my host, Why are these children not in \nschool? He\u0014\n         answered, Oh, these children dont go to school. This is \nfamily work.\u0014\n         I asked him if he meant that these were children with the \nsame father and\u0014\n         mother making this rug, and by implication, the rest of the \nmany rugs\u0014\n         being made in this big room. He said, No, it is what the \nfamilies do.\u0014\n         He was speaking in somewhat broken English, and it was \ndifficult to\u0014\n         understand everything he was saying, but suddenly my stomach \nfelt\u0014\n         nauseous. I was aghast! It just dawned on me that this was a \nchild\u0014\n         labor sweat shop, one like I read about in many places in \nthe world but\u0014\n         never thought I would personally see.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I asked questions about the ages of these in front of \nme--they were from\u0014\n         six to ten. The fourteen-year-old had been working there for \nsix years\u0014\n         and was considered a Master. The six-year-old was \nconsidered an\u0014\n         apprentice. As I asked more questions, my host began to \nsee my anxiety\u0014\n         about what was going on here and tried to change the subject \nand stress\u0014\n         the marvelous skills of these workers. He never used the \nterm\u0014\n         children. Shortly he moved me out into their show room of \nrugs small,\u0014\n         large, and very large. He showed me the invoices of orders \nfrom Kuwait,\u0014\n         Saudi Arabia, New York, Paris, etc. Some of the rugs cost \nmore than\u0014\n         $150,000. I bought two small rugs, table size, with \nintricate designs.\u0014\n         The more intricate the design, the more spools of silk \nthread needed, of\u0014\n         course, to make the rug.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         When I left, sick at heart, I asked Abdul some more \nquestions. He tried\u0014\n         to change the subject, but I said, Im not going to cause \nanybody any\u0014\n         trouble; I just want to know. He told me that the little \nsix-year-old\u0014\n         would probably make one Rupee a day--28 cents at that \ntime--for twelve\u0014\n         hours work, six days a week. The fourteen-year-old \nsupervisor might\u0014\n         make as much as three Rupees a day. If he pushed the \nchildren hard\u0014\n         enough to finish quicker than usual, he might make another \ntwo Rupees\u0014\n         bonus on each rug. I did remember his speaking harshly to \ntwo of the\u0014\n         children while they were working. None of the children \nsmiled or looked\u0014\n         at me while I watched them.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I asked, If one makes mistakes, what happens? He said, \nThey will have\u0014\n         to work with them more. I said, What does that mean? He \nsaid, They\u0014\n         talk to them and maybe some time they may have to have some \nwhipping if\u0014\n         they keep doing it. Listen to that. It will keep you awake \nat night\u0014\n         just thinking about it. These children are nothing but \nslaves. They are\u0014\n         essentially, if not legally, the property of the owner(s). I \nasked how\u0014\n         long they will work there before going on to other work. \nAbduls answer\u0014\n         was, As long as they live usually. They never have the \nopportunity to\u0014\n         learn any other work. We talked some more. I had more \nquestions. The\u0014\n         answers were more disturbing. I had one other one before we \nleft: Have\u0014\n         you ever seen one of those children smile in the years you \nhave been\u0014\n         bringing visitors here? He stopped and answered slowly, \nNo, I dont\u0014\n         think I have.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I told him that now that I had the two rugs, I felt dirty. \nHe said, But\u0014\n         these are working. There are others who dont have any \nwork. Then he\u0014\n         said in what I felt was a profound way, At least when you \nhold these\u0014\n         rugs in your hand, you can feel their pain.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         And so I have--every year since then.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         I have seen with my own eyes what Charles Dickens and many \nothers have\u0014\n         felt and written about.\u0014",

    "words": "Church dismisses pastor who came out as transgender in Sunday sermon\u0014\nNEWSMARK WINGFIELD  |  JULY 22, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nJune Joplin, the Canadian Baptist pastor who came out as transgender \nin her Sunday sermon June 14, has been dismissed from her pulpit at \nLorne Park Baptist Church in suburban Toronto.\u0014\n\u0014\nMember Anne McKye, speaking on behalf of the churchs executive \ncouncil, wrote a letter to the congregation July 20 reporting that a \ncongregational vote drew 52 percent of votes in favor of dismissing \nthe pastor and 48 percent in favor of retaining the pastor. A total \nof 111 ballots were cast. Joplin reported the vote as 58 to 53.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last five weeks have been a difficult time in the life of our \nchurch as our discussion and decision about our future with or \nwithout Pastor Joplin has come suddenly and resulted in a wide range \nof strongly held views on how to proceed, she wrote. Over the last \nfew weeks, we have collectively and individually sought Gods will \nfor our fellowship and now, at this juncture, we believe that with \nreliance on Christ you have chosen what is Gods will for the next \nstage of our church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter her coming-out sermon  which church leadership did not know \nabout in advance  Joplin told BNG she chose this means of making the \nannouncement because she has known other pastors who were silenced \nafter coming out and never given a chance to tell their stories. \nRealizing she could lose her pulpit, she chose to use that sermon to \ntell her story.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe YouTube video of her sermon has nearly 15,000 views.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoplin told friends on Facebook that she has eager anticipation over \nentering the next chapter of my life. I dont know where Ill land \nnext, but I know Ill land as my authentic self.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince church services via Zoom are the new normal, she noted, she \nalready has been invited to preach for several churches beyond \nToronto. This Sunday, she will be the guest preacher for St. Charles \nAvenue Baptist Church of New Orleans.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor now, she draws comfort for the words she often has used on Sunday \nmornings at Lorne Park: God is always up to something. Thats good \nnews. And theres more; God is constantly inviting us to be a part of \nthat something.\u0014\n\u0014\nA statement from the church to BNG described the dismissal vote as \nthe first stage of process for discerning the churchs future. \nAfter a month of prayerful discernment and discussions between June \nand the congregation, it was determined, for theological reasons, \nthat it is not in Gods will that June remain as our pastor, the \nstatement said. We wish June Gods grace and peace as she departs \nfrom us.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough statistics are not readily available to say how many \nChristian congregations in the United States have pastors who are \ntransgender, the number is believed to be small. Religion News \nService just this week published an article about how seminaries are \nahead of local congregations on welcoming transgender clergy.\u0014",

    "words": "Remember Rome in 249\u0014\n\u0014\nIn October 249 Trajan Decius became Roman emperor after defeating the \ninvading Goths along the Danube. As W.H.C. Friend wrote in his \nmassive work, The Rise of Christianity, Decius was inspired by the \nvision of the past military virtues of Rome and its emperors. He was \nhailed as the new Trajan, and he added the name of the best of \nemperors to his own.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling himself the restorer of the sacred rites and liberty, and \nrehearsing Romes past glories, Decius decreed that all citizens \n(except Jews) demonstrate their loyalty by offering a sacrifice \n(incense or libation) to the Roman gods and the emperors genius. \nThis oblation was to be made in the presence of a Roman magistrate, \nwho certified in a libelli that the governmentally mandated ritual \nhad been carried out.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians, a flourishing community in the Empire, were compelled to \noffer imperial sacrifices under threat of punishment, even execution.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians, a flourishing community in the Empire, were compelled to \noffer imperial sacrifices under threat of punishment, even execution. \nSome refused to participate and were imprisoned, with an unknown \nnumber put to death. Others, including some bishops, chose exile or \nwent underground.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyprian, the great bishop of Carthage, acknowledged the courage of \nthose who remained faithful, noting, the white-robed cohort of \nChrists soldiers is here, who in the fierce conflict have broken the \nferocious turbulence of an urgent persecution, having been prepared \nfor the suffering of the dungeon, armed for the endurance of death. \nThey rejected such imperial idolatry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe choice was not easy. Eusebius, the churchs first historian, \nwrote that certain Christians, when approaching the state-mandated \ntemples, were pale and trembled as if they were not about to \nsacrifice, but to be themselves sacrifices and offerings to the \nidols; so that they were jeered at by the multitude who stood around, \nas it was plain to every one that they were afraid either to die or \nto sacrifice.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Leonard\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nWhat is critical race theory? As with any complex theory, its not \nterribly easy to define, and there are many branching streams. Rather \nthan summarize it from my conservative perspective, let me quote one \ndefinition from advocates at the UCLA School of Public Affairs:\u0014\n\u0014\nCRT recognizes that racism is engrained in the fabric and system of \nthe American society. The individual racist need not exist to note \nthat institutional racism is pervasive in the dominant culture. This \nis the analytical lens that CRT uses in examining existing power \nstructures. CRT identifies that these power structures are based on \nwhite privilege and white supremacy, which perpetuates the \nmarginalization of people of color. CRT also rejects the traditions \nof liberalism and meritocracy. Legal discourse says that the law is \nneutral and colorblind, however, CRT challenges this legal truth by \nexamining liberalism and meritocracy as a vehicle for self-interest, \npower, and privilege.  CRT also recognizes that liberalism and \nmeritocracy are often stories heard from those with wealth, power, \nand privilege. These stories paint a false picture of meritocracy; \neveryone who works hard can attain wealth, power, and privilege while \nignoring the systemic inequalities that institutional racism provides.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntersectionality is a key concept that emerged from critical race \ntheory, and it is roughly defined as the idea that oppression \noperates in complicated, interlocking ways. So the experience of, \nsay, a white trans woman is different in important ways from the \nexperience of a black lesbian. A white trans woman will experience \nthe privilege of her skin but also oppression due to her gender \nidentity. A black lesbian may experience the privilege of cis \ngender identity but also oppression due to race and sexuality.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid French\u0014",

    "words": "Christian Businessman Founded the Red Cross\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSwiss-born Henry Dunant needed water rights for a business venture in \nFrench-controlled Algeria. The person who could get him those rights \nwas Napoleon III. The only problem was, Napoleon III was on the \nbattlefield in Italy. Dunant did not let that deter him, but set out \nfor Napoleon's headquarters at Solferino in Northern Italy. Thanks to \nthat bold venture, this Christian-influenced businessman became the \nfirst person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe arrived in Solferino in time to witness one of the bloodiest \nbattles of the 19th century. About 40,000 men died in the fighting on \nJune 24, 1859, and another 40,000 perished afterwards because of \ninadequate medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenri Dunant had been reared in active Christian faith. His father \nwas involved in social work and Dunant himself had labored for the \nSwiss arm of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was a \nman of action. Appalled by the suffering he witnessed at Solferino, \nhe immediately organized the local peasants to gather the wounded and \ncare for them in homes and churches. Had he not done so, even more \nmay have died. He persuaded Napoleon III to issue an order freeing \ndoctors and surgeons attached to the Austrian armies. But more was \nneeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant saw that modern weapons would kill increasing numbers of men. \nSomething had to be done. He wrote a book titled A Memory of \nSolferino. In it he called all nations to set up commissions to deal \nwith war casualties. Everyone who could should be trained to care for \nthe wounded. His idea sparked interest. In 1863 a committee of five, \nincluding Dunant, met in Geneva to see if his plan could be \nimplemented. It called for a conference. This was also held in \nGeneva. On this day, October 29, 1863, the conferees founded the \nInternational Red Cross (not yet called by that name). The following \nyear, the concerned committee drew up the Geneva Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant never got his water rights. As a consequence, his business \nfailed. Genevans lost money through him and shunned him. He was \naccused of homosexuality and died obscure and impoverished in a \nhospice, bitter and refusing to spend the international awards that \nshowered upon him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nRich, Josephine.

Two days before he was supposed to \nmarry his sweetheart, Melissa, Bobby was attached to a breathing \nmachine in the intensive care unit at Johnston-Willis Hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nCOVID-19 left him struggling to breathe, but while he could still \nspeak, he and Melissa tied the knot.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Thursday, November 19  four days after the Sunday wedding the \nPates had been planning. Melissa was at home, unable to be by her \ngrooms side in the hospital. A pastor friend married them by \nFaceTime.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were no heartfelt vows, no first kiss as man and wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was quick and official. They both said, I do.\" They both said, \"I \nlove you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLast week by phone, Melissa cried softly as she recalled that she \nwould speak to her husband for the last time two days after they were \nmarried.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks later, shed say goodbye.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a year marked by a global pandemic that took the lives of 335,000 \nAmericans and nearly 1.8 million people worldwide, Chesterfield \nCounty residents Bobby and Melissa Pates love story seemed destined \nfor a happy ending.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, they'd already beaten nearly insurmountable odds time and \ntime again.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelissa met Bobby in 2013 when her then young son needed a haircut. \nBobby was a barber in Midlothian and Melissa said she instantly fell \nfor his warm, charismatic personality. She joked that in those early \nweeks and months, she'd take her son every week for a haircut, \nwhether the little boy needed it or not.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I started making appointments for my son every single Thursday just \nso I could go up there and see him,\" Melissa said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe two grew close as friends, and eventually more. Bobby was by her \nside when Melissa suffered a brain aneurysm in 2017. Both had been \nmarried before and while Melissa said Bobby always told her he'd \nnever marry again, he proposed in late 2018. They planned to marry in \nApril 2019, but those plans were sidelined when Melissa was diagnosed \nwith Burkitt lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in January \n2019.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe went through treatment and they moved wedding plans to April \n2020, but COVID-19 squashed those plans, too. In May 2020, Bobby was \nin a car accident and suffered a head injury, which revealed lesions \nin his skull that turned out to be terminal multiple myeloma.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey again moved their wedding plans, this time to spring 2021, to \ngive Bobby some time to get through his own cancer treatments.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, Melissa said they heard about and entered a dream \nwedding contest in September of last year. The contest was offered by \nRichmond-based The Shed, which provides rental services for \nindividuals, corporate groups, restaurants and others, everything \nfrom tents and cutlery to catering services, furniture and more. The \nShed worked with Richmond's 103.7 Play to find the winning couple.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor once, Melissa said, she and Bobby hit a stroke of good luck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pates' were notified in October that they'd won a wedding prize \npackage that included everything from the cake and flowers and DJ to \nMelissa's dress, their rings and more. Local radio personalities \nMelissa Chase and Jack Lauterback, from 103.7 Play, were going to be \nthe wedding officiants.\u0014\n\u0014\nBobby and Melissa were chosen from 78 couples. Their wedding date was \nset for November 15.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelissa said she and Bobby were excited  this was an opportunity \nbeyond their wildest dreams  but they weren't looking for a fancy \nwedding. They were insistent on only one thing: the color scheme had \nto be royal blue, gold and white, a nod to Bobby's favorite pro \nfootball team, the Los Angeles Rams.  \u0014\n\u0014\nMarylee Marmer, of Marylee Marmer Events, was the wedding planner who \nworked with Melissa and Bobby when they won. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I thought they were the sweetest couple,\" she said. Theirs \"was a \nheart-wrenching story of what they'd already been through [and] when \nI got on the phone with them, I was so happy that they were the ones \nwho won.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOther than Bobby's color scheme, Marmer said, \"they didn't want \nanything extravagant  they were just so appreciative of everything \nwe gave them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe added: \"They just wanted to get married and be happy together.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMelissa Chase, host of 103.7 Play's \"Mornings with Melissa & Jack\" \nshow and program director for SummitMedia radio stations including \n103.7, K95 Country and more, recalled that lots of couples entered \nthe wedding contest, though the Pates' story struck them because of \nthe hardships the couple had already faced .\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Their story was so touching about how they'd been there for each \nother the whole time,\" Chase said, through both instances of cancer \nand Melissa's aneurysm, not to mention raising three children between \nthem. When Bobby tested positive for COVID-19, and their wedding \nplans were changed, Chase said they shared the story with their \nlisteners, who'd been following the couple ever since Melissa and \nBobby got the surprise call in October that they'd won.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We talked about it on air and shared her story [because] everyone \nwas waiting to hear about the wedding,\" Chase said. They ultimately \nshared the news of Bobby's passing, too.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Part of our job in radio is, we give you the full story,\" she said, \n\"and unfortunately, sometimes that means it's a sad story.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that Thursday last month, her wedding day, Melissa listened and \nwatched a screen as her fun-loving barber spoke only a few words, but \nwords she'd been waiting to hear for some time. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was happy - I wanted to be his wife for so long,\" Melissa said. \nShe said she still has his wedding ring - a simple silver ring with a \nthin gold band in the middle. She never got a chance to slide it on \nhis finger. \u0014\n\u0014\nBobby died Dec. 6. He was 52. In the days before, he'd also suffered \na stroke, Melissa said. \u0014\n\u0014\nA GoFundMe account has been established to help the Pate family, \nwhich includes Melissa and her daughter and son, and Bobby's son.

    "words": "CATHOLIC CHURCH TEACHING ON RELICS\u0014\n\tREV. CHARLES MANGAN \u0014\n\u0014\nSome people think the Catholic Church abandoned her teaching on \nrelics after Vatican II. However, a quick glance at the Code of Canon \nLaw, published by authority of Pope John Paul II in 1983, reveals \nthat the Church very much considers sacred relics to be important and \nsignificant in the life of the Church (cf. canons 1281-89). Just what \nare relics and what meaning do they have for disciples of Jesus \nChrist?\u0014\n \u0014\n Just what are relics and what meaning do they have for disciples of \nJesus Christ? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe word relic comes from the Latin relinquo, literally meaning I \nleave, or I abandon. A relic is a piece of the body of a saint, an \nitem owned or used by the saint, or an object which has been touched \nto the tomb of a saint. Traditionally, a piece of the body of a \nsaint, especially that of a martyr, may be with the permission of the \nlocal ecclesiastical authority used in solemn processions recalling \nthe specific holy person. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt may seem strange that Christianity, which so adheres to the belief \nin the resurrected body after the final judgment, should attach \nveneration to body parts of the faithful departed. But as Dom \nBernardo Cignitti, O.S.B., once wrote, In a religion as spiritually \ncentered as Christianity, the remains of certain dead are surrounded \nwith special care and veneration. This is because the mortal remains \nof the deceased are associated in some manner with the holiness of \ntheir souls which await reunion with their bodies in the \nresurrection. \u0014\nVenerable history\u0014\n\u0014\nThe veneration of sacred relics has a long history in the Church. It \nis commonly held that the first account of such veneration stretches \nback to the martyrdom of St. Polycarp, bishop and martyr, who was \nkilled by being burned at the stake in the amphitheater at Smyrna \naround the year 155 A.D. One such reference, which comes from the \nOffice of Readings assigned to the memorial of St. Polycarp (February \n23) in the Liturgy of the Hours, states: When the pyre was ready, \nPolycarp took off all his clothes and loosened his undergarment. He \nmade an effort also to remove his shoes, though he had been \nunaccustomed to this, for the faithful always vied with each other in \ntheir haste to touch his body. Even before his martyrdom he had \nreceived every mark of honor in tribute to his holiness of life. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fathers of the Church take up the theme of the reverence paid to \nthe sacred relics as early as the fourth and fifth centuries. By the \n1100s, relics were being venerated in churches and shrines which \nattracted numerous pilgrims. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs time went on, the clothing and personal effects of holy men and \nwomen and boys and girls of the Lord were also enshrined. Abbot \nCignitti observed: This was because of the widespread belief, beyond \nmeasure in the centuries of the early Middle Ages, that the \nwonder-working power of the saint was to be found not only in the \nentire body but also in every part of it and in objects that had been \nin contact with his person. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the death of Emperor Constantine (fourth century), cases of \nwood, ivory, and various metals containing relics were deposited in \naltars at the time of their dedication or buried near the tombs of \nthe dead or even worn around the neck. It is well-known that altars \nat the time of their consecration by the bishop were to have inserted \na relic of a saint, preferably a martyr, which was kissed by the \npriest as he began to offer the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It is \nstill earnestly recommended that every altar possess a relic of one \nof the saints. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst-class doctrine \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are three classes of sacred relics. The first-class is a part \nof the saints body. (It is this type which is placed in an altar \nstone.) The second-class is a piece of the saints clothing or \nsomething used by the saint, while the third-class is an object which \nhas been touched to a first-class relic. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsnt the veneration of relics optional for Catholics? Must the \nCatholic faithful really esteem the bodies of the saints? Once and \nfor all, the Council of Trent (16th century) responded to the claims \nof the reformers that both the veneration of the saints and their \nrelics is contrary to Sacred Scripture. The Council taught: Also the \nholy bodies of the holy martyrs and of the others who dwell with \nChrist . . . are to be honored by the faithful. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are several scriptural passages that support the veneration of \nrelics. For example, the Israelites took Josephs bones when they \ndeparted Egypt (Ex. 13:19). The bones of Elisha came in contact with \na dead person who then was raised to life (2 Kings 13:21). The same \nElisha took the mantle of Elijah and fashioned a miracle with it (2 \nKings 2:13). The Christians of Ephesus, by using handkerchiefs and \ncloths touched to St. Pauls skin, effected the healing of the sick \n(Acts 19:12). \u0014\n\u0014\nCommunion of saints\u0014\n\u0014\nTo venerate the relics of the saints is a profession of belief in \nseveral doctrines of the Catholic faith: (1) the belief in \neverlasting life for those who have obediently witnessed to Christ \nand His Holy Gospel here on earth; (2) the truth of the resurrection \nof the body for all persons on the last day; (3) the doctrine of the \nsplendor of the human body and the respect which all should show \ntoward the bodies of both the living and the deceased; (4) the belief \nin the special intercessory power which the saints enjoy in heaven \nbecause of their intimate relationship with Christ the King; and (5) \nthe truth of our closeness to the saints because of our connection in \nthe communion of saints we as members of the Church militant or \npilgrim Church, they as members of the Church triumphant. \u0014\nThe relics of the saints and their veneration is just another in the \nlong line of treasures which Jesus Christ has given to His chaste \nbride, the Church. These relics summon us to appreciate more \nprofoundly not only the heroic men and women, boys and girls who have \nserved the Master so selflessly and generously, but especially the \nlove and mercy of the Almighty who called these His followers to the \nbliss of unending life in His eternal kingdom.\u0014",

    "title": "CATHOLICISM INC.",
    "words": "Catholicism Inc.\u0014\nBy BILL KELLER   February 17, 2013  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nBehold a global business in distress  incoherently managed, \nresistant to the modernizing forces of the Internet age, tainted by \nscandal and corruption. It needs to tweak its marketing, straighten \nout its finances, up its recruiting game and repair its battered \nbrand. Ecce Catholicism Inc. \u0014\n\u0014\nYes, the business of the church is saving souls, but it is \nnevertheless a business: a closely held conglomerate with a work \nforce of more than a million, 1.2 billion more-or-less regular \ncustomers, 10 times as many outlets as Starbucks, more real estate \nthan Donald Trump dreams of and lobbying clout to rival that of any \nsecular industry. Now its C.E.O., physically and mentally depleted at \nage 85, is stepping down, creating an opportunity for a serious \nrelaunch. \u0014\n\u0014\nCatholicism is mostly a service industry  Canyon Ranch for the \nspirit, if you will  and its deliverables have stood the test of \nmillenniums: instruction in how to live a good life, sacraments to \nconsecrate major milestones, comfort in times of distress, the \ncleansing therapy of confession, penance and absolution, a sense of \nplace in the universal order and the promise of a celestial payoff. \nThe fundamental problems are not in the catalog. There is still a \nrobust market for the faith. The problem  evident in the waning \nconfidence of the customers as well as the rising market share of \nevangelical start-ups and none of the above  is with the management. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs we wait for the ecclesiastical board of directors to fill the \nChair of St. Peter, Ive been asking professional consultants, \nincluding some who work with the church, what Catholicism Inc. might \nlearn from the temporal business world. After all, while the church \nadapts at a glacial pace, it does adapt. The churchs teachings have \nevolved not just on the liturgy but also on issues as fraught as \npriestly celibacy, slavery, money-lending, war and peace, wealth and \npoverty, divorce and the role of women; even that most divisive of \nissues, abortion, was not always defined as strictly as it is now. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor starters, my experts generally agree, it would help to have a \npope with the drive and charisma to reboot the mission, someone with \nthe gift of persuasion, a bit of media savvy and enough years ahead \nof him to follow through. I dont want to make it all about age, but \nwouldnt it be nice to have somebody who was closer to 60 than to \n80? said a consultant who has helped reverse the fortunes of a major \nairline and a global fast-food chain. (Like some of my experts, he \npreferred to speak on background.) Pope John Paul II became pope at \nage 58, and before his papacy sank into scandal and Parkinsons, he \nwas a beloved, globe-trotting dynamo. Benedict XVI was 78 at the \nstart, and he felt a bit like a caretaker. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first major task facing Benedicts successor will be to get past \nthe lingering horror story of predatory priests, to restore the trust \nof the faithful and the respect of the general public. The business \nworld has much to teach about surviving scandal. Michael Useem, \ndirector of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the \nWharton School, told me the church might learn from the way Warren \nBuffett cleaned up Salomon Brothers after a bond-trading scandal and \nEd Breen revived Tyco International after its chief executive went to \nprison for theft. The remedies were bold and effective. First, a \npurge of those responsible for the abuses and the cover-up. \n(Managing out, as it is called in the corporate vernacular, has \nbeen a major weakness in the church, so it was heartening to hear the \nVatican spokesman say that Benedicts retirement could open the door \nfor a potential wave of resignations.) Second, unstinting disclosure \nto investigators, waiving any privileges. Third, appointment of a \ncompliance officer with impeccable credentials, ethical tenacity and \nconspicuous support at the top. At Tyco, the new leadership went on a \nhigh-profile road show of the companys outposts to drive home the \nreforms. \u0014\n\u0014\nCan you imagine, Useem said, if the new pope went on a tour, and \nat every stop he met with the local clergy and said: Its a new \nchurch. Weve been at it for a couple thousand years, and at this \npoint we need to uphold the principles we all hold dear, and here are \nmy 10 steps for making that happen.  \u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the new pope has dealt with the legacy of past disgrace, it will \nbe time to look ahead. Ted Stenger, a corporate turnaround expert at \nthe consulting firm AlixPartners and a devoted Catholic, pointed out \nthat most big companies assemble their executives every few years for \nan intensive strategic review. The last time the church took stock \nwas the Second Vatican Council, half a century ago. The mission of \nthe church is not going to change, Stenger said. But how you set \nobjectives and tactics to deliver on the mission may in fact change. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne question on the agenda might be, to borrow a Michael Useem \nanalogy, does the Vatican want to be Nokia or Apple? Nokias strategy \nis to sell everyone on the planet a $20 phone. Apples is to market a \nmuch pricier product to a more elite, high-income market. Does the \nCatholic Church change its standards to be more inclusive, or does it \nhold its dogmatic line and appeal to a smaller but loyal base? Or can \nit strike a balance? Either way, its time for a reckoning. \u0014\n\u0014\nA second big question might be how much latitude to give to the more \nthan 220,000 parishes. McDonalds has a basic menu that is consistent \naround the globe, but it gives local franchises license to adapt to \nlocal preferences  wine with your Big Mac in France, vegetarian \ndishes in India. You will find Catholic parishes in cities like New \nYork and San Francisco where gay couples are warmly welcomed, women \nparticipate in the liturgy, and the sermons and music are joyously \nunconventional. You will find others that favor the Latin mass, \nincense and everything by the book. Rome could encourage the parishes \nto be laboratories of worship. Useem notes that in business (and in \nthe military, by the way), giving field officers freedom to execute \nthe mission produces creative solutions and its also just a \ntremendous energizer. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother headache the new pope will inherit is recruiting, especially \nin North America and Europe. In the United States the Catholic work \nforce is shrinking by 50 priests and 175 nuns every month. One parish \nin five has no pastor. An obvious solution is to ordain women and let \npriests marry. The monopoly of celibate males, after all, is a \nlong-established custom, but it is not core Catholic doctrine. Then \nagain, if the church decides to be smaller (the Apple model), it \nwont need so much ministering. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs you might expect of an institution that measures time in \ncenturies, the church has been slow to join the digital world. Pope \nBenedict, tweeting as @Pontifex, has 1.5 million followers, which is \npretty good, but he has tweeted exactly 35 times  and the messages \nread like boilerplate composed by a dutiful intern. Bill Derrough, a \nspecialist in corporate restructuring and a fund-raiser for Catholic \ncharities, said that if parishes simply got the names of their \nmembers into the computer, they could organize meet-ups, share best \npractices, spread news. If the pope wanted to send a message to all \nparishioners, I dont know how hed do it, Derrough said. Learning \nfrom product marketers and political campaigns, I think you could \ndrive an increase in attendance. I think you could drive an increase \nin collections. My wifes church has hired an online collection \nservice, called ParishPay, to put the Sunday offering on digital \nautopilot, but most churches still pass a basket. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, and obviously, the church could use some public relations \nhelp. Its stock response to criticism from without or dissent from \nwithin has been to drop into a defensive crouch, stonewall or go \nnegative. That can come across as bullying and arrogant  in other \nwords, not very Christian. One of the costliest examples of dumb \nmessaging is the tendency of church defenders to treat nuns, and \nwomen in general, with condescension. (Did the Vatican really expel \nan order of nuns from their cloister so the place could be \nrefurbished as a suite for the retiring Benedict? Whose idea was \nthat?) \u0014\n\u0014\nI realize that many devout Catholics recoil from suggestions of \nchange, especially if the suggestions come from deserters like me. \nBut troubled enterprises often benefit from a little outside counsel. \nAnd in the unlikely event that a new pope wants to bring the church \ncloser to the 21st century, he will need all the help he can get. \nThis is a far tougher turnaround than the ones I have led, said an \nexecutive who has helped save more than one foundering Fortune 500 \ncompany. You might need to tap the guy that turned water into wine!\u0014",

    "words": "Christian Patriarchy Is Just Patriarchy\u0014\nby Beth Allison Barr | Mar 23, 2021 | \u0014\n\u0014\nBut you only work part time? So how many hours does that take you \naway from home during the week?\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, you breastfeed? I figured you didnt do that since you worked.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs your husband okay with you making more money than him?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are just a sampling of the questions I have been asked over the \npast 20 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nA pastors wife who continued to pursue my own career even while I \nhad children perplexed many in my evangelical community  including \nsome of my college students.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne student was particularly vocal. He was theologically conservative \nand expressed concern about my choice to continue teaching as a wife \nand mother (especially as a pastors wife).\u0014\n\u0014\nHe challenged me so often in the classroom that I took to rewriting \nlecture material, trying to minimize his disruptions. I wasnt \nsuccessful.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the student suggested that I clear my teaching material with my \nhusband before presenting it to my classroom. This both angered and \nunnerved me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt angered me that he thought it appropriate to suggest that I submit \nmy teaching materials to the authority of my husband. It unnerved me \nbecause every semester I worried about how my vocation as a female \nprofessor clashed with conservative Christian expectations about \nfemale submission.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I read Russell Moores attempt to distinguish Christian \npatriarchy from pagan patriarchy, the experience I had with this \nstudent came to mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Moore, pagan patriarchy encourages women to submit to \nall men, while Christian patriarchy only concerns wives submitting \nto their husbands.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore has softened his discussion of patriarchy over the years, \nemphasizing in his 2018 book that, in creation, men and women are \nnever given dominion over one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, he still clings to male headship.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile he writes that Scripture demolishes the idea that women, in \ngeneral, are to be submissive to men, in general, he explains wifely \nsubmission as cultivating a voluntary attitude of recognition toward \ngodly leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, his general attitude remains unchanged: women should not submit \nto men in general (pagan patriarchy), but wives should submit to \ntheir husbands (Christian patriarchy).\u0014\n\u0014\nNice try, I thought. Tell that to my conservative male student. \nBecause that student considered me to be under the authority of my \nhusband, he was less willing to accept my authority over him in a \nuniversity classroom.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo matter how much Moore wants to separate pagan patriarchy from \nChristian patriarchy, he cant.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth systems place power in the hands of men and take power away from \nwomen. Both systems teach men that women rank lower than they do. \nBoth systems teach women that their voices are worth less than the \nvoices of men.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore may claim that women only owe submission to their own \nhusbands, not to men in general, but he undermines this claim by \nexcluding women as pastors and elders.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf men (simply because of their sex) have the potential to preach and \nexercise spiritual authority over a church congregation but women \n(simply because of their sex) do not, then that gives men in \ngeneral authority over women in general.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy conservative male student considered me under the authority of \nboth my husband and my pastor, and he treated me accordingly.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian patriarchy does not remain confined within the walls of our \nhomes. It does not stay behind our pulpits. It cannot be peeled off \nsuit coats like a name tag as evangelical men move from denying \nwomens leadership at church to accepting the authority of women at \nwork or women in the classroom.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatriarchy by any other name is still patriarchy.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian patriarchy models the patriarchy of mainstream society.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur pastor valued the work of a woman less than the work of a man, \njust as the economy of my hometown values the work of women less \n(almost $20,000 per year less) than the work of men.\u0014\n\u0014\nRussell Moore is right to prefer the term patriarchy because, \nrealistically, it is the right term to use. But he is wrong to think \nthat the Christian model is different.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, regarding the treatment of women throughout history, the \npresent looks an awful lot like the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow little the wage gap between women and men has changed over time \nboth frightens and fascinates me as a medieval historian.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudith Bennett describes this startling reality: Women who work in \nEngland today share an experience with female wage earners seven \ncenturies ago: they take home only about three-quarters the wages \nearned by men. In the 1360s, women earned 71 percent of male wages; \ntoday, they earn about 75 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis historical continuity  what Bennett calls the patriarchal \nequilibrium  lends superficial support to the idea of biblical \nwomanhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen examined carefully, however, the historical origins of \npatriarchy weaken rather than bolster the evangelical notion of \nbiblical womanhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nA gender hierarchy in which women rank under men can be found in \nalmost every era and among every people group.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the church denies women the ability to preach, lead, teach and \nsometimes even work outside the home, the church is continuing a long \nhistorical tradition of subordinating women.\u0014\n\u0014\nEditors note: This article is an adapted excerpt from The Making of \nBiblical Womanhood by Beth Allison Barr (Baker, 2021).

    "words": "Carla Wallenda, matriarch of daredevil family of high-wire \nperformers, dies a natural death at 85\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Matt Schudel  March 9, 2021 \u0014\n\u0014\nCarla Wallenda, the matriarch of the daredevil Wallenda family of \nhigh-wire walkers, who continued to perform past the age of 80, died \nMarch 6 at a rehabilitation facility in Sarasota, Fla. She was 85.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe had complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and \ndiabetes, said her son, Rick Wallenda.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Wallenda was the last surviving child of Karl Wallenda, who \nbrought the family and its tradition of death-defying acts to the \nUnited States from Germany in 1928.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wallenda family had been acrobatic performers in Europe for \ngenerations. Ms. Wallenda learned to walk on a tightrope at the same \ntime she learned to walk on the ground. She first performed in public \nat age 3 and appeared for many years with her familys troupe in the \nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I came down off stage, there were all these people standing and \napplauding and throwing money on stage, she told Florida Today in \n2003. My dad said, Never mind the money  its the applause thats \nimportant.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe grew up with the circus, traveling across North America and \naround the globe with The Greatest Show on Earth. Cousins and \nin-laws with different last names all performed as the Wallendas, \nwho were billed various times as the The Great Wallendas, The \nFlying Wallendas and The World Famous Wallendas.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom childhood, Ms. Wallenda practiced eight hours a day, mastering a \nvariety of risky aerial routines, along with headstands and splits. \nHer grandmother taught her that whenever her foot was not touching \nthe ground or a wire cable, it should be elegantly pointed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother family tradition was that all acts should be performed \nwithout the use of a safety net. The Wallendas, who carried long \nstabilizing poles for balance, believed a net would lead to \nsloppiness and complacency  and would diminish the suspense of the \naudience.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur distrust of nets goes back to 1938 when my fathers younger \nbrother, Willie, broke away from the wire act and started his own \naerial act, Ms. Wallenda told the State Journal-Register of \nSpringfield, Ill. He insisted on using a net and was killed anyway \nwhen he fell and bounced out of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the late 1940s, her father introduced a spectacular new routine \ncalled the seven-person pyramid, in which four people walk on the \nwire; two people stand one level above them, on bars attached to the \nwire walkers; and a seventh person rides atop the pyramid on a chair \nbalanced on a wire.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Wallenda became a regular part of the pyramid act at 15, after \nproving to her father that she could do a headstand on top of the \nchair, balanced above the six people below her.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther female performers later took over the top position in the \npyramid as Ms. Wallenda developed other aerial specialties, including \nthe iron-jaw suspension, in which she spun at high speed while \ndangling from a device held between her teeth. She was not part of \nthe pyramid act in 1962, when the Wallendas fell during a performance \nin Detroit. Two members of the troupe were killed, and Ms. Wallendas \nbrother Mario was paralyzed.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, Ms. Wallendas aunt Rietta died after falling more than \n100 feet while performing on the sway bar  a tall metal pole that \nflexes as much as 25 feet in any direction.\u0014\n\u0014\nAunt Rietta was my idol, Ms. Wallenda said in 1994. I begged my \nfather to let me have that act, but he just thought it was too \ndangerous. Finally, after I proceeded to try and build one myself, he \ngave in and gave it to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1965, Ms. Wallenda made the sway bar her featured act, climbing as \nhigh as 120 feet, while leaning from side to side, holding on and \ntwirling with one hand. At the top of the pole, she would do a \nheadstand.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe gave her final performance in 2017 on Steve Harveys Little Big \nShots: Forever Young television show, leaving the audience and host \ngasping in disbelief.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pole is 85 feet high, Harvey said. Shes 81 years old, from \nthe great Wallenda family. Give it up for Carla!\u0014\n\u0014\nCarla Ella Wallenda was born Feb. 13, 1936, in Sarasota, where her \nfamily maintained a permanent home while not traveling with the \ncircus.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer father died at 73 in 1978 after falling from a cable suspended \nbetween two buildings in San Juan, Puerto Rico. That night, Ms. \nWallenda and other members of her family went ahead with a scheduled \nperformance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll four of Ms. Wallendas husbands were aerial performers, as were \nher four children. In later years, she sometimes appeared with her \ngrandchildren, the seventh generation of flying Wallendas. Ms. \nWallenda appeared in a 2017 music video by Miley Cyrus, Younger Now.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer marriages to Iginio Bogino and Paul Jordan ended in divorce. Her \nthird husband, Richard Guzman, died during a performance in 1972, \nwhen his balancing pole struck an electrical line. Her fourth \nhusband, Mike Morgan, died in 2017 after 39 years of marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of her children adopted the stage name of Wallenda. A son from \nher first marriage, Mario, died in 1993. Survivors include another \nson from her first marriage, Rick Wallenda; a daughter from her \nsecond marriage, Rietta Wallenda; a daughter from her third marriage, \nValerie Wallenda; nine grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren. \n(Nik Wallenda, who has walked across tightropes stretched over \nNiagara Falls, a gorge near the Grand Canyon and between two Chicago \nskyscrapers, is her great-nephew.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn more than 70 years of performing without a net, Ms. Wallendas \nmost serious injury was a bruised tailbone, after falling about 17 \nfeet.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccidents can happen any place, she told the Sarasota \nHerald-Tribune. I have to make a living and this is the only way I \nknow or want to. Ive done waitress work and hated every minute of \nit. Why should I go and do a job that I hate?\u0014",

    "title": "CRITICAL RACE THEORY",
    "words": "Critical race theory\u0014\n\u0014\nCritical race theory is a theoretical framework in the social \nsciences that uses critical theory to examine society and culture as \nthey relate to categorizations of race, law, and power. It began as a \ntheoretical movement within American law schools in the mid- to late \n1980s as a reworking of critical legal studies on race issues and is \nloosely unified by two common themes: \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, CRT proposes that white supremacy and racial power are \nmaintained over time, and in particular, that the law may play a role \nin this process. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, CRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the \nrelationship between law and racial power, and more broadly, pursues \na project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination. \u0014\n\u0014\nScholars important to the theory include Derrick Bell, Patricia \nWilliams, Richard Delgado, Kimberl Williams Crenshaw, Camara Phyllis \nJones, and Mari Matsuda. By 2002, over 20 American law schools and at \nleast three law schools in other countries offered critical race \ntheory courses or classes which covered the issue centrally. Critical \nrace theory is taught and innovated in the fields of education, law, \npolitical science, women's studies, ethnic studies, communication, \nand American studies. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany people believe the critical race theory to be a very important \nview to race and racism in America.\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\nCritical race theory is a way of thinking about Americas history \nthrough the lens of racism. Scholars developed it during the 1970s \nand 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial \nprogress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's \ninstitutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of \nwhite people in society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe architects of the theory argue that the United States was founded \non the theft of land and labor and that federal law has preserved the \nunequal treatment of people on the basis of race. Proponents also \nbelieve race is culturally invented, not biological.\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nCritical race theory (CRT) is an academic movement of civil-rights \nscholars and activists in the United States who seek to critically \nexamine the law as it intersects with issues of race and to challenge \nmainstream liberal approaches to racial justice. CRT examines social, \ncultural and legal issues as they relate to race and racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nCRT originated in the mid-1970s in the writings of several American \nlegal scholars including Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman, Kimberl \nCrenshaw, Richard Delgado, Cheryl Harris, Charles R. Lawrence III, \nMari Matsuda, and Patricia J. Williams. CRT emerged as a movement by \nthe 1980s, reworking theories of critical legal studies (CLS) with \nmore focus on race. As the word \"critical\" suggests, both theoretical \nframeworks are rooted in critical theory, which argues that social \nproblems are influenced and created more by societal structures and \ncultural assumptions than by individual and psychological factors.\u0014\n\u0014\nCRT is loosely unified by two common themes:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, that white supremacy (societal racism) exists and maintains \npower through the law.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, that transforming the relationship between law and racial \npower, and also achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination \nmore broadly, are possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics of CRT argue that it relies on social constructionism, \nelevates storytelling over evidence and reason, rejects the concepts \nof truth and merit, and opposes liberalism.\u0014\n---------------------------------[\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly origins\u0014\nEarly analysis that later consolidated into CRT developed in the \n1970s as legal scholars, activists, and lawyers tried to understand \nwhy civil rights era victories had stalled and were being eroded.[15]\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1980s, students of color at Harvard Law School organized \nprotests regarding Harvard's lack of racial diversity in the \ncurriculum, among students, and in the faculty. These students \nsupported Professor Derrick Bell, who left Harvard Law in 1980 to \nbecome the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. During his \ntime at Harvard, Bell had developed new courses that studied American \nlaw through a racial lens. Harvard students of color wanted faculty \nof color to teach the new courses in his absence.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the university ignored student requests, responding that no \nsufficiently qualified black instructor existed. Legal scholar \nRandall Kennedy noted that some students felt affronted by Harvard's \nchoice to employ an \"archetypal white liberal...in a way that \nprecludes the development of black leadership\". In response, numerous \nstudents, including Kimberl Crenshaw and Mari Matsuda, boycotted and \norganized to develop an \"Alternative Course\" using Bell's Race, \nRacism, and American Law (1973, 1st edition) as a core text. They \nincluded guest speakers Richard Delgado and Neil Gotanda.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpread\u0014\nIn 1995, Gloria Ladson-Billings and William F. Tate began applying \nthe CRT framework in the field of education, moving it beyond the \nfield of legal scholarship. They sought to better understand \ninequities in the context of schooling. Scholars have since expanded \nwork in this context to explore issues including segregation, \nrelations between race, gender, and academic achievement, pedagogy, \nand research methodologies.[23]\u0014\n\u0014\nAs of 2002, over 20 American law schools and at least 3 non-American \nlaw schools offered critical race theory courses or classes which \ncovered the issue centrally.[24] In addition to law, critical race \ntheory is taught and applied in the fields of education, political \nscience, women's studies, ethnic studies, communication, sociology, \nand American studies. A variety of spin-off movements developed that \napply critical race theory to specific groups. These include the \nLatino-critical (LatCrit), queer-critical, and Asian-critical \nmovements. These other groups continued to engage with the main body \nof critical theory research, over time developing independent \npriorities and research methods.[25]\u0014\n\u0014\nViews\u0014\nIn regard to CRT as being \"radical\", Will Oremus argues:[26]\u0014\n\u0014\n[T]he theory [is] radical...in the sense that it questions \nfundamental assumptions.... And unlike some strands of academic and \nlegal thought, critical race theory has an open and activist agenda, \nwith an emphasis on storytelling and personal experience. It's about \nrighting wrongs, not just questing after knowledge.... [M]any of \ntheir ideas are not radical today in the sense of being outside the \nmainstream: Critical race theory is widely taught and studied.\u0014\n\u0014\nDevelopments in the early 2000s in critical race theory include work \nrelying on updated social psychological research on unconscious bias \nin order to justify affirmative action; and work relying on law and \neconomic methodology to examine structural inequality and \ndiscrimination in the workplace.[27]\u0014\n\u0014\nMajor themes\u0014\nMajor themes that are characteristic of work in critical race theory, \nas documented by such scholars as Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, \ninclude:\u0014\n\u0014\nCritique of liberalism: CRT scholars question foundational liberal \nconcepts such as Enlightenment rationality, legal equality, and \nConstitutional neutrality, and challenge the incrementalist, \nstep-by-step approach of traditional civil-rights discourse;[12] they \nfavor a race-conscious approach to social transformation, rejecting \nliberal embrace of affirmative action, color blindness, role \nmodeling, or the merit principle; and an approach that relies more on \npolitical organizing, in contrast to liberalism's reliance on \nrights-based remedies.[28]\u0014\nStorytelling, counter-storytelling, and \"naming one's own reality\": \nThe use of narrative (storytelling) to illuminate and explore \nexperiences of racial oppression.[29] Bryan Brayboy has emphasized \nthe epistemic importance of storytelling in Indigenous-American \ncommunities as superseding that of theory, and has proposed a Tribal \nCritical Race Theory (TribCrit).[30]\u0014\nRevisionist interpretations of American civil rights law and \nprogress: Criticism of civil-rights scholarship and \nanti-discrimination law, such as Brown v. Board of Education. Derrick \nBell, one of CRT's founders, argues that civil-rights advances for \nblack people coincided with the self-interest of white elitists. \nLikewise, Mary L. Dudziak performed extensive archival research in \nthe U.S. Department of State and Department of Justice, including the \ncorrespondence by U.S. ambassadors abroad, and found that U.S. \ncivil-rights legislation was not passed because people of color were \ndiscriminated against. Rather, it was enacted in order to improve the \nimage of the United States in the eyes of third-world countries that \nthe US needed as allies during the Cold War.[31][full citation needed]\u0014\nIntersectional theory: The examination of race, sex, class, national \norigin, and sexual orientation, and how their combination (i.e., \ntheir intersections) plays out in various settings, e.g., how the \nneeds of a Latina female are different from those of a black male and \nwhose needs are the ones promoted.[32]\u0014\nStandpoint epistemology: The view that a member of a minority has an \nauthority and ability to speak about racism that members of other \nracial groups do not have, and that this can expose the racial \nneutrality of law as false.[1]\u0014\nEssentialism vs. anti-essentialism: Delgado and Stefancic write, \n\"Scholars who write about these issues are concerned with the \nappropriate unit for analysis: Is the black community one, or many, \ncommunities? Do middle- and working-class African-Americans have \ndifferent interests and needs? Do all oppressed peoples have \nsomething in common?\" This is a look at the ways that oppressed \ngroups may share in their oppression but also have different needs \nand values that need to be looked at differently. It is a question of \nhow groups can be essentialized or are unable to be essentialized.[33]\u0014\nStructural determinism: Exploration of how \"the structure of legal \nthought or culture influences its content,\" whereby a particular mode \nof thought or widely shared practice determines significant social \noutcomes, usually occurring without conscious knowledge. As such, \ntheorists posit that our system cannot redress certain kinds of \nwrongs.[34]\u0014\nEmpathetic fallacy: Believing that one can change a narrative by \noffering an alternative narrative in hopes that the listener's \nempathy will quickly and reliably take over. Empathy is not enough to \nchange racism as most people are not exposed to many people different \nfrom themselves and people mostly seek out information about their \nown culture and group.[35]\u0014\nNon-white cultural nationalism/separatism: The exploration of more \nradical views that argue for separation and reparations as a form of \nforeign aid (including black nationalism).[29]\u0014\nWhite privilege\u0014\nWhite privilege is the notion of myriad social advantages, benefits, \nand courtesies that come with being a member of the dominant race \n(i.e. white people). For example, a clerk not following a person \naround in a store, or people not crossing the street at night to \navoid a person, are viewed as white privilege.[36]\u0014\n\u0014\nCheryl I. Harris and Gloria Ladson-Billings describe a notion of \nwhiteness as property, whereby whiteness is the ultimate property \nthat whites alone can possess; valuable just like property. In this \nsense, from the CRT perspective, the white skin that some Americans \npossess is akin to owning a piece of property, in that it grants \nprivileges to the owner that a renter (in this case, a person of \ncolor) would not be afforded.[37] The property functions of \nwhitenessi.e., rights to disposition; rights to use and enjoyment, \nreputation, and status property; and the absolute right to \npropertymake the American dream more likely and attainable for \nwhites.\u0014",

    "title": "COULD IT BE IN AMERICA",
    "words": "Could it Be in America?\u0014\nLyndon McDowell May/June 2021     Liberty Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nConsequential circumstances can sometimes be triggered by \ninconsequential events. Given the versatility of wind and weather, it \nmight seem of little consequence that the Mayflower landed at \nPlymouth Rock rather than far to the south near Virginia, but \nnevertheless the event has etched itself deeply into the historical \nconsciousness of the country. The Puritan settlement represented the \nvirility and adventurism of the early American experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the bicentennial celebrations of the landing, Daniel Webster, the \ngreat constitutional lawyer, waxed Ciceronian describing the Pilgrim \nvirtues: Who would wish for other emblazoning of his countrys \nheraldry, or other ornaments of her genealogy, than to be able to say \nthat her first existence was with intelligence, her first breath the \ninspiration of liberty, her first principle the truth of divine \nreligion?1 \u0014\n\u0014\nEloquent indeed. A model for aspiring orators. A subject for study by \nstudents of a country and a history that as yet had not been \nwritten.2 But truth of divine religion? An inspiration of \nliberty? The fruit of intelligence? Or were they, to use a term we \nknow only too well elsewhere in our day, al Qaeda Christians?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn December of 1641 a copy of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties was \nproposed by Puritan leader and lawyer Nathaniel Ward. It is \nrecognized as an important source of rights recognized in the first \nten amendments to the American constitution, or Bill of Rights.3 \nThose early settlers voted a carefully crafted statement defining \ntheir Christian community: \u0014\n\u0014\nThe free fruition of such liberties Immunities and priveledges as \nhumanitie, Civilitie, and Christianitie call for as due to every man \nin his place and proportion; without impeachment and Infringement \nhath ever bene and ever will be the tranquillitie and Stabilitie of \nChurches and Comonwealths. And the deniall or deprivall thereof, the \ndisturbance if not the ruine of both.4\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words ring with intelligence. They exhale the breath of liberty. \nThey resound with the truth of divine religion. But a malefic threat \nis there in which only a prophet would have seen mirrored the fires \nof Smithfield or heard again the tolling bell of St. Bartholomews \nDay. The people were free to believe as long as that belief was in \nharmony with what was believed.5 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Leland (1754-1841), a Baptist minister and an important figure \nin the fight for religious liberty in America, would later warn of \nwhat I suggest is the al Qaeda principle. He listed three principles \nof oppressive governments: those founded on birth and property, those \nfounded on aristocracy, and those that require religious tests to \nensure religious conformity. Of the third one he wrote that it was \nthe error of Constantines government, who first established the \nChristian religion by law, and then proscribed the pagans and \nbanished the Arian heretics. The error also filled the heads of the \nanabaptists in Germany. . . . The same error prevails in the see of \nRome, where his holiness exalts himself above all who are called gods \n. . . , and where no Protestant heretic is allowed the liberty of a \ncitizen. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis principle is also pled for in the Ottoman Empire, where it is \ndeath to call in question the divinity of Mahomet or the authenticity \nof the Alcoran. . . . The same evil has twisted itself into the \nBritish form of government; where . . . no man is eligible to any \noffice, civil or military, without he subscribes to the 39 articles \nand book of common prayer.6\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, the al Qaeda principle is that punishments and disabilities \nare imposed on those who disagree with the states definition of what \nis to be believed and practiced. The argument is simple: Since \nChristianity and the Scriptures are of divine origin, anyone opposed \nto them is guilty of criminal folly. The conclusion was without \nappeal, and its fruit would be despotism. \u0014\n\u0014\nEngland had set many examples. When William Prynne proclaimed \nArchbishop William Laud to be a servant of the pope and the devil, he \nwas jailed, branded on both cheeks, and his ears cut off. 7 Even the \ncaptain of the Mayflower is said to have refused to have a King James \nBible on board his ship. For him and therefore for his passengers as \nwell, the Bishops Bible was the only true Word of God. Thus the \ngenetic religiosity of the Puritans disposed them to a cruel \ndogmatism that infected the colony they founded. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the laws they wrote were expressed as liberties and not in \nthe exact forme of Laws, or Statutes, they added: Yet we do with \none consent fullie Authorise, and earnestly intreate all that are and \nshall be in Authoritie to consider them as laws, and not to faile to \ninflict condigne and proportionable puinishments upon every man \nimpartiallie, that shall infringe or violate any of them.8 \u0014\n\u0014\nCitizens were free to believe and practice as they wished unless it \ndiffered from what the community said was truth. Then some Baptists \narrived and the al Qaeda logic came into play.\u0014\n\u0014\nForasmuch as experience hath plentifully & often proved that since \nthe first arising of the Ana-baptists about a hundred years apart \nthey have been the Incendiaries of Common-Wealths & the Infectors of \npersons in main matters of Religion, & the Troublers of Churches in \nmost places where they have been, & that they who have held the \nbaptizing of Infants unlawful have usually held other errors or \nheresies together therwith (though as hereticks used to doe they have \nconcealed the same until they espied a fit advantage and opportunity \nto vent them by way of question or scruple)such people who appear \nto the Court to be willfully and obstinately to continue, . . . \nshall be sentenced to Banishment.9\u0014\n\u0014\nThe consequences were not of inconsequence for Thomas Gould. In \nOctober 1655 he refused to have his baby sprinkled and christened. \nOver the next three years he was in and out of court, until, finally, \non May 27 he was banished under penalty of perpetual imprisonment. He \nchose imprisonment rather than banishment, but, fortunately for him, \nnews of the proceedings reached England, appeals were made, and he, \nand others with him, were finally released. \u0014\n\u0014\nObadiah Holmes was less fortunate. Tied to a post, he received 30 \nlashes with a three-thronged whip of knotted cord, wielded with both \nhands. The whipping was so severe that when taken back to prison his \nlacerated body could not bear to touch the bed. For many days he was \ncompelled to rest propped up on his knees and elbows.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Fisher and Anne Austin were Quakers who came by ship to Boston. \nSomehow news of their arrival preceded them, and the deputy-governor \nboarded the ship, searched the womens trunks and chests, and took \naway their books and burned them. Soon after the book burning the \nwomen were taken from the ship and imprisoned. Their pens, ink, and \npaper were taken from them. Under pretense of finding out if they \nwere witches or not, they were stripped naked, and their prison \nwindow was boarded up so that there could be no communication with \nanyone outside. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter five weeks of imprisonment they were taken aboard ship again \nand William Chichester, the master of the vessel, was bound by a \n100-pound bond to take them away. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were fortunate. A Vagabond Act stated that any vagabond Quaker \nwas to be tied to a carts tail and flogged through several towns. \nDomiciled Quakers, if they refused to leave, were then treated as \nvagabond. Anne Coleman, Mary Tomkins, and Alice Ambrose were \ncondemned. On a cold winters day the women were stripped from the \nmiddle and upward, and tied to a cart, cruelly whipped with a \ncombined 330 lashes and sent on a journey of some 80 miles. In \nSalisbury, however, the people took pity on them and released them. \u0014\n\u0014\nQuaker Elizabeth Hooton received a similar sentence. In midwinter she \nwas whipped behind a cart through Cambridge, Watertown, and Dedham. \nThe terrible nature of the torture can be visualized in the fact \nthat, being midwinter, the victims wounds became cold and sometimes \nfrozen. This made the torture intolerably agonizing.10 One wonders \nhow a community of Christian people could become so hardened and \ninsensible to true Christian sensibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalem, like most New England settlements, was founded on a popular \ntheocracythe government was in the hands of the church members. The \nCovenant of 1629, composed of only three lines, was the sshortest of \nany. It read: We Covenant with the Lord and one with another; and do \nbind ourselves in the presence of God, to walk together in all his \nwaies, according as he is pleased to reveale himselfe unto us in his \nBlessed word of truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain the al Qaeda principle found expression. John Hathorne, the \ninstigator and judge of witch trials, was described as a very \nreligious man. Mary Eastey was brought before him and accused of \nwitchcraft. Something of the agony of her husband, Isaac, can be felt \nin his later testimony: Mary my wife, he testified, was near five \nmonths imprisoned, all which time I provided maintenance for her at \nmy own cost & charge, I went constantly twice a week to provide for \nher what she needed. Three weeks of this five months she was \nimprisoned at Boston & I was constrained to be at the charge of \ntransporting her to & fro. Mary Eastey was finally hanged on \nSeptember 22, 1692. Before she died, she testified, If it be \npossible, no more innocent blood be shed. . . . I am clear of this \nsin. Hanged with her were Martha Corey, Margaret Scott, Alice \nParker, Ann Pudeator, Wilmott Redd, Samuel Wardwell, and Mary Parker. \u0014\n\u0014\nBetween March of 1692 and October 8 some 20 people were executed for \nthe sin of witchcraft. One of these, Sarah Good, had a nursing child, \nyet was tried and imprisoned for four months and then hanged. The \nchild died in prison. Another child about 5 years old was not only \nimprisoned but also chained. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the impression is held that Salem was a little backwater \nHicksville, this would be incorrect. It had a busy port of \nadventurous sailors and later, after the revolution, became the \nwealthiest city per capita in the United States, with a motto that \nread Divitis Indiae usque ad ultimum sinum (To the rich East Indies \nuntil the last lap).\u0014\n\u0014\nSlowly people began to question the cruelty of such proceedings and \nreparation was given to the families of those who had suffered; some \n578 pounds were paid out. Years later, Hathornes grandson, disgusted \nwith what his grandfather had done and wishing to distance himself \nfrom him, inserted a w into his name and is now remembered as the \nauthor Nathaniel Hawthorne.11\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently the horror of the trials had a salubrious effect. While \ncruel religious laws remained on the statute books, few were followed \nout to the letter. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early colonies religion was not only a vital part of peoples \nlives, but an infrangible aspect of their allegiance to their \nsovereign. William Penn, royal proprietor of the colony of \nPennsylvania, put the matter clearly in 1682:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the great and wise God had made the world, of all his creatures \nit pleased him to chuse man his Deputy to rule it; and to fit him for \nso great a charge and trust, he did not only qualify him with skill \nand power, but with integrity to use them justly. This native \ngoodness was equally his honour and his happiness; and whilst he \nstood there, all went well; there was no need of coercive or \ncompulsive means, the precept of divine love and truth, in his bosom, \nwas the guide and keeper of his innocency.12\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penn is known as a champion of religious liberty, but even he \nlimited that liberty, writing, if there was a disobedient posterity \nthat would not live conformable to the holy law within, and, as a \nresult, they would fall under the reproof and correction of the just \nlaw without, in a judicial administration. Further on in the \ndocument he wrote: So that government seems to me a part of religion \nitself, a thing sacred in its institution and end. Article 35 \ndeclared that all persons living in this province, who confess and \nacknowledge the one Almighty and eternal God, to be Creator, Upholder \nand Ruler of this world . . . shall, in no ways, be molested or \nprejudiced for their religious persuasion. Thus, the liberties were \nnarrowly defined. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penns authority was based on a charter given by King Charles \nII, and was in harmony with English common law.13 People were by \noath in law and conscience obligated to the monarch who was, of \ncourse, placed on his throne by God.14 It is not surprising, then, \nthat the English colonists who settled in America wrote, without \nexception, their state constitutions with English common law in mind. \nAllegiance to the governor was allegiance to the king, and allegiance \nto the king involved how they expressed their religious practices.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that hitherto-inbred loyalty of American citizens to their liege \nlord rapidly withered on the vine. The Revenue Act of 1766, the \nTownshead taxes of 1767, the American Board of Customs, and the \ndiscovery of the Hillsborough letter in 1768 all helped them reassess \ntheir loyalty to the king. The final severance came when the \nso-called Olive Branch Petition, directed not to Parliament but to \nKing George III himself, was contemptuously rejected. In an \nunpublished manuscript Benjamin Franklin expressed the matter clearly:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas, whenever kings, instead of protecting the lives and \nproperties of their subjects, as is their bounden duty, do endeavor \nto perpetrate the destruction of either, they thereby cease to be \nkings, become tyrants, and dissolve all ties of allegiance between \nthemselves and their people.15\u0014\n\u0014\nThe men who assembled in Philadelphia to write a new constitution \nwere lawyers and businessmen, not clergymen. In terms of separation \nof church and state this was no doubt fortunate. A short time after \nWashington was elected as president of the United States the First \nAmendment to the Constitution was voted. It read, in part, Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen the clergy began to make their voices heard. On October 27, \n1789, the First Presbytery Eastward in Massachusetts and New \nHampshire sent President Washington an address in which they \ncomplained that there was no explicit acknowledgment of the only \ntrue God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent inserted somewhere in the \nMagna Charta of our country.16\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years later one of the periodic yellow fever plagues hit \nPhiladelphia, and people were dying at the rate of about 100 per day. \nThe clergy drew their own conclusionGod was angry with the nation.17 \nIn New York City John Mitchell Mason (1770-1829), one of the greatest \npulpit orators of his day, voiced his concern in a sermon entitled \nDivine Judgments. He magnified the irreligious feature of the \nConstitution as one of the chief causes of the calamities of which he \nwas speaking.18\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it went, the past informing the present and an underlie of \nintolerance and persecution.\u0014\n\u0014\n1 In Robert V. Remini, Daniel Webster and His Time (New York: W.

    "title": "C.S. LEWIS,  A PROFILE OF HIS LIFE",
    "words": "C.S. Lewis: A Profile of His Life\u0014\nChristian History \u0014\n\u0014\nIM TALL, FAT, RATHER BALD, red-faced, double-chinned, black-haired, \nhave a deep voice, and wear glasses for reading, C.S. Lewis wrote to \na young admirer in 1954. If the famous author had been prone to \nnotice clothing, he might have added that his trousers were usually \nin dire need of pressing, his jackets threadbare and blemished by \nsnags and food spots, and his shoes scuffed and worn at the heels.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jack, as C.S. Lewiss friends knew him, was not bothered by \nfashion. It is not that he was slovenly. On the contrary, he was \nmeticulous about the precise use of words, the quality of evidence \npresented in arguments, and the meter in verse. Nevertheless, the \nstyle and condition of personal attire was near the bottom of his \nlist of concerns, whereas books and ideas were among his top \npriorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Influences\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis was born into a bookish family of Protestants in Belfast, \nIreland, November 29, 1898. His father, Albert, and his mother, \nFlorence Augusta Hamilton, possessed first-rate minds, and they were \nmembers of the Church of Ireland. Eclectic in their reading tastes, \nthey purchased and read many books, and their love for the printed \nword was passed on to their children. Jack and Warren (his only \nsibling, three years his senior) were not only read to aloud and \ntaught to read, they were encouraged to use the large family library.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his autobiography, Surprised by Joy, C.S. Lewis recalled early \nmemories of endless books. There were books in the study, books in \nthe dining room, books in the cloakroom, books (two deep) in the \ngreat bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as \nhigh as my shoulder in the cistern attic, books of all kinds, he \nremembered, and none were off limits to him. On rainy daysand there \nwere many in northern Irelandhe pulled volumes off the shelves and \nentered into worlds created by authors such as Conan Doyle, E. \nNesbit, Mark Twain, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter brother Warnie was sent off to boarding school in England, Jack \nbecame somewhat reclusive. He spent more time in books and an \nimaginary world of dressed animals and knights in armor. But he \ndid more than read books, he wrote and illustrated his own stories as \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Warren Lewiss exile across the Irish Sea to school in 1905 drove \nJack further into himself and books, his mothers death from cancer \nin 1908 made him even more withdrawn. Mrs. Lewiss death came just \nthree months prior to Jacks tenth birthday, and the young man was \nhurt deeply by her passing. Not only did he lose a mother, his father \nnever fully recovered from her death. For many years thereafter, both \nboys felt estranged from their father, and home life was never warm \nand satisfying again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe death of Mrs. Lewis convinced young Jack that the God he \nencountered in church and in the Bible his mother gave him was, if \nnot cruel, at least a vague abstraction. Four or five years later, by \n1911 or 1912, and with the additional influence of a spiritually \nunorthodox boarding school matron, Lewis forsook Christianity and \nbecame an avowed atheist.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy autumn 1914 C.S. Lewis was somewhat adrift. He had lost his faith \nand his mother, and he felt alienated from his father. He was \nextremely close to his brother, but they saw one another only on \nholidays. A new friendship was beginning with a fellow student, \nArthur Greeves, but it was interrupted in September when C. S. Lewis \nwas sent to Great Bookham, Surrey, to be privately tutored by W.T. \nKirkpatrick, a brilliant teacher and friend of Lewiss father.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Knock, as the Lewis family dubbed Mr. Kirkpatrick, had a \nprofound effect upon the teenaged youth. He introduced him to the \nclassics in Greek, Latin, and Italian literature, and helped him make \na beginning in German. Kirkpatrick not only led Lewis to great books, \nhe pushed him to understand them in the original languages. A most \ndemanding tutor, Kirkpatrick helped Jack learn how to criticize and \nanalyze, and he taught him how to think, speak, and write logically. \nConsequently, after nearly three years with Kirkpatrick, C.S. Lewis \nwas toughminded and widely read. Many years later, Lewis wrote in \nSurpised by Joy that My debt to him is very great, my reverence to \nthis day undiminished.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debt was large indeed. Kirkpatrick helped the young man prepare \nfor scholarship examinations at Oxford, and the demanding mentor \nplayed no small role in Lewiss outstanding performance at University \nCollege, where he took highest honors in honour moderations, greats, \nand English in 1920, 1922, and 1923 respectively.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Kirkpatrick taught Lewis to think criticallyto demand evidence \nfor even the most casual assertions Oxford introduced him to a wide \nhorizon of ideas. Whereas Lewiss hardpressing mentor had helped him \nreinforce his atheism, a few associates at Oxford forced him to \nreexamine his belief in a universe without God.\u0014\n\u0014\nOxford Years\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis entered the world of Oxford in 1917 as a student, and he never \nreally left. Despite an interruption to fight in World War I and his \nprofessorship at Cambridge beginning in 1955, he always maintained \nhis home and friends in Oxford. He loved the bookshops, the pubs, and \nthe Bodleian Library, and he revelled in the company of local men who \nloved to read, write, and discuss books. His attachment to Oxford was \nso strong that when he taught at Cambridge from 1955 to 1963 he \ncommuted back to Oxford on weekends so that he could be close to \nfamiliar places and beloved friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in Oxford that Lewis pursued things of the mind with fervor. \nIdeas, books, and debates were ordinary fare in this heady \nenvironment. With no particular purpose in life beyond stimulating \nhis imagination, feeding his intellectual curiosity, and writing for \npublication and posterity, he thoroughly enjoyed academic life. In \n1919 he published his first book, a cycle of lyrics titled Spirits in \nBondage, which he wrote under the pseudonym Clive Hamilton. In 1924 \nhe became a philosophy tutor at University College. Then in 1925 he \nwas elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, where he tutored in English \nlanguage and literature. The next year his second volume of poetry, \nDymer, was published under the name Clive Hamilton.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlongside the generally selfcentered life Lewis was leading, he \ndemonstrated a loyal and generous nature. When his college roommate, \nPaddy Moore, was killed in World War I, Jack befriended Paddys \nmother, Mrs. Janie King Moore, and her adolescent daughter Maureen. \nThen in 1920, after completing his first degree, Lewis decided to \nshare lodgings with them so that he could more carefully look out for \ntheir needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpiritual Awakening\u0014\n\u0014\nThis gesture of kindness did more than help Mrs. Moore and Maureen; \nit got C.S. Lewis outside of himself and taught him patience. The \nassociation with the Moores also introduced him to Mrs. Moores \nbrother, a combat veteran who suffered from a severe warinflicted \nnervous disorder. This personal encounter apparently shook Lewiss \nconfidence in materialism, because a letter he wrote in 1923 to his \nfriend Arthur Greeves suggests a slight spiritual awakening. It seems \nthat the Doc, as the Moores and Lewis referred to him, came to stay \nwith the trio for three weeks. During the visit Doc underwent an \nordeal of extreme mental torture. After the attack, when the poor \nwretch was hospitalized, Lewis wrote to his friend that Doc had \nbelieved he was in Hell. He wore out his body in the awful mental \ntortures, and then died from heart failure unconscious at the end \nthank God. Lewis concluded his observation by suggesting it is a \ndamned worldand we once thought we could be happy with books and \nmusic!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe spiritual awakening continued, enhanced by reading books by \nGeorge MacDonald and G.K. Chesterton. One MacDonald volume called \nPhantastes had a powerful impact on his thinking. What it actually \ndid to me, wrote Lewis, was to convert, even to baptize my \nimagination. At Oxford Lewis continued to read MacDonald, and he \nimbibed G.K. Chesterton as well. The latter authors books, \nespecially The Everlasting Man, raised serious questions about the \nyoung intellectuals materialism. While MacDonald and Chesterton were \nstirring Lewiss thoughts, a close friend, Owen Barfield, with whom \nhe spent much time during and after their student years, pounced on \nthe logic of Jack Lewiss atheism. Barfield became a theist, and then \na Christian, and he frequently badgered Lewis about his materialism. \nSo did Nevill Coghill, a fellow student and lifelong friend who was \nbrilliant, yet was, to Lewiss amazement, a Christian and a \nthoroughgoing supernaturalist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after joining the English faculty at Magdalen College, Lewis met \ntwo more Christians, Hugo Dyson and J.R.R. Tolkien. These men became \nclose friends of Lewis. He admired their brilliance and their logic. \nSoon Lewis recognized that most of his friends, like his favorite \nauthorsMacDonald, Chesterton, Johnson, Spenser, and Miltonheld to \nthis Christian angle of vision which threatened his whole world view. \nGradually during the 1920s, two paths were converging in Lewiss \nmind: one was reason, the other intuition. In 1929 these roads met, \nand C.S. Lewis surrendered and admitted that God was God, and knelt \nand prayed. Within two years the reluctant convert admitted that \nJesus Christ is the Son of GodGod Incarnate. With this revelation \nthe Oxford don became a communicant in the Church of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nA New Life\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian history shows that when men and women meet Jesus, recognize \nHis Nature, and then decide to trust and follow Him, they become \nstrikingly different people. Those who convertwho turn around and \nobey Christs command to follow me are clearly people with changed \nlives. If evidence of conversion is a new life, C.S. Lewis was \nobviously a believer after 1931. Many changes were apparent. His life \nnow had a purposeto know and obey God. This came to fruition most \ndemonstrably in his writing. Earlier efforts to become a poet were \nlaid to rest. The new Christian devoted his talent and energy to \nwriting prose that reflected his recently found faith. Within two \nyears of his conversion Lewis published The Pilgrims Regress: An \nAllegorical Apology for Christianity, Reason and Romanticism. This \nlittle volume opened a thirty-year stream of books on Christian \napologetics and discipleship that became a lifelong avocation. \nBetween 1933 and his death in 1963, C.S. Lewis wrote books including \nthe seven volume Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, The \nGreat Divorce, and Mere Christianity, that nudged atheists and \nagnostics toward the faith, and encouraged and nurtured believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a good steward and responsible professional, Lewis did not ignore \nhis academic discipline. He wrote literary history and criticism such \nas The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition, \nRehabilitations and Other Essays, and English Literature in the \nSixteenth Century Excluding Drama. These books are still widely read \nand highly regarded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the large quantity and high quality of his academic \npublications, Lewis became known as a literary evangelist. The tone \nand impact of his theological and apologetical books help account for \nthis reputation, as did his own assertion in a rejoinder to his \ncritic, Dr. W.N. Pittenger, published in The Christian Century \nNovember 26, 1958, where Lewis admitted that most of what he wrote \nis evangelistic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA Growing Reputation\u0014\nIf Christianity altered Lewiss writing habits, the publication of \nthose books had a palpable effect on his personal life. First of all, \nthe change was manifested in the mail. Once Lewiss books became \npopular, which they did by the 1940s, he was inundated by letters. \nBecause the famous author believed it was Gods will for him to \nanswer most of this mail himself, and because he was convinced, as he \nsaid in The Weight of Glory, that there are no ordinary people, \nhe took time to write with care to each correspondent regardless of \nage, education, or place in society. This enterprise consumed many \nhours each week.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, life with fame was laden with other pressures. There \nwere numerous invitations to entertain guests, grant interviews, give \nlectures, and preach sermons. Writing, to be sure, is a lonely \nenterprise. This Lewis understood. And even though he felt called by \nGod to write, he likewise felt it was required of him to counsel \nthose who made the pilgrimage to The Kilns, his home on the edge of \nOxford. Frequently he believed it was his calling to explain the \nChristian faith to people over BBC radio, and to the airmen at the \nRAF bases during World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreaching sermons, giving talks, and expressing his theological views \nover the radio throughout the United Kingdom bolstered Lewiss \nreputation and increased his book sales. With these new circumstances \ncame other changesnot the least being a marked upswing in annual \nincome. Throughout the 1920s Lewis had been getting by on little \nmoney. During his student years his father provided an allowance, and \nJack supplemented that in various ways. Nevertheless, money was \nalways scarce. And when the young academician took on the \nresponsibility for Mrs. Moore and her daughter, finances were always \ntight even with the regular tutorial stipend.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs book royalties mounted during the late 1940s, and continued to \nspiral upward thereafter, C.S. Lewis refused to upgrade his standard \nof living. Partly out of disdain for conspicuous living, but mostly \nout of commitment to Jesus Christ, he established a charitable fund \nfor his royalty earnings. Neither the extent nor the recipients of \nC.S. Lewiss charity are fully known. Indeed, he made valiant efforts \nto conceal this information. It is known that he supported numerous \nimproverished families, underwrote education fees for orphans and \npoor seminarians, and put monies into scores of charities and church \nministries.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Late Marriage\u0014\n\u0014\nThe outreach of Lewiss books and the impact of his charity conspired \nto make still another significant change in his lifestyle. During the \nlast decade of his earthly pilgrimage, Lewiss world was invaded by \nan American woman and her two children. In autumn 1952 Joy Davidman \nGresham, who had become a Christian partly because she read The Great \nDivorce and The Screwtape Letters, visited her spiritual mentor in \nEngland. Soon thereafter her husband abandoned her for another woman. \nIn the meantime the divorcee, a writer in her own right, moved to \nLondon with her two adolescent boys, David and Douglas. Joy Davidman \nGreshem gradually fell into financial trouble. Her acquaintance with \nC.S. Lewis led to his underwriting the boarding school education of \nDavid and Douglas. From charity and common literary interests grew a \ndeep friendship, and eventually agape became eros. They were married \nin 1956. Joy was sixteen years Lewiss junior, but that did not \nprevent a happy marriage. A savage case of cancer, however, cut short \ntheir life together. After several years of reprieve from an earlier \nand nearly fatal bout with cancer, Joy Lewis passed away in Oxford \nJuly 13, 1960.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoys entry into Jacks life brought much happiness. As he wrote to \none friend soon after their marriage, Its funny having at 59 the \nsort of happiness most men have in their twenties ...  Thou hast \nkept the good wine till now.  Joy brought C.S. Lewis love, \ncompanionship, and two stepsons, complete with all of the delights \nand problems that naturally come in such circumstances. Furthermore, \nMrs. Lewis brought insights, ideas, and a new angle of vision. Raised \nin a Jewish home, and having written a book on the Ten Commandments, \nSmoke on the Mountain, she encouraged him to renew his writing of \napologetics, in particular Reflections on the Psalms. Her influence \non what Jack considered his best book, Till We Have Faces, was so \nprofound that he told one close friend she was actually his co-author.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics Emerge\u0014\n\u0014\nC.S. Lewiss marriage to Joy Davidman did not enhance his reputation \nin Great Britian. Long assumed to be a confirmed bachelor, the \nesteemed professor not only married late in life, he married an \nAmerican who was at once Jewish, divorced, and personally rather \nabrasive. In brief, the marriage did not set well with most of Mr. \nLewiss friends and acquaintances. The critics notwithstanding, \nJacks faithful brother Warren who lived at The Kilns with Jack \nbefore, during, and after the years with Joysupported him, as did a \nfew other close friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nC.S. Lewis was hurt by the disapproval of his old friends and \ncolleagues, but it was by no means a new experience for him. Although \nhe enjoyed the conviviality of weekly gettogethers with fellow \nInklings (intellectuals and writers who met regularly to exchange \nideas and share in good conversation), and the prodigious successes \nof his books, Lewis was frequently under attack for his decidedly \nChristian lifestyle. Close friends, among them Owen Barfield and \nJ.R.R. Tolkien, openly disapproved of Lewiss evangelistic speaking \nand writing. And if the opprobrium of fellow believers was \nunpleasant, it was mild compared with the attacks from colleagues and \nstrangers who did not share the Oxford authors faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is common knowledge that Lewiss Christian books caused so much \ndisapproval that he was more than once passed over for a \nprofessorship at Oxford, with the honors going to men of lesser \nreputation. It was Magdalene College at Cambridge University that \nfinally honored Lewis with a chair in 1955 and thereby recognized his \noriginal and important contributions to English literary history and \ncriticism. Along with Lewiss international reputation, ever-growing \nroyalties, and thousands of fans throughout the English-speaking \nworld, came increasing alienation. Did Lewis take comfort in his \nLords warning in the Sermon on the Mount that his disciples would \nindeed be insulted and persecuted? We do not know.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis died at The Kilns on November 22, 1963. He is buried beside his \nbrother, who lived ten more years, in the cemetery of Holy Trinity \nChurch, Headington Quarry, Oxford. His letters and books, and the \nlives these writings touch, are his legacy. CH\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Lyle W.

    "words": "Clara Maass Died to End Yellow Jack\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  May 3, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nClara Maass was just 25 when she died in Cuba in 1901. In 1976, the \nUnited States issued a stamp commemorating the Lutheran nurse. \nLutherans honor her on August 13, calling her a \"Renewer of Society.\" \nWhat did she do to attain these honors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of ten children in a German immigrant family, Clara became \na caring person. She worked as a mother's helper during her high \nschool years, then in an orphanage. At seventeen, she entered the \nnewly opened Christina Trefz Training School of Nurses and was one of \nits first graduates. She must have been very good at what she did, \nfor by the age of 21, she had become the school's head nurse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, life held out a chance \nof even greater service to Clara. She became a contract nurse with \nthe American armies. Her competent presence was felt in Georgia, \nFlorida, Cuba, and the Philippines. She found herself fighting \nmalaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases more often than \ngunshots wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the war, the United States set out to find the cause of \"yellow \njack\"-- yellow fever. Clara, having nursed patients with this deadly \ndisease, and she wanted to see it overcome. She volunteered to be \npart of an experiment to understand the fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo rival theories held the field. The first considered yellow fever \nthe result of filthy conditions. The second attributed it to mosquito \nbites.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder experiments conducted by Walter Reed, a team tested both \ntheories. Men lived in filth without exposure to mosquitoes. They did \nnot contract yellow fever. Other subjects offered themselves to be \nbitten by mosquitoes. Some of them came down with fever. One of them \nwas Clara, who contracted a mild case.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas she now immune? Some thought so. Others thought the case was too \nmild to build immunity. On August 14th, 1901, Clara submitted to a \nsecond mosquito bite. Soon she had a bad case of the fever. Ten days \nlater she died. Her case clinched the matter: a mosquito was the \ncarrier of the disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Clara was buried with military honors, no fuss was made over \nher until thirty years later when another nurse stumbled across the \nfacts, researched her story and raised funds for a memorial. Much \nlater, in honor of her brave self-sacrifice, the United States issued \nthe stamp shown here. Clara, by the way, was the first nurse honored \non a U.S. postage stamp. If yellow fever does not threaten the world \ntoday as it did a century ago, it is in part owing to the Christian \ncourage of Clara Maass.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Clara Maass.\" Their Stamp on History. \nhttp://www.stamponhistory.com/people/maass.html\u0014\nDock, Lavinia L and Stewart, Isabel M.

    "title": "COSMA LOVED AS A PREACHER, LOATHED FOR MARKET REFORMS",
    "words": "COSMAS WAS LOVED AS A SAINT BUT LOATHED FOR HIS MARKET REFORMS\u0014\n \u0014\nImagine having a Christian testimony so effective that your enemies \nput a bounty of over one million dollars on your head. That happened \nto Cosmas Aitolos (also known as Cosmas of Aetolia). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Cosmas was born, the Turks controlled much of Greece and the \nBalkans. Formerly Orthodox people had become isolated in mountain \nvalleys, and scholars and educators had fled to safer lands. \nKnowledge of history was lost. Although some teachers made attempts \nto awaken the common people and restore a measure of Christian \nknowledge, none succeeded. The failure of revolutions against the \nTurks brought Christians to despair. Many converted to Islam to make \ntheir lives easier. \u0014\n\u0014\nCosmas sought an education. Eventually this brought him to Mt. Athos, \nGreece, an important center of monastic learning. Under Eugenios \nVoulgaris he and several other students, seeing the threat to \nOrthodoxy and their nation, unanimously agreed in the name of the \nHoly Trinity to help the nation in the spread of literacy. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor Cosmas, this was no idle vow. After ten years of study at Mt. \nAthos, he became a monk at the monastery of Philotheos and eventually \npriest to the monks. Meanwhile, his desire to evangelize among the \nGreeks grew more intense. Aware of the enormity of the undertaking, \nhe opened the Scriptures, asking for a word. His eyes lit upon 1 \nCorinthians 10:24: Let no one seek his own, but each one his \nneighbors good. Reassured, he sought and received the blessing of \nPatriarch Seraphim of Constantinople. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Cosmas was no more successful than earlier preachers. \nHowever he persisted and made sure to speak in simple terms that \nuneducated peasants could understand. He lived frugally and showed no \ndesire for worldly goods. Eventually his hearers began to respond as \nhe called them to put off their sins and live in unity. He prophesied \nthat the day would come when they would throw off the yoke of Islam. \nTo hasten the arrival of that day they needed to return to Christ and \neducate themselves. He demanded a high standard from priests: In \nthis consists the task of the priestto lay down his whole life and \nhead for the good of Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually he became so well-known he could go nowhere without crowds \nflocking around him. He reminded them that a single soul is worth \nmore than the entire world. Therefore, Christians should seek to read \nand understand their faith. In a sermon, he told his followers, \u0014\n\u0014\nI have found the words and the commandments of Christ pure, holy, \ntrue, splendid, brighter than the sun; and whoever believes in Christ \nand calls Him God and lives in accordance with His teaching, \ncontained in the Holy Gospels, is fortunate and thrice blessed. \u0014\nCosmas founded dozens of schools himself, including two for \neducators, and inspired hundreds of localities to provide teachers \nfrom their own resources. More importantly, he led a revival of \nOrthodox faith and he restored hope. Some listeners could remember \nthe gist of his sermons decades later and passed his prophecies to \ntheir children and to their childrens children. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the reforms the saintly preacher inspired was the cessation of \nbuying and selling on Sunday, which ought to be a day for communion \nwith God and fellow Christians. The drop off in trade infuriated \nmerchants, especially Jews, who suffered when market day was moved to \nSaturday, their sabbath. Village elders resented their loss of \nauthority as people began to think for themselves. A combination of \nenemies bribed a local Turkish authority in modern-day Albania to \nexecute Cosmas. On this day, 24 August 1779, Kurt Pasha hung the \npreacher and flung his body into the Aps River. Cosmass followers \npulled the corpse from the water and buried it with honors. Many \nGreeks added Cosmas to their family names, and today he is regarded \nas a saint in Greece and regions of the Balkans.\u0014",

    "words": "By ACI Africa\u0014\n\u0014\nSub-Saharan Africa, 13 September, 2021 / 10:15 am (ACI Africa).\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Antioch, c. 347, Saint John Chrysostom (Golden-mouthed) was \nperhaps the greatest preacher in the history of the Church, thus the \nname given him, and the most prominent Greek father of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe grew up in Antioch, received an excellent classical Greek \neducation, and upon meeting the holy bishop Meletus, he decided to \ndevote his time to the study of religious works and the Sacred \nScriptures. He received Baptism after three years of study and set \nout for the desert to live the ascetic life of a hermit.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn lived in extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375; he \nspent the next two years continually standing, scarcely sleeping, and \ncommitting the Bible to memory. As a consequence of these practices, \nhis stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health \nforced him to return to Antioch.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis extreme mortifications left him in fragile health, and he thus \nreturned to Antioch after two years of recovery, and devoted himself \nto studying for the priesthood. He was ordained in 386 and served in \nthe Cathedral of Antioch for 12 years, winning widespread fame for \nhis sublime preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 398 he was forcefully appointed Patriarch of Constantinople, and \nfast became very popular with his flock through his example of \npreaching and courage in front of the imperial power, whose \ncorruption and decadence he never shirked from criticizing in public.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the autumn of 397, John was appointed archbishop of \nConstantinople, after having been nominated without his knowledge by \nthe eunuch Eutropius. He had to leave Antioch in secret due to fears \nthat the departure of such a popular figure would cause civil unrest.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his time as archbishop he adamantly refused to host lavish \nsocial gatherings, which made him popular with the common people, but \nunpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy. His reforms of the \nclergy were also unpopular. He told visiting regional preachers to \nreturn to the churches they were meant to be servingwithout any \npay-out.[29] Also he founded a number of hospitals in Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis attitude naturally made an enemy of the empress, Eudoxia as well \nas Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, who had him condemned on false \ncharges in 403. He was exiled to Armenia where he continued to be a \ngreat presence in the Church of the East through his many letters. He \nwas exiled from Armenia to an isolated place along the Black Sea. He \ndied September 13 during the journey in 407 in Pontus, his ill health \nunable to endure its rigors.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 438 the Emperor Theodosius II of Constantinople had Johns body \nreturned to Constantinople, and did penance for the sins of his \nmother Eudoxia.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrysostom's many writings, especially homilies and commentaries on \nthe Gospels, are still extant and have exerted great influence over \nthe centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Roman Catholic Church he is recognized as a Doctor of the \nChurch.\u0014",

    "title": "CARDINAL NICHOLAS WAS BRILLIANT, MYSTICAL AND FLAWED",
    "words": "CARDINAL NICHOLAS OF CUSA WAS BRILLIANT, MYSTICAL, AND FLAWED\u0014\n\u0014\nOn  21 September 1451, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa ordered Jews of \nArnhem (in the Eastern Netherlands) to register at the office of the \nburgomaster (magistrate) and wear a yellow badge. He forbade them to \nengage in usury or to loan money to Christians. His instructions came \nin a sermon on absolution. No Christian could receive absolution who \npermitted a usury-practicing Jew to live beside or below him. His \nrules enforced, and even exceeded, laws that originated in previous \ncenturies, including a canon (church law) of the Fourth Lateran \nCouncil (1215) that had required Jews and Muslims to wear distinctive \ndress. At the same time, Cusa sternly forbade anyone to injure a Jew \nnight or day, openly or by stealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nCusa, as papal legate, had issued similar instructions throughout \nGermany that same year. His aim was not only to end moneylending for \ninterest but also to prevent intermarriage between Jews and \nChristians. Pope Nicholas V, however, did not stand by his legates \nactions, rescinding some of his decrees. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his decrees about Jews, one might assume Cusa was a \nclosed-minded bigot. Actually he was a peacemaker, reformer, and \nthinker with wide interests. Two years after issuing his orders \nrequiring badges, he authored De Pace Fidei (On the Peace of Faith) \nwhich sought common ground between Christians, Jews, and \nMuslimsalthough the two non-Christian faiths found it unacceptable \nbecause it insisted on Trinitarian doctrine. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in the first year of the fifteenth century, Nicholas of Cusa \nbecame the greatest German thinker of his generation. He stepped \noutside the scholastic mold of his predecessors, writing many \ninnovative books of theology, mysticism, mathematics, science, and \nphilosophy. He suggested an experiment to prove air has weight. He \ndemonstrated that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery. That \ndocument pretended to give the Lateran Palace and other lavish gifts \nto the pope and had often been invoked to support papal claims of \nlordship over central Italy.\u0014\n\u0014\nEver a peace-seeker, Cusa was among those who sought to reconcile the \neastern and western branches of Christianity. He tried to bring the \npapacy into agreement with the Council of Basel. Like his attempts to \nbring the monotheistic religions into mutual tolerance, his efforts \nto reconcile divisions in Christianity failed. As a reformer, \nhowever, he touched many raw nerves. While bishop of Brixen, he even \nfound himself imprisoned when Duke Sigmund of Tyrol attempted to \nforce concessions from the church. The pope excommunicated Sigmund, \nbut Cusa left Brixen, never to return.\u0014\n\u0014\nCusas reforms did not persist, but his mystical speculations arrived \nat interesting conclusions that came into their own in later \ncenturies.\u0014",

    "words": "FIRST CISNERO RECANTED, THEN RESISTED THE INQUISITION\u0014\n\u0014\nON MAUNDY THURSDAY, March 23, 1559, inquisitors raided a Protestant \nmeeting in Toro, Spain. Among the secret worshipers captured in the \nraid were Antonio Herrezuelo and his wife of five years, Leonor de \nCisneros.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical ideas had come to that part of Spain largely through the \nefforts of Carlos de Seso, mayor of Toro. Such ideas were dangerous \nto hold because in 1554 Pope Paul IV had granted the Inquisition \npower to execute even those who had recanted their Lutheran \nbeliefs. (Those who held Protestant beliefs were all called \nLutherans in Spain, without distinction between different shades of \nnon-Catholic belief.) \u0014\n\u0014\nHeld in isolation, twenty-three-year-old Leonor was told that her \nhusband and the other captives had recanted. In fact he had notas \nshe soon learned. She was threatened with the rack and the stake if \nshe held onto her heretical views.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 8 October that year, all the heretics were led to the auto da \nfe. Twelve who made a last minute repentance would still be burned \nbut with the merciful provision that they would be strangled first. \nNot Antonio. He had stood so firm that he was to burn alive. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeonor and he met on the way to the stake. She saw that he wore the \ngarb of one who was to burn. He saw that she was dressed in the garb \nof a penitent. Furious that she had reneged, he kicked her and \ndemanded to know if her renunciation was all the value she placed on \nthe Christian teaching he had given her. Aghast, Leonor did not reply.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the procession passed through the streets, Antonio sang psalms and \nrecited passages from the Bible. His captors could not endure this \nwitness and clamped his tongue to prevent him expressing his faith. \nPaulo Tiepolo, Venetian ambassador to King Philip II of Spain, \nwitnessed the burning and wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nThe baccalaureate Herezuello de Torro, condemned to confiscate his \nproperty and burn. He was burned alive, insisting on his heresy, \ngagged all the time, never acknowledging the Holy Church of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words of her husband and his brave death steeled Leonors mind. \nWhen she returned to her cell, she fell to her knees and implored God \nto forgive what she had done. She had been sentenced to imprisonment \nin a Benedictine monastery to be re-educated in the Catholic faith. \nHowever, she now resisted, declaring herself a Lutheran; and despite \nseveral long years of brainwashing and torture she never buckled. \nFinally after nine years her captors realized she was not going to \nyield to their demands and they condemned her to die as a heretic.\u0014\n\u0014\nA local historian accused her of inviting death on herself, \nobserving, Nothing could shake the obstinacy of this stubborn \nwoman! On this day, 26 September 1568, thirty-three-year-old Leonor \nde Cisneros walked to the stake in Valladolid. There she was burned \nalive, suffering as courageously for her faith as had her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Columbus Landed in America\u0014\n\u0014\nTierra! Tierra! The men had been on the sea for over thirty days \nwithout sight of land. Now land was in plain view. All the despair \nand gloom immediately gave way to excitement and hope as the three \nlittle ships drew closer and closer to the shore on this day, October \n12, 1492.\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably every American school child old enough to study history has \nheard the little rhyme, \"In October, 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean \nblue\", and the story has often been told of Columbus' dream of \nfinding the East or Asia by sailing west. Columbus is often held up \nas an example of someone who set goals for himself and would not give \nup when obstacles to achieving those goals came his way -- he waited \nat the Spanish court six years before King Ferdinand and Queen \nIsabella agreed to sponsor his voyage. He persuaded his men to \ncontinue their westward voyage even when they threatened mutiny \nbecause they had not yet reached the expected islands of the Orient. \nCertainly Columbus is a model of determination and courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, the man was much more complex than the stories often reveal. \nChristopher was a very devout Catholic who observed all the fasts of \nthe church and prayed regularly. His very name Christopher, which \nmeans Christ-bearer, he understood as a title of his destiny to carry \nthe message of the gospel to far-off lands. He diligently searched \nthe Scriptures and thought he found assurance for a call to sail to \nthe far reaches of the globe with the Christian message. Zechariah \n9:10 said that \"he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his \ndominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to \nthe ends of the earth. And Psalm 107:23-24 promised that \"They that \ngo down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These \nsee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher was particularly concerned with the power of the Ottoman \nTurks who controlled the eastern Mediterranean and were threatening \nEurope. If a way could be found of reaching India by sailing West, \nthe Turks could be attacked from behind and perhaps the Holy Land \nitself could be rescued from their hands. Yes, Columbus was \ninterested in trade and riches, but Christian concern also lay behind \nhis plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen land was sighted on this day October 12, 1492, in recognition of \nthe divine aid in his voyage, Columbus named the land San Salvador, \nwhich means Holy Savior, and prayed,\u0014\n\u0014\nO Lord, Almighty and everlasting God, by Thy holy Word Thou hast \ncreated the heaven, and the earth, and the sea; blessed and glorified \nbe Thy Name, and praised be Thy Majesty, which hath designed to use \nus, Thy humble servants, that Thy holy Names may be proclaimed in \nthis second part of the earth.\u0014\nIn keeping with the Christian motive underlying his mission, Columbus \nat first showed great concern for how the natives, whom he called \nIndians, were treated. He wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nSo that they might be well-disposed towards us, for I knew that they \nwere a people to be delivered and converted to our holy faith rather \nby love than by force, I gave to some red caps and to others glass \nbeads, which they hung around their neck, and many other things...I \nbelieve that they would easily be made Christians, for it seemed to \nme that they had no religion of their own.\u0014\nAll the same, Columbus' concern for the salvation of these people was \ncoupled with an attitude of superiority which saw nothing wrong in \nforcibly capturing the people and making them slaves of the \nEuropeans. And the missionary drive which was prominent during his \nfirst voyage, in later voyages became subordinate to his love of \nwealth and position. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, Columbus was not the last to lose sight of his \nspiritual goals when tempted with wealth and power.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBandelier, Ad.

    "title": "CONSTANTINE ADOPTED THE SIGN OF THE CROSS",
    "words": "Constantine Adopted the Sign of the Cross\u0014\n \u0014\nONE OF THE MOST significant battles in world history took place on \nthis day, 28 October 312 after Constantine had a vision. His father \nConstantius had been co-emperor of the Western Roman empire. Upon his \ndeath, his troops proclaimed thirty-two year-old Constantine emperor. \nHowever, the other co-emperor, Maxentius, was determined to hold \nItaly and Africa for himself. In order to claim the empire, \nConstantine would have to defeat Maxentius. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurch historian Eusebius recorded Constantines account of the \nvision. Eusebius admitted it would be hard to believe if Constantine \nhad not sworn to its truth with an oath: Constantine was praying to \nhis fathers [pagan] god, beseeching him to tell him who he was and \nimploring him to stretch out his right hand to help him in his \npresent difficulties. While he was fervently praying, an incredible \nsign appeared to him from heaven.... He said that about noon, when \nthe day was already beginning to decline, he saw with his own eyes \nthe trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, and an \ninscription that said Conquer by This attached to it. Seeing this, \nhe and his army, which . . . witnessed the miracle, were struck with \namazement. \u0014\n\u0014\nPondering the meaning of this sign, Constantine fell asleep. He \nclaimed Christ appeared to him in a dream and commanded him to make a \nlikeness of the sign which he had seen in the heavens and use it as a \nsafeguard in his encounters with his enemies. Next day, Constantine \nordered his soldiers to decorate their shields with the sign of the \ncross and advance on Rome. At that point, Maxentius made a big \nmistake. He came out of Romes walls where he could have withstood \nConstantine indefinitely. He ordered the Milvian Bridge destroyed so \nConstantine could not use it and constructed a pontoon bridge to \nsupport his own troops. He then met Constantine on the outer bank of \nthe Tiber. Constantine drove Maxentius back to the river bank, where \nhis men rushed the pontoon bridge to escape, causing it to collapse. \nMaxentius drowned. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe victorious Constantine did not neglect to honor the Christian \nGod. He ended official Roman persecution of Christians, built \nchurches, elevated bishops, and presided over the first church \ncouncil since the days of the apostles. The emperors adherence to \nChristianity was mixed, however. His coins depicted him with the god \nSol Invictus, and he issued a proclamation making Sunday the Roman \nday of rest. On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and \npeople residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. \nNonetheless, Constantine was baptized on his deathbed, the first \nRoman emperor to embrace Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Clement's Date for Christ's Birth\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen was Jesus born in Bethlehem? The Bible tells us with certainty \nthe fact of Jesus' birth and the place. But not the exact date. \nAlthough many Christians celebrate Christ's birthday on December \n25th, it has not always been so. In fact, one of the early church \nfathers, Clement of Alexandria speculated that Christ was born on \nthis day, November 17, 3 BC!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the earliest church there seems to have been no celebration of \nJesus' birth. Instead, each Sunday was a celebration of Christ's \nresurrection. The Jewish festivals of Passover and Pentecost \ncontinued to be celebrated by Jewish converts within the church for a \ntime since they were closely associated with Christ's death and \nresurrection. In the third century, some churches in the east began \nto celebrate January 6 as the Epiphany, the time that Christ revealed \nhimself to the people as the Messiah. Jesus' incarnation--when God \nbecame man--was also commemorated at this time.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany speculated that since shepherds were in the field the night \nChrist was born, it must have been in spring or summer. Some said May \n20; others fixed the date on April 19th or 20th. Still others thought \nMarch 25th most likely. No one really knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is written evidence that by 354, the Bishop of Rome was \nobserving December 25th as the date of Christ's birth. Four major \nRoman festivals were held in December, including Saturnalia which \ncelebrated the returning Sun-god. Some thing these were adapted to \nthe Christian celebration of the coming of the Son of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christianity expanded in Europe, the followers of Christ continued \nto celebrated December 25th as Christmas, and as each nationality \nconverted to Christianity it brought its own customs to the \ncelebration. But if Clement of Alexandria were still alive today he \nprobably would be wishing us a \"Merry Christmas\" on this day.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For the sake of each of us he laid down his life--worth no less than \nthe universe.

    "title": "CASTELLO PAID A HIGH PRICE CONFRONTING JOHN CALVIN",
    "words": "CASTELLIO PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR CONFRONTING CALVINS INTOLERANCE\u0014\n \u0014\nHORRIFIED by the cruelty of the Inquisition and longing for religious \nfreedom, the scholar Sebastian Castellio left Lyons, France, for \nStrasbourg, where prominent reformer John Calvin was staying. \nCastellio was drawn to Calvin because of his scholarship, evidenced \nin his Institutes of the Christian Religion. Calvin in turn was \nimpressed with Castellio and invited him to Geneva when that city \nasked Calvin to return.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the autocratic Calvin soon discovered Castellio had an \nindependent mind and grew hostile toward him. Castellio was \ntranslating the Bible into Latin and French from the original \nlanguages. Printers hesitated to publish without Calvins approval. \nAs Calvin had authorized another French translation and written its \npreface, he was furious with Castellio. Permission would not be \nforthcoming unless Castellio agreed to let Calvin make whatever \nchanges he saw fit. Castellio, who was not inferior to Calvin in \nscholarship, would not agree. Consequently, Castellio was permitted \nonly a low-paying position in Geneva.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenevas council recognized his worth even if Calvin didnt. He was \nthe only Genevan clergyman who volunteered to visit plague victims \nduring an epidemic in 1543 after the death of one their number from \nthe disease. Calvin wouldnt, declaring it would not do to weaken \nthe whole Church in order to help a part of it. Other pastors also \nfound excuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 15 December 1543, council members recommended that \nCastellio be appointed as one of the citys preachers. Despite the \nCouncils unanimous recommendation, Calvin vetoed the appointment, \nhinting there were serious objections to Castellio. When pressed, he \ncould point to only two offenses: Castellio believed the Song of \nSolomon was a secular love poem, not an analogy of Christ and his \nbride, the church, as Calvin taught; and Castellio differed from \nCalvin on what the Bible meant when it said Christ descended into \nhell.\u0014\n\u0014\nCastellio resigned his positions in Geneva and sought work elsewhere \nto provide for his family. But Calvin now became Castellios \nimplacable foe. He blocked Castiellos appointment anywhere in \nReformed territories. Calvin wrote to Lausanne, for example, that \nCastiello was a blasphemer who was saying, The God of Calvin is a \nliar, a hypocrite, two-faced, the author of all evil, the enemy of \njustice, and worse than the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile Castellio supported himself through poorly paid work as a \ntranslator and proofreader. He even dug ditches and hauled logs out \nof the Rhine. But he considered his integrity worth the suffering. \nCalvin managed to block some of Castellios books from seeing print. \n(An early exception was Sacred Dialogues in Latin and French, a book \nof Bible stories retold for children to emphasize humane \nconsideration for others. It went through many editions.) Finally, \nafter eight years, Castellio obtained a position teaching Greek in \nBasel.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving suffered his own persecution at the hand of Calvin, Castellio \nsympathized with Michael Servetus when the Genevan Council, at the \ninstigation of Calvin, arrested Servetus illegally, put him on trial, \nand burned him to death for his views on the Trinity. Under a \npseudonym, Castellio wrote Concerning Heretics, Should They Be \nPersecuted?urging religious toleration. \u0014\n\u0014\nLater, in answer to Calvins justification of killing Servetus, \nCastiello wrote another book pointing out Calvins faults and \ndeploring his murder of Servetus, whose errors he rejected while \ndefending his right to hold them. To kill a man is not to defend a \ndoctrineit is to kill a man. He defended himself vigorously against \nlibels by Calvin and Theodore Beza, although his responses often \ncould not find publishers, sometimes even into the twentieth century. \nDifferences of religious opinion being impossible to avoid, he \npleaded that Christians live by the law of love:\u0014\n\u0014\nO Christ, Creator and King of the world do You see and approve these \nthings? Have You become a totally different person from what You \nwere? When You were on earth, nothing could be more gentle and kind, \nmore ready to suffer injuries. You were like a sheep dumb before the \nshearers. Beaten, spit upon, mocked, crowned with thorns, crucified \nbetween thieves, You prayed for those who injured You. ... Do You \n[now] command that those who do not understand Your ordinances and \ncommandments . . . should be drowned, or drawn and quartered, and \nburned at the stake?\u0014\n\u0014\nCastellio even quoted an earlier plea by Calvin for religious \ntolerance, highlighting Calvins about-face. Enraged that Castellio \nwould challenge their theology and point out their discrepancies, \nCalvin and Beza arranged a denunciation of Castellio for heresy. \nBefore Castellio could be brought to trial in Basel, he died of heart \nfailure. He was only forty-eight years old. Many turned out to honor \nhim in death who hardly dared side with him in life. Today he is \nrecognized as a major innovatorthe first significant Protestant \nvoice raised in behalf of religious tolerance on the ground of \nconscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "[Marital therapist John] Gottman calls contempt sulfuric acid for \nlove. However, it doesnt just destabilize our relationships and our \npolitics. Gottman tells me that it also causes a comprehensive \ndegradation of our immune systems. It damages self-esteem, alters \nbehavior, and even impairs cognitive processing. According to the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the feeling of rejection, so \noften experienced after being treated with contempt, increases \nanxiety, depression, jealousy, and sadness and reduces performance \non difficult intellectual tasks. Being treated with contempt takes a \nmeasurable physical toll. Those who routinely feel excluded have \npoorer sleep quality, and their immune systems dont function as \nwell as those of people who dont suffer contemptuous treatment.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs important, contempt isnt just harmful for the person being \ntreated poorly. It is also harmful for the contemptuous person, \nbecause treating others with contempt causes us to secrete two stress \nhormones, cortisol and adrenaline. The consequence of constantly \nsecreting these hormones  the equivalent of living under significant \nconsistent stress  is staggering. Gottman points out that people in \ncouples who are constantly battling die 20 years earlier, on average, \nthan those who consistently seek mutual understanding. Our contempt \nis inarguably disastrous for us, let alone the people we are holding \nin contempt.\u0014\n\u0014\nArthur Brooks, Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America \nfrom the Culture of Contempt  (HarperCollins, 2019), 26.\u0014",

Corrie Ten Boom \nalmost forgot to react when she heard her name, as she was so used to \nresponding to prisoner number 66730 instead. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a prisoner because she and her sister had worked with the \nunderground resistance in her native Holland, sheltering Jews from \nthe Germans during World War II. Resistance workers had built a \nsecret compartment in her bedroom to hide Jews from the Germans.\u0014\n \u0014\nOn the morning of her arrest in February 1944, she was suffering from \nthe flu. Her sister Betsie gave her a cup of tea and told her that a \nman was at the door, asking for help. Ten Boom dragged herself down \nthe stairs. She did not recognize the man and his eyes would not meet \nhers. He pleaded for money to bribe the police so he could free his \nwife, whom he claimed had been arrested for hiding Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nLater that day, the Gestapo arrived. The Jews managed to dive into \ntheir hiding place before Ten Boom shut its disguised door. The \nGestapo searched the house and interrogated the Ten Booms, but could \nnot find the secret compartment. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon the Ten Boomsfather Willem, Betsie, and Corriewere headed to \nprison. Their father died just ten days after his incarceration \nbegan. In prison, the two sisters clung to God, strengthening \nthemselves with the thought that His will was their hiding place. \nThey shared with others the faith that had made them risk their lives \nto protect Jews from the Nazis. Ten Boom had been able to sneak her \nBible past searching guards. Thanks to swarms of fleas in her \nbarracks, the guards did not search her bed or enter the room any \nmore than necessary, and she was able to read to the other prisoners. \nSome became Christians.\u0014\n \u0014\nIn December, Betsie died. Two days later, an officer handed Corrie a \ncertificate of discharge. (After the war, she learned her discharge \nhad been the result of a clerical error.) However, she quickly \nlearned she was not really free to go. Only reasonably healthy \nindividuals were allowed out. Because of swelling in her legs, she \nwould have to remain in the hospital until she was better. The \nhospital was a scene from Dantes Inferno. Although she desperately \nwanted to prop up her feet to ease her swelling, she hobbled around, \nhelping patients who could not walk. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 30 December 1944, the gates finally opened to release \nTen Boom to a waiting train. There she discovered her ration card had \neither been lost or stolen and she travelled several days without \nfood. When she finally reached the Netherlands, she was dizzy from \nhunger and could hardly stand.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs soon as she recovered a little, Ten Boom began to speak for the \nLord, telling others the lessons of obedience, forgiveness, and trust \nshe had learned in the concentration camps. You can never learn that \nChrist is all you need, until Christ is all you have, she said. \nThrough the generosity of a rich woman, she was able to open a home \nfor survivors of the camps. Later, she became a tramp for the Lord, \nspreading the Gospel around the world. She told her story in The \nHiding Place.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

The coast \nguard had warned him that a U-boat was prowling the shipping lane off \nthe coast of Newfoundland. As icy night fell, he ordered the troops \nhe was ferrying to turn in with their life vests on in case the ship \nwas torpedoed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the 902 men aboard the ship ignored the order. The hold was \nhot and the life jackets were too bulky to sleep in. Their \ndisobedience cost many of them their lives. Four who obeyed the \ncaptain's command were the ship's chaplains.\u0014\n\u0014\nLt. George L. Fox, a Methodist; Lt. Alexander D. Goode, a Jew; Lt. \nJohn P. Washington, a Roman Catholic; and Lt. Clark V. Poling, Dutch \nReformed, had befriended the homesick and seasick men of the \ntroopship. Now they were to be put to a severe test.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 12:55 a.m. on this day, February 3, 1943, the German U-boat \nlaunched a torpedo at the Dorchester. The bomb hit with deadly \naccuracy well below the water line. Many men were killed outright by \nthe explosion. Others were flung wounded and screaming to the floor. \nAmmonia gas swirled through the hold, strangling others. In the \ndarkness and cold, men struggled to find their way out. Above the \ndin, the chaplains could be heard calming the men, comforting them, \nurging them to be brave and directing them where to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was evident the ship could not stay afloat. The captain gave the \norder to abandon ship. Men scrambled for life boats, overloading \nthem. On deck, the chaplains preached courage. They opened a locker \nwith life vests and handed them to the men who needed them. Quickly \nthe supply was exhausted. Each of the four chaplains then peeled off \nhis own jacket and handed it to a man. \"It was the finest thing I \nhave seen or hope to see this side of heaven,\" said John Ladd, one of \nthe 230 men who survived the attack.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-seven minutes after the Dorchester was struck, it sank. \nSurvivors said the last thing they saw was the four chaplains linked \narm in arm on the deck, praying. Moved by their heroism, Congress \nafterward marked February 3rd as \"Four Chaplains Day\" and issued a \nSpecial Medal of Heroism to the four, which their families received \nposthumously.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist taught us \"greater love has no man than to lay down his life \nfor his friends.\" We believe the four chaplains who laid down their \nlives received greater honor from Christ than any Congress could \noffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nColson, Chuck. \"No Greater Glory.\" Breakpoint. \n(www.pfm.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=BreakPoint1 \n&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=14387\u0014\nKurzman, Dan.

He \nhad contracted pleurisy a few days earlier and refused medical \ntreatment, attempting to cure himself by limiting his food and drink.\u0014\n\u0014\nThirteen years, one month, and three days before his death, on 25 \nDecember 800, he had become emperor of western Europe. In a famous \nincident, as he knelt in prayer before the altar of the church of St. \nPeters in Rome, Pope Leo III had suddenly placed a golden crown on \nhis head. The people of Rome cheered. To Charles Augustus, crowned \nby God, the great and pacific emperor of the Romans, life and \nvictory!\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he was not called emperor before 800, Charles had for many \nyears been an empire-builder. From the day he became master of the \nFrench kingdom in 768, he had fought to unite his own people and then \nto successfully bring areas of Germany, Saxony, Belgium, Spain, and \nItaly under his authority. Along the way, he defeated Lombards, \nSaracens, Greeks, and a host of belligerent border tribes. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite continual wars (he fought eighteen major battles), he \npromoted education, standardized the monetary system, improved law, \nsupported the church (he was always a friend of the papacy), backed \nAlcuins attempts to produce an accurate Bible, built bridges, \nconstructed forts, and divided his territories into counties for \neasier management. The civilization of the middle region of Europe \nwas largely owing to him. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he did much that was good and useful, he rejected Alcuins \nwise advice against compelling the Saxons to convert to Christianity \nand be baptized. This may have inspired some of the cruelty and spite \nwith which Saxon raiders later treated Christians. \u0014\nCharlemagne had planned to divide his empire among three legitimate \nsons. However, the plan fell through because two of the sons preceded \nhim to the grave (as did his eldest daughter). To his grief, some of \nhis daughters bore children out of wedlock; however there wasnt much \nhe could say about it, given his own loose sexual mores. He was a man \nof many wives, concubines, and mistresses. \u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the death of Charlemagne, his son Louis the Pious held the \nempire together for a quarter of a century. But after Louiss death, \nCharlemagnes grandsons dismembered it in struggles for supremacy. \nCharlemagne had been not only the first, but possibly the greatest of \nthe Holy Roman emperors from the eighth through the nineteenth \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

She was from Luxembourg, the daughter of Siegfried I and his \nwife Hedwig, but scholars debate Hedwigs ancestry. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn around 975, Cunegunda married Henry, Duke of Bavaria, in 999. \nAfter he was crowned King of the Germans in 1002, she was also \ncrowned queen. Later, she was crowned empress beside her husband \nwhen, in 1014, at St. Peters Basilica, Rome, he became Holy Roman \nEmperor Henry II. \u0014\n\u0014\nCunegunda was no wallflower. She participated in imperial councils, \nmanaged the kings business during his absences, and (according to \ntradition) was active in his charitable endowments. She donated her \nown dowry to fund the diocese of Bamberg when it was founded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pair had no children.

The monks of \nBamberg called for her canonization.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a canonization to take place, she had to be shown to have done \nmiracles. A life was written.

She put out a fire that threatened to engulf \nher bed by making the sign of the cross. She slapped her frivolous \nniece Judith in the face, leaving an imprint that lasted the rest of \nthe girls life.

They are dicephalic parapagus twins \n(having two heads joined to one torso), and are highly symmetric for \nconjoined twins, giving the appearance of having a single body \nwithout marked variation from typical proportions. Each has a heart, \nstomach, spine, pair of lungs, and spinal cord.\u0014\n\u0014\nEach twin controls one arm and one leg. When they were infants, \nlearning to crawl, walk, and clap required cooperation. They can eat \nand write separately and simultaneously. Activities such as running, \nswimming, hair-brushing and driving a car require coordination.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe twins' progress has been covered in the popular media, including \nLife magazine and The Oprah Winfrey Show. They were interviewed on \nThe Learning Channel in December 2006, discussing their daily lives \nand future plans. They starred in their own reality television \nseries, Abby & Brittany, on TLC in 20\u0014\n\u0014\nThe twins were born in Carver County, Minnesota, to Patty, a \nregistered nurse, and Mike Hensel, a carpenter and landscaper. They \nhave a younger brother and sister. They were raised in New Germany, \nMinnesota; attended Mayer Lutheran High School, in Mayer; and \ngraduated from Bethel University, in St. Paul, in 2012.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe twins have a single body with separate heads and necks, a chest \nthat is wider than average, two arms, and two legs. At birth, they \nhad a rudimentary arm between the bases of their necks attached to a \nshoulder blade at the back, being combined parts of Abby's left arm \nand Brittany's right arm. It was removed, leaving the shoulder blade.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbby's head tilts laterally outward about 5 degrees to the right, \nwhile Brittany's tilts laterally at about 15 degrees to the left, \ncausing her to appear shorter even when seated. Brittany's leg is \nnearly two inches shorter than Abby's and Brittany tends to stand and \nwalk on tip-toe which has made her calf muscle significantly larger \nthan Abby's.[4] The continued growth of Abby's spine was surgically \nhalted after Brittany prematurely stopped growing.[4] At age 12, they \nunderwent surgery at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare to \ncorrect scoliosis and to expand their chest cavity to prevent \nbreathing-trouble.[5]\u0014\n\u0014\nEach twin manages one side of their conjoined body. The sense of \ntouch of each is restricted to her body half; this shades off at the \nmidsagittal plane, so that there is a small amount of overlap at the \nmidline. Stomach-aches, however, are felt by only the twin on the \nopposite side.[4]\u0014\n\u0014\nThey cooperatively use their limbs when both hands or both legs are \nrequired. By coordinating their efforts, they walk, run, swim, and \nride a bicycle normally. Together, they can type on a computer \nkeyboard and drive a car. However, Abby, at 5 ft 2 in (1.57 m), is \ntaller and longer of leg than Brittany, who is 4 ft 10 in (1.47 m)[6] \nand their disparate heights caused difficulty in balancing a Segway, \nas shown in their 2012 reality series.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2012, the twins managed to get a teaching job. Following an \ninterview with the schools principle, Mr. Good, a faculty member \nwalked over to him and practically begged him to hire the pair. They \nended up as math specialists, teaching the fourth and fifth grade. It \nbegan as a part-time job, allowing them to more comfortably \ntransition into teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs teachers now, the pair essentially do the job of one person, so \nthey get the paycheck of one. However, theyre still different people \nand are able to more efficiently teach their class than if they were \njust one person.\u0014",

    "words": "Conrad Grebel Drew Crowds in Switzerland\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Conrad Grebel arrived at St. Gall Switzerland, on this day March \n25, 1525, he began to speak on the need for repentance and baptism. \nHundreds turned out to hear him preach and over the next few months, \nhe baptized five hundred. What was significant about this was that \nmost of them had already been baptized as infants.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrebel was in exile from Zurich. Well-educated, he had studied the \nBible with Uhlrich Zwingli, the reformer of Zurich, and stood by him \nas he made changes in the city. However, Grebel thought that Zwingli \nmoved too slow in implementing reforms based on the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Conrad Grebel became convinced from Scripture that infant baptism \nwas wrong. In order to exercise faith, a person had to be old enough \nto understand the Gospel. Baptism could only have meaning for a \nperson who understood why he or she was being baptized. Those who \nthought this way were called Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli and Grebel held public debates on the issue, but Zwingli \nstuck with infant baptism and so did Zurich. Consequently, Conrad \nGrebel and a number of others decided to obey their consciences. \nGrebel is often called the \"Father of the Anabaptists\" because on \nJanuary 21, 1525, he re-baptized George Blaurock, a former priest. It \nwas the first such adult baptism in Zurich.\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately the Zurich authorities forbade the Anabaptists to speak \nabout their beliefs on adult baptism. Shortly afterward, they drove \nthe Anabaptists out. Soon they would be killing them, often by \ndrowning. Grebel went to St. Gall, where he found immediate success.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventh months later, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life in \nprison. Friends helped him escape, but his life was destined to be \nshort all the same. He could not outrun the plague, which carried him \noff less than two years after he baptized George Blaurock. He was \nonly about 29 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Conrad Grebel left few writings, he left many converts. A \ncollege in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is named for Conrad Grebel. It \nwas founded by Mennonites--spiritual offspring of the early \nAnabaptist reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBautz, Friedrich William. \"Grebel, Konrad.\" \n(http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/g/grebel_k.shtml).\u0014\nBender, Harold S.

    "words": "Cranmer Got the Top Job but Didn't Want it!\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL    2010,  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Thomas Cranmer learned he had been named Archbishop of \nCanterbury by King Henry VIII, he balked. Visiting Germany at the \ntime to promote the King's interest in a divorce, he dawdled seven \nweeks getting back to England. Although the King's word was law, \nCranmer hesitated to accept the position.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English church was in a turmoil over the question of Henry's \ndesired divorce from Catherine. Having presented him with no male \nheir, the queen, once so charming to Henry, was now repugnant. Yet he \ncould not get the Pope to agree to an annulment.\u0014\n\u0014\nCranmer had come to the King's attention when, in conversation with \ntwo of Henry's men, he had suggested that the universities could just \nas well settle the question as the Pope. Henry swore Cranmer had \"the \nright sow by the ear.\" He earmarked the priest to become Archbishop \nof Canterbury, England's highest religious post. Cranmer was \nconsecrated on this date, March 30, 1533.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving himself subject to the King, Cranmer promptly granted Henry \nthe annulment. Throughout his tenure as archbishop, he would do \npretty much whatever the King commanded. Henry's continual shifts of \npolicy often made Cranmer appear wishy-washy. For example, he ruled \nHenry's marriage to Anne of Cleve lawful and six months later \nannulled it as unlawful.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlready leaning toward Protestantism, Cranmer became the chief \narchitect of the English Reformation. He urged the King to place \nBibles in England's churches and it was done. He wrote the first Book \nof Common Prayer. In only a few things did he resist Henry. At some \njeopardy to himself, he pleaded for the lives of Thomas More and \nBishop Fisher and testified for three days against Henry's Six \nArticles which went back to Roman Catholic forms. However, he sat \nwith the persecutors of John Frith and Joan of Kent, both of whom \nwere executed by fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy his twisting and turning, Cranmer escaped execution under Henry. \nHenry trusted him above all his other prelates and on his deathbed \nclung to Cranmer's hand. Under Edward, Cranmer advanced \nProtestantism, helping draft doctrines which became the basis for the \nChurch of England's Thirty Nine Articles.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder pressure, Cranmer supported Lady Jane Gray to succeed Edward. \nIt was not to be. Mary took the throne and charged him with treason \nand heresy. In face of death he recanted his Protestant opinions. \nWhen he learned he was to die anyway, he publicly renounced his \nrecantation. \"As for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy and \nAntichrist, with all his false doctrine.\" When the fire was lit, he \nheld the hand that had signed the recantation into the flame, burning \nit off before the fire touched his body, saying, \"This unworthy right \nhand.\" As death approached he repeated several times, \"Lord Jesus, \nreceive my spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Cranmer, Thomas.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

Land grabs are always ugly.\u0014\n\u0014\nRussian czar-for-life Vladimir Putin has a penchant for that. His war \nmachine took the Crimean Peninsula away from Ukraine and \"annexed\" it \nto Russia back in 2014, mainly to control important ports on the \nBlack Sea, including Sevastopol.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat move broke any number of treaties and was widely condemned as \nagainst international law. Sanctions were levied, but nothing changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike a schoolyard bully taking away a smaller boy's candy, Russia got \nwhat it wanted and pretended that it was what the people of Crimea \nwanted, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading about the nasty business introduced me to the word \n\"irredentist,\" which has nothing to do with getting X-rays of your \nteeth. A Wikipedia article about the annexation of Crimea noted, \"As \nearly as 2010, some analysts speculated that the Russian government \nhad irredentist plans.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nlrredentist refers to a situation in which a political movement or \npeople group occupies a territory that they consider -- based on \nhistory or legend -- to have originally been theirs, but had been \nlost and needed to be returned, or \"redeemed\" (the word is from the \nItalian irredento, meaning \"unredeemed\").\u0014\n\u0014\nCrimea had once been part of the Soviet empire, and Putin wanted to \nhave it back in the USSR (with apologies to the Beatles' 1968 tune). \nKeep that word in mind: \"irredentism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPurtn's continuing land-grabbing efforts, while pretending he's doing \nso for justifiable and even humanitarian reasons, are ugly business- \nas is the support he gets from some American political leaders and \nothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, most Americans are not cheerleaders for Putin. On \nprinciple, we recognize that occupying someone else's land - just \nbecause you can - is not kosher.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr is it?\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people who are quick to condemn Putin are unmoved by the State \nof Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank, where groups of \nsettlers - often financed by Americans - move into Palestinian \nterritory and start building houses, which grow into towns and cities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Israeli government then builds roads and army camps to protect \nthe settlers, disrupting travel and daily life for Palestinians. When \nthe land adjoins Israeli territory, as in East Jerusalem, the \ngovernment \"annexes\" the land.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsraeli settlements and annexations break just as many international \nlaws and treaties as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's blatantly \nwrong, but few people get up in arms.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? irredentism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsraeli activists claim that all the land belongs to them because God \npromised it to Abraham, and because the kingdoms of Israel and Judah \ncontrolled the land for a few hundred years- more than 2,500 years \nago.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat argument is as bogus as Russia's claim to Ukraine, but most \nAmerican Chris tians give the Israelis a pass, assuming that they \nmust be biblically justified in taking the land.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn sermons and devotions, many still cheer the exploits of Israelites \nwho invaded and occupied Canaan, believing they had a divine mandate \nto do so. It was a bloody business, the way the stories are told, \nconquering and burning cities, killing and enslaving people who were \nminding their own business.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does that not bother us? Why can we get all riled up about Russia \ninvading Ukraine while still celebrating the Israelites'\u0014\nconquests in Canaan, or tuming a blind eye to Israeli settlements in \nthe West Bank?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer: uncritical irredentism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hebrew Bible condemns many stories about the Israelites and their \nenemies. Readers are often unaware that most of these stories were \nwritten long after the fact and designed to justify the Israelites' \nclaim to the land. The stories need to be read with a critical eye, \nnot just a devotional one.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid God really endorse the takeover of Canaan? These biblical stories \nwere written by people with their own agendas. They testify t? the \npeople's beliefs, but that doesn't mean they accurately reflect a \ndivi?e poi?t of view.\u0014\n\u0014\nWould Jesus endorse the kind of bloody warfare or vengeful actions \ndescribed in the conquest narratives or the imprecatory psalms? Did \nany aspect of Jesus teaching even touch on restoring land to Israel?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. While many had longed for a military messiah who would return \nIsrael to the world stage as an independent power, Jesus proclaimed a \nvision of human kinship and service, a kingdom of God, characterized \nby love.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we want to be irredentist, let's try recovering that metaphorical \nland. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n- Tony W.

    "title": "CHRISTIANS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE",
    "words": "What Christians Need to Know About the Rwandan Genocide\u0014\nby Angela Grant | Apr 7, 2022 \u0014\n\u0014\nEverything I knew about the Rwandan genocide I learned from the 2004 \nmovie Hotel Rwanda.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is, until, following graduate school, my favorite professor let \nme audit one more class. What I learned was horrifying and, for a \nChristian who knew practically nothing about the events, humiliating.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe country was 90% Christian, which meant 90% of both the victims \nand the killers were Christian. And it seemed those who surely knew \nwhat was likely to happen were unprepared or unwilling to do anything \nabout it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had to find out how this could have happened. Here is what I found.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-eight years ago this month (April), in the skies above the \nsmall African country of Rwanda, a plane was shot down, killing \nPresident Habiyarimana and all on board.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlans were already in place, and the massacre began immediately.  By \nJuly, close to one million Rwandans, mostly Tutsi Christians, had \nbeen killed by their fellow Rwandans, mostly Hutu Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne-third of the murders took place on church property, often with \nthe complicity of clergy from nearly every denomination represented.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity had come to Rwanda in the late 19th century with \nCatholic priests known as White Fathers who followed the colonial \npowers. Rwandas leader was converted, and by 1920 the majority of \nthe population was Christian. Eventually, missionaries of most \nProtestant denominations arrived.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were periods of revival, but Christianity did not calm the \nrivalry that had existed for at least a century between the two major \nethnic groups. Most Rwandans, 85%, are of Hutu heritage, as was \nPresident Habiyarimana, while 14% are Tutsi, and a small number are \nTwa.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Hutu and Tutsi intermarried, lived in the same villages and \nattended the same churches, there was intermittent conflict, often \ndepending on whose representatives held power.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1932, the Belgian colonialists, who had taken over from the \nGermans following World War I, had affirmed the differences between \nthe groups by requiring ID cards. Most clergy became closely aligned \nwith the colonial powers and, after the revolution in 1959, linked \nthemselves to the new government.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurches became major economic forces, controlling jobs and education \nas well as status. Christianity, for most Rwandans, was equated with \nallegiance to the clergy and, through them, to whoever was in power.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the New Testament had been translated into the national \nlanguage, Kinyarwanda, literacy was only 60%. Rwandans looked to \nclergy for guidance in matters of daily living. but it seems most \nmissionaries arrived unprepared to address the Hutu-Tutsi issue. \nWhether this was because their sending boards were unaware of, or \nunconcerned with, ongoing violence is not clear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were exceptions. A few churches, including Pentecostals and \nCatholics, began to integrate social justice in their teaching. \nPentecostals, following their practice, remained outside the \npolitical realm.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 1990 and 1991, thousands of Tutsi had been killed in various \nmassacres. And by 1993, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a militia of \nmainly Tutsi refugees, had formed over the northern border with \nBurundi and was making its way towards the capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew missionaries were fluent in Kinyarwanda, the language of radio \nbroadcasts that, even before the plane crashed, had begun sending \ninstructions to Hutu citizens to kill the Tutsi traitors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough it is difficult to know how closely mission boards followed \nthese events, they would surely have had some knowledge of events \nthat, by mid-April in 1994, required the evacuation of all foreign \nresidents, including missionaries, via United Nations-led convoy.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne missionary, a humanitarian worker, refused to leave Kigali and, \nwith the assistance of residents and UN force contacts, was able to \nsecure supplies that saved several hundred orphans. For others, the \ndecision to leave was painful as they wondered what would happen to \nthe workers they left behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome killing was by means of explosives or firearms, but most of the \nslaughter was the physical act by squads of Hutu citizens, the \ngnocidaires, of hacking bodies into pieces with machetes. Mounds of \nbody parts were not buried, but left to decay, the skulls becoming \nmarkers of the killing sites.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the behest of militia groups, or on their own initiative, some \nclergy summoned members to the church with the promise of sanctuary \nand then left the premises to avoid the appearance of complicity.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers, sometimes Catholics and Protestants together, have reported \nthat they stood up to the killers, stayed together, and the Lord \nprotected them.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo American journalists remained in Rwanda, but some major U.S. \nnewspapers covered the events from neighboring countries or with \nlocal stringers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 16, for example, an article in The New York Times reported \nthe involvement of churches: New reports of massacres emerged today \nfrom Rwanda, including an account of nearly 1,200 men, women and \nchildren shot and hacked to death in a church where they sought \nrefuge.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike many Americans, I thought I was keeping up with world events, \nand a check of the archives shows that my local paper was reporting \non Rwanda, but I was busy raising an active five-year-old, and I \nwasnt paying attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither were most of my fellow Americans. Just a few months earlier, \nU.S. military members had been killed in Somalia in the incident that \nbecame known as Black Hawk Down. Media coverage reflected that we \nhad little appetite for what we viewed as just another African tribal \nwar.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor did our world leaders. On April 27, Pope John Paul II was the \nfirst to call the events in Rwanda a genocide, but he did not take \nfurther steps. Nor did President Clinton, as U.S. participation in a \nU.N. agreement intended to prevent another Holocaust would have \nrequired intervention in events determined to be genocide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis word has been raised recently by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy \nto describe events in his country, possibly in hopes that the U.S. \nand other nations will agree to send in NATO forces. As of this \nwriting that seems unlikely for various reasons, including that it \nmight raise the question as to why military force was authorized in \nresponse to genocide in a European, but not an African, nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, as anyone who saw the movie knows, UNAMIR (United Nations \nAssistance Mission for Rwanda) Commander General Romo Dallaire \nwaited for orders that never came.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe massacre continued until, on July 4, the RPF reached Kigali and \ntook control of the government. Its commander, Paul Kagame, was \nappointed vice president and, in 2000, was elected president.\u0014\n\u0014\nLarge numbers of perpetrators were tried for their crimes, and some \nwere punished. A few clergy were also tried, though others fled to \ncountries in Africa and Europe or to the U.S. Some religious groups \nissued apologies for their role  most not until years later.\u0014\n\u0014\nMissionaries from various groups have returned. At least one sending \norganization has begun requiring what it describes as \ncross-cultural training. ID cards have been banned. Training for \nclergy is now mandated by Rwandan law.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly three decades later, whether you are Christian or not, there \nare two questions that call for answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, How can you say the majority of murderers were Christian? \nThat answer is simple: the 1991 Rwandan census recorded it, and there \nis no reason to doubt its accuracy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, to those of us who paid no attention and did nothing: If you \nsay, Look, we did not know this, does not he who weighs the heart \nperceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the answer: Will he not repay all according to their deeds? \n(Proverbs 24:12, NRSV).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAngela Grant\u0014\nYale Divinity School\u0014",

    "title": "COROLLA WILD HORSES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT",
    "words": "Corolla Wild Horse Fund\u0014\nApril 7, 2022    \u0014\n\u0014\nYesterday's post about Bee, and the questions about whether or not \nwe've found Brio's mom made us realize that many people don't realize \nhow vast the horses' habitat is. What you see in most pictures is \njust a very, very small part of the primary habitat, and only the \nplaces people have access to. There are about 7600 acres of land \navailable to the horses (that's 75 acres per horse!), and the \ntopography ranges from sand dunes to maritime forests, tidal flats, \nshrub thickets, brackish and freshwater marsh and estuaries, and the \ngrassy yards of the more developed areas. \u0014\n\u0014\nHorses are seasonal grazers; they go where the food is, and that \nchanges based on the seasons. In the spring the horses stay tucked \nback in the marsh because that's where the grass gets green first. \nRight now they are eating the tender cattail and marsh grass shoots. \nIn a month or so, they will begin to migrate east towards the dunes, \nwhere by June the grass will be green and the sea oats blooming. \nBiting flies will drive them out of the marshes with the west winds \nin the summer, and cold northeasterly winds drive them west into the \nforests in the winter. In the summer, the grass in the marsh grows \ntaller than a person and the horses disappear into it, submerging \ntheir heads into the water to graze. Terrain that seems easy to \ntraverse upon first glance becomes nearly unnavigable once you really \nget going - sand, mud, snakes, reedgrass solid as a wall, and thorny \nvines do not make for easy hiking! \u0014\n\u0014\nThe horses are never lost - they just go to places that we, as \nhumans, can't easily get to. Several times a year we do a helicopter \nsurvey of the area, but this doesn't serve as the only herd count of \nthe year. It's impossible to see all of the horses during these \nflights because the tree cover is so thick, even in the winter. We \noften get asked about using drones, and while this is helpful if \nthere is a very specific area we need to check out, they really \naren't that useful when you don't know exactly where you're looking, \nor for any kind of broad overview. Horses travel miles every day, and \nwhile we do know the general parameters of each horse's territory, \nthey can move great distances in a short amount of time. For example, \nlast week new foal Charlie's parents moved him nearly two miles in \nless than an hour, to an area they don't normally frequent. The \nminute you think you know everything about the horses, and can \npredict their movement and behavior, they do something to humble you \nand make you remember that nope - they do what they want and will \nalways keep you on your toes! \u0014\n\u0014\nLast year we got word of a deceased horse \"somewhere on the refuge.\" \nWe hiked around as much as we could, but the area where the remains \nwere allegedly spotted (from the air) is dense and vast. There are no \nroads and trails can be hit or miss. We looked from the helicopter \nwhen we went up in May, but didn't spot anything. About a month or so \nago, we got a call from a hunter who had come across some bones. \nGiven the location, we knew it was the deceased horse reported a year \nago, and we also know now which horse it was. He was a very old \nstallion who has been on our \"not seen\" list for about a year. He \ndied a natural death, far, far away from humans in the place where he \nlived his entire life. It's the end we wish for all of our wild and \nfree ones. The gentleman who found his remains brought us the skull \nso that we can recover DNA from it, and respectfully buried the rest \nof the bones under an oak tree near where he died. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo where is Brio's mom? She is not lost. Perhaps she died and her \nremains are deep in the marsh. Perhaps she is alive and well, under \nthe cover of the live oaks and reedgrass, and the blooming sea oats \nwill draw her out come June. There is no question that Brio could not \nhave made it out of the marsh (where they were both last seen just a \ncouple weeks before he showed up alone) to where we found him on his \nown. She either brought him there on purpose, or he couldn't keep up \nwith her and was left behind. If she died anywhere near there, it's \nvery, very likely we would have found her body by now. We can only \nwait and see, but we must remember that she is not lost. She is \nwherever she wants to be; she is a wild animal with free will and \nstrong instincts and despite all of our very best efforts, sometimes \nwe just have to let them be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are just a couple examples of the challenges that come with \nmanaging a population of wild animals, while at the same time working \nto preserve an endangered breed. There is much we simply just don't \nhave any control over, and that's the tradeoff if they are to stay \nwild as they have been for the last 500 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nHave a look through the photos included in this post. They will give \nyou a better idea of what the habitat really looks like. Zoom in on \nsome, and you may spot horses hidden in the marsh that you might not \nhave noticed at first glance. There are some satellite views, one of \nthe entire habitat (the red dots are locations of horses we saw when \nwe last flew over) and one is a close up of Brio's mom's territory. \nIt is such a beautiful, special place - some of the last truly \npristine land left on the East Coast. It can be harsh and \ninhospitable, but also so full of life. We are lucky to call it home, \nand honored to play a small part in trying to preserve it for the \nhorses and other wildlife, the people who live here and come here to \nvisit, and the future.\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTIANS FIGHTING OTHER CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "Sixteenth-century Europe seethed with spiritual and political \nferment. Christians fought Turks, Protestants warred with Catholics, \nCatholic powers fought each other, peasants rose against lords, and \npopes formed alliances that swirled and dissipated like mists as they \nsought to protect papal prerogatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn September 1526, Clement VII of the Medici family of Florence was \npope when Cardinal Colonna, a rival, joined Spanish grandee Ugo di \nMancada to attack Rome. The attackers quickly broke into the city and \nsacked it. Romans, sick of arrogant churchmen and high taxes, did \nlittle to defend the pope. Clement VII escaped to his citadel, the \nCastel SantAngelo. Lacking provisions, he soon had to capitulate.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement learned little from his embarrassment. He did not strengthen \nRomes defenses or placate the populace. Instead, to save money, he \ndismissed most of Romes troops. Although Spanish forces had defeated \nthe French at Pavia in 1525, Clement allied himself with France.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe popes strategy revealed its weakness in 1527. Emperor Charles V \ndid not have funds to pay his Spanish troops and German mercenaries. \nDefying their commanders, the hungry soldiers headed south through \nItaly, intending to sack Florence and Rome. The army became a mob, \nrobbing, raping, torturing, and murdering as it advanced. George von \nFrundsberg and the Duke of Bourbon were unable to control them. \nFrundsberg collapsed from a stroke. Florence reinforced its position, \ncausing the lawless army to focus on Rome. The Duke of Bourbon \ndemanded huge sums from the pope. \u0014\n\u0014\nClement pleaded with England and France to help but they were too \ndistant to intervene. Meanwhile he cobbled together a defensive band \nof about eight thousand military veterans and untrained civilians. \nToo late he started to repair Romes walls. The citys prospects \nimproved when rain and mud caused the advancing force to abandon \ntheir artillery. Without cannon, it would be harder for them to \nbreach Romes walls. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe hope proved illusionary. Under cover of fog, the enemy attacked. \nThe Romans beat back the first assault and killed the Duke of \nBourbon. Clement held a mass imploring Gods protection. But while he \nwas at the altar, the invaders overcame Romes defenders. On this \nday, 6 May 1527, Charles Vs mercenaries poured into the city. Two \nthousand Swiss guards died protecting the pope, who again escaped to \nthe Castel SantAngelo.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Vs mercenaries proceeded to loot, rape, torture, and kill. \nNo one was safe. They held cardinals and nobles for high ransoms and \nburned two thirds of the city. They were barely dissuaded from \ntorching the Vatican Library or destroying the Sistine Chapel. Months \npassed before the last invaders left, and then only because epidemics \nwere killing them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Charles apologized to the pope and disavowed the carnage, he \nexacted concessions. Clement was hostage to Charless policies. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe effects were far-ranging. The pope had to crown Charles V as Holy \nRoman Emperor. He also had to refuse Henry VIIIs request for a \ndivorce from Catharine of Aragon, Charless aunt, leading Henry to \nbreak from the Catholic Church. When the pope schemed against \nCharles, the emperor denounced him in terms that strengthened \nLutheran reformers. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn yet more fallout, the popes Italian allies marched into Rome and \nsacked it yet again. Italian city-states preyed on the popes \nweakness to seize papal lands. People blamed the immorality of the \nclergy for the catastrophe. Their demands for church reform led to \nthe election of a severe pope after Clement died, and so inquisition \nraged. And the popes could no longer lavish support on art, so \nfunding for the Renaissance dried up.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "CANONICITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF REVELATION",
    "words": "Canonicity and acceptance of Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nBy AD 200 Revelation was accepted as authoritative by several bishops \nand other Christian leaders in the Mediterranean world . . . However, \nsome rejected Revelation as Scripture. Gaius and Dionysius of \nAlexandria argued that Revelation was not apostolic in origin. Even \nas late as the fourth century, Eusebius classified the documents \nscriptural status as disputed. By 1300, Revelation was acknowledged \nas authoritative Scripture by most Christians.8 However, even today, \nthere still exist some Christian communities who reject Revelations \nauthority.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation cannot be categorized as being ONLY one style (or genre) \nof literature. The author employs various styles and techniques to \ncommunicate his message, including apocalyptic, prophetic, \nepistolary, and liturgical styles.\u0014\n\u0014\nApocalyptic style\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apocalyptic (Gr. apokalypsis) style of writing found in \nRevelation was used in both Jewish and Christian circles. It often \nhas an angel or otherworldly being reveal heavenly mysteries to a \nhuman recipient. The mysteries are delivered in the form of visions \nplaced in a narrative framework.13 The visions serve to interpret the \ndifficult times the recipients are experiencing, portraying them as \ntemporary and counterfeit, while the heavenly mysteries are portrayed \nas an accurate depiction of reality. In this function, apocalyptic \nliterature has an ethical component. On the basis of the message, the \nrecipients are mandated to modify their thinking and behavior. They \nare expected to either persevere or overcome depending on their \ncurrent situation. Those who pursue a life of faithfulness and purity \nwill avoid the punishments promised to the unfaithful.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey figures in the book of Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nThe antichrist\u0014\nThe mark of the beast\u0014\nGog and Magog\u0014\nThe number 666 in Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nApproaches to interpreting the book of Revelation\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout Church history, Revelation has been interpreted through \nseveral different perspectives: non-historical, futuristic (or \nend-historical), church-historical, and contemporary historical.\u0014\n\u0014\nNon-historical\u0014\nThe non-historical approach to understanding Revelation is also \ncalled poetic, idealist, or spiritual. This method is similar to the \nallegorizing approaches the Alexandrians (like Clement and Origen) \nused with the Bible. Read from this perspective, Revelation contains \ntimeless general principles with no concern for the issues facing the \nseven churches. In its most extreme view, it denies any historical or \nfuture meaning of the book. In general, the symbols and images do not \nrefer to any events in past or future church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nFuturistic or end-historical\u0014\nThe futuristic or end-historical interpretation understands \neverything that follows Revelation 3 as events that have not yet \noccurred. According to this view, the visions given to John predict \nin detail two future periods of human history. The first period would \nfall seven years prior to Christs return (Rev 6:119:21). The second \nperiod would be the thousand years following the second coming of \nChrist (Rev 20:122:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch-historical\u0014\nRead from the church-historical viewpoint, Revelation is a detailed \nmap of history from the time it was written until Christs return. \nChapters 2 and 3 speak to Johns time, but typically the focus of \nthis interpretation is the interpreters time, which is usually \nasserted at the end of history, close to the return of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nContemporary-historical\u0014\nThe contemporary-historical reading understands the book the way the \noriginal audience in the seven churches would have read it. \nRevelation is related to what happened during the time of the author; \nthe main contents of chapters 422 are viewed as describing events of \nJohns own time.\u0014",

    "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE",
    "words": "CHARACTERISTICS OF APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE\u0014\nRay Summers, Worthy is the Lamb\u0014\n\u0014\nThe task of classifying the many characteristics of apocalyptic \nliterature seems almost endless. Some authors give a general \nclassification to cover all such literature. Others give \ncharacteristics of Jewish apocalypses alone. Still others list the \ncharacteristics of Revelation, the New Testament apocalypse. There \nappear to be almost as many different classifications of \ncharacteristics as there are interpretations of the book; and these \nare legion. The classification followed here is largely arbitrary. \nThe main effort is to indicate all the major characteristics as they \nwould touch Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Apocalyptic was always possessed of a historical significance. \nThere was ever some critical historical situation with which it was \nconnected. Elements of this historical situation are represented by \nthe imagery of the book. Knowledge of the historical situation out of \nwhich the apocalyptic work grew greatly facilitates interpretation. \nThis cannot be done with perfect assurance in all cases, but the \nevidences favor the Domitianic persecution as the background of \nRevelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is self-evident that a knowledge of the historical \nsituation lends much aid in determining the correct interpretation. \nIt has been observed previously that the main purpose of apocalyptic \nliterature was to bring comfort, assurance, and courage in difficult \ndays. To know the days concerned is to know the courage needed and to \nunderstand better the message employed to bring this courage. To \nignore the historical situation is to ignore the main piece in the \njigsaw of interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Generally, apocalyptic literature is of pseudonymous authorship. \nThe writers of these books generally wrote in the name of some great \nman of the past, Enoch, Abraham, or Moses, rather than in their own \nnames. Undoubtedly different reasons led to this procedure, which \ntoday is rather difficult to understand in spiritual men with an \nearnest message. To the writer there was doubtless nothing unethical \nin such a course of action, since they used so much from early \nsources that in many cases they were giving credit where credit was \ndue. Then, too, the Hebrew writer was almost wholly devoid of the \npride of authorship and showed no jealousy as to his literary rights. \nHe was little concerned as to his personal fame; his sole object was \nthe service of God and the well-being of the nation.\u0014\nAnother reason for this method has been suggested by Charles after a \nstudy of all the Jewish apocalyptic literature in connection with the \nconditions and attitudes behind it. When the law reached supremacy \namong the Jews, it left no room for prophecy of any kind since it \nclaimed to be the complete revelation of God. When the idea of an \ninspired lawadequate, infallible, and valid for all timehad become \nan accepted dogma for Judaism, as it became in the post-Exilic \nperiod, there was no longer room for an independent representative of \nGod to appear with Gods message.\u0014\n\u0014\nProceeding from this basis, Charles indicates that the prophet who \nreleased a prophecy under his own name after the time of Ezra and \nNehemiah could not expect a hearing. Against the reception of false \ntruth the Law stood in the way unless the book containing it came \nunder certain great names of the past. Against the claims and \nauthorities of such names the official representatives of the Law \nwere in part reduced to silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLegalism, becoming absolute, determined henceforth the character of \nJudaism. Prophecy and apocalyptic, which had exercised a determining \ninfluence in many of the great crises of the nation and had given \nbirth to and shaped the higher theology of Judaism, were driven from \ntheir positions of secondary authority and either banished absolutely \nor relegated wholly into the background.\u0014\nAll Jewish apocalypses, therefore, from 200 B.C. onward were of \nnecessity pseudonymous if they sought to exercise any real influence \non the nation. For the Law was everything; belief in inspiration was \ndead amongst them, and their canon was closed. Charles holds that \nthis did not hold true with reference to the apocalypse of the New \nTestament, as will be indicated in the discussion of authorship of \nthe book of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen suggests yet a third reason for the advisability of concealing \nthe authorship of apocalyptic literature. This reason is a very \npersonal one with the writer of the books in question. It has been \nobserved previously that the books of this type were free to prophesy \ndoom upon the political power then in control. Anonymity might have \nled to investigations or might have brought punishment upon some \nsupposed writer if the book fell into the hands of authorities; but \nif they thought it to have been written by some author who lived long \nago, there was nothing they could do but endeavor to suppress it \nsince the author was beyond their power. At first glance this may \nappear to be an unworthy motive, but when all the circumstances are \nconsidered, including the good accomplished by a work which could not \notherwise be available to the people, criticism fades.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. A third characteristic of apocalyptic literature is the \npresentation of the message through visions. This method was often \nused by the prophets, but in apocalyptic writings it became the chief \nmethod of expressing truth. These visions vary from scenes in heaven \nto scenes on earth. They abound in heavenly messengers or angels who \nare Gods agents in the securing of his revelation to the seer.\u0014\nThere has been an abundance of discussion as to whether or not the \nwriters actually saw the visions they describe. Some incline to the \nview that the writer saw the truth to be conveyed and then out of \nexperience, conditions, and available literature he formed the images \nand visions used. Scholars are of divergent opinions on the matter. \nAll agree that the most important question is the religious value of \nthe teaching and not the form used in presenting the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nA close study of the New Testament apocalypse leaves a strong \nimpression that the visions recorded were objectively real to John. \nThis impression comes from the nature of the symbols and figures in \nthe course of the visions as well as from references in which John \nseems to make a direct claim that the visions were objective. Perhaps \nit is a matter of little importance. Objective or subjective, they \npresent the same truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe highly elaborate vision is the most distinctive feature in the \nform of apocalyptic literature. The subject matter is attributed to a \nspecial revelation, commonly given in visions, ecstasies, or raptures \ninto the unseen world. The vision or rapture in apocalyptic writings \nis a literary form wrought out with great fulness of details, often \nwith strange symbolism and with fantastic imagery. It is this mode of \nunveiling hidden things in these writings that has given them the \nname apocalyptic.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. As a fourth characteristic of apocalyptic literature, we find a \npredictive element. A review of the conditions out of which this type \nof literature grew will indicate the truth that the future is dealt \nwith in apocalyptic. As has already been observed, apocalyptic was \nthe word for a dark day and condition. It pictured the present as a \ntime of evil, turmoil, persecution, upheaval, but the future was \npredicted to be a glorious period of vindication, triumph, and \nfreedom from all the handicaps which beset us here. Thus it is noted \nthat the prediction of the future is general, in the main, and deals \nwith the character of events rather than the details. Caution should \nbe observed and dogmatism avoided at this point in the interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. One of the main characteristics of apocalyptic is the use of \nsymbol. Among writers of this type of literature there was developed \nan elaborate system of cryptic symbols and figures of speech for the \nexpression of spiritual ideas. The writer was faced with the task of \nseeing the invisible, painting the unpaintable, and expressing the \ninexpressible. The writing is therefore full of imagery and symbolism \nwhich are hard to understand, and which make the task of the modern \ninterpreter far removed from those conditions exceedingly difficult. \nSymbolism is a system in which qualities, ideas, principles, etc., \nare represented by things concrete. These symbols have a meaning for \nthe initiated but are hopeless jargon to one unacquainted with such \nterms. Richardson calls attention to a man who was in prison because \nhe had bumped off a bird in Alabama and to the fact that the soup \nwhich a safe-cracker would use would hardly be fit to serve as a \ndinner course. These are illustrations on a very low level of \nsymbolic languagelanguage with a double meaning. The apocalyptic \nwriters by compulsion of the unsympathetic and often hostile \nenvironment in which they and their readers lived developed a system \nof symbols, figures, and codes for comparatively safe communication. \nThus, one cannot interpret symbols as one would interpret prose where \nthe meaning lies on the surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe writer employs the symbols as a method of communicating his \nthoughts to those who were familiar with the process and at the same \ntime concealing his ideas from those outside this circle. The symbols \nare often arbitrary rather than natural, as were the illustrations \nused by the prophets. The meaning of the greater part of the symbols \nis clear, but there are some symbols in the interpretation of which \nthere is much room for diversity of opinion. About these symbols one \ncannot afford to be dogmatic. It appears that the wise thing to do in \ninterpreting symbols is to follow the proper method of interpreting \nparablesfind the central truth which is being portrayed and let the \ndetails fit in in the most natural way.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the main usages of symbol in this literature is found in the \nsymbolism of numbers. Even a casual reading of the Revelation \nimpresses one with the frequent recurrence of certain numbers. This \nsame thing is true in the other literature of this class. Because of \nthis fact, it appears wise to include a discussion of the symbolism \nof numbers in this discussion. Most of the discussion which follows \non this matter is a summary taken from Wishart with occasional \nreferences to other works.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe symbolism of numbers: The inner significance of numbers was a \nkind of device which always had fascination for the Oriental mind. In \nthat early day, when language was primitive and the vocabulary \nmeager, one Hebrew word sometimes was compelled to do duty for a \nscore of diverse meanings. Under such conditions men came naturally \nto use numbers as we use words. They were the symbols of moral or \nspiritual truth. A certain number would suggest a definite concept. \nThe conceptions arose quite naturally through certain primitive \nassociations. Just as the sound of a given word by long habit calls \nup the corresponding idea, so a certain number, by acquired \nassociation, called up a definite concept. Such numbers become \nsymbols and cannot be read with the literal exactness that we employ \nwhen interpreting mathematical formulae.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter this fashion men saw a single object and came to associate with \nthe number 1 the idea of unity or independent existence. It stood \nfor that which was unique and alone. This word does not appear \nsymbolically in the book of Revelation. It is, of course, at the base \nof other numbers that do appearsome frequently.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid the dangers of primitive life, with a fear of wild beasts, or of \nhostile attack by his enemies constantly before him, man gained \ncourage in companionship. Two were far stronger and more effective \nthan one. Thus the number 2 came to stand for strengthening, for \nconfirmation, for redoubled courage and energy. There was a symbolic \nsignificance in the fact that Jesus sent his disciples forth two by \ntwo. Two witnesses confirmed the truth, and their testimony which \notherwise would have been weak was made strong. Always this number \nmeant augmented strength, redoubled energy, confirmed power. So in \nthe book of Revelation the truth of God is confirmed by two witnesses \nwho are slain and rise again and ascend to heaven. This symbolizes a \nstrong witness which prospers then seems to be beaten to earth only \nto rise again to heavenly triumph. Likewise there are two wild beasts \nmutually confirming and supporting each other as they wage war \nagainst the cause of righteousness. They present a formidable foe. \nBut over against them God has a twofold instrument of warfarethe \nconquering Christ and the sickle of judgment. These prove to be too \ngreat for the two beasts to defeat. Thus, symbolically, we see the \ncause of righteousness triumph over evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nWishart suggests that man found in his primitive home the divinest \nthing that life had to offer himfather love, mother love, filial \nlove. He found God reflected in the interplay of love and kindness \nand affection in his own household and began to think of the number \n3 as a symbol of the divine. In his more thoughtful moments he \ncarried that idea back into his conception of God. For this reason, \ndoubtless, there appear glimmerings of a Trinity not only in the \ntheology of the Hebrews but in the dreams of the Greeks. The divinest \nthing in life was 3 and the divine origin of life was 3. Here in \nthe ultimate world ground were father love, mother love, and child \nlove. Here, too, were the glimpses of the great mysteries which we \nexpress in the terms Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Three came to \ncarry the thought of the divine.\u0014\n\u0014\nFOR FULL ARTICLE: SEE  DOCUMENTS/CHARACTERISTICS OF APOCALYPTIC \nLITERATURE\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nCYRUS MCCORMICK OWED HIS BIG IDEA AND HIS ETERNAL HOPE TO HIS FATHER\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe example of a godly father is immeasurable on a child; and a \nfathers timely word can have eternal consequences. Robert McCormick \nproved both true with his son, Cyrus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe McCormicks were of Scottish stock and staunch Presbyterians. A \nchurch building on their Virginia property testified to their \nconvictions. When local Presbyterians watered down the faith, Cyruss \ngrandfather took his hat, walked out, and erected the new worship \ncenter. Cyrus grew up singing in its choir, reading the Bible, and \nmemorizing the catechism. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis father, Robert, honored Christ with godly living, hard work, and \nfaithful prayer. Among his projects was an attempt to build a reaper. \nHe toiled at this in his spare time for many years despite the jeers \nof neighbors. Finally, he gave up. He had run out of ideas. \u0014\nBut Cyrus, about twenty years old at the time, had watched his \nfather, learned mechanical skills from him, seen what did not work, \nand most importantly witnessed Roberts perseverance and character. \nHe asked his dad if he could take over the abandoned project. \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert tried to dissuade him. But when Cyrus explained he had some \nnew ideas, his dad relented. In about a year Cyrus had a model that \nworked. After years of further improvements, on this day, 21 June \n1834, Cyrus McCormick patented his reaper. It changed the face of \nworld agriculture.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after Cyrus took over his dads reaper project, he acquired \nan even greater gift from him: faith. A team of evangelists came to \nthe Presbyterian Church. One evening they asked everyone who was on \nChrists side to stand. Cyrus McCormick did not rise. As he was going \nto bed, his father came into his bedroom. Son, dont you know that \nby being quiet you are rejecting Christ?\u0014\n\u0014\nCyrus was stunned. He had not seen it in that light. Immediately he \ndressed and rode through the dark to the home of a man known for his \nability to explain the gospel. Billy McClung showed Cyrus that he \nmust commit himself to following Christ, confess his sins, and right \nany wrongs he had done to others. Cyrus never looked back. The next \nSunday he stood up in church and declared publicly he had given his \nlife to Jesus. To the end of his life he lived as a Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually McCormick moved his increasingly successful business to \nChicago. Despite his patent, his invention was stolen by many others. \nHe learned to outbuild and outsell his competitors and became \nwealthy. He invested money in Christian education, supported \nmissionaries, and sought reconciliation between the northern and \nsouthern states which were drifting toward war with each other. \u0014\nAlthough a believer in slavery, he freed Jo Anderson, enslaved by the \nMcCormick family, and provided him with land and a cabin long before \nLincolns Emancipation Proclamation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, as many writers have noted, although his heart was always \nwith the South, McCormicks reapers fed the North and freed its men \nto fight in the Union armies.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Cranmer Got the Top Job but Didn't Want it!\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL    2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Thomas Cranmer learned he had been named Archbishop of \nCanterbury by King Henry VIII, he balked. Visiting Germany at the \ntime to promote the King's interest in a divorce, he dawdled seven \nweeks getting back to England. Although the King's word was law, \nCranmer hesitated to accept the position.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English church was in a turmoil over the question of Henry's \ndesired divorce from Catherine. Having presented him with no male \nheir, the queen, once so charming to Henry, was now repugnant. Yet he \ncould not get the Pope to agree to an annulment.\u0014\n\u0014\nCranmer had come to the King's attention when, in conversation with \ntwo of Henry's men, he had suggested that the universities could just \nas well settle the question as the Pope. Henry swore Cranmer had \"the \nright sow by the ear.\" He earmarked the priest to become Archbishop \nof Canterbury, England's highest religious post. Cranmer was \nconsecrated on this date, March 30, 1533.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving himself subject to the King, Cranmer promptly granted Henry \nthe annulment. Throughout his tenure as archbishop, he would do \npretty much whatever the King commanded. Henry's continual shifts of \npolicy often made Cranmer appear wishy-washy. For example, he ruled \nHenry's marriage to Anne of Cleve lawful and six months later \nannulled it as unlawful.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlready leaning toward Protestantism, Cranmer became the chief \narchitect of the English Reformation. He urged the King to place \nBibles in England's churches and it was done. He wrote the first Book \nof Common Prayer. In only a few things did he resist Henry. At some \njeopardy to himself, he pleaded for the lives of Thomas More and \nBishop Fisher and testified for three days against Henry's Six \nArticles which went back to Roman Catholic forms. However, he sat \nwith the persecutors of John Frith and Joan of Kent, both of whom \nwere executed by fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy his twisting and turning, Cranmer escaped execution under Henry. \nHenry trusted him above all his other prelates and on his deathbed \nclung to Cranmer's hand. Under Edward, Cranmer advanced \nProtestantism, helping draft doctrines which became the basis for the \nChurch of England's Thirty Nine Articles.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder pressure, Cranmer supported Lady Jane Gray to succeed Edward. \nIt was not to be. Mary took the throne and charged him with treason \nand heresy. In face of death he recanted his Protestant opinions. \nWhen he learned he was to die anyway, he publicly renounced his \nrecantation. \"As for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy and \nAntichrist, with all his false doctrine.\" When the fire was lit, he \nheld the hand that had signed the recantation into the flame, burning \nit off before the fire touched his body, saying, \"This unworthy right \nhand.\" As death approached he repeated several times, \"Lord Jesus, \nreceive my spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Cranmer, Thomas.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

    "title": "CRANMER INSISTED ON BURNING TWO PEOPLE AND GOT BURNED HIMSELF",
    "words": "WHERE THERE IS A CHURCH established by the state, persecution of \nsects that hold views that differ from the official church often \nfollows. The great reformers of the sixteenth century, including \nLuther, Zwingli, Calvin, Bucer, and Cranmer, were all guilty of \nexecuting or urging the execution of those who differed from them in \nreligious views.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly two such executions took place during the short reign of King \nEdward VI (1547-1553). In general, the English reformers were not \nbloodthirsty. However, they did not tolerate Anabaptists. \nAnabaptists, the ancestors of todays Mennonites (among other groups) \nbelieved that only converts who confessed Christ when old enough to \nunderstand their action could properly be baptized. It was not for \nthat viewpoint that Joan Bocher and George Van Pare were executed, \nhowever, but because of their teachings regarding Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan Bocher, also known as Joan of Kent, had distributed copies of \nTyndales New Testament when it was illegal to do so and had used her \nwealth to relieve prisoners of conscience. She also taught that the \nVirgin Mary had two seeds, one natural and one spiritual, and that \nChrist was the spiritual seed. When confronted about her unusual \nviews, she stuck to them stubbornly and even impudently. Although she \naccepted Jesus as virgin-born and God-man, Cranmer, Ridley, and \nCoverdale condemned her to be burned to death as a blasphemer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Edward refused to sign her death warrant. For a boy, he \nseems to have been far ahead of his adult advisors in wisdom on this \nissue. He said that to burn her was too much like the cruelty the \nsame reformers condemned when it was done by Catholics. Cranmer \nargued with the king until he beat down his objections. With tears in \nhis eyes, Edward finally signed, but warned Cranmer he was \nresponsible if the deed should be wrong. Joan was burned in May 1550.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second victim was a Dutch surgeon named George Van Pare. He was \nknown for his strict and prayerful life. However, he was condemned \nbecause, in addition to his Anabaptist views on baptism, he seems to \nhave denied the full divinity of Christ, saying only God the Father \nwas God. Because he spoke no English, his trial was conducted through \nan interpreter. Cranmer condemned him on this day, 6 April 1551. \nLater that month Pare went to the stake: a historian wrote, He \nsuffered with great constancy of mind and kissed the stake and \nfaggots that were to burn him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were costly precedents. During the reign of Queen Mary, when \nCatholics burned Protestants in large numbers, they gave as their \njustification the executions of Bocher and Pare in addition to others \nthat had taken place under King Henry VIII with Cranmers consent. \nWhen Cranmer himself was led to the stake, people muttered that he \nonly got what he deserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Christmas Facts\u0014\nBelieve it or not\u0014\n\u0014\nThe abbreviation of Xmas for Christmas is not irreligious. The first \nletter of the word Christ in Greek is chi, which is identical to our \nX. Xmas was originally an ecclesiastical abbreviation that was used \nin tables and charts. In the early days of printing, when font sizes \nwere limited and type was set by hand, abbreviations and ditto marks \nwere used liberally. Xmas came into general use from the church!\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are my crackpot ramblings, which you may hold up to ridicule \nthis Yuletide season. Or perhaps you will discern a deeper wisdom in \nmy sound and fury. In any event, you will be entertained, and \npossibly informed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the beginning\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cross so overshadowed the mangerand the resurrection so \novershadowed the incarnationthat neither scripture nor tradition has \npassed down a firm date for Christmas.\u0014\nThe origin of the date\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a very widespread theory that Christmas began in Rome as a \nresponse to pagan festivities centering around the winter solstice, \nwhich was locally considered to be 25 December. The pagan \ncelebration, which was first established by the Roman emperor \nAurelian in AD 274, was called The Birth of the Invincible Sun. \nHowever, there is evidence that, some years earlier, Christians had \nmade a sincere attempt to calculate the actual date of Jesus \nbirthday. People commonly believe that Christmas was instituted on \nthe date of a pagan holiday to supplant it, but it was actually the \nother way around. Christmas was there first.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn ancient Judaism, there was a common belief, which ancient \nChristians inherited, that the prophets of Israel died on the on the \nsame date as their birth or conception. This may be behind the \nlong-standing Christian custom of referring to the date of a martyrs \ndeath as their birthday in heaven. According to ancient western \ncalculations, Jesus was crucified on 25 March, so they assumed that \n25 March was the date of Jesus conception. The Annunciation is still \ncommemorated on that date to this day. Nine months after 25 March \nleads to 25 December, which would be the birthday of Jesus Christ if \nall those assumptions and calculations were correct. They arent \ncorrect, but the fact remains that the date has a Christian origin. \nfootnote\u0014\n\u0014\nIn AD 354, Philocalus wrote a Christian martyrology that dates the \nnativity of Jesus Christ on December 25, and cites an earlier work as \nbackup. From this we can deduce that Christmas was celebrated on the \npresent date at least as early as AD 335 in Rome. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe origin of our present celebration\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas failed to gain prominent or even universal recognition \namong Christians until quite recently. In some protestant-dominated \nareas, such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the celebration of \nChristmas was even legally banned, probably as part of their \nrejection of those parts of the traditional liturgical calendar that \nhave no apparent foundation in Scripture. As late as the last \ncentury, Christmas had gained no great importance; it was not even a \nlegal holiday. This explains why nineteenth-century readers found it \ncredible that Scrooge could require Cratchit to come to work on \nChristmas Day and why in the nineteenth century the US Congress could \nmeet on Christmas Day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe origins of Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus, presents, and trees\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Nicholas Day (December 6) was the traditional day for giving \ngifts to children. It is still the day on which children receive \ngifts from St. Nicholas in the Netherlands. Epiphany (January 6) is, \nin the western Church, the commemoration of day on which the three \nkings presented the baby Jesus with gifts.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Nicholas was the bishop of Myra in Lycia, which is in modern \nTurkey, sometime before AD 350. Nothing is known of his life except \nfor the legends that have built up around him, but he was associated \nwith kindness to children. He was a widely admired saint throughout \nthe eastern and western churches. The Dutch custom of giving presents \nto children on St. Nicholas Day was brought to America by early Dutch \nsettlers in New Amsterdam, which was renamed New York when the \nBritish took over the colony. Santa Claus is the American \npronunciation of Sinter Klaas, which was colloquial Dutch for Saint \nNicholas.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the US, gifts are now exchanged on Christmas Day in a sort of \ncompromise of Dutch, German, and British gift-giving customs. The \nChristmas tree is a Christianized pagan custom that originated in \nGermany. German settlers introduced it in America. It became popular \nduring the nineteenth century, and then later spread to Britain and \nJapan from the US.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe origin of the retail madness\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring World War II it was necessary for Americans to mail Christmas \ngifts early for the troops in Europe to receive them in time. \nMerchants joined in the effort to remind the public to shop and mail \nearly and the protracted shopping season was born. Since those days, \nretail merchants have been hard at work to escalate our retail \nobservances this time of year. Accordingly, we shop longer and buy \nmore than ever before. Retailers have taken the gift motif from Saint \nNicholas Day and Epiphany and have used the combination to supplant \nthe meaning of Christmas. They have instituted a secular sacrament of \nshopping, which pays no attention at all to the arrival of the Giver \nwho gave His all. They call it a season for giving, and with that \nlaudable slogan have lured us into a time of great expectations, huge \nlet-downs, and lascivious acquisitiveness. They could not have done \nthis without our full cooperationfor instead of celebrating the \narrival of our salvation, we jump with glee and clap our hands at the \narrival of the UPS truck!\u0014\n\u0014\nTruly, we have a form of giving, but not the spirit thereof. They all \nrolled over, and one fell out\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Advent has become a shopping season, and Christmas is over as \nsoon as the wrapping paper has been set out in the trash. In fact, \nSanta Claus has out-done Jesus: in Japan, where Christian believers \nmake up a very small percentage of the population, Santa Claus and \ngift-giving has become big business. One person who read this essay \nwrote to me to tell about his visit to Tokyo right before Christmas. \nHe said the department store decorations included a manger scene, \ncomplete with the baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Mickey, and Goofy. Bad \ntaste, you say? But it is our fault for trivializing our own holy \nday. Only two percent of all Japanese are Christians, so how could \nthey know?\u0014\n\u0014\nPoor Jesus! For on His birthday we give earrings to Mother and \nslippers to Dad and a bicycle to Junior, but nothing to Him. We yearn \nfor possessions, and not for Him. We seek out appropriate gifts for \nall our loved ones except for Him for whom we can shop without money \nor credit cards or lay-away plan. Some of us no longer even give Him \nlip service, lest someone think we are too religious.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow you can remedy this lamentable situation\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus once spoke of a person taking good things and bad things from a \nstorehouse. At this time of the year, we become that person, taking \ngood things and bad things from our historic Christian heritage. We \ncannot simply reject or embrace everything that is there: we must \ndiscern what is good and reject what is bad. We do not want to end up \nwith bah humbug attitude of the Puritans, nor do we wish to tacky \nup our homes with decorations until truckers stop and ask if Jolene \nis working this shift. Neither extreme is desirable. Christmas is a \njumble of good things and bad things, and we must be discerning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThink of our nominal birthday boy this year. If anyone can have \ncompassion on people who are plagued with holiday blues, it certainly \nmust be Jesus on His birthday. This year, let Him be the guest of \nhonor at your party.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam J. Tighe, a history professor at Muhlenberg College, explains \nthe date of Christmas in his article Calculating Christmas, \npublished in the December 2003 issue of Touchstone Magazine\u0014",

    "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE",
    "words": "Characteristics of Apocalyptic Literature -- Ray Summers\u0014\n\u0014\nThe task of classifying the many characteristics of apocalyptic \nliterature seems almost endless. Some authors give a general \nclassification to cover all such literature. Others give \ncharacteristics of Jewish apocalypses alone. Still others list the \ncharacteristics of Revelation, the New Testament apocalypse. There \nappear to be almost as many different classifications of \ncharacteristics as there are interpretations of the book; and these \nare legion. The classification followed here is largely arbitrary. \nThe main effort is to indicate all the major characteristics as they \nwould touch Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI. Apocalyptic was always possessed of a historical significance. \nThere was ever some critical historical situation with which it was \nconnected. Elements of this historical situation are represented by \nthe imagery of the book. Knowledge of the historical. situation out \nof which the apocalyptic work grew greatly facilitates \ninterpretation. This cannot be done with perfect assurance in all \ncases, but the evidences favor the Domitianic persecution as the \nbackground of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe truth is self-evident that a knowledge of the historical \nsituation lends much aid in determining the correct interpretation. \nIt has been observed previously that the main purpose of apocalyptic \nliterature was to bring comfort, assurance, and courage in difficult \ndays. To know the days concerned is to know the courage needed and to \nunderstand better the message employed to bring this courage. To \nignore the historical situation is to ignore the main piece in the \njigsaw of interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Generally, apocalyptic literature is of pseudonymous authorship. \nThe writers of these books generally wrote in the name of some great \nman of the past, Enoch, Abraham, or Moses, rather than in their own \nnames. Undoubtedly different reasons led to this procedure, which \ntoday is rather difficult to understand in spiritual men with an \nearnest message. To the writer there was doubtless nothing unethical \nin such a course of action, since they used so much from early \nsources that in many cases they were giving credit where credit was \ndue. Then, too, the Hebrew writer was almost wholly devoid of the \npride of authorship and showed no jealousy as to his literary rights. \nHe was little concerned as to his personal fame; his sole object was \nthe service of God and the well-being of the nation. Another reason \nfor this method has been suggested by Charles after a study of all \nthe Jewish apocalyptic literature in connection with the conditions \nand attitudes behind it. When the law reached supremacy among the \nJews, it left no room for prophecy of any kind since it claimed to be \nthe complete revelation of God. When the idea of an inspired \nlaw-adequate, infallible, and valid for all time-had become an \naccepted dogma for Judaism, as it became in the post-Exilic period, \nthere was no longer room for an independent representative of God to \nappear with God's message.\u0014\n\u0014\nProceeding from this basis, Charles indicates that the prophet who \nreleased a prophecy under his own name after the time of Ezra and \nNehemiah could not expect a hearing. Against the reception of false \ntruth the Law stood in the way unless the book containing it came \nunder certain great names of the past. Against the claims and \nauthorities of such names the official representatives of the Law \nwere in part reduced to silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLegalism, becoming absolute, determined henceforth the character of \nJudaism. Prophecy and apocalyptic, which had exercised a determining \ninfluence in many of the great crises of the nation and had given \nbirth to and shaped the higher theology of Judaism, were driven from \ntheir positions of secondary authority and either banished absolutely \nor relegated wholly into the background.\u0014\nAll Jewish apocalypses, therefore, from 200 b.c. onward were of \nnecessity pseudonymous if they sought to exercise any real influence \non the nation. For the Law was everything; belief in inspiration was \ndead amongst them, and their canon was closed. Charles holds that \nthis did not hold true with reference to the apocalypse of the New \nTestament, as will be indicated in the discussion of authorship of \nthe book of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen suggests yet a third reason for the advisability of concealing \nthe authorship of apocalyptic literature. This reason is a very \npersonal one with the writer of the books in question. It has been \nobserved previously that the books of this type were free to prophesy \ndoom upon the political power then in control. Anonymity might have \nled to investigations or might have brought punishment upon some \nsupposed writer if the book fell into the hands of authorities; but \nif they thought it to have been written by some author who lived long \nago, there was nothing they could do but endeavor to suppress it \nsince the author was beyond their power. At first glance this may \nappear to be an unworthy motive, but when all the circumstances are \nconsidered, including the good accomplished by a work which could not \notherwise be available to the people, criticism fades.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. A third characteristic of apocalyptic literature is the \npresentation of the message through visions. This method was often \nused by the prophets, but in apocalyptic writings it became the chief \nmethod of expressing truth. These visions vary from scenes in heaven \nto scenes on earth. They abound in heavenly messengers or angels who \nare God's agents in the securing of his revelation to the seer.\u0014\nThere has been an abundance of discussion as to whether or not the \nwriters actually saw the visions they describe. Some incline to the \nview that the writer saw the truth to be conveyed and then out of \nexperience, conditions, and available literature he formed the images \nand visions used. Scholars are of divergent opinions on the matter. \nAll agree that the most important question is the religious value of \nthe teaching and not the form used in presenting the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nA close study of the New Testament apocalypse leaves a strong \nimpression that the visions recorded were objectively real to John. \nThis impression comes from the nature of the symbols and figures in \nthe course of the visions as well as from references in which John \nseems to make a direct claim that the visions were objective. Perhaps \nit is a matter of little importance. Objective or subjective, they \npresent the same truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe highly elaborate vision is the most distinctive feature in the \nform of apocalyptic literature. The subject matter is attributed to a \nspecial revelation, commonly given in visions, ecstasies, or raptures \ninto the unseen world. The vision or rapture in apocalyptic writings \nis a literary form wrought out with great fulness of details, often \nwith strange symbolism and with fantastic imagery. It is this mode of \nunveiling hidden things in these writings that has given them the \nname apocalyptic.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. As a fourth characteristic of apocalyptic literature, we find a \npredictive element. A review of the conditions out of which this type \nof literature grew will indicate the truth that the future is dealt \nwith in apocalyptic. As has already been observed, apocalyptic was \nthe word for a dark day and condition. It pictured the present as a \ntime of evil, turmoil, persecution, upheaval, but the future was \npredicted to be a glorious period of vindication, triumph, and \nfreedom from all the handicaps which beset us here. Thus it is noted \nthat the prediction of the future is general, in the main, and deals \nwith the character of events rather than the details. Caution should \nbe observed and dogmatism avoided at this point in the interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. One of the main characteristics of apocalyptic is the use of \nsymbol. Among writers of this type of literature there was developed \nan elaborate system of cryptic symbols and figures of speech for the \nexpression of spiritual ideas. The writer was faced with the task of \nseeing the invisible, painting the unpaintable, and expressing the \ninexpressible. The writing is therefore full of imagery and symbolism \nwhich are hard to understand, and which make the task of the modern \ninterpreter far removed from those conditions exceedingly difficult. \nSymbolism is a system in which qualities, ideas, principles, etc., \nare represented by things concrete. These symbols have a meaning for \nthe initiated but are hopeless jargon to one unacquainted with such \nterms. Richardson calls attention to a man who was in prison because \nhe had \"bumped off a bird in Alabama\" and to the fact that the \"soup\" \nwhich a safecracker would use would hardly be fit to serve as a \ndinner course. These are illustrations on a very low level of \nsymbolic language-language with a double meaning. The apocalyptic \nwriters by compulsion of the unsympathetic and often hostile \nenvironment in which they and their readers lived developed a system \nof symbols, figures, and codes for comparatively safe communication. \nThus, one cannot interpret symbols as one would interpret prose where \nthe meaning lies on the surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe writer employs the symbols as a method of communicating his \nthoughts to those who were familiar with the process and at the same \ntime concealing his ideas from those outside this circle. The symbols \nare often arbitrary rather than natural, as were the illustrations \nused by the prophets. The meaning of the greater part of the symbols \nis clear, but there are some symbols in the interpretation of which \nthere is much room for diversity of opinion. About these symbols one \ncannot afford to be dogmatic. It appears that the wise thing to do in \ninterpreting symbols is to follow the proper method of interpreting \nparables-find the central truth which is being portrayed and let the \ndetails fit in in the most natural way.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the main usages of symbol in this literature is found in the \nsymbolism of numbers. Even a casual reading of the Revelation \nimpresses one with the frequent recurrence of certain numbers. This \nsame thing is true in the other literature of this class. Because of \nthis fact, it appears wise to include a discussion of the symbolism \nof numbers in this discussion. Most of the discussion which follows \non this matter is a summary taken from Wishart with occasional \nreferences to other works.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe symbolism of numbers: The inner significance of numbers was a \nkind of device which always had fascination for the Oriental mind. In \nthat early day, when language was primitive and the vocabulary \nmeager, one Hebrew word sometimes was compelled to do duty for a \nscore of diverse meanings. Under such conditions men came naturally \nto use numbers as we use words. They were the symbols of moral or \nspiritual truth. A certain number would suggest a definite concept. \nThe conceptions arose quite naturally through certain primitive \nassociations. Just as the sound of a given word by long habit calls \nup the corresponding idea, so a certain number, by acquired \nassociation, called up a definite concept. Such numbers become \nsymbols and cannot be read with the literal exactness that we employ \nwhen interpreting mathematical formulae.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter this fashion men saw a single object and came to associate with \nthe number \"1\" the idea of unity or independent existence. It stood \nfor that which was unique and alone. This word does not appear \nsymbolically in the book of Revelation. It is, of course, at the base \nof other numbers that do appear-some frequently.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid the dangers of primitive life, with a fear of wild beasts, or of \nhostile attack by his enemies constantly before him, man gained \ncourage in companionship. Two were far stronger and more effective \nthan one. Thus the number \"2\" came to stand for strengthening, for \nconfirmation, for redoubled courage and energy. There was a symbolic \nsignificance in the fact that Jesus sent his disciples forth two by \ntwo. Two witnesses confirmed the truth, and their testimony which \notherwise would have been weak was made strong. Always this number \nmeant augmented strength, redoubled energy, confirmed power. So in \nthe book of Revelation the truth of God is confirmed by two witnesses \nwho are slain and rise again and ascend to heaven. This symbolizes a \nstrong witness which prospers then seems to be beaten to earth only \nto rise again to heavenly triumph. Likewise there are two wild beasts \nmutually confirming and supporting each other as they wage war \nagainst the cau5e of righteousness. They present a formidable foe. \nBut over against them God has a \"twofold\" instrument of warfare-the \nconquering Christ and the sickle of judgment. These prove to be too \ngreat for the two beasts to defeat. Thus, symbolically, we see the \ncause of righteousness triumph over evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nWishart suggests that man found in his primitive home the divinest \nthing that life had to offer him-father love, mother love, filial \nlove. He found God reflected in the interplay of love and kindness \nand affection in his own household and began to think of the number \n\"3\"' as a symbol of the divine. In his more thoughtful moments he \ncarried that idea back into his conception of God. For this reason, \ndoubtless, there appear glimmerings of a Trinity not only in the \ntheology of the Hebrews but in the dreams of the Greeks. The divinest \nthing in life was \"3\" and the divine origin of life was \"3.\" Here in \nthe ultimate world ground were father love, mother love, and child \nlove. Here, too, were the glimpses of the great mysteries which we \nexpress in the terms \"Father,\" \"Son,\" and \"Holy Ghost.\" Three came to \ncarry the thought of the divine.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen man went outside his home and looked about him, he had no \nconception of the modern world as we know it. No Copernicus had ever \nopened his eyes to the vast significance of the universe. To him the \nworld was a great flat surface with four boundaries, east and west \nand north and south. There were four winds from the four sides of the \nearth. There were four angels, he thought, to govern the four winds. \nIn the town he placed himself within the limit of four walls. Thus \nwhen he thought of the world he thought in terms of four. Four became \nthe cosmic number. In Revelation there appear four living creatures \nsymbolical of the four divisions of animal life of the world. There \nare four horsemen symbolical of the destructive powers of the world \nat war. The world in which men lived and worked and died was \nconveniently symbolized by \"4.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNext, man turned from the study of his home and the world about him \nto study himself. Perhaps our decimal system arose from the intensive \nstudy by a man of his own fingers and toes. That was a crude and \ncruel age where many were maimed and crippled through disease, \naccident, or warfare. A perfect, full-rounded man was one who had all \nhis members intact. So the number \"5\" doubled to \"10\" came to stand \nfor human completeness. The whole duty of man was summed up in \"10\" \ncommandments. The picture of complete power in government was that of \na beast with ten horns. In Revelation the dragon, the first beast, \nand the scarlet beast have ten horns each, and in the case of this \nlast beast the ten horns are called ten kings-complete world power as \nit appeared to belong to Rome with her provincial system. As a \nmultiple, \"xo\" occurs also in many of the higher numbers of \nRevelation; \"70\" =a very sacred number, \"1000\" = ultimate \ncompleteness-completeness raised to the nth degree, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen man began to analyze and combine numbers, he developed other \ninteresting symbols. He took the perfect world number \"4\" and added \nto it the perfect divine number \"3\" and got \"7,\" the most sacred \nnumber to the Hebrews. It was earth crowned with heaventhe \nfour-square earth plus the divine completeness of God. So we have \"7\" \nexpressing completeness through union of earth with heaven. This \nnumber runs throughout the book of Revelation. There are seven \nSpirits, seven churches, seven golden candlesticks, seven stars, \nseven sections to the book, each, save the last, divided into seven \nparts. The sacred number, multiplied by the complete number \"10,\" \nresulted in the very sacred \"70.\" There were seventy members of the \nJewish high court, Jesus sent out seventy prepared workers. In a \nsweeping figure he presented the idea of an unlimited Christian \nforgiveness when he told a disciple to forgive his brother seventy \ntimes seven.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the field of multiplication, \"4\" was multiplied by \"3,\" and the \nresultant \"12\" became a well-known symbol. In Hebrew religious \nthought it was the symbol of organized religion in the world. There \nwere twelve tribes of Israel, twelve apostles, twelve gates to the \nHoly City in Revelation. This number was reduplicated to 144,000 when \nthe writer of our Apocalypse wanted to picture the security of a \nperfect number sealed from the wrath of God visited upon the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the realm of division the perfect number \"7\" was cut in half. The \nresulting \"3 1/2\" came to express the incomplete, that which was \nimperfect. It symbolized restless longings not yet fulfilled, \naspirations unrealized. When the writer of apocalyptic wished to \ndescribe that condition, when he found it necessary to picture the \nworld waiting for something which had not arrived, when he saw men in \ndespair and confusion seeking for peace and light, he used \"3 1/2\" \nThis takes several forms: \"3 1/2\" a time, times, and a half time,\" \n\"forty-two months,\" \"1,260 days,\"all have the same meaning. In \nRevelation two witnesses preached \"3 1/2\" years-an indefinite time; \nthe court of the Temple was trample,4 by the ungodly \"3 1/2\" years; \nthe saints were persecuted forty-two months; the church was in the \nwilderness \"1,260 days.\" Always \"3 1/2\" or its equivalent stood for \nthe indefinite, the incomplete, the dissatisfied; but in it all were \nthe hope and patient waiting for a better day when truth would be \ndelivered from the scaffold and placed on the throne usurped by wrong.\u0014\nOne last number must be treated in this study of symbolism. To the \nJew the number \"6\" had a sinister meaning. As \"7\" was the sacred \nnumber, \"6\" fell short of it and failed. \"Six\" was the charge that \nmet defeat, with success just in its grasp. It had within it the \nstroke of doom. It had the ability to be great but failed to measure \nup. It was for the Jew what \"13\" is for many today-an evil number. \nSome buildings skip from floor twelve to fourteen because thirteen is \na bad rental proposition. Many hotels have rooms 12, 12A, and 14, but \nno 13, because no one wants to sleep in that room. It is possible \nthat the dread of this number goes back to a night when thirteen men \nbroke bread at the same table. From that room went one to commit the \nblackest betrayal in history and one to make the supreme sacrifice of \nhistory. Thus \"6\" was an evil number for the Jews. It is important to \nkeep this in mind when we come to the number \"666\" in Revelation.\u0014\nFrom this observation of the symbolic use of numbers, it follows that \nthe numbers which occur in the book of Revelation cannot be \nunderstood with real numerical value, nor even as round numbers. They \nare purely symbolic, and we must discard our mathematical ideas and \nseek to discover their symbolic significance. A large part of the \nunscriptural dispensationalism of the past and present is based upon \na false view of the value of the numbers employed by the writer.\u0014\n\u0014\nApart from this symbolism of numbers in Revelation, there is an \nabundance of other figurative language. Many objects are used \nsymbolically. Birds, beasts, persons, cities, elements of nature, \nweapons, qualities (light, darkness, etc.), precious stones-all these \nand many others are made to serve the writer's purpose as he gives to \nus his picture book of the triumph of righteousness over evil. \"In \nthis weird world of fantasy, peopled by a rich Oriental imagination \nwith spectral shapes and uncouth figures, where angels flit, eagles \nand altars speak, and monsters rise from sea and land in a world of \nthis kind many Asiatic Christians of that age evidently were at home, \nand there the prophet's message had to find them.\" One cannot \npossibly approach the true interpretation of Revelation if he ignores \nthis central characteristic.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. The dramatic element, one of the most effective instruments of any \nwriter, serves as another characteristic of apocalyptic. One of the \nchief purposes of apocalyptic literature was to make the truth taught \nas vivid and forceful as possible. Frequently the figures are \npresented for the purpose of adding vividness to aid in creating the \ndesired impression. The details are of significance only from this \nviewpoint and are not to be pressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis principle is true of many of the visions and figures in the \nbook. It makes its vivid and dramatic impression upon the reader by \nmeans of the grotesque and terrific symbols. Rivers of blood; \nhailstones weighing one hundred pounds; a dragon so large he knocks \ndown a third of the stars when he lashes with his tail; Death riding \na horse, with the Grave following behind; a woman, with the moon as a \ndress and the sun as a footstool; animals with many heads and horns; \na dragon that casts from its mouth a river of water to destroy a \nwoman who is flying through the air; a dragon, a beast, and a false \nprophet, each of which vomits up a frog which joins in gathering an \narmy-all these are symbolical, but they are more than just symbols. \nThey are exaggerated symbols for the purpose of a dramatic effect. \nThe meaning of the figure is to be discerned by viewing it in broad \nperspective as a whole and not by trying to determine the meaning of \neach minute detail. One must not become so interested in the actor \nthat he forgets the plot and its meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis survey of the characteristics of apocalyptic literature helps us \nto see at once that we are not dealing with ordinary literature and \nhence cannot use ordinary methods of interpretation. This literature \nis thus written to unveil its message. This message can only be \nunveiled to us when we rightly interpret the symbols as they were \nrelated to the background of the book and as they conveyed their \nmessage to those who first received the book. Its meaning for them is \nits meaning for us. Therefore, we must find that meaning to know the \napplication of the book today.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWorthy Is the Lamb: An Interpretation of Revelation.\u0014",

    "words": "CROWDS COULDNT GET IN TO HEAR MENDELSSOHNS REVIVAL OF BACH\u0014\n\u0014\nIMAGINE THE STIR twenty-year-old Felix Mendelssohn created in Berlin \nwhen he revived Johann Sebastian Bachs neglected masterwork, The \nSaint Matthew Passion. On this day, 11 March 1829, a thousand people \nhad to be turned away from the Sing-Akadamie for lack of room. Demand \nwas so great a second performance had to be scheduled as soon as \npossible, and then a third. Ironically, the Sing-Akadamies director \nhad balked at authorizing the performance, believing interest would \nbe low.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach had first introduced the work one hundred-and-two-years earlier \non this day, 11 March 1727, with perhaps as few as twenty singers \ndivided into two choirs at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig. The libretto \nwas largely taken from the Gospel of Matthew chapters 26 and 27, \nrecounting the arrest, Crucifixion, burial, and Resurrection of \nJesus. Interspersed between the Scriptures were related poems and \nhymns that added theological understanding to the bare biblical \nnarrative.\u0014\n\u0014\nMendelssohn first became aware of the masterpiece at fourteen when \nhis grandmother, Bella Salomon, a Bach collector, presented him with \na copy of the score. He spent five years adapting it in preparation \nfor its famous revival. Mendelssohn employed well over a hundred \nperformers and cut the work almost by half. Conductors thought \nnineteenth-century audiences, accustomed to Classical and Romantic \npieces, would not sit for three hours of Bachs dry, old-fashioned, \nand mathematical baroque music.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, the performance led to a major revival of Bachs music, \nincluding his enormous repertoire of religious works. Never have I \nknown any performance so consecrated by one united sympathy, wrote \none participant. French composer Hector Berlioz marveled at the Bach \nmania, summing it up wittily with the words, There is but one \ngodBachand Mendelssohn, his prophet. By 1841, when Mendelssohn \nagain led a performance, audiences were acclimatized to Bach and he \nrestored many of the passages he had cut twelve years earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince its revival, Saint Matthew Passion has been performed in its \nentirety hundreds of times. In the Netherlands, for instance, many \nlocal ensembles make an annual Easter tradition of presenting the \nPassion. The Netherlands Bach Society has a fine free performance on \nYouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwVW1ttVhuQ) as well as a \nperformance of Bachs shorter and sunnier Saint John Passion \n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMf9XDQBAaI).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Mendelssohn was inspired by Bachs monumental Passion, in the \nnineteenth century, twentieth-century Swiss composer Frank Martin \ndeclared that hearing it when he was ten-years-old was his most \nformative musical experience. Inspired by Bachs use of two choirs, \nMartin composed his highly-regarded Mass for Double Choir also \navailable on YouTube \n(https://youtu.be/J4c0ecGbtqY?si=YdfBBdtDTpSpNQur). \u0014\n\u0014\nAs is well-known, Bach wrote his music for the glory of God and for \nthe re-creation of his listeners.

She \nconsidered playing at Notre Dame, a Catholic university, before \nopting for Iowa. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe knows that she has some talents that other people werent \nnecessarily born with, and shes just looking to maximize them not \njust for herself but for her teammates, and on an even bigger scope \nfor the fans, Kristin Meyer, her high school coach, told Crux. Its \nnot just about scoring a lot of points or winning; she loves playing \nin front of a sold-out arena because she gets to entertain people and \nbring a smile to their face. For two hours she lets them have this \ngreat experience and she takes that pretty seriously, and knows that \nthose gifts from God are an opportunity to bring joy to other \npeople. \u0014\n\u0014\nNext season, Clark will be playing in the WNBA, most likely for the \nIndiana Fever, which has the No. 1 pick in the draft. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer path to stardom began as a freshman when she led the NCAA in \nscoring with 26.6 points per game. As a sophomore, she averaged an \nNCAA-leading 27 points, and as a junior, she averaged 27.8 (which \nranked second to Villanovas Maddy Siegrists 29.2 points). This \nseason she is averaging 31.9 points, which leads all women in college \nbasketball. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe has 56 career 30-plus point games - the most in all of college \nbasketball over the last 25 seasons. She does more than simply score, \nthough, as she leads her team and the Big 10 in assists.\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Joseph Pins, pastor of the familys church, St. Francis, said \nClark does a great job just living out the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere proud of our alumna who has done such a great, great, great, \nthing in life, Pins told Crux. Its always good as we form children \nto watch this go through and see success not just on the basketball \ncourt but also in her faith life.\u0014\n\u0014\nClark, while in high school, said the religious aspects of Dowling \nCatholic were a big reason she enjoyed playing here.  \u0014\n\u0014\nWe get to live our faith every day. Dowling starts every day with \nprayer and ends every day with prayer, Clark told the Des Moines \nRegister in 2018. This is a big reason why Dowling has such a \nspecial culture and is such a special place to go to school.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2023, when Iowa advanced to the Final Four, the parish held a \nwatch party so parishioners could gather and cheer on their favorite \nplayer, together. \u0014\n\u0014\nShes a team player. Shes very humble, said parishioner Shelley \nGoodell. I think she represents whats best about being raised in \nthe Catholic faith. She really is the perfect role model for all the \nkids.\u0014\n\u0014\nClark often signs autographs for fans after games, staying long after \nthe final horn. Earlier this season, she made national headlines when \nshe gave her game-worn shoes to a 10-year-old girl at courtside. \nClark said the young girl had caught her eye during pregame warmups. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat girl had my jersey on, and it was cute. She was copying our \nstretching warming up, so I thought it was adorable, Clark said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop William Joensen, who serves in the familys parish, told Crux \nthat Clark continues to draw strength, perspective and peace from \nher presence at Mass and the Gospel values instilled in her.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe takes seriously her call to be a role model to young girls \nespecially, Joensen said, and to all who mark this phenomenal \nachievement.\u0014",

    "words": "Christmaker\u0014\nBy James F. McGrath. Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing \nCHRISTMAKER: A Life of John the Baptist. Company, 2024. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost Christians know the name of John the Baptist. He is a central \ncharacter in the Advent story and appears again on Baptism of Jesus \nSunday (the Sunday after Epiphany), along with several other \nreferences. He is eternally connected with Jesus, as a possible \ncousin, forerunner, and the one who baptizes Jesus. Many who know the \nname of John the Baptist, likely have imbibed a certain image of \nJohn. Hes probably dressed in animal skins (maybe the summer dress \nof a caveman). You might mistake him for the crazy guy with a \nsandwich board who yells at people on the street corner telling them \nto repent or theyll go to hell. Then theres his diet of locusts and \nwild honey. Then theres the matter of his arrest and death on the \norders of Herod Antipas, an execution that takes place after the \ndaughter of his wife Herodias dances for him. We likely know certain \nparts of Johns story, but could there be more to the story? Might \nJohn be more than simply Jesuss forerunner? In other words, could \nthe conventional story of John the Baptist be off the mark?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor inquiring minds who wish to know more of Johns story and whether \nwe need a corrective, we are fortunate to have James McGraths book \nChristmaker: A Life of John the Baptist. McGrath offers this volume \nas an accessible introduction to the life of John the Baptist. He has \nalso written a second, more academic version, titled John of History, \nBaptist of Faith: The Quest for the Historical Baptizer. McGrath \npoints the reader to that volume for those wishing to dive deeper \ninto the story of John the Baptist. I plan on offering a review of \nthat more in-depth volume, but first I would like to introduce you to \nthis volume.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough I thought I knew the story of John the Baptist fairly well, \nin reading Christmaker, I discovered that there is much more to the \nstory than I had imagined. The Gospels tell us that John served as \nthe precursor or forerunner to the ministry of Jesus. He was called \nby God to prepare the way for Jesus, and therefore he would play a \nsecondary role in the story. According to Luke, he was Jesuss \ncousin. He is the one who baptizes Jesus, launching Jesuss ministry, \nbefore finally getting arrested and executed on the orders of Herod \nAntipas. But what if Jesus started out as one of Johns followers and \nthen took over leadership of that movement after Johns arrest and \nexecution? Then there is the question of where John got his start, \nespecially since, according to Luke, he was the son of a priest. \nWhere did he get the idea of using baptism to call people to \nrepentance with the offer of forgiveness? Was he a Nazarite? Was he \nan Essene?  There are many questions that are left hanging by what is \nfound in the Gospels, though Josephus fills in part of the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames McGrath teaches New Testament literature and language at Butler \nUniversity and is the author of several booksboth academic and \npopular. The most recent book, prior to Christmaker is The A to Z of \nthe New Testament: Things Experts Know that Everyone Else Should Too, \n(Eerdmans, 2023). His interest in John the Baptist is not only rooted \nin his studies of the Gospels but also in his interest in the Mandean \nreligious community, a community in which John the Baptist factors \nprominently. What makes his work on John the Baptist unique is his \nuse of Mandean accounts to help us better understand Johns life and \nministry. Thus, he draws the Gospel accounts, Mandean accounts, along \nwith Josephus and other apocryphal accounts that speak of Johns life \nand ministry. He notes that more of the legends (both early and \nlate) contain at least a faint echo of the voice of the historical \nJohn than has hitherto been acknowledged. Some of what is familiar \ntells us much, much more about John than anyone has realized (p. 8). \nWhile John has been overshadowed by Jesus, who is featured throughout \nthis book, John is an important figure in his own right and deserves \nto have his story better understood. Since John and Jesus are deeply \nintertwined, if we are to truly know one, we should know the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Christmaker, McGrath takes us from Johns origins as Zechariahs \nRebellious Son (Chapter 1) to his arrest and death (Chapter 5: The \nLast Days), along with a reflection on his impact (Chapter 6: No One \nIs Greater than John).\u0014\nIn Chapter 1, we encounter the one McGrath speaks of as being A \nRebellious Son. The reason for this reference is that John was born \nto be a priest and yet he rejected that calling. McGrath suggests \nthat Elizabeths decision to dedicate her son to God, likely making \nhim a perpetual Nazarite, which would have involved his not cutting \nhis hair, would have prevented him from becoming a priest like his \nfather. So we encounter this figure who lives on the margins of \nsociety, dressing in rough clothing and eating locusts and honey. \nWhile he shared some aspects of the Essene vision, his views were \ndifferent enough to make it unlikely that he was an Essene. While we \noften envision him being something of a hermit, if we pay attention \nwe discover that John gathered around himself disciples who shared \nhis vision. One of those persons might have been Jesus. Since rebels \ntend to attract rebels, he writes that it should come as no surprise \nto discover that Johns most famous follower, Jesus of Nazareth, was \naccused of being a rebellious son as well (p. 27). The two may have \nhad different emphases, but they shared a common vision of their \ncontext and the Temple.\u0014\nJesus is known for preaching against the Temple, but according to \nMcGrath he shared this view with John. Thus, the second chapter is \ntitled I Will Destroy This Temple. Even as John rejected his \nfathers calling, he turned against the Temple, offering Baptism as \nan alternative. While immersion for purity was a common practice, \nJohn offered it as an alternative to the Temple sacrifices as a means \nof receiving forgiveness of sins. It served as an important challenge \nto the Temple system since Johns baptism was free and did not \nrequire travel to the Temple, while Temple sacrifices required money, \neven for the cheapest sacrifices.  In doing this John also fulfilled \nhis priestly calling. When it comes to whether John was connected to \nthe Essenes, though there were similarities, including protests \nagainst the Temple leadership, the Essenes still held out hope of a \nrestoration of the Temple leadership, while John completely \nrepudiated the Temple. Thus, if Jesus was his follower, which I think \nMcGrath has demonstrated here, then Jesus was not part of the Essene \ncommunity either. Therefore, it is likely that what Jesus did was \nextend and expand Johns ministry.\u0014\nChapter 3, The Lost Sheep of Israel, speaks to Johns attempts to \nconnect with an audience and to draw to himself followers. Again, we \nare reminded that John wasnt the wild man we often envision, but \nrather a person who could draw people to himself. McGrath writes that \nJohn was a passionate individual with a great boldness and \ndirectness, and at the same time, he was a teacher who gathered \nstudents, people who were impressed with what they heard him say and \neager to learn more (Luke3:10-14; John 135; 3:25). Eventually, people \nflocked from far and wide to hear him, and the extent of his \ninfluence was remarkable (p. 66-67). Among those who gathered around \nhim most likely was Jesus. What we have is a movement of people who \nfound the establishment less than helpful and sought a different way \nof being the people of Israel.\u0014\nJohn is quoted as speaking of someone who would follow him. It is in \nChapter 4, Someone Is Coming, that McGrath begins to develop more \nfully the relationship of John and Jesus. Thus, we have Johns role \nas the Christmaker. What is important to note here is that John most \nlikely didnt see himself being Jesuss forerunner, even when he \nspoke of someone coming after him. He writes that it is much more \nlikely that John saw his prediction of a stronger one to emerge from \nhis followers as an invitation rather than a reference to someone \nalready identified (p. 97). This isnt how we usually read the \nGospel accounts of Johns ministry, but it makes the most sense \ncontextually. What McGrath does here, however, is show how John could \nhave been perceived to be a messiah and a threat to the political \nestablishment. He might have espoused nonviolence, but that doesnt \nmean the authorities didnt perceive him to be a threat. Thus, he was \narrested and executed. What McGrath seeks to do as well is affirm the \npremise that John and Jesus were not at odds or rivals but had a \nsimilar goalthe establishment of Gods realmeven if they may have \ndiffered at certain points.\u0014\nThe story of Johns execution has long fascinated people, especially \nthe suggestion that a drunken Herod Antipas was so taken by the dance \nof his wifes daughter that he promised her half his kingdom. In many \nways the Gospels let Antipas off easy, blaming the wife, but as \nMcGrath demonstrates in Chapter 5, The Last Days, Antipas had every \nreason to have John executed\u0014\nFor full review, see Document/Christmaker\u0014",

    "title": "COMMENTS ON SOME EPHESIAN PASSAGES",
    "words": "Ephesians 3:1-13.  This passage is not one of my favorites about \nPaul.  He makes a claim in verse three that troubles me.  Here, and \nat other places in his writings, he declares that his knowledge \nabout Christian faith came to him by personal revelation (only) \n(v.3).  Paul did not know Jesus personally, and he claims that he did \nnot learn anything about the life and teachings of Jesus from any of \nthe eye-witnesses of Jesus life.  \u0014\n\u0014\nI have not been able to find where Paul cited the teachings of Jesus \nas the basis for Pauls teachings about the Christian life.  He \ndeclares that he was made an apostle to the Gentiles by Jesus in \nhis Damascus Road conversion experience, but in all his early \npreaching, he preached to Jews, and on his missionary journeys he \nwent first to synagogues and worked among Jews until he was driven \nto turn to the Gentiles because he was  made to do so by rejection \nby Judaizers. \u0014\n\u0014\nPauls central tenet of faith is that the crucifixion of Jesus was a \nsubstitute blood sacrifice to atone for  original sin so that \nhumanity (Adams descendants) might be forgiven and no longer bear \nAdams guilt.  But his belief in substitute blood sacrifice came down \nto him in his childhood rearing in Gamaliels rabbinical school.\u0014\n\u0014\nSubstitute sacrifice was begun by Moses after the Exodus and made \ncentral in the animal sacrifices of Mosaic Law. Paul found in the \ncrucifixion of Jesus a fulfillment of Mosaic atonement faith.  Now \nlet me be  clear.  Paul was historically the most influential person \nin the development and spread of Christian faith during the first \nhalf-century after the life and death of Jesus.  Pauls doctrine of \nsalvation (and I believe it is different from that of Jesus) has \npredominated in the stream of Christian faith until the present.  \nBUT, his writing about the Christian life, after conversion, tracks \nwell with the teaching and practice of Jesus.  I have high regard for \nPaul; I cannot imagine Christian history without him, but I wish he \ncould have been a bit more humble in his self-image, and  I have to \nwish he would have learned about the life and teachings of Jesus from \nthose who carried forward the traditions from which the four \nGospels were written a generation later, after his martyrdom death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEphesians 4:8-10.  I need first to comment on the statement  that \nWhen he (Christ) ascended on high he led a host of captives (v.??.  \nPaul cites Psalm 68:18 as his authority, but that passage is about \nGod winning an earthly battle for Israel and coming from the battle \nleading the defeated army as captive slaves, which was a common way \nfor ancient kings to demonstrate their victory in war.  Paul seems to \nbe expressing a belief, like that of 1 Peter 3:19, that between \ncrucifixion and resurrection Jesus went to sheol (the place of the \ndead) and preached to the spirits in prison (people who had died \nbefore Jesus lived and died).  These were the host of captives  he \nled when he arose and ascended.  This is an obscure tenet of faith \nthat is found only in these two places in the Bible.  It is not \nsupported by any other tenets of faith that I know about.  I cant \nfind help in word study.  The Greek text has two long words, \ndifferent forms a complex word made from two roots meaning to lead \n(or be led) by a spear.  I am not  good enough linguist to tell if \nthe grammatical forms of the words refer to the condition \n(captivity, being captive) or to the persons (captives).  Both the \nKJV and my Greek interlinear say the victorious Christ led captivity \n(the condition) captive meaning that Jesus had triumphed over the \nbondage of sin to liberate sinners by forgiveness.  Both RSV and \nNIV say that in the ascension, Christ led a host of captives \n(persons whom he was liberating).  All of the transactions affirm \nthat the ascending Christ did indeed bestow gifts  on humanity, \nwhich we will find and discuss in verses 11-16.   \u0014\n\u0014\nPaul then does some interpreting himself.  He writes that you cant  \ntalk about ascending  without considering descending first.  Ok, \nbut he doesnt talk about Jesus descending in incarnation, but \ndescending into the lower parts of the earth (deeper than the \ngrave,  into sheol, the place of the dead).  This would again seem to \nindicate that Paul did believe that the crucified Jesus went to sheol \nand preached, as 1 Peter 3:19 says.  That is a nuance of belief I do \nnot believe, because I am persuaded that for Jesus at crucifixion and \nall people at physical death, the soul/spirit/person do not go into \nsome place of the dead, but they go on living  in the realm of \nspirit in the presence of God.  I believe the human spirit/soul is \nimmortal, not subject to human death.\u0014\n\u0014\nSherrill Stevens 6/29/24\u0014",

Mr. Ermel had argued that his client was only guilty of \n\"killing on request,\" an illegal form of euthanasia that carries a \nmaximum jail term of five years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He's a model prisoner,\" Mr. Ermel told reporters at the courthouse. \n\"He will voluntarily undergo psychiatric therapy to get away from his \nfetish for men's flesh. I'm sure he won't do anything like this \nagain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is not likely to calm the nerves of people in Rotenburg an der \nFulda, the secluded village south of Kassel where Mr. Meiwes, 42, \nlived in a rambling half-timbered house. He played host there to four \nother men who responded to his Web posting, before finding the \n43-year-old Mr. Brandes in March 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat followed was an evening of sexual role-playing and violence, \nmuch of it videotaped by Mr. Meiwes. In the end, he stabbed Mr. \nBrandes to death with a kitchen knife, hung the corpse on a meat \nhook, and carved it up, storing pieces of flesh in plastic bags in \nhis freezer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"With every piece of flesh I ate, I remembered him,\" Mr. Meiwes said \nduring his trial. \"It was like taking communion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was hard to reconcile the placid, well-dressed defendant in the \ncourtroom with the grisly testimony. Yet it was the legal dilemma, as \nmuch as the lurid details of the case, that consumed the court. \nConvicting Mr. Meiwes of murder would have been difficult, according \nto legal experts, because the victim consented, even pleaded, to be \nkilled. But confining Mr. Meiwes to a psychiatric hospital would also \nhave presented problems because a court-appointed psychiatrist \ntestified that he was not suffering from \"diminished responsibility\" \nat the time of the killing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company\u0014",

The \nmost recent sociological surveys have found that more than half of \ntoday's newlyweds live together before tying the knot, compared to 10 \nper cent in 1965. \"Living in sin,\" as it used to be called, was \nillegal in every state of the union before 1970. Further research has \nfound that while unmarried cohabitors have sex more often than \nmarried couples (one more act per month), there's also more cheating \nby both partners, as well as more domestic violence and cases of \ndepression. Some of the sociologists doing this research are urging \nyoung adults to reject the argument that cohabitation is good \npreparation for marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Jay Tolson, \"No Wedding?

Researcher Thom \nRainer categorized unchurched people in five groups. Twice as many \nover-50s were classified \"most resistant,\" compared to the average of \nall unchurched persons. Rainer said younger people were much more \nlikely to have interest in spiritual things.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir church attendance, however, is another matter. Of those in \ntheir 20s, 31 percent say they attend weekly, compared to 53 percent \nof those over age 60. \u0014\n\u0014\n20-Somethings: AWOL. Pollster George Barna says younger people drop \nout of church because they struggle to find a place. They are \none-third less likely than older adults to attend, give financially, \nor read the Bible. Barna is most concerned about the 58 percent \ndecline in attendance among 18- to 29-year-olds who were faithful \nchurchgoers in their teens. He blames their quest for personal \nfulfillment and the tendency of churches to overlook young leaders. \nOnly 4 percent of the 20-somethings report serving in church \nleadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmaller Churches: The smaller church is the right setting for many \nadults under age 35. Boomers like larger churchesone-fourth attend \nchurches of 500 or more, compared to one-sixth of busters. Barna \ncredits the disinterest of busters in boomer-led organizations, and \ntheir desire for strong community. While some have predicted their \ndemise, Barna says small congregations will remain prevalent. About \n60 percent of U.S. churches have 100 or less in attendance each \nweekend. \u0014\n\u0014\nwith information from churchcentral.com, barna.org, and USA Today.\u0014",

Dave is like many \npastors who call Metanoia Ministries for counsel about how to handle \nconflict in their church. \u0014\n\u0014\nDave told me about Tom, a founding member and retired businessman in \nhis church. \"He acts like he is the boss and I am his employee,\" Dave \nexplained, \"constantly telling me what I did or said wrong.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, how do you respond?\" I asked. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'd like to tell him off,\" Dave admitted. \"But I'm trying to extend \ngrace. I pulled him aside after service last week and said I'd like \nto talk to him. I mentioned that his words to me were discouraging. \nTom immediately became defensive, telling me he is a \n'straight-shooter.' He said that I needed more 'backbone,' or I would \nnot last long as pastor. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This morning Tom sent me an e-mail warning me that he will be \ndropping by later today to discuss 'serious concerns about my \npreaching and leadership,'\" Dave told me. \"My stomach is tied up in \nknots. I know I need to confront Tom, but he has a history of being \nargumentative and manipulative.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What do I do?\" Dave asked me. \"How do you confront a critical and \ndefensive person?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe talked on the phone awhile longer. I explained how defensive \npeople are good at seeing the fault of others while failing to see \ntheir own. When confronted, defensive people will always find ways to \ndisagree. If they cannot win they will feign hurt, blaming you for \n\"judging\" their hearts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dave,\" I said, \"to confront a defensive person like Tom, you must \nfirst understand why he needs to be defensive.\" I told Dave to spend \nsome time in prayer asking God for wisdom and insight.\u0014\n \u0014\nWe talked about other encounters people had with Tom. I explained \nthat often people like Tom put on an outward bravado in order to mask \na deep insecurity. They may be afraid of close relationships. Being \ncritical and defensive lets them change the conversation away from \ntheir own inadequacies to the failure of others. Defensive people \ninstinctively set up conversations to protect themselves. \n\"Understanding why he is doing this will help you minister to Tom's \ninner soul while correcting his outward behavior,\" I said.\u0014\n\u0014\nI reminded Dave that to be redemptive, a leader must discern, \ndescribe, and lovingly invite the person into change. \u0014\n\u0014\nA simple rule is this: never confront power with power, confront \npower with loving truth.\u0014\n \u0014\nHere are seven steps for encountering a defensive person. \u0014\n\u0014\n1. Move toward, not away. Your first inclination will be to move \naway, to ignore, or to isolate him. This is wrong. Always move toward \na defensive person, not away. Defensive people want to be distant; \nthey want to think in extremes. Moving away provides emotional \ndistance for the person to hide; it confirms this suspicion that you \nwill not listen, that he is right and you are wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Engage relationally. Greet the critical person with a question \nlike \"What do you do for fun?\" Whatever he says, make a date to do \nthat with him. Show interest in him as a person. Ask about his \nmarriage and his family. Typically, defensive people have great \ndifficulty giving and receiving love, which is why they elevate \nopinion and loyalty over relationship and reconciliation. This will \nbe evident in their friendships, marriage, and family. Empathize with \nthe trail of broken relationships you are likely to find. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Bless and affirm. Jesus said, \"Bless those who curse you, pray for \nthose who mistreat you\" (Luke 6:28). Defensive people only know \nnegative affirmation. Bless and affirm his gifts. Recognize that he \nbelieves his cause is right and just.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Be direct. While affirming, state truth directly. Speak to Tom \npersonally. Do not respond by e-mail. And when the language becomes \nhurtful, I suggested that Dave say: \"What you have to say, Tom, is \nimportant. But the way you say it causes problems.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Find agreement. The greatest mistake leaders make is to engage a \ndefensive person on issues of disagreement. Arguing with a defensive \nperson always ends up in frustration and confusion. In fact, the \nproblem escalates as each side responds to the accusation of the \nother. Therefore, find facts, methods, or events where you agree. \nWhen wrong, apologize. Allow Tom's explanation to be one possible \nconclusion then focus on fruit, not facts. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Follow the fruit. Scripture tells us to test everything by \nspiritual fruit (Gal 5:22-23). Confront Tom about fruit, I \nrecommended, and again, be direct. \"I am experiencing you as angry \n(or defensive) right now, Tom. Are you angry?\" When Tom insists that \nhe is right, it might be good to ask, \"What would we expect to see if \nthat were true?\" or \"If God's Spirit were present, what would it look \nlike?\" Ask the defensive person to describe what the fruit of his \nwork looks like.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Invite submission. Ask the defensive person to walk with you in \nmutual submission. Tell him you want to follow Christ in being \nhumble, leadable and teachable. Ask if he wants this too. Suggest \nways you and he can have a reciprocal relationshipone that shows \nrespect and honor to each other. Ask \"Are you willing to grow?\" Set \nboundaries based upon your agreement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Tom may still be critical and defensive toward Dave. \nHabits are hard to break. \"Or,\" I told Dave, \"you might win over a \nvaluable friend.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Van Yperen is executive director of Metanoia Ministries, a \nnon-profit Christian organization serving the church in leadership \nformation and conflict reconciliation.

    "words": "I've not met anyone yet who likes new taxes. For that matter, I've \nnot met anyone who likes old taxes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNeither did the Jews in the first century. By the time Jesus comes \non the scene, it's been almost thirty years since Rome instituted the \npoll tax. But it still rankles. The Jews hate the intrusive Romans \nanyway, and every tax that reaches into their pockets, every tax \ncollector coming around with his bulging purse, every coin that bears \nCaesar's image, reminds them that their land  land given to them by \nGod, land that belongs to God  has been taken over by this hated and \nhateful enemy. Oh, how they loathe the Romans. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tWith good reason. The Romans were often heavy-handed in their \ndealings with the Jews and didn't mess around when it came to raw and \nswift punishment. The Romans were quick to construct crosses for \nthose who stepped out of line. It didn't take that much either, to \nattract the attention of the Romans; not as much as you might think. \nBut it worked, for the most part. The Jews lived under the thumb of \nRoman government, subdued by their captors, made meek by their \nsubjection to a higher power. They didn't like it, not one bit, but \nthey lived with it. What other choice did they have but to live with \nit?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhich makes this encounter with Jesus so interesting. It's recorded \nin both Matthew and Mark with little variation. So, the elements of \nthe story can be trusted. The Pharisees confront Jesus yet again. \nMatthew makes it clear that this little meeting has been set up by \nthe Pharisees. But this time they bring along with them some other \nfolk who cannot exactly be classified as friends. They are called \nHerodians. We don't know much about them, but the name itself tells \nus a great deal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhile the Pharisees were interested in matters religious, the \nHerodians were politically minded. They served the interests of the \nHerod dynasty, Roman puppets set up to rule Palestine. The Herods \nwere Jews, but in name only. For all practical purposes, they served \nthe Romans and used their Jewish brothers and sisters as pawns in \ntheir political games. Generally hated by their fellow Jews, the \nHerodians were pretty much on the same level as the tax collectors.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe Pharisees were on the other end of the spectrum. They weren't \npolitical, at least in terms of civic activity. Their interest was \nstrictly in the religious realm. To them, Rome represented evil. But \nas long as the Romans stayed away from their religious dealings, they \nsubmitted grudgingly to governmental authority. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tEvidently, Jesus poses a threat to both parties. So, these strange \nbedfellows get together and come up with an insidious plot, a puzzle \ndesigned to trip him up and make him look foolish in the eyes of all \nthose who might be tempted to follow him.\u0014\npplyBrkRulesAs Fred Craddock puts it, they come to Jesus with \nflattering lips and hostile intent.1 But Jesus, according to \nMatthew's story, perceives what is in their hearts. The translation I \nread earlier uses the word malice. It's not exactly a friendly word, \nbut neither does it seem to have the full force of what is intended \nhere. A better word is evil. Why are you putting me to the test? \nJesus asks them. Again, the word test is rather benign. A better \ntranslation is tempt. Evil and temptation. In other words, this isn't \njust a little word-play session between Jesus and his opponents, a \ngame of wits where they piddle around with a riddle or two and then \ngo their merry way. From Jesus' perspective, the Evil One is using \nthese people for his evil intent, which is the only kind of intent \nthe devil has. He wants to lure Jesus into the political arena, and \nJesus will have nothing to do with it. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tThey try to put Jesus into the classic Catch-22. You're familiar \nwith the phrase, aren't you? It comes from the 1961 novel by Joseph \nHeller. In the story, John Yossarian is an Air Force bombadier during \nWorld War II. He slowly watches each of his buddies die off in the \nhorrors of war, and decides the only way to escape this fate for \nhimself is to be declared insane. However, concern for his personal \nsafety in the face of danger, as far as the Air Force is concerned, \nis the product of a rational mind. So, he will have to fly. Except, \nhe would have to be crazy to fly, what has proven to be so far, \nnothing but a suicidal mission. But to ask not to fly proves his \nsanity. In other words, whatever he does, he is going to fly. And \nchances are, if he flies, he dies. He is, to use military lingo, in a \nCatch-22\".\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhen you're in a Catch-22, no matter what you do you're caught in \nthe web. You've got nowhere to go, and the spider is getting closer \nand closer. Catch-22.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThat's where Jesus is with the Pharisees and Herodians... in a \nCatch-22. If he says it is right and proper to pay taxes to Caesar, \nthe Pharisees (and many other Jews) are offended because of their \nhatred of the Romans and their imposed taxes. If he says not to pay \ntaxes to Caesar, the Herodians, whose livelihood is dependent on \ntheir Roman overseers, become angry and the Pharisees can charge \nJesus with being a fomenter of rebellion against the Romans. Which, \nof course, is why the Pharisees invited the Herodians to come along \non this little adventure. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tJesus can't win. They've caught him in their web. Catch-22.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince this is one of those passages that is often quoted in places \nother than church, Jesus' words are well known to us. But let's not \nrun past his first response. The first thing he does is let them know \nhe is aware of their motives. Why are you tempting me, you bunch of \nhypocrites? Then he says, Show me the coin used for the tax. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tTwo things... First of all, if Jesus has any money on him, he's not \nadmitting to it. We all know that Judas was the treasurer for the \ngroup, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jesus didn't carry a bit of \nloose change in his pocket from time to time. Second, he knows that \nthe Romans will not accept Jewish currency when it comes to paying \ntaxes. All taxes have to be paid in coinage that bears the likeness \nof Caesar. )That was the Romans' version of Catch-22, wasn't it?) The \nJewish law, recorded in Exodus, prohibits graven images of any kind. \nSince Caesar proclaimed himself to be a god, they're not supposed to \ncarry Caesar's coins. Yet, when Jesus says,  Show me the coin used \nfor the tax, they immediately bring him a denarius. Somebody in the \ngroup was carrying an idol around in his pocket!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tI am reminded of a movie starring Burt Reynolds and Jill Clayburgh. \nDon't ask me to tell you the title. That part of it is definitely \nforgettable. But there is one scene that sticks in my mind. They are \nshopping in the bedding section of a department store when Reynolds' \ncharacter has an anxiety attack. He is lying on a mattress, not able \nto breathe. Clayburgh is trying to help him, and in doing so turns to \nthe small, curious crowd that has gathered around the bed. Does \nanyone have a Valium? she asks. Immediately, everyone in the group \nhands her a pill.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wonder if that's the way it is with Jesus.  Show me the coin used \nfor the tax, he says, and immediately everybody reaches into his \npocket. And just as immediately, both groups  the Pharisees and \nHerodians  are compromised. George Mason says it's kind of like \nasking a Baptist if the lottery ticket in his pocket is a winner, or \na preacher asking a deacon for a light. The question itself carries \nits own answer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMatthew doesn't say that Jesus took the coin in his hands or that he \ntouched it. He simply begins asking questions. Who's image is on \nit? Caesar's. Who's title is inscribed on it? Caesar's. Then \nrender to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things \nthat are God's.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe all know that the impact of words is not found merely in the \nwords themselves but also in how they are spoken. Let me quote Jesus \nagain and see if this doesn't change, just a bit, how you interpret \nthem. Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's (long \npause), and to God the things that are God's. What does that say to \nyou? This is not a 50/50 split between Caesar and God, government and \nchurch, cut it right down the middle and give half to each. Jesus \nisn't necessarily saying that equal weight needs to be given to both. \nWhen push comes to shove, and more often than not it does, most of \nthe emphasis of life is to be given to the kingdom of heaven, not our \nkingdoms on earth. Earthly kingdoms, much as we don't want to think \nabout it, have come and gone. The kingdom of heaven  do I need to \nremind you?  is forever.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tNotice that Jesus doesn't give us a nice and tidy formula on how to \ngive both to Caesar and to God. But he does offer a couple of clues \nas to how we ought to approach our relationship to the earthly and \ndivine. Whatever manifests the work of the state  such things as \ntaxes and public education and the common good  belongs \nappropriately to the state. And for that reason, it is our duty and \nresponsibility to support what properly belongs to the workings of \nour nation, and work to ensure that the freedom on which our nation \nstands is made available to everybody and not just to the majority. \nThere is nothing in Jesus' response that would keep his followers, \nthen and now, from giving support to the work of government.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut whatever bears the image of God belongs solely to God. God \ndeserves our highest loyalty. When all is said and done, we are \ncitizens of an unseen kingdom and our ultimate allegiance belongs to \nGod. So let me ask you a question, and you tell me  no, you tell \nyourself and God  what is your instinctive, first-response answer. \nDo you consider yourself first a Christian or an American? Uh oh, \nI've done quit preaching and gone to meddling, haven't I? And on the \n4th of July! After giving it a little thought, you might come back at \nme by saying, Now wait a minute, preacher. It isn't either/or; it's \nboth/and. And you would be right. You would be very, very right.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pharisees, who come to Jesus in their little Catch-22, are wrong. \nThey hate and oppose their government at every turn. The Herodians, \nthe little toadies who accompany the Pharisees in this adventure, are \nwrong as well. They think government has all the answers, so they \nfully accommodate themselves to Caesar. Jesus puts both groups in \ntheir respective places and tells them this is not how God wants it. \nGod wants us to put our loyalties where our loyalties belong. But \nultimately we all know who makes the final claim on us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYet, Jesus doesn't give the obvious answer,. He provides just enough \nof an answer to require us to come up with some ideas of our own. He \nwants us to measure our hearts and  see where our true loyalty lies.3\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe are fortunate, most fortunate, to live in a country that gives us \nthe space and the freedom to give God our highest allegiance. That in \nitself is God's gift to us, a gift that Jesus himself never \nexperienced on this earth. It then behooves us to use that freedom of \nexpression to help those who are unable to help themselves. The only \nway for us to do that  we who follow Jesus  is to let him be our \nguide and teacher in all things... all things. It is the only way to \nescape the Catch-22. It is the only way to God. \u0014\n\u0014\nRandy L. Hyde, Pastor, Pulaski Heights Baptist Church, Little Rock, \nArkansas\u0014",

    "words": "For \nChristian teens, culture drives beliefs\u0014\n\u0014\nAn article in the July 9 issue of The Wall Street Journal notes that \neven for American teens who claim to be born-again, their actual \nbeliefs are being driven by the culture rather than by a biblical \nworldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs writer Dale Buss points out, \"Ninety-one percent of born-again \nteenagers surveyed a few years ago proclaimed that there is no such \nthing as absolute truth, says the Rev. Josh McDowell, a Dallas-based \nevangelist and author. More alarmingly, that number had risen quickly \nand steadily from just 52% of committed Christian kids in 1992 who \ndenied the existence of absolute truth. A slight majority of \nprofessing Christian kids, Mr. McDowell says, also now say that the \nbodily resurrection of Jesus Christ never occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"'There's a greater disconnect now than ever in the history of the \nchurch in America between what a Christian young person says they are \nand what they actually believe,' says Mr. McDowell, who has \nministered mainly to youth for more than 30 years. 'Christianity is \nbased on truth; Jesus said, 'I am the truth.' But you have an \noverwhelming majority even of Christian kids saying there is no \nabsolute truth.'\u0014\n\u0014\nBuss adds, \"Indeed, the consequences of this theological implosion \nnow pervade the thoughts and actions of believing teenagers, \nfollowing the moral breakdown of the broader American culture. Here's \none practical example: Only 10% of Christian teens believe that music \npiracy is morally wrong, according to a recent Barna survey, not all \nthat different from the 6% of their non-Christian peers who feel the \nsame way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then extrapolate the situation to other possible big-picture \nresults. Nearly 60% of evangelical Christian teenagers now say that \nall religious faiths teach equally valid truths, according to Mr. \nMcDowell. It's bad enough that they seem to have been co-opted by \nrelativism from within our culture and even from within the church \nand family. But it's even more disconcerting to realize that we're \nrelying on this generation for the future defense of Judeo-Christian \ncivilization against the highly motivated forces of militant Islam.\"\u0014",

    "words": "The basic storyline in many media outlets goes like this: The \nkeynote speakers at the Republican National Convention aren't nearly \nso conservative as the delegates or the party \"base\" of religious \nconservatives (or, for that matter, the candidate). Most religious \nconservative leaders are fine with that, saying that putting them up \non the podium would draw few swing voters.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Republican Party is already cast as being captive of the \nReligious Right, so why aggravate it?\" explains the National \nAssociation of Evangelicals' Rich Cizik in today's Washington Times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut some delegates and others are frustrated. \"I think they're making \na mistake,\" Pastoral Congressional Prayer Conference head Rod \nMcDougal told The Boston Globe. \"We didn't realize they were going to \neliminate and censor everything about God.  They need some people of \nfaith up there.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Since Republicans actually love God-talk, it stood to reason that \ntheir convention would be a veritable revival meeting,\" says \nBeliefnet editor Steven Waldman. \"Instead, it's been more like an \nACLU retreat, at least in terms of the use of religious rhetoric from \nthe top speakers. None of the marquee acts on the first two nights so \nmuch as threw in a Bible passage. Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack \nObama were downright Pentecostal compared to John McCain and Arnold \u0014\nSchwarzenegger.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, away from the marquee acts, there's been plenty of God talk. \nCheck out, for example, Sen. Elizabeth Dole's remarks, which didn't \nmake prime time:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n    Two-thousand years ago a man said, \"I have come to give life and \nto give it in full.\" In America I have the freedom to call that man \nLord, and I do. In the United States of America we are free to \nworship without discrimination, without intervention and even without \nactivist judges trying to strip the name of God from the Pledge of \nAllegiance; from the money in our pockets; and from the walls of our \ncourthouses. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, not \nfreedom from religion. The right to worship God isn't something \nRepublicans invented, but it is something Republicans will defend.\u0014\n\u0014\nSlate's Chris Suellentrop notes that Mississippi congressional \ncandidate Clinton LeSueur made a significant change from his brief \nprepared remarks. Instead of saying, \"The very foundation of this \ncountry is faith,\" which appeared in the version of the speech given \nto reporters, LeSueur said, \"The very foundation of this country is \nChristianity and faith in Jesus Christ.\" (John Kerry, by the way, \nalso changed a remark from the prepared text of his convention \nspeech. Instead of saying, \"I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve,\" \nhe said. \"I don't wear my own religion on my sleeve.\")\u0014",

    "title": "CHRISTOPHER REEVE, SYMBOL OF COURAGE DIES",
    "words": "October 11, 2004\u0014\nChristopher Reeve, 52, Symbol of Courage, Dies\u0014\nBy DOUGLAS MARTIN\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Reeve, the cinematic Superman who became a real-life \ninspiration through his painstaking efforts to overcome total \nparalysis, while speaking out for stem-cell research and other \npotential treatments, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital \nin Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 52 and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reeve was being treated for a pressure wound, a common \ncomplication for people in wheelchairs, said his publicity agent, \nWesley Combs. These wounds result from constant pressure in one spot, \nreducing the blood to that area and finally killing the affected \ntissue.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Combs said that Mr. Reeve fell into a coma on Saturday. The wound \nhad become severely infected, and the infection spread through his \nbody.\u0014\n\u0014\nA riding accident in 1995 had left the actor paralyzed from the neck \ndown. After briefly pondering suicide, Mr. Reeve had become a \npowerful proponent of causes ranging from insurance reform for \ncatastrophic injuries to unleashing the possibilities some scientists \nbelieve lie in using embryonic stem cells for research.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs recently as Friday, Mr. Reeve's name emerged, as it often has, in \nthe national debate over stem cell use. In the presidential debate in \nSt. Louis between President Bush and Senator John F. Kerry, the \nDemocratic challenger, Mr. Kerry mentioned Mr. Reeve by name in \narguing against the president's position that stem-cell research must \nbe restricted to protect the lives of human embryos.\u0014\n\u0014\nYesterday, the White House issued a statement on behalf of the \npresident and Mrs. Bush, citing Mr. Reeve as \"an example of personal \ncourage, optimism and self-determination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young unknown actor Mr. Reeve propelled himself to the status of \ninstant myth by starring in \"Superman: The Movie,\" a hugely popular \n1978 picture, then going on to do three successful sequels. Many \ncritics said he exhibited humor and sensitivity, particularly in his \nportrayal of Clark Kent as the bespectacled bumbler. His own ironic \ndetachment came out in a comment he made while filming the first \nmovie.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I prevent an earthquake,\" he said. \"I repair Golden Gate Bridge and \nBoulder Dam, and I prevent a nuclear explosion in Southern \nCalifornia.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe certainly seemed able to. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall, with a \nstrikingly handsome, square-jawed face and a strong athletic build. \nEven before \"Superman,\" he looked like Superman. Enhancing the image, \nhe performed his own stunts, and off-screen piloted his own plane.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was determined not to be typecast (\"escape the cape,\" he vowed) \nand found numerous other roles, including leading substantial parts \non Broadway. But it was Mr. Reeve's personal courage in dealing with \nhis paralysis that transcended both his causes and profession, making \nhim a real-life superhero in many minds. By using electrical shocks \nto stir his numb nervous system and tirelessly exercising, he \ntwitch-by-tiny-twitch was beginning to recapture use of his body. In \nSeptember 2000 he moved an index finger and the news startled \nscientists who had not expected to see such progress so long after so \nsevere an accident. Mr. Reeve expected nothing less and continued to \nimprove.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You have to take action and stand up for yourself - even if you're \nsitting in a wheelchair,\" he said in an interview with Psychology \nToday in 2003.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch was his progress that Mr. Reeve in February 2003 decided to have \nsurgery to free him from the respirator that had enabled his \nparalyzed lungs to breathe. Electrodes were implanted into his \ndiaphragm so that breathing could be regulated electronically.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut infections ultimately trumped technology, intensive exercise and \neven steely determination. The slim luck that had nurtured Mr. Reeve \nran out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat luck apparently resulted from the fact that some of his nerves \nhad not been destroyed, scientists suggested. Because they were not \ndead, they could be revived. Massive amounts of physical activity \ninduced new connections to form and a dormant pathway to revive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd with that recovery came a string of accomplishments since his \naccident that included writing two books and directing and acting in \nmovies. His extensive lobbying for public health issues helped earn \nhim an award for public service in 2003 from the Lasker Foundation , \nwhich gives awards for medical research.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a speech then, Mr. Reeve challenged the medical establishment to \nregain the sense of urgency shown by the emergency medical \ntechnicians who helped save his life.\u0014\n\"I believe I speak on behalf of patients who are willing to accept \nfailure as a necessary aspect of moving science forward,\" he said. \n\"We want researchers to think less like academics and more like \nE.M.T.'s whose primary function is to save lives.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reeve led by example, as numerous other awards testified. \"In the \nGloaming,\" a movie he directed for HBO in 1997, was nominated for \nfive Emmys. His performance in a remake of Hitchcock's classic \"Rear \nWindow\" won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor in a \ntelevision movie or miniseries.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis autobiographies, both favorably reviewed, were \"Still Me\" (1998) \nand \"Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life\" (2002), both \npublished by Random House.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Reeve was born in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 1952. His \nparents divorced when he was 4, and he moved with his younger brother \nand mother to Princeton, N.J. He began appearing in school plays \naround 8, and soon became involved in the McCarter Theater, \nPrinceton's professional theater.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was 9 when the McCarter cast him in a Gilbert and Sullivan \noperetta. This July, Mr. Reeve said in an interview on CNN that the \ntheater became \"like a family to me,\" as he sought to escape his own \nfamily's disruption. By the time he was 15, he was a member of Actors \nEquity and had worked as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theater \nFestival.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe graduated from Cornell University, then studied at Juilliard under \nJohn Houseman and roomed with Robin Williams. While at Juilliard he \nbegan his two-year run as Ben Harper in the soap opera \"Love of \nLife.\" He acted onstage at night and made his Broadway debut as \nKatharine Hepburn's grandson in Enid Bagnold's play \"A Matter of \nGravity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a generational switch, the following year he played the role of \nthe grandfather in Corrine Jacker's memory play \"My Life\" at the \nCircle Repertory company. Then came Superman, a comic book hero who \nburst on the American scene in 1938. Producers and the director could \nnot settle on a big-name actor who would take the part, so decided to \nfind an unknown. Mr. Reeve at first thought the idea was downright \nsilly and untheatrical, but read the script and loved it, according \nto \"Contemporary Heroes and Heroines, Book III,\" published by Gale \nResearch in 1998.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter being invited back for a screen test, the actor prepared for \ntwo solid weeks, experimenting with complete makeup and costume \nchanges for both Superman and Clark Kent. The young actor won the \npart, and found himself starring with Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman. \n\"Superman\" had what at the time was the most successful opening in \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy his fourth and last Superman, \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" \n(1987) , Mr. Reeve was helping write the original story for the film. \nHe was also speaking out on many issues from campaign finance reform \nto recycling garbage in New York City. He went to Santiago, Chile, to \ndemonstrate on behalf of 77 actors threatened with execution by the \nPinochet regime.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was known for his often expert pursuit of vigorous sports, \nincluding sailing, skiing, scuba diving and competitive horseback \nriding. Following the first \"Superman\" film, Mr. Reeve celebrated by \nsailing from Connecticut to Bermuda. He also flew his plane solo \nacross the Atlantic twice.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Saturday, May 27, 1995, he was engaging in a sport that \nincreasingly captivated him, riding horses in competition. He owned a \nnumber of horses, including a chestnut thoroughbred named Eastern \nExpress.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe place was Culpeper, Va., where a three-day equestrian competition \nwas taking place. Mr. Reeve was wearing blue and silver riding \ncolors, knee-high boots, off-white breeches and a protective vest and \nhelmet. He and Eastern Express, entry No. 103, were moving \nharmoniously as they approached a zigzagged, three-foot-high rail \njump, the third of 15 jumps.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, Eastern Express backed off from the jump. Mr. Reeve kept \nmoving, pitching forward over the horse's neck. His head hit the rail \nfence and he landed on the turf on his forehead. His head dangled, \njust barely connected to his spine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fall caused multiple fractures of the first and second cervical \nvertebrae and left him unable to move his limbs or breathe without \nthe use of a respirator.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reeve said that in the days after the accident he contemplated \nsuicide, but seeing the faces of his wife and family dissuaded him. \nHis wife, Dana Morosi, an actor and singer, yesterday released a \nstatement thanking \"the millions of fans\" who supported her husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Reeve is survived by his mother, Barbara \nL. Johnson; his father, Franklin Reeve; his brother, Benjamin; his \nsons Will and Matthew, and his daughter, Alexandra. Gae Exton, with \nwhom Mr. Reeve lived for much of the 1980's but never wed, is the \nmother of Matthew and Alexandra.Mr. Reeve's progress after the \naccident ranged from very elementary things, like learning to operate \nhis wheelchair by puffing into a tube, to very public triumphs like \nhis tear-provoking appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1996. \nHe often testified before Congress.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, which was founded by \ncombining two older organizations in 1998, raised more than $46.5 \nmillion for spinal cord research.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his final years, after the electrodes were implanted on his \ndiaphragm, he spoke of one day getting rid of his respirator \naltogether. His recovery was considered remarkable because most \nspinal-injury victims make progress only in the first two years after \nthe accident.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of Mr. Reeve's last projects was directing \"The Brooke Ellison \nStory,\" about a girl who became a quadriplegic at 11 but rose above \nher disability to graduate from Harvard. It will be broadcast on A&E \nin August.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast month Mr. Reeve said on the Oprah Winfrey show that he thought \nit \"very possible\" he would walk again. He was asked what would \nhappen if he did not.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then I won't walk again,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "words": "Campolo Says Church Will Suffer for Partisan Politics\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n11-29-04\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church in America is going to suffer for allowing secular \npolitical divisions to enter religion, author and activist Tony \nCampolo said on a Sunday talk show.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When the church gets aligned with a political party--left or \nright--it's like mixing ice cream and horse manure. It won't hurt the \nmanure, but it ruins the ice cream,\" Campolo said on ABC's \"This \nWeek\" with George Stephanopolous.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile polls indicated that \"moral values\" rated high in the last \nelection, Campolo said \"What Karl Rove did was make certain issues \nreligious while ignoring others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said whenever morality is reduced to abortion and \nhomosexuality, the Republicans are going to do well.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jesus never mentioned homosexuality,\" Campolo said. \"Paul does. \nJesus doesn't.\" Yet there are 2,000 Bible passages mentioning the \npoor, he added, while the United States ranks at the bottom of 22 \nindustrial nations in per capita spending for the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said he believes minorities fear that evangelicals are going \nto take away their rights.\"In a democracy, you do not have the rule \nof majority,\" he said. \"What makes a democracy is when it is safe to \nbe a minority.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso on the program, Gary Bauer of American Values said he thinks a \nbigger phenomenon in the election than mobilization of religious \nvoters is the \"increasing militant secularism of the cultural elites.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They want to put religion back in the closet,\" Bauer said, just as \nmost Americans are wanting to take it out.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said evangelical voters helped elect President Bush to a \nfirst term four years ago expecting him to overturn Roe vs. Wade, \nsomething \"he did not make the slightest effort\" to do.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That left me suspicious that the religious right was more concerned \nabout a Republican president than the unborn,\" Campolo said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBauer said the president cannot overturn Roe vs. Wade; it is up to \nthe Supreme Court. Asked why Bush has said he would not make abortion \na litmus test for prospective justices, Bauer said evangelicals \nbelieve the president's desire to appoint \"strict constructionist\" \njudges means they will rule against a constitutional right to \nabortion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As a Christian I know the difference between Jesus Christ and \nPresident Bush,\" Bauer said.\"I don't think either party has a \nmonopoly on virtue or vice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "CATHOLIC FESTIVAL OR RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY",
    "words": "Catholic festival or religious holiday? Christians have celebrated \nthe birth of Christ for hundreds of years, but over the centuries \nevangelicals and other conservative believers have wondered about the \nbest way to observe it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Yvonne Betowt\u0014\n\u0014\nDid you know Alabama was the first state to declare Christmas an \nofficial holiday?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat happened in 1836, 71 years before the last \nstateOklahomafollowed suit in 1907. Christmas is the only legal \nnational religious holiday in the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it has been less than 100 years since all 50 states recognized \nChristmas as an official holiday, Dec. 25 has been celebrated for \ncenturies by Christians as Jesus birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut until 245 A.D., when a group of scholars tried to determine the \ndate of Christmas, the question had never been addressed, according \nto a 1995 article by Victor M. Parachin in the Christian Reader. \nHowever, the project by the early church theologians was denounced by \na church council, which thought it wrong to celebrate Jesus birthday \nas though he were a King Pharaoh.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat didnt prevent the scholar-theologians from continuing their \nquest to determine the day Jesus was born. They originally listed \nfour datesJan. 1 and 6, March 25 and May 20as possibilities, \naccording to Parachins research.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe May date was first thought to be closest to the authentic date \nbecause of the Bibles reference in Luke 2:8 saying the shepherds \nwere keeping watch over their flock by night.\u0014\n\u0014\nShepherds only watched over their sheep at night during the spring \nlambing season. During the winter, the flocks would be inside \nenclosed corrals without a posted guard.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther scholars, such as Samuel Bacchiocchi, believes the date was \ncloser to the Feast of the Tabernacles celebration, which falls in \nlate September or early October. It is called the season of our \njoy, found in Deuteronomy 16:13-14, according to Bacchiocchi, a \nretired professor of theology from Andrews University, a Seventh-day \nAdventist school in Michigan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasnt until 349 A.D. that Dec. 25 was formally chosen as \nChristmas Day by Pope Julius. The date was already celebrated as the \nNatalis Solis Invicti in honor of the sun god, Mithras, by Roman \ncitizens. They decorated their homes with greenery, exchanged gifts \nand gathered for festive meals on that date, observed just after the \nwinter solstice.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany scholars believe Pope Julius picked Dec. 25 as Christmas Day to \nconvert followers of Mithras, in addition to providing Christians \nwith an opportunity to celebrate Jesus birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas continued, however, to be a contentious issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 17th century England and early America, English Puritans said the \nBible offered no clear basis for celebrating Jesus birth. In 1643, \nthe English Parliament outlawed not only Christmas, but Easter and \nother Christian celebrations.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut by 1660, Christmas had become such a popular holiday, the law was \nrepealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth, Mass., in 1620, their English \nmisgivings about Christmas celebrations continued. In 1659, people in \nMassachusetts who celebrated Christmas were fined. The law was struck \ndown in 1681 because the popularity of observing Christmas had grown \nimmensely.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Christian groups remained divided over whether Christmas \nshould be celebrated because of its ties to pagan observances. The \nLutherans, Dutch Reformed, Catholic and Anglican churches forged \nahead with the celebrations while the Baptists, Pres-byterians, \nQuakers and Puritans continued to speak against it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven today, some Christian groups, including many Churches of Christ \nand Seventh-day Adventists, do not acknowledge Christmas as a \nreligious observance. However, most do recognize it as a secular \nholiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is very unlikely that Dec. 25 is actually the birth date of \nChrist, said Huntsville (Ala.) Church of Christ minister Byron \nLaird. The birth of Christ is something we all believe in, but we do \nnot celebrate it as a religious holiday. However, many, or most \n[Church of Christ] families do celebrate it as a time of exchanging \ngifts and getting together.\u0014\n\u0014\nBacchiocchi wrote in a 2000 newsletter that, while growing up in \nRome, his Adventist family regarded Christmas as a Catholic \nfestival.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven when he came to America to attend Andrews in the early 1960s, \nBacchiocchi said he doesnt recall much Christmas decorations and \ncelebrations in the churches I visited. But he noted that tradition \ngradually changed over the past four decades as more and more \nAdventist churches added candles and decorations during the Advent \nseason.\u0014\n\u0014\nBacchiocchi believes a more simple celebration of Jesus birth would \nbe more in keeping with the setting of his birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion News Service\u0014\n\u0014\nYvonne Betowt writes for Religion News Service.\u0014",

    "words": "1. The famous tale about Washington chopping down the cherry tree \n(\"Father, I cannot tell a lie\") is a complete fabrication.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. George Washington never threw a silver dollar across the Potomac \nRiver--in fact, to do so from the shore of his Mount Vernon home \nwould have been physically impossible. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. George Washington did not wear wooden teeth. His poorly fitting \nfalse teeth were in fact made of cow's teeth, human teeth, and \nelephant ivory set in a lead base.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Early in his life, Washington was himself a slave owner. His \nopinions changed after he commanded a multiracial army in the \nRevolutionary War. He eventually came to recognize slavery as \"a \nmassive American anomaly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n5. In 1759, having resigned as Virginia's military commander to \nbecome a planter, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis. \nWashingtons marriage to the colony's wealthiest widow dramatically \nchanged his life, catapulting him into Virginia aristocracy.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Scholars have discredited suggestions that Washington's marriage \nto Martha lacked passion, as well as the provocative implications of \nthe well-worn phrase \"George Washington slept here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Washington held his first public office when he was 17 years old, \nas surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. At age 20, despite no prior military experience, Washington was \nappointed an adjutant in the Virginia militia, in which he oversaw \nseveral militia companies, and was assigned the rank of major.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. As a Virginia aristocrat, Washington ordered all his coats, \nshirts, pants, and shoes from London. However, most likely due to the \nmisleading instructions he gave his tailor, the suits almost never \nfit. Perhaps this is why he appears in an old military uniform in his \n1772 portrait.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. In 1751, during a trip to Barbados with his half-brother \nLawrence, Washington was stricken with smallpox and permanently \nscarred. Fortunately, this early exposure made him immune to the \ndisease that would wipe out colonial troops during the Revolutionary \nWar.\u0014",

Arius had preached that \nChrist was a creation of God, the first of all his creatures, to be \nsure, but a creation nonetheless. He was not of the substance or \nnature of God. \"There was a time when the Son was not,\" he and his \nfollowers insisted. They even made up songs with catchy tunes to \npropagandize their ideas among the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Alexander of Alexandria was horrified. Jesus, the Word, had \nco-existed eternally with God the Father he argued. If Christ were \nnot God, then man could not be saved, for only the infinite and holy \nGod could forgive sin. He deposed Arius. Arius did not go quietly. He \ngathered followers and continued to teach his pernicious doctrine. \nThe factions rioted. The unity of the empire was shaken. Constantine \nwas alarmed. He called the council.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the council progressed, the bishop of Nicomedia defended Arius' \nviews, attempting to prove logically that Jesus, the Son of God, was \na created being. Opposition bishops snatched his speech from his hand \nand flung it in shreds to the floor. They had suffered for Christ, \nsome of them greatly, in the persecutions of Diocletian. They weren't \nabout to stand by and hear their Lord blasphemed. Otherwise, to what \npurpose had they borne their gouged eyes, scourged backs, hamstrung \nlegs and scorched hands?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe issues of Nicea boil down to this. If Christ is not God, how can \nhe overcome the infinite gap between God and man? If a created being \ncould do it, there were angels aplenty with the power. Indeed, why \ncould not any good man himself bridge the gap? On the other hand, \nJesus had to be truly man, otherwise how could he represent mankind?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt some point the council decided their best course was to write a \ncreed that testified to what they believed. The creed of Nicea became \na document of fundamental importance to the church. That so many of \nthe bishops who approved it had suffered greatly for Christ only \nadded to its significance. The council itself was a forerunner to \nmany more. Those councils which came after also grappled with issues \nof Christ's humanity and deity. Was he one person or two? Was he God \nwhile in his mother's womb? Did he have just one will? Which books \nbelong in the Bible? The seventh ecumenical church council was also \nheld at Nicea.\u0014",

    "words": "Campolo Predicts Backlash \nto Religious Right\u0014\n\u0014\nEthicsDaily.com Staff\u0014\n04-12-05\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Southern Baptist Conventions triumphalist attitude after the \nvictory of President George W. Bush is confusing the public about \nwhat it means to be a Baptist, evangelist Tony Campolo told a British \nnewspaper.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo, a featured speaker at this summers Baptist World Alliance \nCentenary Congress in Birmingham, England, told The Baptist Times \nthat he fears Republican Party sympathies by Southern Baptists in the \nUnited States.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals and the religious right are seen as synonymous and that \nis to the detriment of our ministry, Campolo said. They have \nlimited themselves to two social issues: abortion and gay marriage. \nThese are important issues, but we must remember that there are 2,000 \nverses of Scripture that deal with poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\n Campolo criticized the way right-wing evangelicalism aligned itself \nwith the anti-gay marriage and pro-war stance of the Republican Party \nin the last election, while failing to lobby for more tax cuts and \nwelfare benefits for the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\n After the election, we have come across as anti-gay, anti-women, \npro-war, pro-guns and indifferent to the poor, Campolo said. Is \nthat what evangelical Christianity is all about?\u0014\n\u0014\n When people ask if Christians are left or right, Campolo said, We \nshould say on what issue? On abortion we are right; on aid to the \npoor left.\u0014\n\u0014\nReferring to Bushs advocacy of capital punishment, Campolo said \nrather than supporting his right-wing viewpoint, Christians should be \nstrongly against the use of death as a form of punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\n Doesnt the Bible say a great deal about the poor people, jubilee, \nthe environment, justice and our judicial system? he asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo stressed that the blurring of political and religious spheres \nis at present a purely American phenomenon.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I talk about evangelical Christians and this issue, I am \ntalking about the U.S., he said. When I go elsewhere I find there \nis a great nervousness among leaders toward the U.S. and the Southern \nBaptist alliance with political figures. That is a marriage that \nneeds to be made into a divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said British evangelicals, for example, are more interested \nin fostering social justice. You have a more holistic theology, he \nsaid. I feel much more at home in the U.K. than I do in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said he was greatly sadden[ed] by Baptist relations in the \nU.S., particularly last summers split in the Baptist World Alliance. \nThe Southern Baptist denomination withdrew membership from the \norganization, and Campolo said he is unconvinced by the SBC leaders \ndenial that the denomination intends to set up a rival organization \nto the BWA.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo predicted the conventions eagerness to exert an \ninternational presence will affect the spread of Christianity over \nthe next 20 years, tarnishing its image because of its association \nwith right-wing politics. But it is only a matter of time, he said, \nbefore thoughtful converts realize that the Bible addresses a \nbroader range of issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next 20 years are going to be glorious years for those on the \nreligious right, Campolo said. But a reaction will set in over the \nnext quarter of a century that may hurt Christianity in all its \nforms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt will create disillusionment, and there will be a departure from \nchurches, he predicted. In the short term, they win; in the long \nterm, they lose.\u0014\n\u0014\nCampolo said he realizes his words may alienate portions of the \nworldwide Baptist family, but he sees it as his duty as a Christian \nand as a sociologist to speak out.\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to engage the non-Christian world, he said. Without raising \nthese serious questions, I lose my legitimacy for speaking to those I \nneed to speak to most.\u0014",

Liberal?: Commentary on Catholicism Draws Reader \nResponse\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor, Times-Dispatch: Your recent editorial, \"Labels and Popes,\" \nasserts that commentators need to be reminded that labels drawn from \nthe political realm do not apply to religion generally or to the Pope \nin particular. You note that the typical report identifies Benedict \nXVI as \"conservative\" and ask what that means, contending that the \nman in the street does not equate \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" with \ntheological substance, that the terms distort rather than clarify, \nand that regarding religion and the papacy they are beside the point. \nWould that it were so!\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Benedict XVI is as conservative as the fundamentalist element of \nthe Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) in his opposition to the \nordination of women, his condemnation of homosexuality, his statement \nthat other religions are \"deficient,\" etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new Pope well may win across-the-spectrum applause as you \nsuggest, and discomfit the political left and right alike from time \nto time, but his well-known reputation as defender of the faith, as \nhe interprets it, clearly allows one to apply a \"conservative\" label \nto him. For that, of course, probably as many Catholics are pleased \nas are discomfited.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the record, I happen to be a Southern Baptist who does not \nsubscribe to the views of SBC leadership as to the role of women in \nthe church. \u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel A. Polk. richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n. . .\u0014\n\u0014\nEditor, Times-Dispatch: In his column celebrating the election of the \nnew Pope, Benedict XVI, who has deplored relativism and other \n\"numerous ideological currents,\" Ross Mackenzie says \"this modernism\" \nhas caused many parishioners of mainline churches to flock to \n\"evangelical, Pentecostal churches.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tremendous growth in evangelism is a manifestation of a new \nreligious awakening in America. In fact, there have been other \ndistinct waves of evangelicalism in our nation's history, all of \nwhich contained some of these features: a belief that personal \nsalvation is attained by faith and prayer and not solely by good \nworks or reason; a belief that individual behavior should be based on \nthe teachings of the Bible rather than the church authorities; and a \nbelief that relations with God should be personal and come from the \nheart. Evangelicals also energized the abolitionist movement against \nslavery in the 19th Century, as well as the temperance crusade \nagainst alcoholism.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne noticeable and welcome difference between the present burst of \nevangelical Christianity and prior movements is that many \ncontemporary believers are embracing what is called \"creation care,\" \na euphemism for stewardship of the environment. When fundamentalist \nChristians became aligned with the Republican Party in the early \n1980s, many viewed environmentalism with disdain because it was \nlinked to anti-capitalist, left-wing secular groups. It is surprising \nthat it has taken so long for evangelicals to accept the idea that \nthe Earth should be preserved, a fact that persons of all faiths \nshould adopt, since we are all products of the creation.\u0014\n\u0014\n Lee Rice.

    "words": "Cheerleading At \nChristmas\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you \nhold me in your heart....\" (v. 7)\u0014\n\u0014\n\tCheerleading is big -- especially in Texas and Oklahoma. You \nremember the cheerleader mom who shot the mom of her daughter's rival \nin a cheerleading competition? Cheerleading is huge in some regions \nof the country.\u0014\n\tSomeone was bound to notice. Jeff Webb was a yell leader at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma in the early '70s. After graduating, he opted \nout of his plans to attend law school, and instead joined a company \nthat ran cheerleading summer camps. After three years he left to form \nhis own company, and in his first year, 1975, posted an $850 profit.\u0014\n\tFast forward 25 years. Now he's the president and CEO of Varsity \nSpirit Corporation, a company that now pulls in $150 million \nannually. His company and others like it run cheerleading camps and \ncompetitions. But the big money comes from the sale of cheerleading \napparel and accessories.\u0014\n\tWhat does a cheerleader need to make it big? You've got your body \nsuit under the uniform, the shirt and the skirt, hair accessories, \nbriefs, pom-poms, megaphone, socks, and shoes. Add to that the cost \nof summer camp, camp wear, and personalized warm-ups and it can \neasily cost, according to one cheerleader mom, over $1,000 to keep \nher daughter in pom-poms.\u0014\n\tNo industry of this size can make it without magazines to drive the \ncheer culture. At least eight magazines now market to cheerleaders, \nincluding American Cheerleader, Dance Spirit, and others.\u0014\n\tIt's not all fun and games. The practices can be brutal. Injuries \nare common. Cheerleaders train in gymnastics, mastering the vault and \nhandsprings. They run laps to stay in shape. They work out. They \npractice twenty hours a week learning stunts and routines, practicing \ntheir tumbling and pyramids. And when they have time, they go to \nclass!\u0014\n\tSome are specialists within the genre. Fliers are the cheerleaders \nwho get tossed into the air. Catchers are those who grab them on the \nway down.\u0014\n\tSo what if schools didn't have cheerleaders? Would the fans in the \nstands sit on their hands and keep their mouths shut when their team \nis on the two-yard line threatening to score? Probably not. But it's \ncool to have people designated to lead the cheers.\u0014\n\tAnd that's what Paul is doing here, writing to a church that \narguably was the closest to his heart of any of the churches he \nfounded or visited. \"You're the greatest,\" he says, \"and I'll tell \nyou why.\"\u0014\n\tHe cheered them on in their faith. He cheered them in spite of his \nown problems (he was writing from prison). He cheered in spite of \ntheir imperfections. He was the yell leader of the faith. He knew how \nto pump up the Philippian crowd and get them going.\u0014\n\tYears earlier the angel had said to the shepherds in the field, \"I \nbring you good news of great joy that will be for all people\" (Luke \n2:10).\u0014\n\tGreat joy! Christmas is a time for good cheer! Why shouldn't we be \npumped up? God is with us! And why shouldn't we, too, seize the \nmoment to bring good cheer to those around us?\u0014",

He uses the most common of people, people that \naren't any different from any of us here; he comes in the most common \nof ways, when by his Spirit an anonymous young woman is found to be \nwith child. And the strangest thing is that he comes at allhe's not \nthe Above-Us-God, too holy to come down. This God's love is so \nimmense that he wants to come down.

    "title": "CHRISTMAS CAROLS FORBIDDEN",
    "words": "Christmas carols\u0014\n\u0014\nThe singing of Christmas carols -- as we now know them -- was \nabolished in England by the Puritan Parliament in 1649 under pressure \nfrom Oliver Cromwell, England's \"Lord Protector\" who preached against \n\"worldly festivals\" that included Christmas carols, decorated trees, \nand other expressions that \"desecrated that sacred event.\" As a \nresult, Christmas hymns and carols were scarce between the late 17th \nand the early 18th Century in England. Charles Wesley's \"Hark! the \nHerald Angels Sing\" (written in 1739) was one of the few written \nduring that period that became popular wherever Christians gathered \nduring Advent. After Cromwell died in 1658 and the monarchy was \nrestored in England in 1660, the former decision to prohibit the \nsinging of Christmas carols was abandoned, and hymns written to honor \nthe birth of Jesus began to appear and have continued to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his latest Tuesday Mornings newsletter, Tom Barnard shares a bit \nof the history of Wesley's great Christmas carol. Barnard explains \nthat Wesley, an Anglican who became part of the 18th Century \nMethodist Revival in England, wrote the words to the hymn but his \noriginal words were subsequently altered. The first line of the hymn \noriginally read, \"Hark! how all the welkin rings, Glory to the King \nof Kings.\" Welkin is an old English word that means \"vault of \nheaven.\" In 1753 George Whitefield changed the first line to read, \n\"Hark! the herald angels sing -- Glory to the newborn King!\" And that \nis how we sing it today.\u0014\n\u0014\nMendelssohn, a Messianic Jew, composed the music. It is from the \nsecond chorus of a cantata he wrote in 1840 to commemorate Johan \nGutenberg and the invention of the printing press. Mendelssohn \nstrictly admonished that this composition was to be used in a purely \nsecular manner. William Cummings, however, totally ignored \nMendelssohn's wishes in 1856 and joined the lyrics by Wesley with the \nmusic by Mendelssohn for the first time, giving the world this \nwonderful Christmas Carol.\u0014",

Religious people, especially those who worship \nregularly, are more likely to visit friends, invite others into their \nhome, attend meetings of civic organizations and, in general, belong \nto groups and associations. He reports that civic involvement as \nsimple as talking to neighbors or as involved as voting, serving on a \njury, and taking on community projects are more likely to be done by \nmembers of religious groups than by those people not associated with \na particular religion.\u0014",

    "title": "CRUCIFIXION",
    "words": "Biblical scholar Bill Wylie Kellermann describes crucifixion based on \nan archaeological discovery outside of Jerusalem. The skeletal \nremains of a young man named \"John\" (the name on the ossuary in which \nhe was buried) settles the longstanding debate over the use of nails \nin crucifixion:\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the wrist of the forearm bone is a scratch in all likelihood \nworn by the arm nails; piercing the heel bones is the four and \none-half spike with a piece of the titular plaque, which announced \nhis crime. At the point of the nail some fragments of the olivewood \ncross itself survive. The legbones were severed and splintered, \nprobably by a single blow that functioned at once to confirm his \ndeath and remove him from the cross. Though subject to several \ninterpretations, the most likely reconstruction suggests that the \nfeet were first nailed to the cross side by side with the single \nnail, then the arms. The skilled executioners may well have added a \nsedicula, a small crossbar under the buttocks to support the victim's \nweight and prolong the agony.\u0014\n\u0014\nCrucifixion was a slow and excruciating death, often taking several \ndays; people died of sheer exhaustion. Beatings and scourgings, as \nrecounted in the gospels, were designed to hasten the end. Add to all \nthis the thoroughly public character of nakedness and death. Bodily \nfunctions were exposed and loss of control manifest. The \npowerlessness of the victim was utter and complete. For Jews, the \npublic shame was further compounded by the curse on anyone hanged \nupon a tree (Deuteronomy 21: 23; Galatians 3:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nCan anyone doubt that Jesus felt abandoned by God? We should not pass \nlightly over the sense of ultimate despair which hovers nearby \nhemming him in and tempting his heart yet again. And yet, according \nto Luke, it is out of this dark suffering and from it that he says, \n'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.' The cross is \nthe love of enemies.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Seasons of Faith and Conscience:\u0014\nKairos, Confession, Liturgy\u0014\n(New York: Orbis Books, 1991), 179.\u0014",

    "words": "HealthSouth CEO Turned Evangelist Convicted of Bribery\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen\u0014\n07-07-06\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than a year after he was acquitted on charges of accounting \nfraud, former HealthSouth CEO turned religious broadcaster Richard \nScrushy was convicted last week of a bribery scheme along with a \nformer governor of Alabama.\u0014\n\u0014\nA federal jury in Montgomery, Ala., convicted Scrushy and former Gov. \nDon Siegelman of conspiracy, bribery and fraud last Thursday. Scrushy \nwas accused of paying $500,000 in laundered funds to Siegelman's \ncampaign, in exchange for obtaining a seat on a state hospital \nregulatory board, while Scrushy was serving as chief executive of \nHealthSouth, the largest rehabilitation hospital in the United States.\u0014\n \u0014\nSince a federal jury found Scrushy not guilty last June in an \nunrelated five-month trial on charges of a $2.64 billion fraud, he \nand third wife, Leslie, have started a daily, half-hour Christian \ntalk show on an independent television station and a ministry Web \nsite. Scrushy also helped found Kingdom Builders International \nMinistries, a non-denominational missions organization.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore recently he and his wife--the daughter of a Methodist \nminister--were ordained as co-pastors of Grace and Purpose Church, \nwhich broadcasts its worship service on a cable channel owned by \nScrushy's son-in-law.\u0014\n\u0014\nScrushy has long been portrayed as an active churchman and generous \ndonor to religious work. He reportedly gave $600,000 toward \nconstruction of an $11.5 million building for MountainTop Community \nChurch in an affluent suburb of Birmingham, Ala.\u0014\n\u0014\nScrushy attended the church for about six years. It is a \nnon-denominational congregation started in 1992 by Bill Elder, a \nlongtime Baptist pastor who resigned after three years as pastor of \nBirmingham's Vestavia Hills Baptist Church over disagreement about \nworship styles to start a new church based on the \"seeker-friendly\" \nWillow Creek Community Church model.\u0014\n \u0014\nElder said in a 2003 newspaper interview that Scrushy \"heard and \nresponded to strong messages about biblical ethics\" while at the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We talk a lot about ethics in the workplace and stewardship,\" Elder \nsaid. \"Richard has heard messages on the rich young ruler, the Good \nSamaritan, the prodigal son. He always responds positively.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his first trial, Scrushy, who is white, was accused of \nattempting to curry favor with a majority-black jury by attending a \npredominantly African-American church and cultivating influential \nblack church leaders to attend his trial. The group, dubbed his \"Amen \nCorner,\" prayed with Scrushy before the start of court every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, the Birmingham News reported that a charity funded by \nScrushy gave more than $700,000 to 19 organizations and churches, at \nleast eight including leaders seen frequently at his trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne former supporter, Pastor Herman Henderson of Believers Temple \nChurch, alleged that he was hired by Scrushy to organize black \npastors to attend the trial in Birmingham and provide public \nrelations services, including writing favorable articles placed in \nThe Birmingham Times, a local newspaper serving the black community.\u0014\n\u0014\nScrushy, his wife and pastors from five churches denied those \nallegations in a group interview. Scrushy said the relationship was \nbased purely on a common Christian calling and that Henderson was \ntrying to extort money from him--an accusation that Henderson denied.\u0014\n\u0014\nScrushy isn't the only figure in recent high-profile corporate \nscandals with ties to preachers.\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Enron CEO Ken Lay, the son of a Baptist minister, convicted in \nMay of conspiracy and fraud related to the energy company's collapse \nin 2001, reportedly enlisted former Southern Baptist Convention \nPresident Ed Young as his spiritual adviser and a character witness \nin his trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nLay died Wednesday after a massive heart attack, six weeks after \nbeing found guilty and before he was sentenced to prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Lay was a Methodist, he often attended Young's Second Baptist \nChurch of Houston with his oldest son. Young reportedly described Lay \nas a trustworthy man. \"I believe he loves God, I believe he works \nhard, and I believe he's a man who keeps his word,\" Young said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernie Ebbers, convicted of an $11 billion fraud in 2005, was a \nmember of Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Miss., while \nserving as CEO of Worldcom, a communications giant that went bankrupt \nin 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Futral, executive director-treasurer of the Mississippi Baptist \nConvention, asked for leniency in the sentencing phase of Ebbers' \ntrial, but Ebbers received a 25-year sentence in federal prison for \nwhat the Jackson Clarion-Ledger called \"the worst business fraud in \nhistory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview on his Web site, Scrushy scoffed at cynics who say \nhis religious work is an attempt to sway people into thinking he is a \ngood person.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's just absolutely not true,\" he said. \"The truth is my wife and \nI are both ordained pastors--ministers, evangelists.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n\"Our television show is a ministry,\" he said. \"What we're trying to \ndo is help people. We're trying to help build the Kingdom of God. \nWe've always been Christians.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nScrushy also pledged to keep ministry supporters up to date through a \nblog.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"As most of you know, I am in the fight of my life,\" he wrote. \"I \nhave decided to share my most intimate thoughts with you through this \ndiary. I will occasionally be taking the time to share what God has \nlaid upon my heart for my situation. This journey will be the \ntestimony to my faith, and belief I will be delivered through.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. District Judge Mark Fuller allowed both Scrushy and Siegelman to \nremain free on bond. Both men said they plan to appeal the verdict. \nScrushy, 53, faces up to 30 years in prison.\u0014\n \u0014\nHe also still faces a civil trial next April, in which the Securities \nand Exchange Commission seeks $786 million from him in penalties and \nrestitution. Scrushy was acquitted late last June on three dozen \ncounts he faced in an accounting scandal that allegedly overstated \nearnings HealthSouth's earnings by at least $1.4 billion.\u0014\n \u0014\nA prosecutor said Scrushy's conviction \"sends the message that \nAmericans will not tolerate the bribery of our public officials.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bribery of this sortbetween a sitting governor and a corporate \nchief executive officerhas a devastating impact on public confidence \nin our government,\" said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher. \n\"The Justice Department will continue to aggressively investigate and \nprosecute corrupt public officials and those who conspire to corrupt \nthem.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Allen is managing editor of EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday ordered his \ncase back to Smith County for the trial court to consider whether he \nis retarded.

He said he was high on crack \ncocaine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm guilty of the crime but I wasn't in the right frame of mind,\" \nBridgers said. \"I took a life but I shouldn't go pay for it with my \nlife. It's like them playing God. I just want people to understand \nI'm not a bad person. I'm no serial killer. I just made a mistake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNash declined comment on Bridgers' statements. The lawyer said he \nbelieves the evidence of old intelligence tests and expert testimony \nwill show that Bridgers is retarded.\u0014",

    "words": "The countrys Sunni-Shiite bloodletting is driving many Iraqis to \nbury the very essence of their identity: their names.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo have to hide ones name is considered deeply shameful. But with \nsectarian violence surging, Iraqis fear that the name on an \nidentification card, passport or other document could become an \ninstant death sentence if seen by the wrong people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is because some first names and tribal names indicate whether a \nperson is Sunni or Shiite. A first name of Omar is popular among \nSunnis, for example, as is Ali among Shiites.\u0014\n\u0014\nStories abound of Iraqi civilians being stopped at checkpoints by \nmilitiamen, insurgents or uniformed men and having their \nidentification cards scrutinized.

In Baghdad, Shiite death squads  \nsometimes in police uniform  operate many of the illegal \ncheckpoints, Iraqi and American officials say.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most infamous episode of this kind took place in July, when \nShiite gunmen set up fake checkpoints and went on a daytime rampage \nthrough the Jihad neighborhood of Baghdad, dragging people from their \ncars and homes and shooting them after looking at their \nidentification cards. Up to 50 people were killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first seven months of this year, 1,000 Iraqis officially \nchanged their names, far more than in any similar period since the \nAmerican invasion of 2003, said Maj.

    "title": "CONTROVERSY CAN BE HELPFUL",
    "words": "Controversies of the past offer some valuable lessons to help \nBaptists deal constructively with crises today. This article will \nidentify and briefly discuss six such lessons.\u0014\n \u0014\nFirst, Baptists who fight too much risk losing their integrity. Some \npeople seem born to quarrel. Their DNA spells clash. They wrangle \nover small things and big things. Bickering makes their day. \nDifficult to get along with, they inject a constant flow of \nnegativity into church business meetings. They squabble and beat down \nthe ideas of other people (and sometimes the people themselves) to \nthe point that they lose their credibility as Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, Baptists who refuse to fight sometimes compromise their \nsouls. Some Baptists straddle every fence in sight. For them, no \ncause is worth defending or dying for. Unity is always the ultimate \ngoal--even if based on values without substance. Or are they \nconcerned with job preservation? They defend the status quo and never \naccept the prophetic requirements of ministry. Their souls dissipate \nthrough inaction and moral failure. Some battles must be fought; \nrefusal to participate is spiritual cowardice.   \u0014\n\u0014\nThird, some battles are not worth fighting, and some wars can never \nbe won. Sometimes, Baptists fight over issues that do not merit a \nbattle; the issues are simply inconsequential. At other times, \nBaptists fight long-term wars that are impossible to win. In both \ncases, Baptists waste enormous amounts of emotional and spiritual \nenergy, financial resources, and valuable time misusing the \nstewardship of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFourth, controversy can never be totally eliminated from Baptist \nlife, because there is no Baptist authority that can issue the final \nverdict that all must accept. To some, that may sound like a \ndeathblow to the Baptist future. To the contrary, it spells marvelous \nopportunities for Baptists to accept and re-emphasize the value of \nautonomy under the Lordship of Christ. Every Baptist has an equal \nvote in every business meeting. That has a powerful equalizing effect \non the nature of Baptist decision-making.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifth, Baptists can make major strides forward by championing \nbiblical causes regardless of the cost. Baptists have made their \nhighest, noblest, longest-lasting and most daring accomplishments \nwhen they have stood tall for the principles and practices reflected \nin Scripture. Consider the Lordship of Christ, the authority of the \nBible, believers baptism, voluntarism, the priesthood of all \nbelievers, religious liberty, separation of church and state, \ncongregational church government, missions, human rights, and women \nin ministry. Baptists have suffered ridicule, threats, imprisonments, \nbeatings, and death defending such causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles DeWeese\u0014",

    "words": "Christmas Countdown\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen does the holiday season really start?\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nIf retail promotions are any indication, Christmas begins as soon as \nthe last bags of Halloween candy have been moved to the bargain bins. \nOur Christian ancestors, however, had other ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first church official to propose special activities for the \npre-Christmas period was Perpetuus, bishop of Tours, in 490. To help \nhis flock prepare for the holiday, he advocated fasting every Monday, \nWednesday, and Friday from Martinmas (November 11) to Christmas Eve. \nThis practice, which mirrored Lent, spread slowly throughout France, \nSpain, and Germany. Then it crashed into Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman attention to the Advent season trailed Perpetuus by about 100 \nyears, and it took a radically different tone. While much of Western \nEurope, and at least portions of the Christian East, fasted, Roman \nChristians celebrated. Perhaps it seemed odd to them to approach \nChrist's birth as somberly as they did his death. By the eleventh \ncentury, though, Rome had come around, and Advent meant no feasts, no \nrecreational travel, no marital relations, and no weddings. (These \nprohibitions were dropped in recent centuries.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSometime in all of this, the start date for Western Advent slid back \ntwo weeks, to the Sunday closest to St. Andrew's Day (November 30). \nAs a result, Advent can last anywhere from 22 to 28 days, though for \nthe sake of year-to-year consistency, Advent calendars start with \nDecember 1. Yet not everyone kicks off the Christmas season at the \nsame time or in the same way.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Orthodox church, Advent still includes fasting, and in most \nplaces it lasts from November 15 to December 24. The Armenian \nOrthodox church is an exception; its members fast for three of the \nseven weeks between November 15 (St. Philip's Day) and January 6 \n(Epiphany).\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Barbara's Day, December 4, signals the beginning of the Christmas \nseason in Syria, Lebanon, and parts of France and Germany. Some \nMiddle Eastern customs for the day resemble American \nHalloween-children dress up in frightening costumes and go \ndoor-to-door collecting candy and other small gifts. This activity \nhas no relationship to the story of St. Barbara, which states that \nher father locked her in a tower, killed her for her Christian faith, \nand was then struck by lightning. Not that it matters; historians now \ndoubt that St. Barbara even existed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Nicholas's Day, December 6, inaugurates the Christmas festivities \nin Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, and parts of \nGermany. On the night of December 5, St. Nicholas-accompanied, oddly \nenough, by a little demon-brings gifts for good children, who set out \nshoes or stockings for him to fill. The Dutch make the biggest \nproduction of Nick's arrival, gathering to watch his ship land in \nAmsterdam, then seeing him off on his flying, white horse. Obviously, \na lot of this pageantry crossed over to America, except that our St. \nNicholas arrives via the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and doesn't \ndeliver his gifts until December 24.\u0014\n\u0014\nSwedes wait until St. Lucy's Day, December 13, to commence Christmas \nobservances. Lucy, who supposedly died in Italy in 304, became a \nScandinavian favorite when that region converted to Christianity, \nbeginning in about the eleventh century. Lucy's name comes from the \nLatin word for \"light,\" but, before sixteenth-century calendar \nreforms, her feast day fell on December 21-the shortest day of the \nyear. Scandinavians were pretty desperate for light around that time, \nso they latched onto Lucy. Her annual remembrance involves a girl \nfrom each household wearing a wreath of lingonberry leaves and lit \ncandles on her head and making an early breakfast for the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nStrange or silly as some of these customs might seem, I'd rather have \nmy calendar structured around cultural traditions than around \ncorporate budget forecasts. I don't care how much retailers are \nworried about fourth-quarter earnings. If they play Christmas music \nbefore Thanksgiving, they won't get my money.\u0014\n\u0014\nInformation for this article was adapted from the Encyclopedia of \nChristmas, by Tanya Gulevich\u0014",

    "words": "Child Sex Tours\u0014\n\u0014\nThe average victim is 14, and Americans make up 25 percent of the \ncustomers.\u0014\nDawn Herzog Jewell \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the ease of international air travel, arranging sex \ntourismincluding sex with under-age girlsis almost as simple as \nclicking on a website. By taking trips to areas tolerant of \nprostitution, American tourists or business travelers can easily take \nadvantage of the estimated 2 million prostituted children in Asia, \nLatin America, and Africa. Economically depressed or politically \nunstable regions are especially vulnerable to commercialized sex.\u0014\nRelated articles and links\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to World Vision, some predators travel specifically for \n\"sex tours,\" expecting anonymity, low-cost prostitution, ready access \nto children, and immunity from prosecution. Americans account for 25 \npercent of child sex tourists, according to reliable global \nestimates. The average victim is 14 years old, although some \nprostituted children are pre-adolescent. Besides the emotional and \nphysical wounds of sexual abuse, the children are also at great risk \nof HIV infection.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo combat child sex tourism, World Vision has teamed up with national \ngovernments and U.S. immigration and law enforcement agencies. U.S. \ncitizens and residents can face up to 30 years imprisonment for \nengaging in sexual activity with children under 18, even if they do \nso outside the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nInternationally, prosecutions are rare. In a recent case, Australian \npolice arrested a pilot, charging him under an anti-sex tourism law. \nHe is accused of abducting a Papua New Guinea girl and forcing her to \nhave sex with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, corrupt law enforcement feeds the problem in countries such as \nThailand, says Graham Tardif, who until recently oversaw World \nVision's anti-trafficking program in Thailand. Since trafficking \nprofits are huge and local wages are low, accepting bribes to look \nthe other way is a huge temptation for police and immigration \nofficers, despite government attempts to end such corruption.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to encouraging proper law enforcement, World Vision is \nsponsoring a media campaign to dissuade potential child sex tourists. \nIt includes airport billboards and posters, ads in tourist magazines, \nin-flight video announcements, and brochures in taxis and hotels in \nthe United States, Thailand, Cambodia, Mexico, and Costa Rica.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the problem remains massive. In Thailand alone, the \ngovernment-sponsored Baan Kredtakarn center in Bangkok has been \nproviding shelter and assistance for women and girls for more than 40 \nyears. World Vision's Tardif estimates that more than 90 percent of \nthe girls treated there are victims of child sex tourism and \ntrafficking. That is not likely an exaggeration, considering that the \nThai government admits there are 20,000 to 30,000 children involved \nin its commercial sex industry.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "words": "The concept of a \"critical mass\" was first used by physicists to \ndescribe the conditions needed for a molecular chain reaction that \nbegins once a certain atomic weight is reached and the atom splits. \nOnce this process begins, it is unstoppable -- and the ensuing \nnuclear fission results in the release of tremendous energy. Safely \nharnessed, this energy is used to run the massive turbines at our \nnuclear power plants. Packed into a metal casing, this energy is \nturned into the most deadly of bombs. But nothing happens, for good \nor ill, until that first initial critical mass is achieved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe principle of a critical mass works on human populations as well. \nThere always seems to be some \"magic number\" that must be achieved \nbefore anything really gets accomplished. The critical mass that \nturns a still photograph into cinematography is 24 frames per second. \nIn politics, the principle of \"critical mass\" is confused with \nmajorities -- in some instances, a simple majority of 51 percent to \ninitiate action of some sort; in other cases -- like a congressional \noverride of a presidential veto -- a two-thirds majority before \nthings can change.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was the first to elaborate on the principle of critical mass. \nAs this week's gospel text lays it out, the critical mass number for \nChristians is \"two or three ... gathered in my name\" (Matthew 18:20).\u0014",

    "words": "Christian Coaches Face Off for Super Bowl XLI\u0014\nThe God of Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith isn't just for Sunday.\u0014\nJason Bailey\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many people, football is religion. Superstar players are deified, \nweekly games are strictly observed, and everyonedevoted fan or \nnotwatches the Super Bowl.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith, football has not taken God's \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe head coaches of the AFC champion Indianapolis Colts and the NFC \nchampion Chicago Bears, who will lead their teams in Super Bowl XLI \non Sunday, have a lot in common. As has been well documented, they \nshare the distinction of being the first black head coaches in the \nSuper Bowl. They are close friends, having coached together with the \nTampa Bay Buccaneers for five years. They are also Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God is the center of my life,\" Smith told the media during a Super \nBowl press conference earlier this week. \"It controls all that I do. \nI hope I don't have to spend my time telling my players I'm a \nChristian. I hope they see it in my life every day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith and Dungy are not just Christians when the spotlight shines on \nthem. Their day-to-day coaching styles and set of priorities stand \nout among a league of coaches obsessed with winning at all costs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe coaches in the headlines this regular season have been \nhighlighted because of their animosity (Bill Belichick), duplicity \n(Nick Saban), and postgame electricity (Dennis Green). With only two \ncoaches left to write about, the tenor of the articles has clearly \nchanged.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He does things the right way,\" Dungy said of Smith after the Colts \nand Bears each won their conference championship games. \"No \nprofanity, no intimidation, just helping his guys the best he canand \nthat's the way I try to do it. I think it's great that we're able to \nshow the world not only that African-American coaches can do it, but \nChristian coaches can do it in a way that we can still win.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trait that makes Dungy and Smith excellent coaches is their \nability to put things in perspective. During even the most stressful \nsituations, neither wavers from his steady approach to the ups and \ndowns that are inherent in a volatile game. Although their \nmild-mannered styles do not make great headlines, they have proved \nendearing to players who look to Dungy and Smith for leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best coaches have players who are willing to do anythingwithin \nmoral and legal boundariesfor them. Dungy and Smith have commanded \nthat respect because they love and discipline their players as a \nfather would his son or God his children. And while a players' coach \n(e.g., Dick Vermeil) and a disciplinarian (e.g., Bill Parcells) can \nwin Super Bowls, it takes a certain type of coach to lose Super Bowls \nwell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill the losing coach of Super Bowl XLI be upset knowing how hard he \nworked and how far he came, only to lose the biggest game of his \ncareer? Most certainly. Will the losing coach be distraught and go \ninto a three-day funk before beginning to scout college seniors? Most \ndefinitely not.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Dungy and Smith will be back at work, rededicated to another \nseason, in due time. But they are perhaps most different in that \nregard. While the NFL has turned into a 24-7 affair where coaches \nlike to brag about how late they fall asleep and how early they wake \nup (with bonus points for sleeping in their office or filmroom) Dungy \nand Smith have always made sure that their priorities are in \norderGod comes first, family comes second, and football is a distant \nthird.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis hierarchy was most recently apparent shortly before last \nChristmas, when Dungy's 18-year-old son, James, committed suicide. \nAfter taking a few weeks away from football to grieve, Dungy returned \nto the field with a professionalism that served as a witness to his \ndeeply held faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nDungy and Smith are respected coaches not only because of their \nfootball knowledge (the duo collaborated to create the Tampa 2 \ndefense, which both the Colts and Bears will use in the Super Bowl), \nbut also because of the way that they conduct business both on and \noff the field.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Super Bowl, Dungy and Smith will continue to be the same \npeople they were before the big game. There will be no finger \npointing, neither outward nor upward, for the unpretentious duo.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two coaches live out their faith. While they do not proclaim it \nin response to every question asked at a press conference, they do \nnot come close to hiding their true devotion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Lord set this up in a way that no one would believe it,\" Dungy \nsaid after the Colts and Bears advanced to the Super Bowl. \"The Lord \ntested us a lot this year, but he set this up to get all the glory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christianity Today\u0014",

Semler said he submitted his resignation after \nofficials at the Roger Smith Hotel shut down the show.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe six-foot sculpture was the victim of \"a strong-arming from people \nwho haven't seen the show, seen what we're doing,\" Semler said. \"They \njumped to conclusions completely contrary to our intentions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut word of the confectionary Christ infuriated Catholics, including \nEgan, who described it as \"a sickening display.\" Bill Donohue, head \nof the watchdog Catholic League, said it was \"one of the worst \nassaults on Christian sensibilities ever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hotel and the gallery were overrun Thursday with angry phone \ncalls and e-mails about the exhibit. Semler said the calls included \ndeath threats over the work of artist Cosimo Cavallaro, who was \ndescribed as disappointed by the decision to cancel the display.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In this situation, the hotel couldn't continue to be supportive \nbecause of a fear for their own safety,\" Semler said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sculpture was to debut Monday evening, the day after Palm Sunday \nand just four days before Roman Catholics mark the crucifixion of \nJesus Christ on Good Friday. The final day of the exhibit was planned \nfor Easter Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe artwork was created from more than 200 pounds of milk chocolate, \nand features Christ with his arms outstretched as if on an invisible \ncross. Unlike the typical religious portrayal of Christ, the \nCavallaro creation does not include a loincloth.\u0014\n\u0014\nCavallaro is best known for his quirky work with food as art: Past \nefforts include repainting a Manhattan hotel room in melted \nmozzarella, spraying five tons of pepper jack cheese on a Wyoming \nhome, and festooning a four-poster bed with 312 pounds of processed \nham.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2007 The Associated Press.\u0014",

    "title": "CAN YOU SLEEP WHEN THE WIND BLOWS?",
    "words": "CAN YOU SLEEP WHEN THE WIND BLOWS?\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago, a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast. \u0014\nHe constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were \u0014\nreluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic. They dreaded the \u0014\nawful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the \nbuildings and crops. \u0014\nAs the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received \u0014\nA steady stream of refusals.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached \u0014\nthe farmer. \"Are you a good farm hand?\" the farmer asked him. \u0014\n\"Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,\" answered the little man.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, \u0014\nHired him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy from \u0014\ndawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work. \u0014\nThen one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore. \u0014\nJumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed \u0014\nnext door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the \u0014\nlittle man and yelled, \"Get up! A storm is coming! \u0014\nTie things down before they blow away!\" \u0014\nThe little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, \"No \u0014\nsir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEnraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on \u0014\nthe spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. \u0014\nTo his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had \u0014\nbeen covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens \u0014\nwere in the coops, and the doors were barred. \u0014\nThe shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. \u0014\n\u0014\nNothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his \u0014\nhired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while \u0014\nthe wind blew.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE MORAL TO THIS STORY:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you're prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, \u0014\nyou have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the \u0014\nwind blows through your life? \u0014\nThe hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he \u0014\nhad secured the farm against the storm. \u0014\nWe secure ourselves against the storms of life by \u0014\ngrounding ourselves in the Word of God. \u0014\nWe don't need to understand, we just need to hold \u0014\nHis hand to have peace in the middle of storms.\u0014",

    "words": "In the middle of WWII on October 29, 1941 Winston Churchill delivered \na short address at the Harrow School. England had been through some \nof its darkest days. But Churchill was equal to the task. He said to \nthe students:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You cannot tell from appearances how things will go. Sometimes \nimagination makes things out far worse than they are; yet without \nimagination not much can be done. Those people who are imaginative \nsee many more dangers than perhaps exist; certainly many more than \nwill happen; but then they must also pray to be given that extra \ncourage to carry this far-reaching imagination. But for everyone, \nsurely, what we have gone through in this period - I am addressing \nmyself to the School - surely from this period of ten months this is \nthe lesson: never give in, never give in, never, never, never, \nnever-in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in \nexcept to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force; \nnever yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We \nstood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our \naccount was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our \nsongs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, \nwere gone and finished and liquidated. [Churchill continues:] Very \ndifferent is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had \ndrawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the \ngap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what \nseemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we \nourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where \nI say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.\"\u0014",

His mother, Catherine de \nMdicis, controlled most of his decisions and persuaded him to order \nthe massacre of French Protestants on Saint Bartholomew's Day in \n1572.

    "title": "CHURCH POLITICS 101 - LEADERSHIP",
    "words": "Leader's Insight: Church Politics 101\u0014\n5 ways I deal with the political nature of leadership.\u0014\nby John Killinger\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of us associate politics with control or Machiavellian \nmanipulation, and therefore we pretend that the church is above it. \nJesus, we like to say, was not into politics. He didn't even try to \nsave his own skin when he could. We prefer to think of the church as \na no-politics zone.\u0014\n\u0014\nI always had a streak of navete about this. I became a little \nsmarter as the years went on, but only a little. Not a political \nschemer myself, I didn't dream that some people in the church ate, \nbreathed, and slept politics, and were invariably up to something.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was before I became senior minister of a church where each \nmonthly council session was a political battleground. I disliked \nhaving to think like a politician in order to conduct ministry. As \nexciting as it was, I soon tired of trying to preside over that \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the years since, I have realized how much easier my life as a \nminister might have been, and possibly how much more effective, if I \nhad been more aware of how political the minister's role is.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm not talking about being a politician for Jesusthe very idea \nstill appalls mebut I admit now that much can be accomplished by \nunderstanding the internal workings of church politics. If I were \ndrafted to teach a seminary course on the subject, here is some of \nwhat I would include:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Make friends, but carefully. Every church, including yours, will \nhave some disgruntled, even morally evil souls who will try to \nsabotage your ministry. Sometimes they will come on first as your \nfriendsall the while planning your downfall. This is a terrible \njudgment, but often true.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best way to deal with such people is to smile, accept their \nappearance of friendship without any great expectations, and pray for \ntheir transformation. You may win over a few, but don't count on it.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarefully cultivate friendships with a few church members in strong \nleadership positions, as well as some who are marginal to the life of \nthe congregation. Consult them on a regular, informal basis. Ask \nwhat's going right and wrong. Encourage them to speak freely. Listen!\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Truth has consequences. Be meticulously honest. Lies inevitably \nreturn to haunt you. If you fail at anything, be quick to admit it. \nDon't try to cover up. Small deceits mushroom into bigger problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe as open and charming as you can, but don't feel you have to share \neverything you know. Being too frank with your views, or trying to be \n\"edgy,\" will get you in trouble with people who can't understand or \nbe discreet. Remember: \"Least said, soonest mended.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlways keep confidences inviolable. Nothing undermines your \nrelationship with a congregation faster than for a member to tell you \nsomething in private and then hear it from someone else a few days \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Don't feed the rumor mill. Live your personal life above reproach. \nIt may not be fair for congregations to expect more of a minister \nthan they do of themselves, but it is a fact of life that they do. \nPay your bills promptly. Fulfill your obligations. Avoid the \nappearance of evil, especially in relationships with the opposite \ngender.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf a rumor about you gets started, find out where it began, talk to \nthe people who facilitated its transmission, and, if necessary, deal \nwith it in some public fashion.\u0014\n\u0014\nI like the story of the minister who had two gossipy sisters in his \nchurch. One day they saw his car parked in front of the liquor store \nand began spreading word of their minister's \"drinking problem.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he learned who was spreading the rumor, he parked his car in \nfront of the sisters' house and left it there overnight. The town \nheard about it, of course, credited the minister with wit and humor, \nand recognized the rumor for what it was.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Confront the turncoats. It's one thing to be Christian, but you \ndon't have to tolerate liars, gossips, and turncoats in church \nleadership positions. The faster such persons are cashiered from \ntheir positions, the better. You'd like to think that a staff member \nwho undercuts your work would change after being confronted, but this \nseldom happens. It's best to face the problem, ask the person to \nresign, or dismiss him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I had an untrustworthy associate I was unable to fire because of \nchurch polity, I did the next best thing and walled the person off \nfrom vital information and sensitive situations whenever I could.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't be afraid to go to a board or the entire congregation with a \nproblem that is troubling you or the church. Chances are the problem \nis already disturbing others and they are wishing something could be \ndone about it. Bringing such a problem officially before the proper \nvenue allows others to deal with it corporately and join creatively \nin its solution.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Give credit away. Share the credit. Be generous in giving credit \nto others, especially in public. Taking credit for others' work and \nideas will not help your reputation. You earn a far better reputation \nby sharing the spotlight. Many loyal workers labor in obscurity and \nwill work twice as hard if given public praise for their \naccomplishments.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlways exalt Christ. The church may be political. But the exaltation \nof Christ as its head has, through the centuries, lifted it above \nordinary politics. There was a brass plaque in a pulpit I once \nentered that said it best: \"Remember, these folks didn't come to see \nyou, they came to see Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Killinger is a pastor, author, and professor. This article is \nadapted from \"Pastoring Is Political\" in the Spring 2006 issue of \nLeadership.\u0014",

Looking toward the nearby mainland, the \naspiring missionary was said to have cried out, \"Rock, rock, oh when \nwilt thou open, rock?\" Priests in Macao had told him not to hold his \nbreath: the conversion of the Chinese, they argued, was completely \nimpossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin four years, though, a 30-year-old Italian Jesuit was living in \nthe provincial capital and introducing Chinese to the Christian \nfaith.

Little by \nlittle, Ricci moved closer to the imperial capital, Peking, and in \n1600, he was invited by the emperor to dwell there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chinese considered theirs the only true civilization, and Ricci \naccommodated them when he addressed them: \"Li Ma-ton, your Majesty's \nservant, comes from the Far West, addresses himself to your majesty \nwith respect  Despite the distance [of my homeland], fame told me of \nthe remarkable teaching and fine institutions with which the imperial \ncourt has endowed all its peoples.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe told the emperor that he only wanted to be \"of some small use,\" \nand at first, that meant repairing clocks, two of which he'd given \nthe emperor upon his arrival. Ricci's skill at this and mapmaking so \nimpressed the emperor, more doors were opened for him, so that he was \nable to remain in the capital, with government protection, for ten \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is a miracle of the omnipotent hand of the Most High,\" wrote \nRicci, \"The miracle appears all the greater in that not only do we \ndwell in Peking, but we enjoy here an incontestable authority.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nControversial evangelism\u0014\n\u0014\nTo translate Christianity into the Chinese idiom, Ricci had to \ninnovate. For example, the Chinese did not have a word for \"God,\" so \nRicci at first used T'ien Chu, \"Lord of Heaven.\" In one of his \nearliest catechisms, he wrote, \"Those that adore Heaven instead of \nthe Lord of Heaven are like a man who, desiring to pay the emperor \nhomage, prostrates himself before the imperial palace at Peking and \nvenerates its beauty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLater he decided that T'ien (\"heaven\") alone already had theistic \novertones to the Chinese. He also believed that terms like Sheng, \noften translated \"holy,\" were used in a wide sense to describe \nanything held as venerable. Thus Ricci used it when referring to \nConfucius.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, to give himself a hearing among the Chinese \nintelligentsia, most of whom were devotees of Confucianism, Ricci \ndecided he needed to become a Confucian scholar.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in order to honor local traditions, he permitted his converts to \ncontinue many ancient customs, like ancestor \"worship.\" In China, \nsociety was founded on the cohesion of the family, and paying \nreverence to ancestors (burning incense to them) was a traditional \nrite that reinforced this family value. Ricci, after prolonged study, \ndecided the practice was not worship, as some Christians charged, but \nmerely an act of respect for those family members who had gone before.\u0014\n\u0014\nRicci's methods came under fire almost immediately, especially from \ncompeting orders, the Dominicans and Franciscans, who were jealous of \nJesuit success. The affair become known as the Chinese Rites \nControversy. Rome tended to take the side of the friars and tried to \ncurtail Ricci's work. Peking, on the other hand, sided with the \nJesuits, and the controversy raged for centuries without being \nresolved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRicci maintained his mission until he died. Though the number of his \nconverts was relatively small, it included many influential Chinese \nscholars and families who played key roles in the future of \nChristianity in China.\u0014",

Many Nez Perc, including Chief Joseph's father, \nwere converted to Christianity and Chief Joseph was educated in a \nmission school. The advance of white settlers into the Pacific \nNorthwest after 1850 caused the United States to press the Indians of \nthe region to surrender their lands and accept resettlement on small \nand often unattractive reservations. Some Nez Perc chiefs, including \nChief Joseph's father, questioned the validity of treaties pertaining \nto their lands negotiated in 1855 and 1863 on the ground that the \nchiefs who participated in the negotiations did not represent their \ntribe.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the United States attempted in 1877 to force the dissenting Nez \nPerc to move to a reservation in Idaho, Chief Joseph, who had \nsucceeded his father in 1871, reluctantly agreed. While he was \npreparing for the removal, however, he learned that a trio of young \nbraves had massacred a band of white settlers and prospectors; \nfearing retaliation by the U.S. army, he decided instead to lead his \nsmall body of followers (some 200 to 300 warriors and their families) \non a long trek to Canada.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor more than three months (June 17Sept. 30, 1877), Chief Joseph led \nhis followers on a retreat of more than 1,000 miles across Oregon, \nWashington, Idaho, and Montana, outmanoeuvring the pursuing troops, \nwhich outnumbered Joseph's warriors by a ratio of at least ten to \none, and several times defeating them in actual combat. During the \nlong retreat, he won the admiration of many whites by his humane \ntreatment of prisoners, his concern for women, children, and the \naged, and also because he purchased supplies from ranchers and \nstorekeepers rather than stealing them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nez Perc were finally surrounded in the Bear Paw mountains of \nMontana, within 40 miles of the Canadian border. On October 5 Chief \nJoseph surrendered to Gen. Nelson A. Miles, delivering an eloquent \nspeech that was long remembered: Hear me, my chiefs; my heart is \nsick and sad. From where the Sun now stands, I will fight no more \nforever.\u0014\n\u0014\nChief Joseph and his band were sent at first to a barren reservation \nin Indian Territory (later Oklahoma); there many sickened and died. \nNot until 1885 were he and the remnants of his tribe allowed to go to \na reservation in Washingtonthough still in exile from their valley. \nMeanwhile, Chief Joseph had made two trips to Washington, D.C., \nwhere, presented to Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, he pleaded for the \nreturn of his people to their ancestral home. See also Nez Perc.\u0014",

Chandler, D.Min., \nExecutive Director\u0014\n\u0014\n          Chris Hedges states that alter a period of time, war begins \nto develop its own life. The\u0014\nforner theology student turned journalist wrote in his book, War is a \nForce That Gives Us Meaning, that those involved are able to perform \nsuperhuman acts because they are energized      by the war. A veteran \nwar journalist, Hedges studied the nature and dynamic of war \n(especially     the wars of the 1980s and I 99Os), concluding that \nwar provides a purpose for living. He argues that war bonds people \ntogether from diverse backgrounds into a common cause, sometimes\u0014\nbringing together strange bedfellows. The cycle can be contagious.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Church conflict, sometimes like war, can take on a life of \nits own. And it does so for the same reasons. Swords are drawn among \nthe factious groups, gossip flows, and the myths take on a life of \ntheir own to fuel the conflict (wars). In this war both sides share a \ncause that unites them because they have something or someone to \noppose or support. Each side convinces themselves that they are \nparticipating in a noble cause. A communal march against a common \nenemy generates among people who otherwise have so little in common. \nIt can disintegrate into a feeding frenzy. Perspectives are blurred \nas people engage in gossip that destroys the enemy without \nconsidering what it does to the body of Christ. Pack thinking \nreplaces reason and investigation of the facts. The end justifies the \nmeans no matter who is wounded or killed. The cause demands full \nattention and followship. Sometimes the major issue(s), is no longer \nthe focus. The conflict is now the focus. Lines are drawn in the sand \ncreating divides that are seldom bridged.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Disregarding the spirit of Christ and the mission of the \nchurch, however; is never right or productive. The Prophet Isaiah \nadmonished, \"Come, let us reason together (Isa 1:18.) The Apostle \nPaul said, And now I will show you the most excellent way \nwhereupon he launches\u0014\ninto his dioscourse on love (I Corinthians 13.)\u0014\n\u0014\n          Conflicted congregations dissipate their time and energies \nwarring, thus they have little time or energy for ministry to others. \nResearch by the Hartfbrd Theological Seminary confirned\u0014\nsomethiitg that we already knew or at least suspected: churches with \nmajor conflict experience less church growth, produce fewer members \ngoing into vocational ministry and have less       positive influence \nin their community. And the reasons are self evident. When \ncongregations lost their way they lose their spiritual effictiveness.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Seldom do healthy congregations emerge accidentally. They \nare the result of healthy clergy and lay church leaders who embody \nspiritual commitment, a high level of trust, shared leadership, \ngenuine concern for the body of Christ, and personal investment in \nministry to others.\u0014\nThis is intentional, not accidental. Ministers and lay leaders pray \nfor one another and are more concerned about being faithful to the \nopportunities for ministry aaround them than they are in \"statistical \nsuccess or who gets the credit. Healthy church leaders mentor the \nyounger brothers and sisters and are not obsessed over who gets the \ncreditor blame.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           Lets wonder what might happen if time and energy expended \nin church conflict were \u0014\nchanneled into a healthy ministry of mutual trust and respect based \nupon the leadership of the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n      \u0014\n           Im convinced that healthy ministers help produce healthy \nchurches.\u0014",

    "title": "CELEBRATING TRUE THANKSGIVING:AN INDIANS' VIEW",
    "words": "Monday, November 19, 2007\u0014\nCelebrating True Thanksgiving: One Native American View (by Randy \nWoodley)\u0014\n\u0014\nMillions of Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving again this year \nwith a philosophy of Manifest Destiny. Many Native Americans will not \ncelebrate Thanksgiving at all. They will view the holiday as a \nnational day of mourning. To them, the Thanksgiving Myth justifies \nthe genocide of indigenous peoples and acquiesces to notions of  \nWhite supremacy. They will protest at Plymouth Rock and disseminate \nstories of the many massacres of Native Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us, trying to think through our mutual history, have asked \nquestions like: \"Should we even celebrate Thanksgiving? And if so, \nhow?\" In contrast to the sanitized Pilgrim story that we all learn, \nand in contrast to the horror stories from our past, I suggest that \nwe replace the dominant myth of Thanksgiving with an alternate view.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should begin by realizing that Thanksgiving in America didn't \nbegin with the Pilgrims. For thousands of years feasts of \nthanksgiving have been characteristic of our Indian people. This has \nnever ceased. While I do not advocate we replace them with the \ndominant Thanksgiving Myth, I still don't want to give up any type of \nfestival of thanksgiving to the Creatornot even Thanksgiving day. \nWhy? The answer is simple. Everything we have comes from God. We \nshould always give thanksfor everything! I think our indigenous \nancestors would agree with this point.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wake up every morning and give thanks to Creator-Son, Jesus, for \nall that I have. Each day my wife and I burn sweet grass, read a \ndevotional and pray for many things. Most of this time we spend \ngiving thanks. We often have guests in our home (native and \nnon-native) who join us during these times. How can I wake up on the \nday that is designated \"Thanksgiving,\" or any day, and do something \ndifferent?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know that many of the \"Christian\" Pilgrims did not act like \nittheir greed for land and false notions of superiority did not \nreflect Jesus. We also know there were real times of peace and \nfriendship that did reflect the real Jesus. We should celebrate those \ntimes. But, if we are using the Thanksgiving holiday as a narrative \nfor peace and friendship, then let's build upon that and not ignore \nthe whole picture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact remains, settlers killed a lot of Indians, sometimes without \nmercy even for women and children. And, they often justified it with \nmoral superiority from a \"righteous\" Christian base. That march of \nsupposed moral supremacy over Native Americans is in \"lock step\" with \nthe current call to war. If you don't support the current war, (or \nAmerica's feigned moral superiority), take ownership of the whole \nhistory and celebrate the times of peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can also celebrate new possibilities of true reconciliation with \nNative Americans, Muslims, and all the \"other\" people who have been \nthe recipients of the devastation brought on by the dominant myth. \nOur family, on Thanksgiving Day, chooses to invite non-Indians to our \nhome to cultivate true friendship.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur family's prayer for you is to celebrate and enjoy this time of \nThanksgiving, be thankful, educate yourselves concerning the real \nhistory of America, and use this time to encourage reconciliation \nbetween your family and those who share a different history. This is \nthe first step to healing our land.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Randy Woodley is a Keetoowah Cherokee Indian teacher, lecturer, \npoet, activist, pastor and the author of Living in Color: Embracing \nGod's Passion for Ethnic Diversity (InterVarsity Press).\u0014\n\u0014\nResponse to above:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about the current Thanksgiving celebration is honoring killing \nor celebrating darkness? What is mythic about what children learn \nabout \"the first Thanksgiving?\" Was it not true that the Pilgrims and \nothers in their community, including American Indians, came together \nto celebrate and give thanks to God for their survival? There is \nnothing mythic about that. It happened. This is what kids are taught \nabout Thanksgiving.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, we don't spend Thanksgiving talking about the harsh things done \nto American Indians in the years to follow because it has absolutely \nNOTHING to do with Thanksgiving! It's another chapter in American \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nEric | November 19, 2007\u0014\n\u0014\nI live by a couple of tribes and this is what is basically taught in \ntheir culture .\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact of the matter Natives were treated quite wrongly , even as \nlittle as a generation ago kids were being TAKEN out of homes as to \nmake sure they were Americanized . Sent to boarding schools , a make \nshift culture is being re invented , but it was taken from them .\u0014\n\u0014\nHorrible , horrible . but I believe where the writer goofs up is his \nmyth that many tribes were so noble , They were not , they were \npre-historic , that did not know how to make metals . They promoted \nslavery , attacked other tribes and stole women and children for \nlabor . They were often quite barbaric and often treated their own \npeople quite harshly . Most tribes did not live up to the Dances with \nWolves myth, not many . Just like not many Pilgrims were not the \nperfect ambassadors of Christianity .\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact of their matter is they thanked God for their blessings , \nand that is what is important . Especially to a culture that seems to \nforget that we have received so many blessings from God .\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted by: Mick Sheldon | November 19, 2007\u0014",

    "title": "CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA, THEOLOGIAN FOR THE INTELEGENCIA",
    "words": "Clement of Alexandria\u0014\nTheologian for the intelligentsia\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let us remove the ignorance and darkness that spreads like a mist \nover our sight, and let us get a vision of the true God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNew Age thought is really not all that new, nor is the twentieth \ncentury the first time Christians have been forced to respond to this \nstrain of religious teaching. One early form of New Age type thinking \nwas Gnosticism, which flourished in the second and third centuries, \nand one of the most effective Christian responders was Clement of \nAlexandria.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"new philosophy\"\u0014\nHe was born Titus Flavius Clemens, most likely to pagan parents in \nAthens. As an adult, he sought out truth from a number of teachers in \nGreece, lower Italy, Syria, Palestine, and finally Alexandria, a city \nof perhaps one million inhabitants. There he sat under Pantaenus, who \ntaught Christianity in light of the scientific teachings of the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn about 190, Clement opened his own \"school,\" which was more like a \ncycle of conferences drawn out over years. He taught a \"new \nphilosophy\" that addressed the cultural and philosophical concerns of \nthe day. The \"philosophy\" was not all that newChristianitybut \nClement's teaching of it was. He wrote three books to expound his \nviews.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Exhortation to the Greeks was an introductory philosophical work \nfor the unbaptized, in which he attempted to show the reasonableness \nof the Christian faith. \"Away then, away with our forgetfulness of \nthe truth!\" he exhorted. \"Let us remove the ignorance and darkness \nthat spreads like a mist over our sight, and let us get a vision of \nthe true God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Instructor, he outlined the specific duties and ethics taught by \nthe \"Instructor\" (i.e., the Logos, or Christ): \"Our superintendence \nin instruction and discipline is the office of the Word [Logos, in \nGreek], from whom we learn frugality and humility, and all that \npertains to love of freedom, love of man, and love of excellence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Miscellanies is a multicolored patchwork of teachings in advanced \nphilosophy, ethics, and disciplined instruction for \"Christian \nGnostics\" to lead them into esoteric knowledge (gnosis): \"The man of \nunderstanding and discernment is, then, a Gnostic. And his business \nis not abstinence from what is evil ... or the doing of good out of \nfear ... nor any more is he to do so from hope of promised recompense \n... but only the doing of good out of love, and for the sake of its \nown excellence is the Gnostic's choice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf this sounds mystical, it is. Clement sought to reach the literati \nof his day, and Gnosticism was the rage. He sought to present the \nChristian faith in terms these people could recognize.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem of wealth\u0014\nClement didn't spend all his time on pagans but also sought to help \nthe church. One of history's most famous sermons is Clement's. In it \nhe tried to address a recurring problem in church history, but one \nwhich Christians were facing for the first time in his day: in light \nof Jesus' parable of the rich young ruler, what should rich \nChristians do with their wealth? Clement took an approach that has \nbeen debated but usually followed ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement puts the issue this way: \"Since possessions of one kind are \nwithin the soul, and those of another kind outside it, and these \nlatter appear to be good if the soul uses them well, but if they are \nbadly usedwhich of the two is it that he [Jesus] asks us to \nrenounce?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe answers, \"The Lord admits the use of outward things, bidding us \nput away, not the means of living, but the things that use these \nbadly. And these are ... the infirmities and passions of the soul.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, it's our attitude toward possessions (i.e., greed), \nnot the possessions themselves, that are the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement also advocated using the visual arts in worship at a time \nwhen some early Christians were reluctant to employ painting or \ndrawing, fearing attention to their work might constitute idolatry. \nClement concluded that Christians are not to depict pagan gods, nor \nsword or bow, nor wine cups, nor reminders of sexual immorality.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, \"Let our emblem be a dove, or a fish, or a ship running \nbefore the wind, or a musician's lyre, or a ship's anchor. And if \nthere be a fisherman, he will remind us of an apostle, and little \nchildren being drawn up out of the water.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, one of the earliest Christian hymns is that appended to \nClement's Instructor, \"Hymn of the Savior Christ.\" Its earliest \nrendering in English verse (in 1846) appears in many hymnals today as \n\"Shepherd of Tender Youth.\" Three stanzas translated from the \noriginal Greek bring a vivid picture of the praise-life of the \nAlexandrian church:\u0014\n\u0014\nBridle-bit of untamed colts,\u0014\nWing of birds that do not go astray,\u0014\nSure Tiller of ships,\u0014\nShepherd of the King's lambs!\u0014\nGather your children\u0014\nWho live in simplicity.\u0014\nLet them sing in holiness.\u0014\nLet them celebrate with sincerity,\u0014\nWith a mouth that knows no evil,\u0014\nThe Christ who guides his children!\u0014\n\u0014\nHis ministry, both in and outside the Alexandrian church, was cut \nabruptly short in 202, when persecution broke out during the reign of \nEmperor Septimius Severus. Clement was compelled to flee the city. He \nsettled in Cappadocia, and by 215 had died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his influence did not end when his life did. He was, according to \ntradition, the teacher of Origen, a theologian of immense influence \nin the next generation. His mystical theology may have also \ninfluenced Psuedo-Dionysius, who was the theologian who shaped \nmedieval mysticism. And in the 1700s, John Wesley drew on Clement's \ndepiction of the true Gnostic for help in describing Christian \nperfection.\u0014",

    "title": "CHURCH AND STATE--WAS IT REALLY THE ISSUE?",
    "words": "February 7, 2008,  4:42 pm\u0014\nMitts Funeral\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMitt Romney is gone, having suspended his campaign in the face of \ndelegate math that cannot work in his favor, no matter how he \ncrunches the numbers. But before he leaves the stage, the record \nshould show who  or what  did him in.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlame Christians. By significant margins, in poll after poll, in vote \nafter vote a solid block of evangelical Christians said they would \nnever vote for a Mormon. Since evangelicals made up nearly half of \nthe Republican primary vote in some states, Romney was up against a \ndeep well of distrust of a religion that many evangelicals still \nlabel a cult.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt showed again Tuesday, in exit polls in the bellwether state of \nMissouri. Among the small group of Republican voters who say they \nnever go to church, Romney got his highest vote total  39 percent. \nAmong people who attend services more than once a week, he received \nhis lowest, 21 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nPut another way, those dreaded secularists  whom Romney himself \ncriticized in his off-tune and hugely miscalculated speech on \nreligion in December  were far more likely to vote for him than were \nthe most devout Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost evangelicals will still be suspicious of Mormonism as a \nreligion, noted Christianity Today, a leading evangelical \nperiodical, after the speech, which was Romneys attempt to defuse \nthe issue. The religions continued rejection of historic Christian \ntruths feeds that suspicion.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, there are many other reasons why the well-funded \nex-governor with the to-die-for resume never got any traction. Many \nvoters found him unctuous, weasely, fake. He didnt wear well. His \nvoice was grating and snappish. He was too perfect, on the surface, \nfor the human race, let alone America on the cusp of a recession and \nan uncertain war. He changed positions so dramatically on gays and \nabortion that Senator John McCain could call him the true change \ncandidate in a debate, and the audience laughed at the obvious joke.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as it became clear that McCain, who is anathema to many \nconservatives, was going to head the Republican ticket, Romney had \nhis chance. Gov. Mike Huckabee, for all his chuckleheaded bon mots, \nwas never a viable candidate. He simply didnt have the money, the \nexperience or the judgment. Talk radios leading gasbag, Rush \nLimbaugh, said as much, telling listeners that a vote for Huckabee \nwas a vote for McCain.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, precisely at Romneys opening, the Christian base was not there \nto help him. On Super Tuesday, the influential evangelist James \nDobson said he would sit out the election if John McCain was the \nnominee. At the moment Romney most needed him, Dobson threw no life \njacket his way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd those who think that race without Huckabee would have given \nRomney the conservatives he needed are delusional.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts tempting to call these voters anti-Mormon bigots. Polls show \nevangelicals are three times as likely to vote for a black candidate \nas a Mormon. In the late 1960s, the percentage of Americans who said \nthey would not vote for a Jew was in the teens. By 2000, that number \nwas down to the low single digits. A similar tolerance opened up for \nCatholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on Mormons, the numbers never moved. About 17 percent of \nAmericans say they have qualms about voting for a Mormon  the same \nnumber as in 1967.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong evangelicals, its far worse. Southern Baptists, a huge part of \nthe Republican base, have labeled Mormonism a cult. Mormons believe \nthat the Garden of Eden was in Missouri, and that a lost tribe of \nIsraelites found their way to North America  both anthropological \nfairy tales, and heresies to many evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a Pew Center poll, 36 percent of evangelicals said they \nwould be less likely to vote for a candidate who was Mormon. This is \n50 percent higher than the nation as whole.\u0014\n\u0014\nRomney has to know this. If he had been honest on this issue, \naddressing it head on, perhaps his fate would have been different.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his speech on Mormonism in December, he took a swipe at secular \nAmericans, missing his chance to dislodge the real base of \nanti-Mormon prejudice. And in his remarks Thursday in which he \nannounced the suspension of his campaign, he mentioned the Democrats \nand opponents of American culture in the same sentence.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would have been better off had he begged for tolerance from an \naudience full of the people who did him in.\u0014",

Check out this \npurrr-fect list of myths so kitty can sit pretty.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Cats should have a litter before they are spayed.\u0014\nThis is not true. Cats that have a litter before they are spayed are \nnot better for it in any way. In fact, spayed cats are healthier and \nhave eliminated the risk for life-threatening uterine infections.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Street cats are always healthier than purebred cats.\u0014\nThis is not true. Both purebred and \"street\" cats can be unhealthy. \nBoth can have diseases, however, many mixed breed \"domestic\" cats do \nnot have many of the genetic diseases common in purebred lines.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. All cats prefer canned food.\u0014\nSome cats do but some cats will only eat dry food.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Cats cannot be trained.\u0014\nThis is not true. Cats are very smart and can be trained to do tricks.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Cats like tasty food.\u0014\nCats have poor taste buds and eat primarily based on their sense of \nsmell.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Cats will let you know when they are sick.\u0014\nThis is not true. Cats generally are very good at hiding that they \nare sick by survival instinct, thus not to appear vulnerable to \n\"prey\". Often by the time they show you that they are sick, their \ndisease or condition is quite advanced.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Cats don't need heartworm prevention.\u0014\nThis is not true. Cats can get heartworm disease, even indoor cats. \nHeartworm disease is spread by mosquitoes, which can come inside.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Cats don't need litter box trained - they naturally know where to \ngo.\u0014\nThere is a natural instinct for many cats; however, not all cats \nunderstand the litter box concept.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Cats are happier and healthier when they are outdoors.\u0014\nThis is not necessarily true. Many cats are happy being outside at \ncertain times, especially when the weather is good. However, during \nbad weather, they would prefer to be inside. Nevertheless, outdoor \ncats are definitely not healthier than those that remain indoors. The \naverage lifespan of strictly outdoor cats is estimated to be \napproximately 1 year of age; indoor-outdoor cats about 3-6 years and \nindoor only cats have an average lifespan closer to 13-15 years.\u0014",

    "words": "Constantine\u0014\nFirst Christian emperor\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have experienced this in others and in myself, for I walked not in \nthe way of righteousness.  But the Almighty God, who sits in the \ncourt of heaven, granted what I did not deserve.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first Life of Constantine describes its subject as \"resplendent \nwith every virtue that godliness bestows.\" This praise-filled \nbiography came from the hand of Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in \nPalestine, and perhaps Constantine's greatest admirer. It is the \nclassic image that prevailed in Eastern Christianity for more than a \nthousand years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians now debate whether \"the first Christian emperor\" was a \nChristian at all. Some think him an unprincipled power seeker. What \nreligion he had, many argue, was at best a blend of paganism and \nChristianity for purely political purposes.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, Constantine held to ideals we no longer share. He knew \nnothing of religion without politics or politics without religion. \nYet he clearly believed he was a Christian, and he looked back to a \nbattle at the Milvian Bridge, just outside the walls of Rome, as the \ndecisive hour in his newly found faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nField vision\u0014\nOf Constantine's early years, we know only that he was born in \nIllyria, a region in the Balkans. His father, Constantius Chlorus, \nwas already a Roman official on the rise. Helena, the daughter of an \ninnkeeper and Constantius's wife, gave birth to Constantine around \nA.D. 280 in Naissus, just south of the Danube. By the time \nConstantine was 31, he was in line to become emperor of the western \nempireand more.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the spring of 311, with 40,000 soldiers behind him, Constantine \nrode toward Rome to confront an enemy whose numbers were four times \nhis own. Maxentius, vying for supremacy in the West, waited in Rome \nwith his Italian troops and the elite Praetorian Guard, confident no \none could successfully invade the city. But Constantine's army was \nalready overwhelming his foes in Italy as he marched toward the \ncapital.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaxentius turned to pagan oracles, finding a prophecy that the \"enemy \nof the Romans\" would perish. But Constantine was still miles away. \nSo, bolstered by the prophecy, Maxentius left the city to meet his \nfoe.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Constantine saw a vision in the afternoon sky: a bright \ncross with the words By this sign conquer. As the story goes, Christ \nhimself told Constantine in a dream to take the cross into battle as \nhis standard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough accounts vary, Constantine apparently believed the omen to be \na word from God. When he awoke early the next morning, the young \ncommander obeyed the message and ordered his soldiers to mark their \nshields with the now famous Chi-Rho.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaxentius's troops fled in disarray toward the surging Tiber. The \nwould-be emperor attempted to escape over the wooden bridge erected \nto span the stream, but his own army-turned-mob, pressing through the \nnarrow passage, forced him into the river, where he drowned by the \nweight of his armor.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine entered Rome the undisputed ruler of the West, the first \nRoman emperor with a cross in his diadem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWavering believer\u0014\nOnce supreme in the West, Constantine met Licinius, the ruler of the \nBalkan provinces, and issued the famous Edict of Milan that gave \nChristians freedom of worship and directed the governors to restore \nall the property seized during the severe Diocletian persecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius in his Church History recorded the Christian jubilation: \n\"The whole human race was freed from the oppression of the tyrants. \nWe especially, who had fixed our hopes upon the Christ of God, had \ngladness unspeakable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine's faith was still imprecise, but few questioned its \nauthenticity. In 314 Constantine sent a message to the assembled \nbishops at the Council of Arles. He wrote about how God does not \nallow people \"to wander in the shadows\" but reveals to them \nsalvation: \"I have experienced this in others and in myself, for I \nwalked not in the way of righteousness.  But the Almighty God, who \nsits in the court of heaven, granted what I did not deserve.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a decade, though, he wavered. For example, on the Arch of \nConstantine, which celebrates his Milvian Bridge victory, pagan \nsacrifices usually depicted on Roman monuments are absent. Then \nagain, there are still no Christian symbols, and Victory and the Sun \nGod are honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had no desire to impose his newfound faith as a state religion. \n\"The struggle for deathlessness,\" he said, \"must be free.\" He seemed \nto begin where his father left off: more or less a monotheist opposed \nto idols, and more or less friendly toward Christians. Only through \nthe years did his Christian convictions grow.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublic relations expert\u0014\nIn 323 Constantine triumphed over Licinius and became the sole ruler \nof the Roman world. The victory enabled Constantine to move the seat \nof government permanently to the East, to the ancient Greek city of \nByzantium (now Istanbul). He enlarged and enriched the city at \nenormous expense and built magnificent churches throughout the East. \nThe new capital was dedicated as New Rome, but everyone soon called \nthe city Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians were more populous and vocal in the East than they were in \nRome, so during the last 14 years of his reign, \"Bullneck\" could \nopenly proclaim himself a Christian. He proceeded to create the \nconditions we call \"state-church\" and bequeathed the ideal to \nChristians for over a thousand years.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 325 the Arian controversy threatened to split the newly united \nempire. To settle the matter, Constantine called together a council \nof the bishops at Nicea, a city near the capital. He ran the meeting \nhimself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You are bishops whose jurisdiction is within the church,\" he told \nthem. \"But I also am a bishop, ordained by God to oversee those \noutside the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPresiding at the council, Constantine was magnificent: arranging \nelaborate ceremony, dramatic entrances and processions, and splendid \nservices. He was also a gifted mediator, now bringing his skill in \npublic relations to the management of church affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately he could not follow abstract arguments or subtle issues \nand often found himself at a great disadvantage at these councils.\u0014\n\u0014\nDelayed baptism\u0014\nConstantine waited until death drew near to be baptized as a \nChristian. His decision was not unusual in a day when many Christians \nbelieved one could not be forgiven after baptism. Since the sins of \nworldly men, especially those with public duties, were considered \nincompatible with Christian virtue, some church leaders delayed \nbaptizing such men until just before death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe gave his sons an orthodox Christian education, and his \nrelationship with his mother was generally happy, but he continued to \nact as a typical Roman emperor. He ordered the execution of his \neldest son, his second wife, and his favorite sister's husband. No \none seems to be able to explain fully his reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile many of his actions cannot be defended, he did bid farewell to \nthe old Roman gods and make the cross an emblem of Victory in the \nworld.\u0014",

    "title": "COMPOUND IN SALIVA SPEEDS WOUND HEALING",
    "words": "Compound in Saliva \nSpeeds Wound Healing \u0014\n\u0014\nA report by scientists from The Netherlands published online in The \nFASEB Journal (http://WWW.fasebj.org) identifies a compound in human \nsaliva that greatly speeds wound healing. This research may offer \nhope to people suffering from chronic wounds related to diabetes and \nother disorders, as well as traumatic injuries and burns. In \naddition, because the compounds can be mass produced, they have the \npotential to become as common as antibiotic creams and rubbing \nalcohol.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"We hope our finding is ultimately beneficial for people who suffer \nfrom non-healing wounds, such as foot ulcers and diabetic ulcers, as \nwell as for treatment of trauma-induced wounds like burns,\" said \nMenno Oudhoff, first author of the report.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpecifically, scientists found that histatin, a small protein in \nsaliva previously only believed to kill bacteria was responsible for \nthe healing. To come to this conclusion, the researchers used \nepithelial cells that line the inner cheek, and cultured in dishes \nuntil the surfaces were completely covered with cells. Then they made \nan artificial wound in the cell layer in each dish, by scratching a \nsmall piece of the cells away. In one dish, cells were bathed in an \nisotonic fluid without any additions. In the other dish, cells were \nbathed in human saliva. After 16 hours the scientists noticed that \nthe saliva treated \"wound\" was almost completely closed. In the dish \nwith the untreated \"wound,\" a substantial part of the \"wound\" was \nstill open. This proved that human saliva contains a factor which \naccelerates wound closure of oral cells. Because saliva is a complex \nliquid with many components, the next step was to identify which \ncomponent was responsible for wound healing. Using various techniques \nthe researchers split the saliva into its individual components, \ntested each in their wound model, and finally determined that \nhistatin was responsible. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This study not only answers the biological question of why animals \nlick their wounds,\" said Gerald Weissmann, MD, Editor-in-Chief of The \nFASEB Journal, \"it also explains why wounds in the mouth, like those \nof a tooth extraction, heal much faster than comparable wounds of the \nskin and bone. It also directs us to begin looking at saliva as a \nsource for new drugs.\"\u0014",

    "words": "The Death of Common Sense\u0014\n\u0014\nMy parents told me about Mr. Common Sense early in my life and told \nme I\u0014\nwould do well to call on him when making decisions. It seems he was\u0014\nalways around in my early years but less and less as time passed by\u0014\nuntil today I read his obituary. Please join me in a moment of silence\u0014\nin remembrance. For Common Sense had served us all so well for so many\u0014\ngenerations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                       Obituary\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense\u0014\n\u0014\nToday we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, Common Sense, who\u0014\nhas been with us for many years. No one knows for sure how old he was\u0014\nsince his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as\u0014\nknowing when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the\u0014\nworm, life isn't always fair, and maybe it was my fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend \nmore\u0014\nthan you earn) and reliable parenting strategies (adults, not children\u0014\nare in charge).\u0014\n\u0014\nHis health began to deteriorate rapidly when well intentioned, but\u0014\noverbearing, regulations were set in place. Reports of a six-year-old\u0014\nboy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate, teens\u0014\nsuspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch, and a teacher\u0014\nfired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the\u0014\njob they themselves failed to do in disciplining their unruly \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt declined even further when schools were required to get parental\u0014\nconsent to administer Aspirin, sun lotion or a Band-Aid to a student,\u0014\nbut could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and\u0014\nwanted to have an abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense lost the will to live as the Ten Commandments became\u0014\ncontraband, churches became businesses, and criminals received better\u0014\ntreatment than their victims.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a\u0014\nburglar in your own home and the burglar can sue you for assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense finally gave up the will to live after a woman failed to\u0014\nrealize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in\u0014\nher lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust; \nhis\u0014\nwife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe is survived by three stepbrothers; \u0014\n\u0014\n1. I know my rights, \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Someone Else is to Blame\u0014\n\u0014\n         and \u0014\n\u0014\n3. I'm a Victim. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.\u0014",

    "words": "The earliest Christians believed that in baptism we were joined to \nthe life of Christ, and our sins were forgiven. Serious sin led to a \nseparation from the community. In the second-century The Shepherd of \nHermas we are told that someone who had sinned seriously was allowed \na second chance, but only one. Some took the stance that no \nreconciliation was possible. This gradually gave way to a system \nunder which those who had sinned seriously (the three great sins were \nmurder, apostasy and adultery, because they struck directly at the \nheart of the community) stood in a special place in the church, often \nwearing rags or skins, and were denied communion for a specific, \nusually lengthy, period of time. At the end of the period of \nrepentance they were reconciled, through a prayer offered by the \nbishop. Some sins led to lifelong excommunication. Saint John \nChrysostom was unusual in his practice of accepting sinners back into \ncommunion after repeated falls, and he was harshly criticized (and \neventually deposed) by other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--John Garvey, Sinning and sorrowing: Taking confession seriously, \nCommonweal, July 13, 2001, Commonwealmag.\u0014",

Such \nCatholic countries as Brazil, France, Italy, and Spain are hardly \nknown for their puritanical sexual mores. Even in northern climes, \nthe large Catholic family is proverbial. But the priests who stand in \nthe person of Christ at Mass, who dispense God's mercy in the \nconfessional, who baptize our children and bury our deadwe Catholics \nexpect them to be sexually abstemious. They are supposed to be holy, \nand holiness has always and everywhere been associated with purity. \nFor a variety of complicated historical reasons, the purity that \nmatters most when discussing the Catholic clergy is sexual purity. \nAnd sexual deviation, more so than any other of the many forms of \nhuman sinfulness, brings out the tabloid editor in all of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nClerical celibacy, the promise never to marry, is often, but \nshouldn't be, confused with chastity, which is the vow taken by nuns \nand priests who belong to religious orders, such as the Dominicans or \nJesuits. Religious vowspoverty, chastity, and obedienceare called \nthe Evangelical Counsels because they conform to the radical way of \nlife evidenced by Jesus in the New Testament. The regular Catholic \nparish clergy take a vow of obedience to their bishops, and they \npromise to be celibate, but they do not promise poverty or chastity. \nIn the Eastern Orthodox churches, monks and nuns also take the \nevangelical vows, but the regular clergy have always been free to \nmarry. The churches of the Reformation also allow their clergy to \nmarry. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Slate, 5/15/09 by Michael Shawn Winte\u0014",

His name is \none of those iconic words, like socialism, which people use without \nunderstanding what they are talking about. He has been accused of \noppression, intolerance and rigidity, and indeed he had strong \nopinions. But these accusations judge him against idealistic, not \neven realistic, modern standards, with no historic context.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin wanted to be a Priest in the Roman Catholic Church, but was \nappalled by the lack of honesty, integrity and knowledge. He was a \nhumanist. Were he alive today, he would be reading Darwin, Marx, \nFreud and Einstein.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two pillars of the Protestant Reformation were Martin Luther and \nJohn Calvin. The Reformation did not begin with either of them, but \ntheir leadership laid lasting foundations for future intellectual \nevolution. The foundations of modern science were being established \nbut strongly resisted by the Roman Catholic Church. These Reformers \nlaid the foundation for the triumph of empirical rationality in the \n18th century, but they were groping their way toward a more rational \nfuture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe objection of both Luther and Calvin was not the church's \nrejection of empirical science, but its utter corruption: selling \ncertificates of forgiveness to finance the magnificent buildings in \nRome, and selling of church offices.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout Calvin\u0014\n\u0014\nThough traditional theologically, Calvin was not a fundamentalist. He \ndid not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, but that the \nauthority of the Bible was self authenticating, and became the Word \nof God when properly preached. He did not believe in \nsubstitutionary atonement, in which God had to sacrifice Jesus \nto pay for the debts of all humanity. Such an idea would imply a \nlimitation on the freedom of God. Calvin did not know much about \nbiology so the virgin birth was not an issue for him, nor the \nresurrection, but his view of the book of Revelation as \ninsufficiently important that he did not write a commentary on it \nspeaks for itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin affirmed the sovereignty of God  not the sovereignty of the \nRoman Catholic Church, nor the Kings of France and England, nor would \nhe be impressed by the claim for the sovereignty of the United \nStates. He was more concerned about integrity, honesty, justice and \nresponsibility than political power. He believed God was \ntranscendent, and that we could not know God directly. Certainly we \ncould not put God in a school, nor take God out of a school. We could \nknow God, he believed, by understanding the obedience of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvinism's effect\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin never denied that the Roman Church, nor his Lutherans friends \nin German-speaking countries were authentic churches, but insisted \nthat there was only one Catholic and Universal Church, implying that \nany modification of the term Catholic compromised its universality. \nRather the Reformed and Lutheran churches are not just 500 years old \nbut participate equally, and correct, the evolutionary history of \nChristianity, as may the denominations based in Rome and Greece.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, no other theological tradition has declared as doctrine: \nChurches err.\u0014\nIs there any doubt that those countries where Calvinism has had \ninfluence are among the countries which have had more closely \napproximated democracy  Switzerland, France, Holland, Scotland, \nEngland, The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand? Yet, \nthere is need for a new Reformation which goes to the core of \naffirmation of justice and mercy, without the stultifying debates \nabout correct theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, Calvin would not be preaching salvation from an angry, \npunitive God, but would note that the word salvation comes from a \nroot meaning healing, and would declare that God has already healed \nus. He would affirm that we should love our neighbor as ourselves, \nand that our neighbor may even be a fundamentalist Muslim. He would \naffirm that God's word cannot be in contradiction to honest science \nwhich is the description of God's creation. And he would remind of us \nJesus' sermon as described in Luke 6: 17- 26: Blessed be ye poor, \nfor yours is the democracy of God... Blessed are ye that hunger now, \nfor ye shall be filled... But woe unto you that are rich! ...Woe to \nyou that are full! For ye shall hunger; Woe unto you that laugh now! \nFor ye shall mourn and weep...\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Harrison is a clinical psychologist working with Skyland \nBehavioral Health Associates.

    "words": "Cohabiting Couples on the Rise\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cultural trend isn't going away anytime soon. How should the \nchurch respond?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Christine A. Scheller\u0014\n\u0014\nA new national study suggests that the trend toward cohabiting \ncontinues its forward march for young adults, many of whom still \nexpect to marry someday. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than three-quarters of 20- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. said they \nbelieve that love, fidelity, and making a lifelong commitment are \nvery important to a successful relationship. Women, predictably, \naspire to marriage at significantly higher rates than men. Perhaps \nless predictably, married young adults tend to have negative views of \nliving together with no intent to marry, even though (or perhaps \nbecause) more than half of them have cohabited themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2008, the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University \npublished Cohabitation, Marriage and Child Well-being, a report in \nwhich sociologist David Popenoe traces the history of cohabitation \nback through the sexual revolution. He concludes, \u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be obvious . . . that in an era of relatively unrestricted \npremarital sex, women in the work place, delayed marriage, and high \nmarital breakup, there is a profound logic  almost an inevitability \n about the practice of living together before marriage. What are the \nalternatives? Either marriage at a young age (not a good idea \nbecause, among other reasons, it limits access to higher education \nand is associated with a much higher risk of divorce), no sex before \nmarriage (hard to imagine reinstituting this social norm across the \npopulation), or sleeping around rather than living with one sex \npartner (not good for a variety of reasons). It seems likely, \ntherefore, that non-marital cohabitation is a practice that is not \ngoing away anytime soon.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopenoe, former co-chair of the Council on Families in America, and \nauthor most recently of Families Without Fathers, doesnt view this \nstate of affairs as neutral. Not only is cohabitation demonstrably \nbad for children, he says, Cohabiting partners tend to have a weaker \nsense of couple identity, less willingness to sacrifice for the \nother, and a lower desire to see the relationship go long term. This \nholds true even in nations where cohabitation has become common and \ninstitutionalized.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopenoe's conclusions corroborate those of a study published in the \nJournal of Family Psychology this February. It found that cohabiting \ncouples often end up marrying for all the wrong reasons, such as a \njoint lease and shared ownership of household items.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopenoe sees little hope of reversing the trend apart from a broad \ncultural shift, reflected in the hearts and minds of the citizenry.\u0014",

    "words": "No story of an Anabaptist martyr has captured the imagination more \nthan the tale of Dirk Willems.\u0014\nDirk was caught, tried and convicted as an Anabaptist in those later \nyears of harsh Spanish rule under the Duke of Alva in The \nNetherlands. He escaped from a residential palace turned into a \nprison by letting himself out of a window with a rope made of knotted \nrags, dropping onto the ice that covered the castle moat. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeeing him escape, a palace guard pursued him as he fled. Dirk \ncrossed the thin ice of a pond, the \"Hondegat,\" safely. His own \nweight had been reduced by short prison rations, but the heavier \npursuer broke through. \u0014\n\u0014\nHearing the guard's cries for help, Dirk turned back and rescued him. \nThe less-than-grateful guard then seized Dirk and led him back to \ncaptivity. This time the authorities threw him into a more secure \nprison, a small, heavily barred room at the top of a very tall church \ntower, above the bell, where he was probably locked into the wooden \nleg stocks that remain in place today. Soon he was led out to be \nburned to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome inhabitants of present-day Asperen, (Holland) none of them \nMennonite, regard Dirk as a folk hero. A Christian, so compassionate \nthat he risked recapture in order to save the life of his drowning \npursuer, stimulates respect and memory. Recently Asperen named a \nstreet in Dirk's honor.\u0014\n \u0014\nJohn S. Oyer and Robert Kreider, Mirror of the Martyrs [Good Books, \n1990], p. 36-37.\u0014",

    "words": "Today, heresy is hardly an operative term in Protestant church life, \nbut in Calvin's day to deny the Trinity was tantamount to committing \ntreason against the basic foundation of society itself. Servetus was \na hunted man all over Europe. He had been burned in effigy by the \nCatholics before he was burned in reality by the Protestants, and it \ncould just as easily have been the other way around. Calvin believed \nthat the civil magistrate was the custodian of both tables of the law \nand should punish heresy, blasphemy, and idolatry no less than \nmurder, theft, and perjury. Roger Williams, a 17th-century Calvinist \nwho preached and practiced religious liberty in early Rhode Island, \ndenied the state any role in compelling obedience to the first table \nof the law, securing a firmer basis for freedom of conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin worked with a more medieval understanding of the unitary \nnature of society and thus limited the degree of liberty he was \nwilling to concede to religious dissenters. We can note that the \nGenevan officials who condemned Servetus to death were actually \nCalvin's opponents, not his henchmen. We can also point out that \nreligious persecution was commonplace in Calvin's century: Mary Tudor \nsent hundreds of Protestants to their deaths in England, thousands of \nHuguenots were killed in the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, and \nmany more Dutch Calvinists were slain by the Duke of Alva.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll this is true, but the fact remains that Calvin should have known \nbetter. The logic of his own thinking could and should have led him \nto agree with Sebastian Castellio, his sometime friend and later \ncritic, who declared: \"To kill a man is not to defend a doctrine; it \nis to kill a man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2009 Christianity Today.

Hengel's work surveys material on \ncrucifixion from all parts of the ancient world. In doing so he \nreveals that for the people of the ancient world, Greeks, Romans, \nbarbarians and Jews, crucifixion was not something you treated \nlightly or glossed over. It was absolutely obscene and wasn't \nreferred to in polite company. That Christians could claim that the \nSon of God was crucified would have been not just outrageous, but \noffensive. While parts of this book are quite technical (especially \nin Hengel's use of ancient languages) it is helpful in restoring our \nsense of just what an astonishing thing God has done through Christ. \nIn a world where the symbol of a cross has become quite commonplace, \nand even something we might wear as jewellery, this book helps to \nchange your perspective.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho would've known that there was so much information about this \nancient method of torture? Before happening upon this scholarly gem, \nI didn't think that any such work existed. Hengel does a great job of \npresenting much information about the crucifixion and the \ndifficulties that it presented to the early fathers of the church. \nSurely it was a difficult thing to present such a gospel about a man \nwho they claimed to be God and died the most humiliating and \ndisgraceful death, but they did so regardless. I would absolutely \nrecommend this work if you are looking for a book that addresses \nvirtually all questions about crucifixion.\u0014",

But days into the \nstandoff, Oscar Osorio, a Bellavista convict who became a prison \nchaplain, gathered a handful of Christian volunteers associated with \nChuck Colson's Prison Fellowship International. Singing hymns and \ncarrying white flags, Osorio and his volunteers marched in procession \nthrough the prison gates, unsure if their lives would be spared. \nOsorio found the prison's public address system was still working, so \nthe chaplain boldly called prisoners to repentance. Stunning prison \nauthorities, the inmates laid down their weapons. The riot was over. \nBut more than that, the killing stopped and the gospel swept through \nBellavista like a holy fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, evangelicals have embraced Bellavista as an important \nplace to help Colombians practice mutual forgiveness and achieve \nreconciliation. \"Every day all over the prison we have 500 inmates \nmeeting at 6 a.m. for discipleship,\" said Jeannine Brabon who heads \nPrison Fellowship in the Medellin region. \"Evenings are devoted to \nworship, and weekends to evangelizing family members and friends who \ncome to visit.\" Seeing the inmates' desire for deeper Bible training, \nJeannine helped to start the Bellavista Bible Institute in 1991. \nInmates who move on to a higher level of training attend classes \ntaught by Jeannine or seminary students.

Peter Hullermann: that he stay away \nfrom young people and alcohol and be supervised by another priest at \nall times.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Huth said he issued the explicit warnings  both written and oral \n before the future pope, then Joseph Ratzinger, archbishop of Munich \nand Freising, left Germany for a position in the Vatican in 1982. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1980, after abuse complaints from parents in Essen that the priest \ndid not deny, Archbishop Ratzinger approved a decision to move the \npriest to Munich for therapy. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the psychiatrists warnings, Father Hullermann was allowed to \nreturn to parish work almost immediately after his therapy began, \ninteracting with children as well as adults. Less than five years \nlater, he was accused of molesting other boys, and in 1986 he was \nconvicted of sexual abuse in Bavaria. \u0014\n\u0014\nBenedicts deputy at the time, Vicar General Gerhard Gruber, said he \nwas to blame for that personnel decision, referring to what he called \nserious mistakes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe psychiatrist said in an interview that he did not have any direct \ncommunications with Archbishop Ratzinger and did not know whether or \nnot the archbishop knew about his warnings. Though he said he had \nspoken with several senior church officials, Dr. Huths main contact \nat the time was a bishop, Heinrich Graf von Soden-Fraunhofen, who \ndied in 2000.\u0014",

The reports said fellow climbers struggled to \nhelp him down but risked putting themselves in danger and had to \nleave him in the early morning and retreat to camp below.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the risks climbers face, aside from the various effects of \noxygen deprivation, are high-altitude retinal hemorrhaging, or small \nareas of bleeding in the eye, and snow blindness, or burning of the \ncornea by ultraviolet rays.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not clear what happened to Kinloch. Some British media said he \nhad suffered temporary blindness in the past, but not when \nmountaineering.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The geography of the area is very complicated, and the weather is \noften bad.

I found it in a commemorative book called Marney, put out by \nMyers Park Baptist Church after he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf entering now the zenith of my brief arc around and within creation \nI should enter Gods grand hall tomorrow, called to my account for \nmyself, I should offer this confession and defense if indeed I could \ndo more than call down. But if able to give vocal response at all, I \nshould say this, Thou knowest, dear Lord of our lives, that for \nfifty of Thy/my years in ignorance, zest, zeal and sin I lived as if \ncreation and I had no limit. I lived and wanted as if I had forever, \nwithout regard for time or wit or strength or need or limit or \nendurance and as if sleep were a heedless luxury and digestion an \nautomatic process. But Thou, O Lord of real love did snatch my bit \nand ride me into Thy back pasture and didst rub my nose in my \nvulnerability and didst split my lungs into acquiescence and didst \nfreeze my colon in grief loss and didst press me into that long \ndepression at the anger I directed against myself. And Thou didst \nread over my shoulder my diary of that long journey when I did melt \nbefore Thee as a mere preacher. Thou didst hear. \u0014\n\u0014\nHear now my pitiable defense. In all my sixty years I killed no \ncreature of Thine I did not need for food except for a few \nrattlesnakes, a turtle or two, two quail I left overlong in my coat \nand three geese poisoned on bad grain before I shot them in Nebraska, \nplus one wood duck in Korea. In all my years I consciously battered \nno child though my own claimed much need to forgive me. And \nconsciously misused no person. Thou knowest my aim to treat no human \nbeing as thing, never to hate overlong, to pass no child without \ncatching his or her eye and my innermost wish to love as Thou doest \nlove by seeing no shade of color or class. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Thou didst long ago hear my cry to let me go from Paducah. Thou \nknowest my covenant with Elizabeth in our youth and Thou knowest it \nhas been kept better than my covenant with Thee and wilst Thou \nforgive? Indeed Thou hast. \u0014\n\u0014\nHear now my intention with grace as if it were fact. I do and have \nintended to be responsible in creation by covenant and where I have \ndefaulted do Thou forgive. Forgive Thou my vicarious responsibility \nfor all the defection from Thy purpose of all Thy responsible \ncreatures and accept this my admission of utter dependency on Thy \nmercy.\u0014\n\u0014\nNaked I came into the world, how I am dressed at the conclusion makes \nno difference. A pair of jeans or a Glasgow robe, it makes no \ndifference. Meantime, well I mow, I cut wood for winter, I clean \ndrainage ditches, I preach what is happening and look to see what God \nwill do in the earth. I watch out always for babies and little \nrabbits in front of my mower and old folks nearby and black snakes \nworth preserving, and little puppies on the road, and the young-old \nwho stutter and laugh and cant hear too.

And so he had his soldiers transfer \nthe condemned man to Newgate Prison around midnight. Despite the \ngovernment's attempt at secrecy and the late hour, thousands of the \ngood man's supporters lined the way. There was no riot.\u0014\n\u0014\nA rumor sped through the streets that John would be burned to death \nat 4 a.m. the next morning. Indignant crowds gathered before the \ncrack of dawn, filling the streets around Smithfield, the place of \nexecution. Among them were Catholics, outraged because the charges \nagainst the Protestant preacher were so obviously trumped up.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Mary, the Catholic queen, had ascended the English throne after \nthe death of Protestant Edward VI, she immediately took steps to \nrestore the Roman Church. Some of the Catholic preachers were not \nwell received. One named Bourne had a dagger hurled at him when he \nspoke. Terrified, Bourne asked John to calm the crowd. John did so \nand shielded Bourne with his own body. After rebuking the mob, John \nBradford and John Rogers led the trembling Bourne to safety.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You save him that will help to burn you!\" warned one of Bourne's \nenemies. And that is what happened. Three days later the crown \naccused John Bradford, the man who had helped calm the situation and \nwho had saved Bourne's life, with trying to stir up the mob! John was \nimprisoned in the tower of London.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the tower, the tender-hearted preacher studied his Bible daily and \npreached often to the other prisoners. He shared his money with them. \nWhen he saw thieves and murderers taken to the gallows, he would say, \n\"But for the grace of God, there goes John Bradford.\" He was so \ntrusted by the jailor that the man actually let him out twice to tend \nto religious needs, simply on the strength of his word. John always \nhurried back before the promised time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn prison, John wrote constantly--letters and sermons. The Earl of \nDerby complained \"that he has done more hurt [to Mary's cause] by \nletters, and by exhorting those that have come to him in religion, \nthan ever he did, when he was abroad, by preaching.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith soldiers lining the way on this day, July 1, 1555, John was led \nto his death. He asked permission to give his clothes to his poor \nservant. It was all he had left. That done, he was bound to one side \nof the stake and another Protestant witness, John Lease on the other \nside. John Bradford turned to his partner and said \"Be of good \ncomfort brother; for we shall have a merry supper with the Lord this \nnight!\" He prayed to be worthy of the Lord in death and quoted \nChrist's words, \"Strait is the way, and narrow is the gate that leads \nto eternal salvation, and few there be that find it.\" Soon afterward, \nhe was in eternity. \u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical churchman J.

On this day, July 27, 1681, he put on his new suit.\u0014\n\u0014\nA scottish preacher, he suffered persecution when he refused to \naccept the episcopal form of church government (bishop run churches) \nthat London tried to impose on Scotland. Scotland was Presbyterian \n(elder run). Thousands in Scotland signed their names to covenants in \nwhich they promised to uphold the faith of their fathers. Some fought \nfor it. Donald took part in the disorganized Battle at Bothwell \nBridge at which the king's forces defeated the Scottish rebels, but, \nalthough wounded, he escaped.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a famous sermon, he \"excommunicated\" King Charles II and his \ncounselors, saying, \"The Church ought to declare that those who are \nnone of Christ's are none of hers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch actions marked him as a wanted man. Several times he was almost \ncaptured. One such instance took place at Queensferry. An agent of \nthe king, praised Donald and expressed a desire to meet with him to \ndrink to his health. When Donald appeared, the agent pretended \nfriendship but then arrested Donald and Henry Hall. The men struggled \nto escape. Hall was mortally wounded. Donald also was wounded, but \ngot away. Despite his injuries, he preached the following Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWandering in exile, he often preached openly in the Scottish \nlowlands, but at other times, he was forced to stay hidden. Highland \nclansmen hunted for Donald and other Covenanters, because they had \nbeen promised bounties for the capture of such \"rebels.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe law caught up with Donald at Lanarkshire in May 1681. Heas \ncruelly treated and hauled to jail with his feet tied tightly under a \nhorse's belly. Convicted of high treason in Edinburgh, he was \ncondemned to be hanged and beheaded.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of his sermons, Donald had said, \"If believers loved Christ as \nHe loves them, they would be more in haste to meet Him.\" That spirit \ncaused him to die bravely. As he mounted the ladder to be hanged, he \nsaid, \"The Lord knows, I go up this ladder in less fear and perturbed \nof mind that ever I entered the pulpit to preach... Farewell, all \nrelations and friends in Christ; farewell all acquaintances and all \nearthly enjoyments; farewell reading and preaching, praying and \nbelieving, wanderings, reproaches and sufferings. Welcome joy \nunspeakable and full of glory. Welcome Father, Son and Holy Ghost. \nInto thy hands I commit my spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the Covenanters, Donald was a martyr for the faith that many Scots \nhad vowed to uphold. But to those Scots who had accommodated the \nreigning powers, he seemed a radical and a traitor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nCargile, John. \"Donald Cargill, a Scottish martyr.\" The Highlander. \nhttp://www.angelfire.com/al/ metaphysicsgalore/Cargile.html\u0014\n\"Covenanters Memorial, the.\" http://www.maybole.org/history/books/ \nplacesofinterest/covenanters.htm\u0014\n\"Donald Cargill.\" http://www.freechurch.org/fair/fairc.htm\u0014\n\"Donald Cargill.\" Significant Scots. \nhttp://www.electricscotland.com/history/ other/cargill_donald.htm\u0014\nSmellie, Alexander.

    "words": "Healthy conflict is one of the most effective means for a church to \ngrow deeper in its understanding of spiritual truth that God sends us.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, when conflict overwhelms the mission of the church \nand becomes the primary way we experience congregational life, it has \nbecome far too pervasive and needs intervention and healing.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing when we have reached that point is always a difficult call.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there are some warning signs that indicate you have crossed \nthe boundary from healthy conflict into unhealthy and destructive \nbehavior. Here are some simple things to look for that suggest the \nneed for help with managing conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. People change in the way they interact with one another. You begin \nto sense suspicion, avoidance, coolness, eye rolling and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. There are significant or sudden decreases in general budget giving \nor increases in designated giving.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. There are significant or sudden decreases in volunteerism or \nattendance at particular events.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Small groups begin to meet in private to discuss church-related \nissues.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. There is orchestration or coordination of meetings or voting, \nincluding meetings before the meeting or after the meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. You experience the dreaded e-mail or telephone campaigns.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. You see disproportionate responses to stimuli. This overreaction \ntakes the form of anger, frustration or conflict that emerges over \nwhat were previously insignificant issues.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. There are unexpectedly high turnouts for business or informational \nmeetings.\u0014\n\u0014\n9. You sense a steady increase in criticism of pastor, staff or lay \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n10. There is growing polarization within the congregation. Members \nbegin using \"we\" and \"they\" language.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you see these indicators, it is time to act.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAn essential ingredient in any congregation's successful navigation \nof intense conflict is the use of objective guidance. When severe \nconflict visits a congregation, outside counsel is indispensible. \nWhile in the midst of congregational conflict, one's vision and \nperspective become clouded by subjectivity. It often takes someone \nlooking from the outside into a congregational system to see the path \nout of the conflict. If you can find a trusted and mature guide for \nthat journey, the chances of emerging from a season of conflict \nintact increase significantly.\u0014\n\u0014\n----Bill Wilson\u0014",

Neither science\u0014\nnor evolution caused Darwin to reject\u0014\nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, bad religion caused Darwin to\u0014\nbecome an atheist.

She later \nclaimed that she was resigning from her radio show \"to regain\" her \nFirst Amendment rights, asserting that criticism of her foul mouth \nwas an abridgment of her right to free speech. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat claim, of course, wasn't truthful. The government had not \nrestrained her trash talk. Her First Amendment rights had not been \nbreached. Individuals had rightly criticized her for using the N-word.\u0014\n\u0014\nMissing an opportunity to give a Christian witness to a dirty mouth, \nSarah Palin tweeted advice to Schlessinger: \"Don't retreat...reload!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, misstate the nature of what you did and keep up the \ntrash talk. \u0014\n\u0014\nA prominent politician, former White House chief of staff Rahm \nEmanuel, got in hot water earlier this year for using the phrase \n\"f------ retarded.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEmanuel's potty mouth is well known. In a reference to his interest \nin running for mayor of Chicago, Newsweek asked, \"Can he keep potty \nmouth in check?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Obama referred to Emanuel's problem at a 2009 political \ndinner. In a failed attempt at humor, Obama said that \"for Rahm, \nevery day is a swearing-in ceremony.\" The president said, \"Every week \nthis guy takes a little time away to give back to the community. Just \nlast week he was at a local school teaching profanity to poor \nchildren.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEmanuel apparently thinks that cussing enhances his stature, his \nauthority, when it really discloses his lack of self-control and his \nrespect for others. Maybe it says something about his arrogance  \ndecent language doesn't apply to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, self-control and respect are virtues banished from TV \nsitcoms, America's open-air sewers for trash talk. TV and movie \nproducers evidently think that reality necessitates profanity because \ntheir reality is so profane, so vulgar.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegrettably, profanity is not reserved for the irreligious. Emerging \nchurch leader Mark Driscoll is known as the cussing pastor. A \nSouthern Baptist Convention agency head used a gutter word to \ndescribe a Jewish U.S. senator at Criswell College, a Dallas Bible \nschool. A Christian ethics professor at Duke University, Stanley \nHauerwas, prides himself on profanity, and his disciples defend him \nwith the lame excuse that he was raised to cuss.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoul language in the public square has become a crippling epidemic. \nPretending it isn't a problem is intellectually dishonest and morally \nnaive.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting to the earliest Christians, James lamented that the human \ntongue was \"a restless evil, full of deathly poison\" with which we \nboth bless God and curse those \"made in the likeness of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n----Robert Parham, Ethics Daily\u0014",

No one can accurately predict what the future \nholds. All we can do is take the present trajectory and project out a \nfew years. \u0014\nHere are 10 predictions and observations I want to share with you:\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 1. The New Baptist Covenant in the fall of 2011 might be our last \nopportunity to create a nationwide, diverse, multi-ethnic Baptist \ngroup meeting like the Triennial Convention of the 1800s. Jimmy \nCarter is using his influence to bring the group back together after \na successful event in 2008. We will need to institutionalize this \neffort for it to have a future.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 2. Liberty University has become the image of Baptist \ninstitutional higher education. It might be defining \"evangelical\" \nhigher education as well. At least it is working hard toward that \ngoal. Liberty is also beginning to dominate Southern Baptist \nConvention (SBC) life. Watch its presence grow in this next decade. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 3. In Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF) life, watch North \nCarolina. The theological discussions are becoming testy and worthily \nso. Do we in CBF life need to be a theological subculture in the U.S. \nreligious scene or seek to stay in the mainstream? If Larry Hovis, \nexecutive director of the North Carolina Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship, can steer their ship through this process, we will need \nhim leading the national effort in the next few years. I have known \nhim for nearly 25 years, and I trust him immensely.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 4. Hopefully, environmental concerns and the environmentalist \nmovement will help change our perspective in Baptist life away from \n\"bigger is better\" to sustainability and carbon footprints. Maybe we \ncan start looking at \"quality of investment\" when distributing our \nBaptist dollars.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 5. Those who oppose women in leadership will lose on this one. \nWomen are now in the majority  sometimes overwhelmingly so  in most \nsectors of society. Churches will follow.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 6. The controversy with Calvinism has not come to full fruition \nyet in SBC life. It is still building. Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary is leading the way and effectively creating a network of SBC \nelites.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 7. Ed Young Jr., Joel Osteen and Jonathan Falwell have all proven \nthat charismatic leaders can be replaced and their children can \noftentimes exceed the elders.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 8. Thomas Road Baptist Church and Saddleback Community Church are \nvying for the role of the most influential local congregation in the \ncountry. It is interesting that both consider themselves Baptist. I \ndon't think that is by mistake.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 9. We Baptists in the South descended from converted \nCongregationalists like Roger Williams. E.Y. Mullins is our most \nsignificant theologian, one which Al Mohler of Southern Baptist \nTheological Seminary is working extremely hard to erase from SBC's \nhistory. Any historical analysis of our kind of Baptist that \ndiminishes either of these two individuals does a disservice to our \nheritage and the analysis.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 10. I've discovered recently that life really is about the \njourney and who is on it with you more so than what you can \naccomplish. I have loved being with the folks at Baptist Heritage \nCouncil. It has been a great group throughout these 14 years. \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Key is director of Baptist Studies at Emory University. This \narticle was reprinted from Baptist Heritage Council of Georgia.\u0014",

    "words": "November 4, 1891 \u0014\nCharles A. Briggs Called on Heresy\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIs the Bible the inspired word of God? Throughout history the church \nhas answered yes. But in the nineteenth century, Julius Wellhausen, a \nGerman history professor, claimed that virtually the entire Old \nTestament was a forgery. There never had been a tabernacle. Moses, if \nhe existed at all, was the spokesman for a local mountain god and \nprobably worshipped a piece of rock. Israelite religion had evolved \nfrom such simple beginnings. The Bible was a fusion of several \nearlier documents heavily edited by priests to establish their own \npower and influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Augustus Briggs studied theology in Germany when Wellhausen's \nideas were at their height. Briggs returned to the United States \nconfirmed in a belief that the Bible was full of errors. While it \ncontained the germ of inspiration, it was not verbally inspired he \nthought.\u0014\n\u0014\nBriggs was appointed head of a newly endowed Department of Biblical \nTheology at Union Seminary in New York. In his inauguration speech on \nJanuary 20, 1891, he openly attacked the Bible. \"There is nothing \ndivine in the text--in its letters, words, or clauses,\" he said. \nHigher Criticism had found errors, he said, and we must meet them.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnion Seminary was friendly to Briggs's ideas. The General Assembly \nof the Presbyterian Church was not. In a hearing they refused his \nappointment. Consequently, Union Seminary broke from the Assembly. \nThe New York Presbytery appointed a committee to consider Briggs's \ninaugural address. He refused to appear before them but made comments \nto the press saying the liberals would fight with all their might. \nThe committee decided Briggs must be tried. He was called to present \nhimself on this day, November 4, 1891.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his trial, Briggs changed tactics. Instead of defending \nWellhausen's theories, he apologized if he had caused any pain to his \ndenomination. He defended himself less on his ideas than by claiming \nthe charges against him were improperly filed under church rules. \nAlthough even one of his own allies declared that his final \nstatements \"could no more be squared with the Westminister Confession \nthan you could square a circle\" the New York Presbytery exonerated \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years later, the General Assembly excommunicated Briggs, \ndeclaring his views heretical, . Looking back we can see that Briggs \nabandoned the bedrock of faith for a theory that turned out to be \nfalse. Within sixty years of the publication of Wellhausen's Higher \nCriticism, archaeology had debunked most of its key ideas. Few read \nthe entire work today. Meanwhile, he did much damage to men of weak \nfaith such as Briggs. Repair of the damage has not been obtained to \nthis day.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Briggs, Charles Augustus.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "words": "Clarence Jordan was a man of unusual abilities and commitment. He had \ntwo Ph.D.s, one in agriculture and one in Greek and Hebrew. So gifted \nwas he, he could have chosen to do anything he wanted. He chose to \nserve the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1940s,  he founded a farm in Americus, Georgia, and called it \nKoinonia Farm. It was a community for poor whites and poor blacks. As \nyou might guess, such an idea did not go over well in the Deep South \nof the '40s. Ironically, much of the resistance came from good church \npeople who followed the laws of segregation as much as the other folk \nin town. The town people tried everything to stop Clarence. They \ntried boycotting him, and slashing workers' tires when they came to \ntown. Over and over, for fourteen years, they tried to stop him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, in 1954, the Ku Klux Klan had enough of Clarence Jordan, so \nthey decided to get rid of him once and for all. They came one night \nwith guns and torches and set fire to every building on Koinonia Farm \nbut Clarence's home, which they riddled with bullets. And they chased \noff all the families except one black family which refused to leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence recognized the voices of many of the Klansmen, and, as you \nmight guess, some of them were church people. Another was the local \nnewspaper's reporter. The next day, the reporter came out to see what \nremained of the farm. The rubble still smoldered and the land was \nscorched, but he found Clarence in the field, hoeing and planting.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I heard the awful news,\" he called to Clarence, \"and I came out to \ndo a story on the tragedy of your farm closing.\" Clarence just kept \non hoeing and planting. The reporter kept prodding, kept poking, \ntrying to get a rise from this quietly determined man who seemed to \nbe planting instead of packing his bags. So, finally, the reporter \nsaid in a haughty voice, \"Well, Dr. Jordan, you got two of them \nPh.D.s and you've put fourteen years into this farm, and there's \nnothing left of it at all. Just how successful do you think you've \nbeen?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence stopped hoeing, turned toward the reporter with his \npenetrating blue eyes, and said quietly but firmly, \"About as \nsuccessful as the cross. Sir, I don't think you understand us. What \nwe are about is not success but faithfulness. We're staying. Good \nday.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning that day, Clarence and his companions rebuilt Koinonia and \nthe farm is going strong today.\u0014\nIn 1969, Clarence Jordan died of a heart attack. None of the local \nfuneral directors were \u0014\nwilling to help with his funeral -- out of either prejudice or fear \nof violence -- so he ended \u0014\nup being buried in a plain cedar box on an unmarked gravesite on a \nhillside near his farm. The actual site is unknown to this day.\u0014",

    "title": "CAN SCHOLARS TAKE THE VIRGIN BIRTH SERIOUSLY?",
    "words": "The textual, philosophical and theological arguments about the Virgin \nbirth are so clear (refined by centuries of reasoning), and for many \nso persuasive, that those who doubt the reality of a biological \nvirgin birth are often accused of heresy, and charged with (1) \ndoubting or tampering with biblical (New Testament) truth; (2) \nplacing more confidence in the seeming laws of nature than in the \npower of God; and (3) refusing to believe in the salvation achieved \nand revealed through and in Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern doubts about the virgin birth are different only in their \nmagnitude. Jews have never believed in the virgin birth of Jesus; \nthey suffered for their lack of belief during the Inquisition \n(especially in Spain). Michael Servetus, who was burned at the stake \nin Calvin's Geneva (1553), judged Jesus to be worthy but in no sense \nuniquely God's son. Thomas Paine, the American patriot whose writing \nskills and political pamphlets helped fan the fires of the American \nRevolution, wrote in 1794:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When ? I am told that a woman called the Virgin Mary, said, or gave \nout, that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man, and \nthat her betrothed husband, Joseph, said that an angel told him so; I \nhave a right to believe them or not; such a circumstance requires a \nmuch stronger evidence than their bare word for it; but we have not \neven thisfor neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matters \nthemselves; it is only reported by others that they said soit is \nhearsay upon hearsay, and I do not choose to rest my belief upon such \nevidence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, the direction of modern biblical scholarship has not \nbeen determined by such simplistic and naturalistic thinkinghowever \ncleverly stated (and Paine was clever). For academically serious New \nTestament scholars, however, certain questions about the virgin birth \nmust be answered.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did Matthew and Luke come upon these stories? The accounts of the \nvirgin birth obviously raise this question. Matthew's answer would \nseem to consist of appeals to texts in the Hebrew Bible, not to \ncontemporary reports or evidence. He believes that the Jewish \nScriptures reliably foretell details in the life of the coming \nMessiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, is the Hebrew Bible a dependable source of information about \nJesus? Matthew, especially, seems to think so, but in a way that is \nhardly reassuring. Matthew tells us (Matthew 1:23) that the virgin \nconception of Jesus was to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah \n7:14), which Matthew quotes as follows: \"Behold, a virgin shall \nconceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.\" But, \nactually, Isaiah does not say this. The Hebrew word Isaiah uses, \nalmah, means a \"young woman,\" with no reference to her sexual \nexperience. There is a Hebrew word for virgin (bethulah), but Isaiah \ndid not use it. The Septuagint (abbreviated LXX), a third-century \nB.C. Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, translates the \nHebrew almah (meaning a young woman) with the Greek word parthenos \n(which does mean virgin). Apparently, Matthew's access to his own \nscriptures was not through the original Hebrew, but through this \nGreek translation. Alternatively, Matthew may have known the \nscriptures in Hebrew but was using the LXX to accommodate his \nreaders, who were largely Greeks and Greek-speaking Jews of the \nDiaspora.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to not referring to a \"virgin,\" Isaiah's prophecy occurs \nin a historically specific context, dating to about 733 B.C. Isaiah \n7:1 describes the time in which his prophecy occurs:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, \nRezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of \nIsrael came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could \nnot conquer it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter predicting the failure of their threat to Jerusalem, Isaiah \nchallenges Judah's king Ahaz: \" 'Ask a sign of the Lord your God ?' \" \n(Isaiah 7:11). Ahaz refuses and asserts, \" ? 'I will not put the Lord \nto the test' \" (Isaiah 7:12). Isaiah then rebukes Ahaz, \" 'Is it too \nlittle for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore, \nthe Lord himself will give you a sign' \" (Isaiah 7:1314).\u0014\n\u0014\nThen immediately follows the prediction that a young woman will give \nbirth and bear a son named Emmanuel. Isaiah firmly ties the \nprediction of Emmanuel's birth to the threatened invasion by saying: \n\" 'For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the \ngood, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be \ndeserted' \" (Isaiah 7:16).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point is that Isaiah is simply not talking about what Matthew \nsays Isaiah is talking about, but rather about an event in Isaiah's \nown time.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Bible Review  04:05 Can Scholars Take the \nVirgin Birth Seriously?\u0014\nBy J.

    "words": "December 14, 1363 \u0014\n\u0014\nCatholic Reformer John Charlier of Gerson\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAs chancellor of the University of Paris, John Charlier of Gerson was \none of the most influential French churchmen at the end of the \nfourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries. Like two other \ncontemporaries named John--John Wycliffe and John Hus, he called for \nreform of the church. Unlike them, he was unwilling to overthrow \nvenerable establishments. Still, he wrote many things which sixteenth \ncentury reformers quoted.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was born on this day, December 14, 1363 in the French farming \ntown of Gerson. His parents were pious people and their faith took \nhold in each of the children. As the oldest son, John acted as a \nspiritual advisor to the others. His sisters eventually devoted \nthemselves to virginity and made a virtual nunnery out of the home, \npracticing good works from it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of John's birth, France's 100 Years' War with England was \ndrawing to a close. (John would write in defense of Joan of Arc \nagainst charges of sorcery and wearing a man's clothes.) France was \nin a mess because of the war and occupation. The church was in a mess \nbecause there were rival popes, each backed by different nations. \nThroughout the world, the church was corrupt. In too many instances, \nthe common people had better morals than the clergy. Groups who \nopposed Roman Catholicism were on the rise. In these trying times, \nJohn's motto was \"Do penance and believe the gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn challenged the top guns of the nation and church, too, pointing \nout that their corruption was the cause of the woes of France. \nAlthough he had been sponsored by the Duke of Burgundy, he \nnonetheless called for the duke's punishment after he arranged the \nassassination of the Duke of Orleans. John sought official \ncondemnation of a brand of theology which permitted murder of \ntyrants. Ironically, Burgundy, who defended the theology, was himself \nlater assassinated.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the start, John realized the importance of training the young if \nthere was to be real reform of the church. His ideal was to train \nthem to have faith in their hearts rather than just knowledge in the \nhead. He favored a mystical approach, pointing out that even young \nchildren and idiots with an inner knowledge of God can lead Christian \nlives whereas many intellectuals fail. And faith should be \nChrist-centered. In their studies, the universities should emphasize \nthose books which dealt with Christ more than those that dealt with \nthe nature and being of God. As for the people, they should gaze upon \nthe life of Christ, \"whose every act is for our instruction.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking to end the split in the church, John pleaded with both popes \nto step down. When they wouldn't, he decided it was better to break \nchurch law temporarily, by taking some steps without the pope's \napproval, than to allow the church to stay broken. He preached a \nstirring sermon which helped hold the Council of Constance together \nwhen it was about to collapse. Eventually, the council ended the \nsplit by declaring it had authority over popes, locking up Pope John \nXXIII and electing a new one. However, that same council burned John \nHus at the stake. John Gerson was a leader in condemning Hus.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering how much he had in common with Hus, how could this be? \nAlthough John Gerson gave Scripture an important place, he insisted \nthat only the church could interpret what the Bible really means. \nGenerally this was done through the universities--especially his own \nUniversity of Paris. Gerson said that for Hus to teach independently \nas he did undermined religious and political authority. Hus must die.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he had spoken out against the Duke of Burgundy, John had to \nlive in exile for two years. After the Duke's death, he returned to \nFrance, but kept out of the way of the Duke's followers by living in \nLyons. There he taught children and wrote devotional books.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nConnolly, James L. John Gerson, Reformer and Mystic.

He felt that Jews, with \ntheir crafts and financial skills, would boost the English economy. \nBecause it was considered wrong for Christians to engage in money \nlending, the role fell to the sons of Israel. In the years that \nfollowed, ruthless kings taxed Jews unmercifully, forcing them to \nraise the interest they charged on loans. This led to resentment on \nthe part of borrowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn outbreaks of anti-Semitism Jews were accused of blood rituals and \nmassacred. Their lending records were conveniently destroyed during \nthese outbreaks. In 1217, they were forced to wear yellow badges. By \n1290, they had been taxed so heavily that they were no longer of use \nto Edward I, who could, in any case, now do business with the Knights \nTemplars. Edward expelled the Jews from England.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor 365 years, it was illegal for an Israelite to live in England. A \nfew Marranos (Portuguese converts to Christianity) reentered the \ncountry in the early 1600s. The Marranos flourished and sought to \nchange the restrictive law.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel approached Oliver Cromwell with a \nseven-point plan in November 1655, the Protector determined to ask \nfor readmission of the Jews. He recognized their benefit to English \ncommerce and intelligence- gathering.\u0014\n\u0014\nCromwell asked his Council to decide the issue. The Council \nestablished a committee. The committee invited a number of ministers, \nmerchants and justices to help them with its decision. Between \nDecember 4 and 18th, this Conference met in Whitehall. Cromwell \nattended each session and expressed himself in favor of readmitting \nthe Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the members of the committee, including the clergy, resisted \nCromwell. However, two judges gave it as their opinion that the law \ndid not forbid Jews to settle in England.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy this day, December 14, 1655, it was evident the committee would \nnever come to a decision. On the 18th, Cromwell dismissed it, letting \nits members know that he intended to admit the Jews unofficially if \nnecessary. All the committee managed to do was to draw up a paper \nrecommending that if Jews were readmitted to England, they be \nprevented from defaming Christianity or working on the Lord's day. \nThey should not hold office, employ Christian servants or seek to \nconvert Christians to Judaism. None of this became law.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter that, the Semites came to England in increasing numbers. Their \npopulation has reached as many as a quarter of a million. For the \nmost part, Britain's Jews have been well-treated since 1656.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to scripture (Zachariah), whoever touches the Jews, touches \nthe apple of God's eye. Does this also mean that those who help the \nJews prosper? Jews have benefited Britain. Many served in Parliament \nand one, Benjamin Disraeli, became a notable Prime Minister. More to \nthe point, British Jews helped fulfill Bible prophecy. English Jews, \nsuch as Moses Montefiore, were strong supporters of the Zionist \nmovement which resettled Jews in Israel, and Chaim Weizmann, the \nfirst president of the state of Israel, was British.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAllen, John.

In 1992, the \ndeath penalty became mandatory upon conviction on blasphemy charges. \nSo far no one has been executed under the blasphemy law, but others \nhave languished in prison for up to 14 years without a trial. Up to \n10 others have been murdered while under investigation. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis week, Asia Bibi, a 45-year-old mother of five from the Punjab \nProvince, became the first woman ever sentenced to death under \nPakistan's blasphemy law. Bibi has already been imprisoned for over a \nyear. Pakistani officials make arrests based on a blasphemy \ncomplaint, and suspects are held during the investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police complaint against her said she called the Qur'an \"fake\" \nand made comments about one of Muhammads wives and his declining \nhealth late in life. The incident under investigation happened when \nBibi, a farm worker, brought water to her fellow female workers. \nApparently, the Muslim women refused to share water with a Christian, \ncalling it unclean. The Punjab is home to Pakistan's small \nChristian minority and has seen over 30 group incidents against \nChristians since September 11.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts hard to wrap my mind around a culture like that. Yet it sounds \nfamiliar because its much like the relationship between Jews and \nSamaritans in the Bible. Jesus addressed the Jews animosity toward \nthe Samaritans many times, not only with the Parable of the Good \nSamaritan, but when he asked  and received  a drink from the \nSamaritan woman (John 4:7-42). That was considered unclean contact, \nas well, but Jesus  who was in the majority group at the time  set \nan example by interacting with her. Of course, in the Bible, \nreligious persecution stops short with Jesus, which speaks of \nblasphemy but also tells us that judgment is in the hands of God, not \nhis people. Jesus became the persecuted while freeing others from it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPakistans population is 95 percent Muslim, and minority groups, \nincluding Christians, have often complained of discrimination by \ngovernment and society. Christian women are particularly vulnerable, \ndue to the countrys history of rape violence. (Pakistan passed the \nWomens Protection bill in 2006, intended to make charges of adultery \nfollowing rape less common.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The [blasphemy] laws are discriminatory and intended as such and are \nused for precisely that purpose, according to Ali Dayan Hasan, \nsenior South Asia analyst for Human Rights Watch. So, the issue is \nnot of their misuse but of the laws being on the statute books at \nall. Vague all-encompassing wording allows the laws to be used as an \ninstrument of political and social coercion, legal discrimination and \npersecution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pope, Pakistani women, one cabinet official, and Bibis husband \nhave all spoken out regarding Bibis case. Her family appealed the \nsentence, and Bibis husband, Ashiq Masih, denies that she ever \ninsulted Muhammad or Islamic scripture. Most alleged blasphemers have \nbeen released on appeal in the past. The question now is how long it \nwill be before Bibi is returned to her family. During the wait, Bibi \nwill need her faith to stay safe.\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted by Katelyn Beaty on November 19, 2010   Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "Lord, first of all, thank you for the careful and creative way in \nwhich you have designed this world. You have made this planet a \nmarvelous place, filled with life and beauty. It is a privilege to \nrecognize that we humans are a part of your amazing invention. \u0014\n\u0014\nHaving said that, it is necessary to also say we are sorry. We are \nsorry for our poor stewardship of the earth. We have not been very \ncareful with the air and the water. We have also not been very \ncareful with certain forms of life. We have acted as if ours were the \nonly existence that matters. Apparently we forgot what Jesus said \nabout you and the sparrows.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have also not been very good stewards of the resources that \nsustain life. Many of us living in the developed nations have become \na highly acquisitive people. It's almost as if we believe that the \npurpose of our humanity is to get our hands on as much stuff as \npossible. There are many who look to their earthly treasures as the \ntrue source of their security and meaning. You used the word \n\"idolatry\" to describe that kind of thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, our pursuit of things has also created a dismal state of \naffairs in our relationships. We've got it all backwards from what \nyou intended. Instead of loving people, as you taught, we use people \nto get what we want. Instead of using things to make life better, we \nlove things and cling to them as if they were life itself. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis tragic reversal has had dire consequences. Our greedy \nconsumption has created a world of poverty for millions  as our \nwealth grows, so does their poverty. And we keep fighting one bloody \nwar after another, taking the lives of your children, trying to \nprotect our stuff.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, that touches on one of our most difficult problems  our \nlove of violence. We treat violence in our culture as if it were a \nsacred rite. We believe in violence. We cherish it, we celebrate it. \nWe teach it to our children as if we were passing along a spiritual \nheritage. We have endowed violence with a trust and a hope that \nshould be reserved for you. We believe violence can conquer evil. We \nbelieve violence can make peace. We believe violence can end \nviolence. You would think that 50,000 years of human experience would \nconvince us otherwise, but not yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is why Christmas is so important. The birth of Jesus represents \nthe supreme effort on your part to reshape our flawed humanity back \ninto your own image. If we would only accept as true the things Jesus \nhad to say to us, what a different world this might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomewhere along the way this Christmas we will hear the words of the \nprophet Isaiah: \"A child shall lead them.\" We are drawn to the \ninnocence of the Nativity with a sense of wonder and longing. We \nbelieve that Jesus is that child.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he cannot lead us if we do not follow. And he cannot change us so \nlong as we insist on having things our own way.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelp us this year to finally admit that our way is not working and \nfor once, just for once, try doing things his way. Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans is pastor of Auburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, \nAla.\u0014",

    "words": "December 24, 1521 \u0014\nChristmas Eve\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nFor centuries, Christmas was celebrated not as a single day, but as a \nwhole season in parts of the world, beginning with this day, December \n24, Christmas Eve. Perhaps the practice of celebrating the evening \nbefore the big day is an echo from ancient Jewish reckoning. Among \nearlier Jews, a day began at six in the evening and ran until six the \nfollowing evening. Had not Moses written: \"An evening and a morning \nwere the first day\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas means \"Christ mass.\" Although the date is a guess, the \ntradition of observing it goes back to at least the fourth century. \nUnder the influence of the church, Christian traditions replaced \npagan solstice festivals throughout Europe. Often the more innocent \npagan practices (such as bringing in a Yule log, decorating with \nholly and the like) were carried over into the Christmas observance, \ntransfigured with new meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas Eve (the evening before Christmas day) was then celebrated \nwith roaring fires, story-telling, feasting, drinking, dancing, and \nsometimes clowning. Sir Walter Scott described its festive air in a \npoem: \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Eve, the bells were rung;\u0014\nOn Christmas Eve, the mass was sung. \u0014\n... \u0014\nThe damsel donned her kirtle sheen, \u0014\nthe hall was dressed with holly green; \u0014\n... \u0014\nAll hail'd with uncontroll'd delight, \u0014\nAnd general voice the happy night\u0014\nThat to the cottage, as the crown, \u0014\nBrought tidings of salvation down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThings weren't always so pleasant, however. On Christmas Eve, 1521, \nwith the Reformation gaining steam in Germany, crowds rioted in \nWittenberg. Against the orders of Elector Frederick, Andreas \nCarlstadt had given them both the bread and wine at mass. Zealous for \nmore \"reformation,\" the mob smashed church lamps, sang ridiculous \nsongs to drown out the choir and intimidated the priests.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther is supposed to have cut the first Christmas tree. The story \nmay be apocryphal, but we know that on Christmas Eve, 1538, he was in \na jolly mood, singing and talking about the incarnation. Then he \nsighed, saying, \"Oh, we poor men, that we should be so cold and \nindifferent to this great joy which has been given us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Luther's lament, others would make warm memories on Christmas \nEve. In his memoirs, Sir John Reresby told how he invited his poor \ntenants for a feast on Christmas Eve, 1682. During World War I, the \nfamous Christmas Truce began for many troops on Christmas Eve, 1914, \ndemonstrating the power for good that is inherent in the season.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

Instead, the 32-year-old Army veteran has less than six \nmonths left, which she'll spend spreading a stark warning: Judgment \nDay is almost here.\u0014\n\u0014\nExley is part of a movement of Christians loosely organized by radio \nbroadcasts and websites, independent of churches and convinced by \ntheir reading of the Bible that the end of the world will begin May \n21, 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo get the word out, they're using billboards and bus stop benches, \ntraveling caravans of RVs and volunteers passing out pamphlets on \nstreet corners. Cities from Bridgeport, Conn., to Little Rock, Ark., \nnow have billboards with the ominous message, and mission groups are \ntraveling through Latin America and Africa to spread the news outside \nthe United States.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A lot of people might think, 'The end's coming; let's go party,' \" \nsaid Exley, a veteran of two deployments in Iraq. \"But we're \ncommanded by God to warn people. I wish I could just be like \neverybody else, but it's so much better to know that when the end \ncomes, you'll be safe.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn August, Exley left her home in Colorado Springs, Colo., to work \nwith Oakland, Calif.-based Family Radio Worldwide, the independent \nChristian ministry whose leader, Harold Camping, has calculated the \nMay 21 date based on his reading of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe is organizing RVs carrying the message from city to city, a \nlogistical challenge that her military experience has helped solve. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe vehicles are scheduled to be in five North Carolina cities \nbetween now and the second week of January, but Exley will be gone \noverseas, where she hopes eventually to make it back to Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't really have plans to come back,\" she said. \"Time is short.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAllison Warden, 29, of Raleigh, has been helping organize a campaign \nusing billboards, postcards and other media in cities across the \nUnited States through a website, We Can Know.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about reactions to the message, which is plastered all over her \ncar, she laughs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's definitely against the grain.

    "title": "CONSTANTINE'S SWORD - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Constantine's Sword is a sprawling work of history, theology, and \npersonal confession by James Carroll (the author of {}An American \nRequiem, among many others). Carroll begins his landmark project by \ndescribing contemporary Catholic remembrances of the Holocaust and \nthe Church's intolerable legacy of hostility towards Jews. He then \nsurveys Catholic anti-Judaism beginning with the New Testament and \nproceeding through the early Church, the Crusades, the Inquisition, \nthe Enlightenment, and World War II, before concluding with \"A Call \nfor Vatican III,\" a Church council that would make meaningful \nrepentance for an entrenched tradition of hatred. Carroll's \nprescriptions for repentance, continued in a powerful epilogue, are \nbracingly concrete: \"there is no apology for Holy Week preaching that \nprompted pogroms until Holy Week liturgies, sermons, and readings \nhave been purged of the anti-Jewish slanders that sent the mobs \nrushing out of church.... Forgiveness for the sin of anti-Semitism \npresumes a promise to dismantle all that makes it possible.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCarroll's personal reflections as an American Catholic infuse his \nhistorical narrative, and although his reflections are sometimes \nunnecessarily detailed, they are admirable for the principle they \nexpress: \"I find myself unable to accuse my Church of any sin that I \ncannot equally accuse myself of,\" he writes. Carroll's judgments on \nthe Church are rightly harsh, even agonizing. And yet his vision for \na future rapprochement between Christians and Jews is hopeful, in \npart because he personally has come to understand the deep \nconnections between Israel and the Church: \"Jesus offers me, a \nnon-Jew, access to the biblical hope that was his birthright as a son \nof Israel.\" --Michael Joseph Gross\u0014\n\u0014\nPart history, part memoir, this hefty tome by novelist Carroll \n(Mortal Friends, etc.) traces the record of anti-Semitism and \nanti-Judaism in the Catholic Church, suggesting that centuries of \nanimus culminated in the Holocaust. Carroll also traces the \ndevelopment of his own thinking about Judaism: as a Catholic \nseminarian, he knew no Jews and little about Judaism, except what he \nlearned in classrooms, i.e., that Judaism had been superceded by \nChrist's new covenant. As a young priest at Boston U (which his \ncolleagues disparagingly referred to as B-Jew, since so many Jews \nwere enrolled), Carroll began to spend time with rabbis and Jewish \nstudents whose political and social commitments he found congenial. \nEventually he left the priesthood; his increased discomfort with the \nChurch's attitudes toward Judaism played no small part in that \ndecision. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this book is more than guilty Catholic breast-beating. It also \noffers a sweeping look at instances of anti-Jewish sentiment \nthroughout European history, from the blood libel to the Dreyfus \naffair, from the Inquisition to Auschwitz. Carroll offers fresh, \nprovocative analysis, as in his discussion of the idea that the God \nof the Jews is a judgmental God concerned with law, whereas Jesus is \nabout loveDa foundation of much anti-Semitism. Carroll argues that \nJesus' emphasis on love was his most Jewish attribute. Carroll makes \nthese incisive arguments in his characteristically vigorous prose; \nfans of An American Requiem, his National Book Award-winning memoir, \nwon't be disappointed. This magisterial work will satisfy Jewish and \nChristians readers alike, challenging both to a renewed conversation \nwith one another.\u0014",

    "words": "February 17, 1858 \u0014\n\u0014\nCause for Waldensian Rejoicing\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the evening of February 16th each year, jubilant Italians light \nbonfires on mountainsides in northern Italy. These are a harbinger of \njoyous worship services and festivities which fill the following day. \nThe Waldenses have reason to be glad. This day, February 17th, marks \nthe anniversary of the day in 1858 when they finally received a \nguarantee of civil and religious rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nRelief had been long in coming. The Waldensian saga began in 1176. A \nrich merchant, Peter Waldo, heard the words of Christ to the rich \nyoung ruler, \"If you would be perfect, go, sell what you posses and \ngive to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, \nfollow me.\" Waldo determined to do just that. He provided for his \nwife, placed his daughters in a nunnery, sold his property and \ndistributed it among the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first effort was to hire two priests to translate parts of the \nscriptures into French. Memorizing large portions of this, he began \nto preach among the people, urging them to imitate Christ's voluntary \npoverty. As quickly as he made followers he sent them out by twos \nwith the scriptures and his message of poverty. Disgusted with \nvoluptuous Rome, the Waldensians denounced virtually all Catholic \nfeasts as man made. They rejected the Catholic sacraments except \nabsolution, confession and Eucharist. Like the Quakers of later years \nthey refused to take oaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAltars, church buildings, holy water, indulgences and all the \nparaphanelia and trappings of the established church they renounced. \nThey denied purgatory. The local archbishop, stung by the implied \nrebuke, excommunicated Waldo. Waldo appealed to Pope Alexander III. \nAlexander was sympathetic and said Waldensians could preach with the \npermission of local bishops. To Waldo's regret, such permission was \nnot forthcoming.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith or without permission Waldo and his followers continued to \npreach, converting souls over a wide area. Waldensianism became one \nof the most widespread non-conformist group of the Middle Ages. Its \nadherents were excommunicated and butchered. For 682 years they fled \nacross Europe or hid in caves, persecuted, hunted, and exterminated \nlike vermin. With the coming of the Reformation, many joined the \nProtestants. Survivors gathered in 1561 and pledged themselves to \nadhere to the scriptures. Eventually they were reduced by persecution \nto only a few thousand individuals. Allowed refuge in Switzerland, \nthey pined for their homeland and in 1689 made a \"glorious return.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNot until the Italian revolutions of the mid-nineteenth century was \nthe remnant, now dwelling in alpine valleys of the north of Italy, \nguaranteed common rights. After centuries of savage persecution, it \nis little wonder that the Waldensians celebrate their relief with \nbonfires, services and festivities.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Waldenses.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

    "words": "Controversial Constantine\u0014\nThe famous emperor ended the persecution of Christians. But was he a \ntrue believer, or merely a superstitious political opportunist?\u0014\nDavid F. Wright is dean of the Faculty of Divinity at the University \nof Edinburgh.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday, July 1, 1990\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine has earned a place in history for many reasonsnot least \nbecause he brought to an end the persecutions of Christians by the \npagan Roman Empire. A concordat agreed to with his fellow emperor, \nLicinius, at Milan in 313 granted both to Christians and to all \nothers full authority to follow whatever worship each person has \ndesired. Every one of those who have a common wish to follow the \nreligion of the Christians may from this moment freely and \nunconditionally proceed to observe the same without any annoyance or \ndisquiet. In retrospect, the agreement forms one of the major \nwatersheds in the history of Christianity, bidding farewell to the \nage of the martyrs and presaging the era of the Christian Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat sort of man was he, this Constantine the Great, the first \nemperor of Rome to come out unambiguously on the side of the \nChristian church? How significant were the so-called Edict of Milan \nand the other actions he took as patron of the church? How truly \nChristian was he himself?\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Days\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine was born on February 27, probably in 272, in the military \ntown of Naissusmodern Nis in eastern Yugoslavia. His father, \nConstantius, was an army officer; his mother, Helena, was a woman of \nlowly origins whom Constantius later (probably by 290) found it \nprudent to divorce as his political aspirations took shape. Not much \nis known for certain about their religious attitudes. Helena became a \nChristianand one of outstanding piety only after her famous sons \nconversion. Constantius enforced without enthusiasm only the first of \nthe anti-Christian measures of the Great Persecution in Britain and \nGaul (France)the sector of the Empire he took charge of in 293 as a \njunior emperor (Caesar). One of his children by his second wife was \nnamed Anastasia, from the Greek word for resurrection, which \nimplies pro-Christian sympathies going beyond mere tolerance. \nEusebius later portrayed him as a worshiper of the one true God, but \nnot in unmistakably Christian terms. The evidence suggests that \nConstantine could have acquired from his father a predisposition to \ntake a serious look at Christianity when the opportunity offered.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the son of a Caesar and hence potentially an emperor himself, \nConstantine spent a dozen years (from about 293 to 305) in the East \nin the court of Diocletian, the senior emperor (Augustus), and \nGalerius, his deputy (Caesar). Constantine could be regarded both as \nan imperial apprentice and as a hostage (ensuring the good conduct of \nhis father). He passed the time partly in Diocletians palace at \nNicomedia (modern Izmit, Turkey, not far from the eastern shore of \nthe Bosporus) and partly in the field on military campaigns. \nConstantines religious development in these formative years is \nlargely hidden from us, but he could hardly have been unaware of the \nChristians in an area of the Empire where they were thickest. The \nranks of Diocletians officials and perhaps even his close family \nincluded some Christians, and the church building in Nicomedia was \neasily visible from the palace windows.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaking over\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Persecution initiated from Nicomedia in 303 304 must have \nbeen highly distasteful to Constantine. In circumstances that \nscholars debate (did he flee at the first opportunity and take steps \nto prevent pursuit?), Constantine left Nicomedia soon after Galerius \nsucceeded Diocletian (as Augustus) on May 1, 305, and made his way to \nBritain to his fathernow also a senior emperor (Augustus). On \nConstantines fathers death at York on July 25, 306, his troops \nsaluted Constantine as Augustus in his place. This was scarcely a \nregular (though not uncommon) route to the imperial throne, and \nConstantine would have to vindicate his right to rule on the \nbattlefield.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo cut a tangled story short, on October 28, 312, he defeated \nMaxentius at the Milvian Bridge, a dozen miles up the Tiber from \nRome, and thereby became sole master of the Western Empire. Twelve \nyears later, he finally routed the forces of Licinius and became \nRuler of the Entire Globeor at least of the whole Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nFavoring the Christians\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the winter of 312313 onwardthat is, from soon after his \ntriumphant entry into Rome as controller of the WestConstantines \nactions reveal increasing favor toward the Christian church. During \nthose months he sent three letters to Carthage (near modern Tunis), \nthe capital of Roman North Africa. The first ordered the Roman \ngovernor to restore to the catholic church of the Christians in any \ncity all the property it had formerly owned, irrespective of its \npresent owner. The second letter informed the bishop of Carthage that \nfunds would soon reach him for distribution to certain specific \nministers of the lawful and most holy catholic religion, and also \nassured him of protection against elements disruptive to the catholic \nchurch. The third letter, again to the governor, exempted clergy from \nthe burdens of inherited responsibilities as local councillors. The \nreason given is highly significant: The setting at nought of divine \nworship  has brought great dangers upon public affairs, and its \nlawful restoration and preservation have bestowed the greatest good \nfortune on the Roman name and singular prosperity on all the affairs \nof mankind (for it is the divine providence which bestows these \nblessings). The clergy, when they render supreme service to the \nDeity,  confer incalculable benefit on the affairs of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious Convictions\u0014\n\u0014\nSentiments like these resonate throughout Constantines letters and \nedicts. They reveal a deeply religious man who believed that the \nwell-being of the Empire was dependent on God, and that God would \nprosper the fortunes of the Empire so long as he was truly worshiped \nby its inhabitants. This true worship (so Constantine held, with \never-sharpening clarity) was the worship offered by the Christian \nchurch, and the true God was the God of the Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow Constantine came by these controlling religious convictions has \nlong been disputed. Two Christian writers, Lactantius and Eusebius, \nhad direct contact with Constantine in later years. They write that \non the eve of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine had a \ndream (Lactantius) or a vision (Eusebius) that convinced him to enter \nthe fray, trusting in the Christians God, and to display a \ndistinctively Christian emblem. The veracity of these accounts is, in \nthe last resort, beyond corroboration. Nevertheless, they speak, in \nhowever embellished a form, of a decisive shift in religious \nallegiancea conversionand this is acknowledged today by eminent \nRoman historians, like Ramsay MacMullen and Timothy Barnes, who have \nno ecclesiastical axe to grind. As Norman H. Bayne wrote, \nConstantines action in confronting Maxentius is more explicable if \nConstantine was convinced that the Christian God had assured him \nvictory.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt must be stressed, though, that the genuineness of Constantines \npro-Christian stance does not depend on the historicity of the dream \nand the vision. It is writ unmistakably large in his words and deeds \nfrom shortly after the decisive victory. This consideration, for \nthose who carry no prejudice against divine communications through \ndreams and visions, may properly count in favor of their authenticity \nin Constantines case.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuperficial Faith?\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine probably never gained a good grounding in Christian \ndoctrine, however. As late as 324 he could regard the momentous \ndivide opening up between the heretic Arius and his opponents as a \nsmall and very insignificant question. Only gradually and never \nfrequently does he speak of Christ and our Savior rather than \nsimply of God or, in more impersonal terms, the divine power, \nprovidence, the supreme Deity, etc.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine was baptized only after the onset of his final illness, \nnot many days before his death on Pentecost, May 22, 337. But if only \nthen do we see him as a penitent (and delayed baptism was the norm at \nthe time), the explanation lies largely in a circumstance too often \nforgotten or minimized by critics who depict him as a hypocrite, an \nimpostor, or even a monster. It is simply this: Constantine was the \nemperor of Rome, the civil and military (and religious) head of the \nEmpire. Our sources give us little access to the private Constantine. \nHis letters and edicts are all official utterances. It is perhaps \nmore remarkable that they make his religious convictions so clear \nthan that they speak so little of Jesus Christ in terms of personal \ndevotion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntermingled Paganism\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantines religion is from first to last that of an autocratic \nruler of an empire secured by military mightand still overwhelmingly \npagan. If pagan elements did not disappear from his coinage \nimmediately after his conversion, that should scarcely surprise us. \nConstantines legislative and executive actions can be fairly \nunderstood only when judged not anachronistically, against some ideal \nportrait of the Christian monarch (there were, after all, no \nprecedents, no available role models, to guide a Roman emperor who \nwas also a Christian), but historically, in a brutal age that took \nharsh retributive punishments for granted. And so his wife and eldest \nson had to die for offenses of treason. Not in vain did this \nConstantine bear the sword.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet in many details a Christian inspiration can be glimpsed in his \nlegal enactmentsfor example, on the treatment of prisoners and \nslaves, on the status-less underclass of Roman society, on the \nexposure of surplus children, on celibacy and marriage and \nextra-marital infidelity.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is important not to make Constantine out to be more \nconsistently Christian than he was. His conversion was not \naccompanied by a sharp break with his former paganism. Rather, a \ntransition is discernible from the worship of the divine Sun to the \nservice of the one true Christian God. When, in 321, he made the \nfirst day of the week a holiday, he described it as the day of the \nsun (but so do Christians today!). Christian regard for the Lords \nDay, however, alone motivated this ruling.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsequences\u0014\n\u0014\nFew individuals have set as many precedents as Constantine. He \nlaunched the church on its way to becoming the official, established \nreligion of the Roman Empirea journey it completed half a century \nlater under Theodosius the Great. And by founding Constantinople as a \nNew Rome, a Christian Rome, he laid the foundations for the noble \nChristian civilization of the Byzantine or East Roman Empire that \nwould survive for a millennium after the Empire in the West had \ndisintegrated. By his patronage Constantine aligned the former church \nof the martyrspersecuted, powerless, and pacifistwith the military \nmight and earthly glory of the state. Christianity would never be the \nsame again.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon the wars of the Empire became holy wars; church leaders looked \nfor civil sanctions to back up their ecclesiastical judgments (the \nCouncil of Nicaea deposed Arius; Constantine exiled him); rulers \nbegan to convene synods of church leaders and to influence or \nintimidate their proceedings; the church hierarchies learned how to \ninvoke state coercion against heretics and schismatics, and they came \nto control increasing property and wealth. Persecution soon resumed \nof Christians by Christians, of pagans by Christians, of Jews and \nMoslems by Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet if blame must be apportioned, much belongs not to Constantine but \nto those church leaders who not only, it seems, failed to teach him \nany better, but even, like Eusebius above all, constructed an \nextravagant theology of the Christian emperor that made him almost \nthe earthly embodiment of divine power.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1990 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

He \nwould make his mark as a Methodist circuit rider and missionary. The \nmark he made as a child, however, was probably not much different \nthan that of other boys of his day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was the time, for instance, when three-year-old William saw a \nlarge cluster of bees hanging down from the front of his \ngrandfather's hive. \"I said, 'Ah, my sweeties, I'll fix you.' So I \ngot an empty horn of a cow and filled it with water and dashed it on \nthe bees. They resented it and speared me most unmercifully. The \nlesson I learned was to attend to my own business and not meddle with \nthe affairs of other folks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore William was ten, his Grandmother taught him the Lord's prayer \nand explained that he could be a son of God. He longed for this \nrelationship but did not know how to get it. Overhearing the story of \na poor black man who had gotten salvation, he wondered why he could \nnot himself. \"But soon after, as I sat one night by the kitchen fire, \nthe Spirit of the Lord came on me and I found myself suddenly weeping \naloud and confessing my sins to God in detail, as I could recall \nthem, and begged him for Jesus's sake to forgive them, with all I \ncould not remember; and I found myself trusting in Jesus that it \nwould all be so, and in a few minutes my heart was filled with peace \nand love, not the shadow of a doubt remaining.\" \u0014\nAfter his conversion, William backslid. Satan (as he later perceived) \ntold him he was beyond forgiveness. For years he lived in dread and \nmisery. But when, as a teen, he was restored to Christ, he was so \njoyful he had to tell others. It was the beginning of a long life of \nevangelization. \"Satan took advantage of my very sensitive and \nover-scrupulous conscience and gave me a great deal of trouble, but \nthe Lord was very patient with me and often defeated him.\" His \ngreatest torment was to go up to perfect strangers and speak to them \ncold turkey about their souls, but he did it until he learned better \nmethods. One was to join the people at their work--log-rolling, \nmaybe--win their confidence with his muscles and then invite the \nworkers to hear him preach.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam rode circuits in Virginia and Maryland. In 1849 he accepted \nan appointment to California, with Annie Kimberlie, his wife, and \ntheir two children. For a fortnight they lived in the open air before \ntaken in. William cut trees and built a home. He ministered to \nCalifornia's gamblers, gold-diggers and sick. Annie was four and a \nhalf years younger than her husband, but looked younger still. People \nmistook them for father and daughter. Although deeply in love, they \nwere often separated for years while he led revival meetings and \nmission work around the world. He reasoned with himself that if \nwhalers could leave their families for three years to gather blubber, \nshould he be willing to do less for the greater treasure of souls?\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Taylor's labors took him to every continent; he preached in \nCanada, Australia, Africa, India, Britain and South America. Wherever \nhe went, hundreds turned to Christ. He was made bishop of Africa. \nWith wry humor, he remarked that if he disposed to lay a scheme for \nkilling bishops decently, he would advise that by all means they \navoid the highlands of Liberia and remain on the deadly \nmalaria-infested coast. William Taylor urged that missions be \nself-supporting. By his hard work, he showed how they might. Taylor \nUniversity in Upland, Indiana, is named for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreau, A. Scott. \"Taylor, William.\" Evangelical Dictionary of World \nMissions.

Jesus is coming back.\"\u0014\nI want to live ready in light of the soon return of Jesus, not acting \nlike a nut because someone said he is coming back tomorrow. Honestly, \nI think that is part of why Jesus says, \"no man knows the day or the \nhour.\" It's because we don't have to think, \"Jesus is coming! Look \nbusy\" because we have been living in light of his return.\u0014\n\u0014\nLee Grady of Charisma magazine doesn't buy it.\u0014\nThere is urgency in the gospel, for sure, but it is not about a \ncountdown to the rapture. Hundreds of thousands of people die every \nday without Jesus, whether or not He returns in their generation. \nThis alone should motivate us to avoid foolish distractions and false \nprophecies so we can get busy with the task of genuine evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAl Mohler says the church should not arrogantly set dates.\u0014\nIn Hebrews 9:28, we are taught that Christ will come a second time \nto save those who are eagerly waiting for him. That is the faithful \nChristian response to the New Testament teachings about Christs \ncoming. The church is not to be arrogantly setting dates, but instead \nto be eagerly waiting for him. Of that we can be truly certain.\u0014\n\u0014\nTim LaHaye says the prediction is bizarre and 100 percent wrong. \u0014\nYou can be sure the rapture will not occur when anyone sets a date \nbecause God wants us all to live every day as though Christ could \ncome today. A great motto for daily living is PERHAPS TODAY. For one \nday it will happen and we don't know when, but we don't want you to \nbe left behind!\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew Paul Turner isn't laughing.\u0014\nIm not saying that I wont Tweet a punch line or two. But my jokes \nwont be personal attacks on the May 21st believers.\u0014\n...Some of them will lose their faith and yet be unable to escape it. \nAnd some of them will go on like nothing happened and probably end up \nsetting and believing in another date.\u0014\nAnd theres nothing funny about that\u0014",

    "title": "CREATION-EVOLUTION DEBATE, HUXLEY VS. WILBERFORCE",
    "words": "June 30, 1860 \u0014\n\u0014\nCreation-Evolution Debate, Huxley vs. Wilberforce\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the publication of the Origin of Species, Englishman Charles \nDarwin unloosed a storm of controversy which has not subsided to this \nday. Religion and science clashed head-on over the theory. Believers \nresented what they perceived as Darwin's attempt to rule God out of \ncreation. Many scientists resented inaccurate and closed-minded \nreactions from the religious community. Darwin had amassed an \nenormous quantity of detail which showed that micro-evolution had \noccurred--evolution within kinds. From this he conjectured that \nmacro-evolution, evolution across kinds, had taken place.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, Saturday, June 30th, 1860, six months after the \npublication of the Origin of Species,evolution was the topic of a \nmeeting of the British Association. Seven hundred people showed up. \nAn American, Dr. Draper, was to speak on the \"Intellectual \nDevelopment of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views of Mr. \nDarwin.\" He spoke for an hour, and then other speakers took off on \nthe theme. A number of churchmen were on the platform, among them \nBishop \"Soapy Sam\" Wilberforce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowd called for this popular speaker. Wilberforce, after \nattempting to defer to another speaker, rose to speak. The great \nanatomist, Sir Richard Owen, had coached him. However, Wilberforce \nwas not deeply grounded in the sciences. He castigated the theory \nwith good humor and made it appear absurd. The crowd loved it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe agnostic Thomas Huxley had been coaxed into attending the \nmeeting. Wilberforce, carried away with words, turned to Huxley with \na mocking question. Was it through his grandfather or grandmother \nthat he claimed descent from a monkey?\u0014\n\u0014\nHuxley slapped his knee and whispered a very un-agnostic comment: \n\"The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands.\" Wilberforce sat down \nto applause. The audience called on Huxley. He rose with defiance. \nExplaining Darwin's key ideas, he exposed what he claimed was \nWilberforce's ignorance and error. He would not be ashamed of a \nmonkey in his ancestry, he said. He would be ashamed to be \"connected \nwith a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.\" The crowd \napplauded. Wilberforce was humiliated. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat was over 135 years ago. The debate still goes on. And sadly \nChristians have often tried to oppose evolution without a full grasp \nof the scientific arguments that they must address and answer. But in \nrecent years even from within the scientific community new questions \nare being raised that seem to assure that the evolution debate is far \nfrom over.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDenbigh, Kenneth G.

But how to prevent them from rolling about \nthe deck was the problem. The storage method devised was to stack \nthem as a square based pyramid, with one ball on top, resting on \nfour, resting on nine, which rested on sixteen.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, a supply of 30 cannon balls could be stacked in a small area \nright next to the cannon. There was only one problem -- how to \nprevent the bottom layer from sliding/rolling from under the others.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe solution was a metal plate with 16 round indentations, called, \nfor reasons unknown, a Monkey. But if this plate were made of iron, \nthe iron balls would quickly rust to it. The solution to the rusting \nproblem was to make them of brass -hence, Brass Monkeys.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew landlubbers realize that brass contracts much more and much \nfaster than iron when chilled.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsequently, when the temperature dropped too far, the brass \nindentations would shrink so much that the iron cannon balls would \ncome right off the monkey.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, it was quite literally, cold enough to freeze the balls off a \nbrass monkey.

Scotland was Presbyterian \n(elder run). Thousands in Scotland signed their names to covenants in \nwhich they promised to uphold the faith of their fathers. Some fought \nfor it. Donald took part in the disorganized Battle at Bothwell \nBridge at which the king's forces defeated the Scottish rebels, but, \nalthough wounded, he escaped.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a famous sermon, he \"excommunicated\" King Charles II and his \ncounselors, saying, \"The Church ought to declare that those who are \nnone of Christ's are none of hers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch actions marked him as a wanted man. Several times he was almost \ncaptured. One such instance took place at Queensferry. An agent of \nthe king, praised Donald and expressed a desire to meet with him to \ndrink to his health. When Donald appeared, the agent pretended \nfriendship but then arrested Donald and Henry Hall. The men struggled \nto escape. Hall was mortally wounded. Donald also was wounded, but \ngot away. Despite his injuries, he preached the following Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWandering in exile, he often preached openly in the Scottish \nlowlands, but at other times, he was forced to stay hidden. Highland \nclansmen hunted for Donald and other Covenanters, because they had \nbeen promised bounties for the capture of such \"rebels.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe law caught up with Donald at Lanarkshire in May 1681. He was \ncruelly treated and hauled to jail with his feet tied tightly under a \nhorse's belly. Convicted of high treason in Edinburgh, he was \ncondemned to be hanged and beheaded.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of his sermons, Donald had said, \"If believers loved Christ as \nHe loves them, they would be more in haste to meet Him.\" That spirit \ncaused him to die bravely. As he mounted the ladder to be hanged, he \nsaid, \"The Lord knows, I go up this ladder in less fear and perturbed \nof mind that ever I entered the pulpit to preach... Farewell, all \nrelations and friends in Christ; farewell all acquaintances and all \nearthly enjoyments; farewell reading and preaching, praying and \nbelieving, wanderings, reproaches and sufferings. Welcome joy \nunspeakable and full of glory. Welcome Father, Son and Holy Ghost. \nInto thy hands I commit my spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the Covenanters, Donald was a martyr for the faith that many Scots \nhad vowed to uphold.

The inquisitor is dead!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWord raced across the German countryside. Nobleman and commoner, \npriest and layman crowded forward to drink in details on this day, \nJuly 30, 1233. The man most hated and feared in all of Germany was \ndead. But how?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was murdered on the highway as he rode home from Mainz. Gerhard, \nhis Franciscan assistant, was killed, too.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was hard not to avoid the connection between Mainz and Marburg. \nJust five days earlier, the Archbishop of Mainz had called a synod \n(local church council). Conrad of Marburg, first inquisitor of \nGermany, had accused the Count of Sayn of heresy. The Count strongly \ndenied the charge and appealed to the Archbishop. The Archbishop \nagreed to examine the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nLittle wonder the count was worried. Conrad, who tortured himself as \npart of his religious system, was even more savage with \"heretics.\" \nAnyone who was indicted for heresy in his court had just two choices: \nto confess themselves guilty or to deny it. If they confessed, their \nhair was shaved off and penalties assessed. If they denied that they \nwere guilty, they went to the stake. It seems never to have occurred \nto Conrad that someone might deny their guilt because they actually \nwere innocent. It should have, for his indictments were obtained by \nthreatening accused people with torture unless they gave him names of \nothers who were \"guilty\" of heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the clergy assembled at Mainz, Conrad was there. The synod found \nno evidence of heresy in the Count of Sayn. Frustrated, Conrad called \nfor a crusade against heretical nobles.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt had to be with relief that the targets of Conrad's wrath learned \nof his death. As brutal as the thirteenth century was, even Conrad's \ncontemporaries could not stomach his harsh methods. When the bishops \nof Germany took over their nation's inquisition, they applied \nstandards of inquiry that were more realistic and fair.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems not many people mourned Conrad's death. One who didwas Pope \nGregory IX. Gregory was an instigator of the inquisition. He called \nfor harsh penalties on Conrad's murderers and extended his protection \nover Conrad's memory.\u0014\n\u0014\nConrad had also been confessor to Elizabeth of Hungary, the gentle \nqueen who opened Europe's first leprosarium. His treatment of her \nshows his temperament. He made her send her children away and ordered \nher to expel the women who had been her close companions and suffered \nexile with her. He surrounded Elizabeth with his own, unsympathetic \nappointees. He imposed harsh penances on her. According to some \naccounts, he even personally beat her.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Conrad of Marburg.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F. L.

On this day, \nJuly 27, 916, the founder of their monastery was to be laid to rest. \nAll recognized that a mighty man had passed from among them.\u0014\n\u0014\nClement of Ohrid (in what is now the Republic of Macedonia) had died \njust a few days earlier. With his passing went a link to the heroic \nage of Cyril and Methodius, Apostles to the Slavs. Clement was one of \nthe five faithful disciples Cyril and Methodius had entrusted with \ncarrying on their mission before they died. The others were Nahum, \nGorazd, Angelarius and Sava, all \"of equal learning and maturity as \napostles...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEqual they may have been, but if so, Clement was the first among \nequals. This was because of his immense learning. Clement wrote over \nfifty books. He is considered the first Slavic writer. Much of his \nwork consisted of translations of psalms, chants, moral writings and \nchurch material. But Clement also wrote the biographies of his \nteachers Cyril and Methodius, lives of other saints and church poems. \nHe translated portions of scripture. Much of the Slavonic liturgy \n(church service) was based on his work.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the tenth century, Ohrid was considered a backwater of Bulgaria. \nBecause of a disagreement with Prince Simeon of Bulgaria over \nmodernization of the alphabet, Clement was not appointed as a royal \nadvisor in 893. Instead, the Prince showed that he was unhappy with \nhim by sending him to Ohrid. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe source of the falling out was that Clement opposed revising the \nalphabet on Greek lines [that is adapting a \"Hellenic\" form]. He \nwanted to stick with the alphabet developed by Cyril and Methodius. \nThe majority of Simeon's advisors voted with Clement. Prince Simeon, \nhowever, was afraid there would be a backlash from the powerful \nByzantium empire that ruled the east if his country persisted with in \nits new nationalistic culture. He ordered Clement to make some \nchanges in the Glagolitic script (an ancient Bulgarian script), but \nClement was not willing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a consequence, Clement suffered attacks from the Greek party.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreat men do not let defeat sideline them completely. Neither did \nClement. He opened a school in Ohrid, in which St. Nahum also taught. \nThis attracted large numbers of students and grew into the first \nSlavonic university. Clement and Nahum employed the Glagolitic \nscript. Ancient traditions say the two friends trained over three \nthousand students, many of whom became priests, thus forever stamping \nthe Balkans with the personal imprint of their two famous teachers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end, Clement stopped working. He was exhausted from a life \nof hard labors and Greek opposition. Perhaps he was not unhappy to \nlay down his work when he died on July 17, 916. Shortly after his \ndeath, he was named a saint. He is still one of the most revered \nfigures in Bulgarian history.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Obolensky, Dimitri. Six Byzantine Portraits.

    "title": "CIRCUMCISION BAN IS VEILED ANTI-SEMITISM",
    "words": "By: RABBI GARY CREDITOR \u0014\nPublished: July 27, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nJudaism is a Scripture-based faith that has continued to evolve \nduring its 3,500-year journey. Among its earliest commandments is \nthat of male ritual circumcision. The Hebrew term is brit milah, \nmeaning circumcision for the sake of the covenant. This procedure \ntranscends its physicality.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Abraham the patriarch to this very day, it is the sign of the \neverlasting covenant between God and the Jewish people. While the \nTorah (the first five books of the Bible) is silent about its \nrationale, I deduce that its location in the area of procreation \nindicates the actual, physical transmission of the covenant from \ngeneration to generation as it is being created, from the first Jew \nto the newest member of our religious community. It is our \nfundamental religious observance from our very beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nElsewhere, the Torah records the prohibition of willful mutilation of \nthe body. This is usually understood as a rejection of idolatrous \npractices. Fortunately it still permits jewelry! Today I am often \nasked whether tattoos are a violation of this commandment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrit milah is certainly not. In Judaism, performed on the eighth day \nby a specifically trained and ordained person, with its attendant \nliturgy, it completes the birth process and indicates membership in a \ncovenantal community. For Judaism it is irrelevant if there are any \nbeneficial effects of medical circumcision. We only fulfill brit \nmilah because the Torah records God's specific ordination of this \ncommandment.\u0014\n\u0014\nI vividly remember the brit milahs of our son, our nephew and our \ngrandson. Of course there was concern for the medical procedure, but \nI had complete confidence in the mohel, the person who is ritually \nand medically trained and dedicated for this purpose. As I held each \nof the three babies and looked into their faces, I tried to imagine \ntheir future, even as my mind traversed our history and I said in my \nheart to Abraham the Patriarch, \"We, too, follow in your footsteps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout history, those who sought to destroy the Jewish people \nalways forbade brit milah, usually upon penalty of death. They \nthought that if they could eradicate the sign of the covenant, they \ncould eliminate the covenantal people. They failed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is the issue that reverberates these days in San Francisco with \nthe attempt through legislation to ban all circumcision. It is a \nthinly veiled attack upon Judaism and the Jewish people. Anyone who \nobjects to this ritual has the democratic right not to participate in \nit. Yet as parents with a religious persuasion, we make decisions on \nbehalf of our children. One of those is the perpetuation of the \nfaith. This is how we do it. This attack is not new  just its \nmethod. It violates core American principles.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich faith community will be the next to be held in disfavor and \nattacked? Which faith-based ritual will not pass muster? Will it be \nthe immersion of baptism? The incense of the cathedral? The removal \nof shoes in the mosque? The head-coverings that bespeak several \nreligious values? The self-accepted religious law of a given \ncommunity? Who is next? What is next?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe greatness of America is the freedom to practice our different and \ndistinct faiths without interference. The magnificence of America is \nrevealed in the multitextual religious communities all \"present and \naccounted for.\" In our different ways we all seek the path to the One \nGod who demands us to live moral, ethical and meaningful lives. For \nJudaism, brit milah enters the child into the covenant with God. I \nhope that the legislature and people of California understand the \nglory of America and thoroughly reject this attack upon American \nvalues and upon the Jewish people.\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Creditor serves at Temple Beth-El.

The Gipper bet $500 on his team that \nday, according to Grantland Rices 1954 book, The Tumult and the \nShouting.

    "title": "CONSECRATION OF HAGIA SOPHIA",
    "words": "Consecration of Hagia Sophia\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing like the new church of Constantinople had been seen before. \nBorrowing from several earlier architectural styles, Anthemius of \nTralles and Isidorus of Miletus created the masterpiece of \nsixth-century Byzantium. Although they were not professional \narchitects, Emperor Justinian chose them, presumably because they had \nhelped construct some of his military works. At any rate, they \napplied mathematics to the structure in a manner new to architectural \ndesign. The result was a work of grace and beauty.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause its dome was set upon a ring of closely spaced windows, the \nHagia Sophia (Church of the Holy Wisdom) was so \"... full of light \nand sunshine; you would declare that the place is not lighted by the \nsun from without, but that the rays are produced within itself, such \nan abundance of light is poured into this church....\" wrote a \ncontemporary. Some described the space within as seeming infinite.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Justinian had spared no expense to erect this masterpiece, \nwhich went up in the astonishing span of just five years. This was \npossible because Justinian lavished money on the enterprise. One \nsource estimates he spent as much as 23 million gold solidi on the \nbuilding (the equivalent of $25 billion dollars* in today's \npurchasing power). 40,000 pounds of silver were used in the decor \nalone\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the emperor inspected the largely-completed work shortly before \nits consecration, he was silent for a long time. His eyes scanned its \ncontrasts of gold with blue, the alternation of vertical and \nhorizontal marble slabs, and the opposition of carven columns to \ncurved arches. These created an interior beauty that made space seem \nto melt into space so that it was hard for the eye to gauge \ndistances. \"Solomon, I have surpassed you!\" he exclaimed at last.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in truth, no temple of antiquity had ever come close to the \noriginality and magnificence of this. It had been made possible only \nby Justinian's zeal. At first it was simply called the \"Great \nChurch,\" but later the name \"Holy Wisdom\" was applied to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn  December 27, 537, Patriarch Menas of Constantinople consecrated \nthe architectural masterpiece. Eventually a bridge linked the church \ndirectly to the nearby imperial palace. Six hundred religious workers \nserved the building, in which important religious functions of the \nempire took place. According to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, \nthese workers included 80 priests, 150 deacons, 40 deaconesses, 60 \nsubdeacons, 160 readers, 25 chanters, and 75 doorkeepers.\u0014\n\u0014\n*This estimate is arrived at through the following reasoning: a gold \nsolidus was worth 25 silver denarii. A denarius was a day's wage for \na common laborer. At a minimum wage of $US 5.50 an hour, a denarius \nwould be equivalent to $44 in buying power. The rest is \nmultiplication.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

It would not let me rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nComplementarianism is a religious construct that deals with the roles \nof gender. The message is evil at its center.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The SBC has affirmed complementarianism - the belief that the Bible \nreveals that men and women are equally made in God's image, but that \nmen and women were also created to be complements to each other, men \nand women bearing distinct and different roles,\" Al Mohler, president \nof Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, stated in a recent column. \n\"This means obeying the Bible's very clear teachings on male \nleadership in the home and in the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo me, it is nothing more than the old argument of \"separate but \nequal\" applied to gender roles and dressed in a type of theological \nclothing. This is the same argument earlier generations used to \njustify segregation of the races.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe whole idea is to downgrade the role of women and to promote the \nsuperiority of men. Proponents dress it up and clothe it in \nstatements of love. In most cases, this is window dressing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many, it is the excuse they need to keep women in their place.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have been through this before: \"Blacks are fine as long as they \nstay in their place.\" It stank then and it stinks now. Separate but \nequal was never equal, and no one pretended that it was.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe black schools in the town of my youth got hand-me-down textbooks, \nhand-me-down desks and chairs and rundown buildings.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe took our money to church for missionaries to win the lost in \nAfrica, but the black children two blocks away could not come to \nchurch with us.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder complementarianism, in many churches women can't teach men \nbecause that is not their God-prescribed role.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inconsistency of the position is seen in the fact that female \nteachers teach male students in public and private schools, including \nreligious ones, every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal is to keep women in lower paying jobs and deny them \nauthority. The males who promote this travesty are in control and \nhave no intention of relinquishing any of their control.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The same Bible that reveals the complementarian pattern of male \nleadership in the home and the church also reveals God's steadfast \nand unyielding concern for the abused, the threatened, the suffering \nand the fearful,\" Mohler stated. \"There is no excuse whatsoever for \nabuse of any form, verbal, emotional, physical, spiritual or sexual.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, the nation is finally seeing some of the harmful results of \nthis philosophy, which plays into the hands of those who abuse women \naround the world: \"The church says that you are to obey me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus set the example for another and better way. He made it very \nclear that there is no artificial ranking of male and female roles in \nhis kingdom. \"Mary, go and tell my disciples.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul emphasized this in Galatians 3:28. \"There is neither Jew nor \nGentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for \nyou are all one in Christ Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing up Southern Baptist, my experience with women pastors is \nlimited, but I have been blessed by hearing some of the best: Linda \nMcKinnish Bridges, Amy Butler, Molly Marshall, Joan Brown Campbell, \nCynthia Campbell, Julie Pennington-Russell, Susan Sparks and Martha \nBrown Taylor, to name only a few.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only have I been blessed by hearing these women, I have gained so \nmuch insight from them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI regularly listen to and read Sparks, pastor of Madison Avenue \nBaptist Church in New York City.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe places God in the center of our every action and has a sense of \nhumor and such an awareness of God's presence in the ordinary that \nyou are compelled to listen and take notice.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcKinnish Bridges, president of Baptist Theological Seminary at \nRichmond, Virginia, preached her sermon, \"Grace upon Grace,\" 27 years \nago. Yet it is as fresh today as it was the first day I heard it \nbecause it expresses God's work in my life.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarshall, president of Central Baptist Theological Seminary in \nKansas, awakened my interest in the influence of the Holy Spirit in \nour daily lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nCynthia Campbell, president emerita of McCormick Theological Seminary \nin Chicago, preached the most inspirational sermon on the \nresurrection I have ever heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's love for all of humanity oozes from every word from the sermons \nof Joan Brown Campbell, an ordained Disciples of Christ and American \nBaptist Church minister who was the first woman to lead the National \nCouncil of Churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you say that God rejects the work of these ambassadors of \nhope because they dare preach to men?\u0014\n\u0014\nI have experienced outstanding female Bible teachers in my years in \nthe church. You want me to disregard the teachings of these gifted \nwomen because I am a male and should not have been listening to them?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould I have not have listened to my mother when she spoke of God's \nlove for me? Should I have not listened to my wife when she assured \nme that God would watch over me and our children?\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of these women were gifted by God with talents far greater than \nthe ones given to me. I think God brought me into contact with them \nbecause they had been given a message I was intended to hear.\u0014\n\u0014\nI ask myself, \"Where would I be in my spiritual journey if these \nwomen were not a part of my life?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nComplementarianism belongs on the ash heap of history along with \nseparate but equal.\u0014\n\\\u0002Mitch Carnell is a member of First Baptist Church of Charleston, \nSouth Carolina.\u0014",

Williams\u0014\n\u0014\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers predicted that if Donald \nTrump were elected, there would be a protracted recession within 18 \nmonths. Heeding its experts, a month before the election, The \nWashington Post ran an editorial with the headline A President Trump \ncould destroy the world economy. Steve Rattner, a Democratic \nfinancier and former head of the National Economic Council, warned, \nIf the unlikely event happens and Trump wins, you will see a market \ncrash of historic proportions. When Trumps electoral victory became \napparent, Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist \nPaul Krugman warned that the world was very probably looking at a \nglobal recession, with no end in sight. By the way, Krugman has been \nso wrong in so many of his economic predictions, but that doesnt \nstop him from making more shameless predictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople whom weve trusted as experts have often been wrong beyond \nimagination, and its nothing new. Irving Fisher, a distinguished \nYale University economics professor in 1929, predicted, Stock prices \nhave reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. Three days \nlater, the stock market crashed. In 1945, regarding money spent on \nthe Manhattan Project, Adm. William Leahy told President Harry S. \nTruman, That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done. The \n[atomic] bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert in \nexplosives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1903, the president of the Michigan Savings Bank, advising Henry \nFords lawyer not to invest in Ford Motor Co., said, The horse is \nhere to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty  a fad. \nConfidence in the staying power of the horse was displayed by a 1916 \ncomment of the aide-de-camp to Field Marshal Douglas Haig at a tank \ndemonstration: The idea that cavalry will be replaced by these iron \ncoaches is absurd. It is little short of treasonous.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlbert Einstein predicted: There is not the slightest indication \nthat nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the \natom would have to be shattered at will. In 1899, Charles H. Duell, \nthe U.S. commissioner of patents, said, Everything that can be \ninvented has been invented. Listening to its experts in 1936, The \nNew York Times predicted, A rocket will never be able to leave the \nEarths atmosphere.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo prove that its not just academics, professionals, and business \npeople who make harebrained predictions, Hall of Fame baseball player \nTris Speakers 1919 advice about Babe Ruth was, Taking the best \nleft-handed pitcher in baseball and converting him into a right \nfielder is one of the dumbest things I ever heard. For those of us \nnot familiar with baseball, Babe Ruth was one of the greatest \noutfielders who ever played the game.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe worlds greatest geniuses are by no means exempt from out-and-out \nnonsense. Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was probably the greatest \nscientist of all time. He laid the foundation for classical \nmechanics; his genius transformed our understanding of physics, \nmathematics, and astronomy. Whats not widely known is that Newton \nspent most of his waking hours on alchemy. Some of his crackpot \nexperiments included trying to turn lead into gold. He wrote volumes \non alchemy, but after his death, Britains Royal Society deemed that \nthey were not fit to be printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen theres mathematical physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin \n(1824-1907), whose major contribution was in thermodynamics. Kelvin \nis recognized for determining the value of absolute zero, \napproximately minus 273.15 degrees Celsius or minus 459.67 degrees \nFahrenheit. In honor of his achievement, extremely high and extremely \nlow temperatures are expressed in units called kelvins.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo prove that one can be a genius in one area and an idiot in \nanother, Kelvin challenged geologists by saying that Earth is between \n20 million and 100 million years old. Kelvin predicted, X-rays will \nprove to be a hoax. And he told us, I can state flatly that \nheavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe point of all this is to say that we can listen to experts but \ntake what they predict with a grain or two of salt.\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason \nUniversity.\u0014",

    "words": "COTTON MATHER\u0014\nAMERICAN RELIGIOUS LEADER\u0014\nWRITTEN BY: The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Mather, (born Feb. 12, 1663, Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony \n[U.S.]died Feb. 13, 1728, Boston), American Congregational minister \nand author, supporter of the old order of the ruling clergy, who \nbecame the most celebrated of all New England Puritans. He combined a \nmystical strain (he believed in the existence of witchcraft) with a \nmodern scientific interest (he supported smallpox inoculation).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe son of Increase Mather and the grandson of John Cotton and \nRichard Mather, Cotton Mather lived all his life in Boston. He \nentered Harvard at the age of 12, easily passing entrance \nrequirements to read and write Latin and to decline the Greek nouns \nand verbs. He devoted himself unremittingly to study and prayer. At \n18 he received his M.A. degree from the hands of his father, who was \npresident of the college.\u0014\n\u0014\nMather once noted that his life was a continual conversation with \nheaven, but he spent agonizing hours convinced that he was damned \nand equal time in ecstasies that he was not. For a while, he feared \nhe could not enter the ministry because of a speech impediment, and \nhe considered becoming a physician; the subject of medicine was of \nlifelong interest to him. After a friend persuaded him to oblige \nhimself to a dilated Deliberation in speaking, he conquered his \nweakness and returned to religious studies. He preached his first \nsermon in his fathers church in August 1680 and in October another \nfrom his grandfather John Cottons pulpit. He was formally ordained \nin 1685 and became his fathers colleague.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe devoted his life to praying, preaching, writing, and publishing \nand still followed his main purpose in life of doing good. His book, \nBonifacius, or Essays to Do Good (1710), instructs others in \nhumanitarian acts, some ideas being far ahead of his time: the \nschoolmaster to reward instead of punish his students, the physician \nto study the state of mind of his patient as a probable cause of \nillness. He established societies for community projects.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined his father in cautioning judges against the use of spectre \nevidence (testimony of a victim of witchcraft that he had been \nattacked by a spectre bearing the appearance of someone he knew) in \nthe witchcraft trials and in working for the ouster of Sir Edmund \nAndros as governor of Massachusetts. He was also a leader in the \nfight for inoculation against smallpox, incurring popular \ndisapproval. When Cotton inoculated his own son, who almost died from \nit, the whole community was wrathful, and a bomb was thrown through \nhis chamber window. Satan seemed on the side of his enemies; various \nmembers of his family became ill, and some died. Worst of all, his \nson Increase was arrested for rioting.\u0014\n\u0014\nMathers interest in science and particularly in various American \nphenomenapublished in his Curiosa Americana (171224)won him \nmembership in the Royal Society of London. His account of the \ninoculation episode was published in the societys transactions. He \ncorresponded extensively with notable scientists, such as Robert \nBoyle. His Christian Philosopher (1721) recognizes God in the wonders \nof the earth and the universe beyond; it is both philosophical and \nscientific and, ironically, anticipates 18th-century Deism, despite \nhis clinging to the old order.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Mather wrote and published more than 400 works. His magnum \nopus was Magnalia Christi Americana (1702), an ecclesiastical history \nof America from the founding of New England to his own time. His \nManuductio ad Ministerium (1726) was a handbook of advice for young \ngraduates to the ministry: on doing good, on college love affairs, on \npoetry and music, and on style. His ambitious 20-year work on \nbiblical learning was interrupted by his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died only five years after his father, whose colleague he had been \nfor 40 years. Of 15 children by his three wivesAbigail Phillips, \nElizabeth (ne Clark) Hubbard, and Lydia (ne Lee) Georgeonly two \nsurvived him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Mathers heritage from his two grandfathers, Richard Mather \nand John Cotton, was both fortunate and unfortunate. Like them, he \nhad an active mind and the will to use it. He lived in the shadow of \ntheir greatness and expected to carry on the tradition and to assume \ntheir role in the Puritan community. Unfortunately, he could not see \nthat the old order was passing. As colonial communities became more \nsecure from earlier hardships of settlements, they also became more \ncomplacent and less in need of a confining spiritual leadership. \nCotton fought for the continuance of the old order of the ruling \nclergy, sometimes with frustration, sometimes in anger. His Diary was \nedited by W.C. Ford (191112).\u0014",

    "title": "CHRIST'S BLOOD IN A VIAL",
    "words": "Mysterious Relic Brought \nto Westminster\u0014\n\u0014\nKing Henry III was very mysterious. An order he sent out instructed \nhis nobles to assemble at Westminster Abbey on this day October 13, \n1247. All the king would say was that he had \"most agreeable news of \na holy benefit recently conferred upon the English.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe whole nation knew that Henry was strongly attached to the memory \nof Edward the Confessor. He had rebuilt Westminster abbey in his \nhonor and asked the pope to include Edward in the calendar of saints. \nHe had even named his own first son after Edward. Going beyond that, \nhe issued instructions for his own body to be buried at the abbey.\u0014\nCuriosity drew many to the abbey (including the historian Matthew \nParis). What was this holy benefit going to be? Religious hopes drew \nothers. Henry had permission from the pope for the monks of \nWestminster to give the pope's own blessings during certain prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe big day came. Henry announced to the cheering crowd that he had a \nmost precious relic. Its arrival in England had been kept top secret. \nIt was a vial of precious drops of Christ's blood. Bishops in the \nHoly Land affirmed its authenticity, and there were seals of the \nKnights Templars, the Knights Hospitallers and the Patriarch of \nJerusalem to back it up. \u0014\nChristians believe that it is by the precious blood of Christ we are \nransomed from sin and cleansed from evil. To the Medieval \nimagination, a vial of Christ's blood was a remarkable relic, holding \nimmense power. In some places such vials became the focus of \npilgrimages.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder a canopy supported on spears and supported by two attendants \n(to be sure he did not drop the precious crystal vase), Henry himself \ncarried the relic the two miles to the abbey. Once he arrived there, \nhe carried the blood in procession around the abbey and the \nneighboring royal buildings before consigning it to the care of the \nmonks.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreaching a sermon afterward, the Bishop of Norwich praised the relic \nand said that indulgences of six years and one hundred and sixteen \ndays would be granted to anyone who venerated the relic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe vial of Christ's alleged blood at Westminster never became a \npopular pilgrim attraction. Did people doubt its authenticity in \nspite of the king's assurances? In Hailes, an abbey founded about the \nsame time, a similar flask of blood drew large crowds of pilgrims. \nThe Christian mystic Margery Kempe visited the place and the poet \nChaucer mentioned it in his \"Pardoner's Tale.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nToday few believe that either vial really contained Christ's blood. \nKing Henry VIII had the vial at Hailes examined in the sixteenth \ncentury; his agents reported that it consisted of clear honey mixed \nwith saffron coloring (another account says it was goose blood, \nreplaced fresh each week). Since the Hailes vial was even better \nauthenticated than the Westminster vial, the worth of Henry's \ntreasure can be guessed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe king ordered Matthew Paris to write a full account of the events \nof this day and it is to his chronicle that historians owe the \ndetailed account that has been preserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nVincent, Nicholas.

The person who could get him those rights \nwas Napoleon III. The only problem was, Napoleon III was on the \nbattlefield in Italy. Dunant did not let that deter him, but set out \nfor Napoleon's headquarters at Solferino in Northern Italy. Thanks to \nthat bold venture, this Christian-influenced businessman became the \nfirst person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe arrived in Solferino in time to witness one of the bloodiest \nbattles of the 19th century. About 40,000 men died in the fighting on \nJune 24, 1859, and another 40,000 perished afterwards because of \ninadequate medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nHenri Dunant had been reared in active Christian faith. His father \nwas involved in social work and Dunant himself had labored for the \nSwiss arm of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was a \nman of action. Appalled by the suffering he witnessed at Solferino, \nhe immediately organized the local peasants to gather the wounded and \ncare for them in homes and churches. Had he not done so, even more \nmay have died. He persuaded Napoleon III to issue an order freeing \ndoctors and surgeons attached to the Austrian armies. But more was \nneeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant saw that modern weapons would kill increasing numbers of men. \nSomething had to be done. He wrote a book titled A Memory of \nSolferino. In it he called all nations to set up commissions to deal \nwith war casualties. Everyone who could should be trained to care for \nthe wounded. His idea sparked interest. In 1863 a committee of five, \nincluding Dunant, met in Geneva to see if his plan could be \nimplemented. It called for a conference. This was also held in \nGeneva. On this day, October 29, 1863, the conferees founded the \nInternational Red Cross (not yet called by that name). The following \nyear, the concerned committee drew up the Geneva Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nDunant never got his water rights. As a consequence, his business \nfailed.

    "title": "CHURCH STAFFING NEEDS",
    "words": "One of the most frequent conversations the Center for Healthy \nChurches has with congregations and their leaders has to do with \nfinances and staff. Specifically, with the majority of churches in \nAmerica plateaued or declining, intense pressure is often brought to \nbear upon church staffing models. With finances tight, congregations \nare being forced to think carefully about the number of professional \nstaff members they require and can afford, and the focus of those \npositions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt can be a difficult conversation to broach, so churches often deny \nthe looming issues and delay the needed discussion. Unfortunately, \nthe conversation can then erupt as a crisis at budget or transition \ntime. Proactively leaning into the conversation is a much healthier \nalternative.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs you consider your churchs situation, here are some guiding \nthoughts.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, a church must clarify its mission, vision and strategy for its \nnear- and mid-term future. Whatever we believe the Kingdom is to look \nlike in the coming season of our congregations life is what reigns \nsupreme when it comes to priorities for facilities, staff, structures \nand finances. That clarity is essential if we are to make wise and \nappropriate choices with regard to our staff. There are multiple \noptions for doing this clarification work. Choose one and pursue it \nwith energy until you are clear and united around a shared agenda for \nthe future.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you were to rebalance this portfolio of responsibility between \nlaity and clergy, what would it look like?\u0014\n\u0014\nA second key factor is the relationship between professional staff \nand laity. What is the leadership culture of the congregation? Some \nchurches seemingly hire staff to do most of the work of the church. \nOthers seek a more balanced ministry model of an engaged laity and \nministerial leaders. What if you made this choice deliberately rather \nthan by tradition? If you were to rebalance this portfolio of \nresponsibility between laity and clergy, what would it look like?\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, an analysis of staffing expenditures and congregational \nattendance patterns can provide insight.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne approach is to analyze your congregations budget and rebalance \nit so that it fits generally accepted models for operation. \nSpecifically, break your budget into five categories: personnel, \nfacilities, programs, debt and missions. Assign every line item in \nyour budget to one of these categories. Hopefully, you are debt-free \nor paying your debt down using a parallel capital campaign. If so, \nthen the other four categories apply to you. If not, you will need to \nadjust to include the debt service.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenerally accepted best practices assign these ranges to each of the \nfour remaining categories:\u0014\n\u0014\nPersonnel  50-60%\u0014\nFacilities    15-25%\u0014\nPrograms  10-15%\u0014\nMissions    10-20%\u0014\nDebt              0-5%\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the key indicators of a healthy church is the combined \npercentage of personnel and facilities. When this number exceeds 75%, \nthe ability of the congregation to successfully engage in ministry \nand missions begins to be negatively impacted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese percentages are strictly guidelines and need to be evaluated in \nterms of your context, congregation size and special circumstances. \nEven with that, once you know where your budget percentages fall, you \ncan begin to make needed adjustments based upon your ministry vision, \nrather than an emotional reaction to a crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the key indicators of a healthy church is the combined \npercentage of personnel and facilities in the budget.\u0014\nAnother metric that lends insight into the discussion is the ratio of \nweekly attenders to ministerial/professional staff. The generally \naccepted ratio is one ministerial staff member for every 100 regular \nattenders. Thus, if your congregation averages 325 attenders, the \nratio suggests you can support 3 ministerial staff members.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis ratio has been around for many years and seems to hold up in \ncurrent scenarios. One proviso: attendance patterns are shifting \ndramatically and may impact this. The frequency of attendance by \nregular attenders is dropping. Do a quick check on the actual \nattendance habits of your congregation, and you will find that many \nof your most faithful, regular attenders often are present 35-40 \nSundays a year. Not only does this have an impact on volunteer \npositions (class leadership, choir, etc.), it means that a \ncongregation must staff and prepare for a larger congregation than \nthe weekly attendance average suggests you have.\u0014\n\u0014\nCount the number of people who attend your church on a monthly basis, \nrather than weekly. You may find that an average weekly worship \nattendance of 300 may actually be be an active congregation of \n450-500, and that has implications for the staffing ratio.\u0014",

Williams (A typical conservative defense)\u0014\n\u0014\nDeliberate Formal Contradictions\u0014\n\u0014\nA consequence of having four records of the same life is that there \nare many overlapping sections among accounts and many opportunities \nfor narratives to differ from each other. It is actually common in \nnormal life that multiple reports of the same events will be, or will \nat least seem to be, in conflict with each other. Over the years, \nmany contradictions have been alleged between the Gospelsthis at \nleast suggests a degree of independence within each account. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, my brief journey into this subject will focus on how the \nGospel of John contains many deliberate formal contradictions within \nitself and with other literature (such as the First Letter of John, \nwhich shows the same authorial style). Here are some examples.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. God loves the world versus do not love the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever \nbelieves in him should not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)\u0014\n\u0014\nDo not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the \nworld, the love of the Father is not in him. (1 John 2:15)\u0014\n\u0014\n2. People believed when they saw Jesuss signs versus they did not \nbelieve.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in \nhis name when they saw the signs that he was doing. (John 2:23) \u0014\n\u0014\nThough he had done so many signs before them, they still did not \nbelieve in him. (John 12:37)\u0014\nThe author of Johns Gospel has recorded contradictions at the \nsuperficial level of language to encourage the audience to think more \ndeeply.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. They know Jesus and where he comes from versus they do not.\u0014\nSo Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, You know me, and \nyou know where I come from. (John 7:28) \u0014\nJesus answered, Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony \nis true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you \ndo not know where I come from or where I am going. (John 8:14) \u0014\nThey said to him therefore, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, \nYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my \nFather also. (John 8:19)\u0014\n4. If Jesus bears witness of himself, his testimony is not true, \nversus the opposite.\u0014\nIf I bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. (John 5:31, \nmy trans.)\u0014\nSo the Pharisees said to him, You are bearing witness about \nyourself; your testimony is not true. Jesus answered, Even if I do \nbear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I \ncame from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from \nor where I am going. (John 8:1314)\u0014\n5. Jesus judges no one versus he has much to judge.\u0014\nYou judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. (John 8:15) \u0014\nYet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone \nwho judge, but I and the Father who sent me. (John 8:16) \u0014\nI have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is \ntrue, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him. (John \n8:26)\u0014\n6. Jesus did not come into the world to judge it versus he came to \njudge.\u0014\nIf anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; \nfor I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. (John \n12:47) \u0014\nFor God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but \nin order that the world might be saved through him. (John 3:17) \u0014\nJesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do \nnot see may see, and those who see may become blind. (John 9:39)\u0014\nThinking Deeply on Meaning\u0014\nI hope that after reading the list above and studying the subtle way \nthe Gospel of John is written, you will agree that these formal \ncontradictions are deliberate. They are part of the authors way of \nmaking us reflect more deeply on the multiple meanings of the words \ninvolved.1This sample prepares us to consider a quotation by skeptic \nBart Ehrman from a book in which he explains what he thinks are the \nclearest contradictions within the Gospels: \u0014\nOne of my favorite apparent discrepanciesI read John for years \nwithout realizing how strange this one iscomes in Jesus Farewell \nDiscourse, the last address that Jesus delivers to his disciples, at \nhis last meal with them, which takes up all of chapters 13 to 17 in \nthe Gospel according to John. In John 13:36, Peter says to Jesus, \nLord, where are you going? A few verses later Thomas says, Lord, \nwe do not know where you are going (John 14:5). And then, a few \nminutes later, at the same meal, Jesus upbraids his disciples, \nsaying, Now I am going to the one who sent me, yet none of you asks \nme, Where are you going? (John 16:5). Either Jesus had a very \nshort attention span or there is something strange going on with the \nsources for these chapters, creating an odd kind of disconnect.2\u0014\nThis forms part of Ehrmans cumulative case for there being \nirreconcilable contradictions within the Gospels. However, it also \nshows a weakness in his method. In every case listed above, Jesus is \nportrayed as speaking one or both sides of the contradiction. But why \nmay an outstanding teacher not use paradox? Each of the formal \ncontradictions we have seen highlights the multiple meanings of \nwords. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is going to the cross and then to \nhis Father, God. The disciples are not asking about that but are only \nthinking in mundane terms of where he will next walk to. Ehrman has \njust missed the irony.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem seems, therefore, to be that the question of \ncontradictions has become part of a point-scoring exercise between \nthose who claim or deny error in the Gospels. Here the author of \nJohns Gospel has recorded contradictions at the superficial level of \nlanguage to encourage the audience to think more deeply. It is \nsomewhat similar to how Dickens opened his A Tale of Two Cities with \na whole list of contradictions to characterize the inconsistencies of \nan era. He famously began, It was the best of times, it was the \nworst of times.3\u0014\nThe presence of such deliberate formal contradictions does not mean \nthat the contradictory statements are not both true in some way at a \ndeeper level. But these formal contradictions do show that the author \nis more interested in encouraging people to read deeply than in \nsatisfying those who want to find fault. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf one author may use vocabulary in more than one way, why may not \ntwo authors? If anyone wants to argue that two Gospel accounts are in \nsuch conflict that both cannot be true, he must first ensure that he \nhas correctly understood the claims being made in each text and that \nhe is not reading either of the accounts in a way that is not \nintended.\u0014",

    "title": "CONFESSION OF FAITH IN TIME OF A CRISIS",
    "words": "We are living through perilous and polarizing times as a nation, with \na dangerous crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest \nlevels of our government and in our churches. We believe the soul of \nthe nation and the integrity of faith are now at stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is time to be followers of Jesus before anything elsenationality, \npolitical party, race, ethnicity, gender, geography. Our identity in \nChrist precedes every other identity. We pray that our nation will \nsee Jesus words in us. By this everyone will know that you are my \ndisciples, if you have love for one another (John 13:35, NRSV).1\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen politics undermines our theology, we must examine that politics. \nThe churchs role is to change the world through the life and love of \nJesus Christ. The governments role is to serve the common good by \nprotecting justice and peace, rewarding good behavior (Romans 13). \nWhen that role is undermined by political leadership, faith leaders \nmust stand up and speak out. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, The \nchurch must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of \nthe state, but rather the conscience of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is often the duty of Christian leaders, especially elders, to \nspeak the truth in love to our churches and to name and warn against \ntemptations, racial and cultural captivities, false doctrines, and \npolitical idolatriesand even our complicity in them. We do so here \nwith humility, prayer, and a deep dependency on the grace and Holy \nSpirit of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis letter comes from a retreat on Ash Wednesday 2018. In this \nseason of Lent, we feel deep lamentations for the state of our \nnation, and our own hearts are filled with confession for the sins we \nfeel called to address. The true meaning of the word repentance is \nto turn around. It is time to lament, confess, repent, and turn. In \ntimes of crisis the church has historically learned to return to \nJesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus is Lord. That is our foundational confession. It was central \nfor the early church and needs to again become central to us. If \nJesus is Lord, then Caesar is notnor any other political ruler \nsince. If Jesus is Lord, no other authority is absolute. Jesus \nChrist, and the kingdom of God he announced, is the Christians first \nloyalty, above all others. We pray, Thy kingdom come, thy will be \ndone, in earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10, KJV). Our faith is \npersonal but never private, meant not only for heaven but for this \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question we face is this: Who is Jesus Christ for us today? What \ndoes our loyalty to Christ as disciples require at this moment in our \nhistory? We believe it is time to renew our theology of public \ndiscipleship and witness. Applying what Jesus is Lord means today \nis the message we commend as elder to our churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we believe leads us to what we must reject. Our yes is the \nfoundation for our no. What we confess as our faith leads to what we \nconfront. Therefore, we offer the following six affirmations of what \nwe believe, and the resulting rejections of practices and policies by \npolitical leaders that dangerously corrode the soul of the nation and \ndeeply threaten the public integrity of our faith. We pray that we, \nas followers of Jesus, will find the depth of faith to match the \ndanger of our political crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nI. WE BELIEVE each human being is made in Gods image and likeness \n(Genesis 1:26). That image and likeness confers a divinely decreed \ndignity, worth, and God-given equality to all of us as children of \nthe one God who is the Creator of all things. Racial bigotry is a \nbrutal denial of the image of God. Racial justice and healing are \nbiblical and theological issues for us, and are central to the \nmission of the body of Christ in the world. We give thanks for the \nprophetic role of the historic Black churches in America when they \nhave called for a more faithful gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHEREFORE, WE REJECT the resurgence of White nationalism and racism \nin our nation on many fronts, including the highest levels for \npolitical gain that we have seen. In the face of such bigotry, \nsilence is complicity. In particular, we reject White supremacy and \ncommit ourselves to dismantle the systems and structures that \nperpetuate White preference and advantage. Further, any doctrines or \npolitical strategies that use racist resentments, fears, or language \nmust be named as public sinone that goes back to the foundation of \nour nation and lingers on. Racial bigotry must be antithetical to \nthose belonging to the body of Christ, because it denies the truth of \nthe gospel we profess.\u0014\n\u0014\nII. WE BELIEVE we are one body. In Christ there is to be no \noppression based o race, gender, identity, or class (Galatians 3:28). \nThe body of Christ, where those great human divisions are to be \novercome, is meant to be an example for the rest of society. When we \nfail to overcome these oppressive obstacles, and even perpetuate \nthem, we have failed in our vocation to the worldto proclaim and \nlive the reconciling gospel of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHEREFORE, WE REJECT misogyny, the mistreatment, violent abuse, \nsexual harassment, and assault of women that has been further \nrevealed in our culture and politics, including our churches, and the \noppression of any other child of God. We lament when such practices \nseem publicly ignored, and thus privately condoned, by those in high \npositions of leadership. We stand for the respect, protection, and \naffirmation of women in our families, communities, workplaces, \npolitics, and churches. We support the courageous truth-telling \nvoices of women, who have helped the nation recognize these abuses. \nWe confess sexism as a sin, requiring our repentance and resistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIII. WE BELIEVE how we treat the hungry, the thirsty, the naked, the \nstranger, the sick, and the prisoner is how we treat Christ Himself \n(Matthew 25:31-46). Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of \nthe least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me \n(verse 40, NRSV). God calls us to protect and seek justice for those \nwho are poor and vulnerable, and our treatment of people who are \noppressed, strangers, outsiders, or otherwise considered \nmarginal is a test of our relationship to God, who made us all \nequal in divine dignity and love. Our proclamation of the Lordship of \nJesus Christ is at stake in our solidarity with the most vulnerable. \nIf our gospel is not good news to the poor, it is not the gospel of \nJesus Christ (Luke 4:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nTHEREFORE, WE REJECT the language and politics of political leaders \nwho would debase and abandon the most vulnerable children of God. We \nstrongly deplore the growing attacks on immigrants and refugees, who \nare being made into cultural and political targets, and we need to \nremind our churches that God makes the treatment of the stranger \namong us a test of faith (Leviticus 19:33, 34). We wont accept the \nneglect of the well-being of low-income families and children, and we \nwill resist repeated attempts to deny health care to those who most \nneed it. We confess our national growing sin of putting the rich over \nthe poor. We reject the immoral logic of cutting services and \nprograms for the poor while cutting taxes for the rich. Budgets are \nmoral documents. We commit ourselves to opposing and reversing those \npolicies and finding solutions that reflect the wisdom of people from \ndifferent political parties and philosophies to seek the common good. \nProtecting the poor is a central commitment of Christian \ndiscipleship, to which 2,000 verses in the Bible attest.\u0014\n\u0014\nIV. WE BELIEVE that truth is morally central to our personal and \npublic lives. Truth-telling is central to the prophetic biblical \ntradition, whose vocation includes speaking the truth to power. A \ncommitment to speaking truth, the ninth commandment of the Decalogue, \nYou shall not bear false witness (Exodus 20:16, NRSV), is \nfoundational to share trust in society. Falsehood can enslave us, but \nJesus promises, You will know the truth, and the truth will set you \nfree (John 8:32, NIV).2 The search and respect for truth is crucial \nto anyone who follows Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHEREFORE, WE REJECT the practice and pattern of lying that is \ninvading our political and civil life. Politicians, like the rest of \nus, are human, fallible, sinful, and mortal. But when public lying \nbecomes so persistent that it deliberately tries to change facts for \nideological, political, or personal gain, the public accountability \nto truth is undermined. The regular purveying of falsehoods and \nconsistent lying by the nations highest leaders can change the moral \nexpectations within a culture, the accountability for a civil \nsociety, and even the behavior of families and children. The \nnormalization of lying presents a profound moral danger to the fabric \nof society. In the face of lies that bring darkness, Jesus is our \ntruth and our light.\u0014\n\u0014\nV. WE BELIEVE that Christs way of leadership is servanthood, not \ndomination. Jesus said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles \n[the world] lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over \nthem. It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great \namong you must be your servant (Matthew 20:25, 26, NRSV). We believe \nour elected officials are called to public service, not public \ntyranny, so we must protect the limits, checks, and balances of \ndemocracy and encourage humility and civility on the part of elected \nofficials. We support democracy, not because we believe in human \nperfection, but because we do not. The authority of government is \ninstituted by God to order an unredeemed society for the sake of \njustice and peace, but ultimate authority belongs only to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nVI. WE BELIEVE Jesus when He tells us to go into all nations making \ndisciples (Matthew 28:18-20). Or churches and our nations are part of \nan international community whose interests always surpass national \nboundaries. The most well-known verse in the New Testament starts \nwith For God so loved the world (John 3:16, KJV). We, in turn, \nshould love and serve the world and all its inhabitants, rather than \nseek first narrow, nationalistic prerogatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHEREFORE, WE REJECT America first as a theological heresy for \nfollowers of Christ. While we share a patriotic love for our country, \nwe reject xenophobic or ethnic nationalism that places one nation \nover others as a political goal. We reject domination rather than \nstewardship of the earths resources, toward genuine global \ndevelopment that brings human flourishing for all of Gods children. \nServing our own communities is essential, but the global connections \nbetween us are undeniable. Global poverty, environmental damage, \nviolent conflict, weapons of mass destruction, and deadly diseases in \nsome places ultimately affect all places, and we need wise political \nleadership to deal with each of these.\u0014\n\u0014\nWE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED for the soul of our nation, but also for our \nchurches and the integrity of our faith. The present crisis calls us \nto go deeperdeeper into our relationship to God; deeper into our \nrelationship with each other, especially across racial, ethnic, and \nnational lines; deeper into our relationships with the most \nvulnerable, who are at greater risk.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church is always subject to temptations to power, to cultural \nconformity, and to racial, class, and gender divides, as Galatians \n3:28 teaches us. But our answer is to be in Christ, and to not be \nconformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your \nminds, so that you may discern what is the will of Godwhat is good \nand acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:1, 2, NRSV).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best response to our political, material, cultural, racial, or \nnational idolatries is the first commandment:  You shall love the \nLord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all \nyour mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second \nis like unto it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these \ntwo commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets (Matthew \n22:37-40, NKJV).3 As to loving our neighbors, we would add no \nexceptions.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe commend this letter to pastors, local churches, and young people \nwho are watching and waiting to see what the churches will say and do \nat such a time as this.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur urgent need, in a time of moral and political crisis, is to \nrecover of confessing our faith. Lament, repent, and then repair. If \nJesus is Lord, there is always space for grace. We believe it is time \nto speak and to act in faith and conscience, not because of politics, \nbut because we are disciples of Jesus Christto whom be all \nauthority, honor, and glory. It is time for a fresh confession of \nfaith. He is the light in our darkness. I am the light of the world. \nWhoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the \nlight of life (John 8:12, NRSV).\u0014\n\u0014\n______________\u0014\n\u0014\nThis appeared as an article in Christian Ethics Today, Spring 2018, \nand is used by permission.

    "title": "CAUGHT UP WITH JESUS IN THE AIR",
    "words": "CAUGHT UP WITH JESUS IN THE AIR\u0014\n[John Nelson Darby]\u0014\n\u0014\nFROM LEFT BEHIND to numerology, the picture of the last things \npainted by many Christians today looks different than it did before \nthe middle of the nineteenth century. Up to that point, most American \nevangelicals imagined that the church was the New Israel, heir to the \npromises of the Old and New Testaments. It would persevere through \ntribulation to triumph and enter the blessed millennium of Revelation \n20. Only then would Christ return to bring about the consummation of \nall things. That view, known as postmillennialism, formed a near \nconsensus.\u0014\n \u0014\nBeginning in the 1830s, a new paradigm, in which Christ would rapture \nbelievers before a great tribulation that would precede the \nmillennium, began to displace the old. By the early twentieth \ncentury, this view, known as premillennialism, had come to \npredominate. Its chief architect: John Nelson Darby.\u0014\n\u0014\ncalled to god, not the bar\u0014\n\u0014\nThe youngest son of a wealthy Anglo-Irish merchant, Darby was born in \nLondon in 1800 into a world of commerce and privilege. All was not \nidealhe had a distant father and an absent motherbut he showed \nresourcefulness and talent, graduating in 1819 from Trinity College, \nDublin, as its top-ranked classics student. A promising career in law \nawaited him, but by then his religious turn was already underway. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not entirely surprisingTrinity College was a stronghold of \nAnglican Evangelicalism. Though called to the bar as a lawyer in \n1822, Darby forsook that profession to enter the Anglican ministry. \nAfter his 1826 ordination in the Church of Ireland, he took charge of \na destitute parish in rural County Wicklow, about 15 miles south of \nDublin. His parishioners knew him as a tireless, compassionate, and \nintensely earnest priest.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a priest troubled in spirit, though, as his developing views \nof true Christianity increasingly clashed with the Anglican \nestablishment. A turning point came in 1827, when a serious injury \nforced him into extended convalescence. He spent months of \nrecuperation pondering his vexed questions. Soon a set of core \nconvictions emerged. One was radical biblicismtruth found in \nScripture alone, interpreted literally in its plain meaning. Another \ntouched on ecclesiology: he saw the church as a spiritual priesthood \nof believers. And finally Darby found certain assurance of Christs \nSecond Coming followed by a millennial reign on earth. He grew \nfurther estranged from Anglicanism. Meanwhile he began to affiliate \nwith likeminded people dismayed by Christian division and unbiblical \ntraditions. They longed for the purity, simplicity, and unity they \nsaw in the New Testament and called themselves Brethrenand, like \nDarby, they were making their way out of the established church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy turns personable and persuasive, disheveled and difficult, Darby \nwas a force of nature; he soon dominated the young movement through \nwill and strength of intellect. One could find his imprint virtually \neverywhere, but especially in the Brethrens understanding of the end \nof time. Europe in the early nineteenth centurywracked by political, \neconomic, and social revolutionformed a cauldron of prophetic \nspeculation. Darby interacted with millenarian views of Edward Irving \n(17921834), a Presbyterian who ended up founding his own movement, \nas well as Jesuits and Jansenists (the last was a Catholic movement \nemphasizing human depravity and divine sovereignty).\u0014\n\u0014\nDarbys system turned on a sharp distinction between Israel and the \nchurch. Rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15) meant \nrecognizing their distinct roles and correctly discerning the \ndealings of God with each. Israel is an earthly entity, the recipient \nof temporal promises literally fulfilled on earth. The church is a \nheavenly entity, the recipient of spiritual promises fulfilled in the \nheavenlies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith that principle of interpretation in place, the divine narrative \ncame more clearly into view, though still not as clearly as Darbys \nreaders might have wished: he wrote voluminously and imaginatively \nbut not lucidly. His mature scheme, though, generally identified six \ndispensations. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first began with Adam and extended to the great flood. The second \nstretched from Noah to Abraham. The Abrahamic dispensation continued \nuntil the giving of the law to Moses. The fourth dispensationthe \ndispensation of Israelwas the most complex and crucial. Not only did \nit contain three subdispensations (law, priesthood, and kingship), it \nalso featured an innovation that, for Darby, unlocked the secrets of \nthe last days. He felt Israels rejection of the Messiah had \ninterrupted the fourth dispensation after week 69 of the 70 weeks \nprophesied in Daniel 9:24. The result was a fifth dispensation, a \nvast parenthesis within the fourth, unrevealed to Old Testament \nprophets and governed by Gods dealings with the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nthe interrupted story\u0014\n\u0014\nLiving Christians, then, found themselves in the Gentile \ndispensation, the Church Age, but how might they expect it to end? \nHere Darby introduced another distinctive feature: 1 Thessalonians \n4:17, where the saints are caught up to meet the Lord in the air, \npointed to a future rapture that would remove the church and end the \nGentile dispensation. Christ would return and take Christians to \ntheir reward, resuming the interrupted dispensation of Israel before \na period of intense tribulationDaniels 70th week. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what a week: the great tribulation, the rise of the Antichrist, \nArmageddon, and the triumphant return of Christ in the long-awaited \nSecond Coming. Afterward, with Satan bound and the Antichrist \ndefeated, the millenniumDarbys sixth dispensationwould begin, the \nfinal stage in Gods dealings with his earthly people, Israel. \nRaptured Christians, meanwhile, would enjoy eternal bliss in heaven. \nFinally, at the end of the millennium, all believers would be united \nin the new heaven and the new earth of Revelation 21.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those who followed this logic and verified the scriptural \ncoordinates on which it rested, this argument held great coherence, \nexplanatory power, and persuasive forceand it placed Darbys readers \ninto a gripping narrative with the whole of history in its view.\u0014\n\u0014\nonly a spiritual church\u0014\n\u0014\nDarby grounded his beliefs about the church in his beliefs about the \nend times. Like other primitivists he sought to follow the apostolic \nchurch. Yet he also adamantly opposed any attempt to restore \napostolic glory. Every dispensation was destined to end in failure; \nthe present was no exception. The visible church lay in ruins, an \napostate Christendom. The true church, spiritual and invisible, \nwithout creed or clergy, persisted only as a faithful remnant. Gods \nplan for the church now was rapture, not restoration.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarby remained an influential figure, but controversy dogged his \nlater decades. In the 1840s a series of disputes escalated into a \nfull-scale schism that split the movement, with Darby at the head of \nthe smaller Exclusive Brethren wing. He grew estranged from many of \nthe movements cofounders and came under attack from junior \nassociates and younger Open Brethren, who held him responsible for \ndividing the movement. Yet he persevered, itinerating into his \neighties. His health failed him in 1881, first through a fall and \nthen a stroke. He rapidly declined and breathed his last on April 29, \n1882.\u0014\nThough indefatigable and overpowering, Darby was ill-equipped to \npopularize his own system. Spreading dispensational premillennialism \nto the masses depended on more pragmatic spirits. By the late 1870s, \nit had begun to prevail in prophecy conferences and camp meetings \nacross North America, with dynamic champions like Dwight L. Moody \n(18371899), A. J. Gordon (18361895), and A. B. Simpson (18431919). \u0014\n\u0014\nIt swept the holiness movement and was carried forward into \nPentecostalism. In the mid-twentieth century, it was broadcast by \nradio evangelists like Charles Fuller (18871968) and propagated by \nfundamentalist institutions. Along the way it was adapted, \nsystematized, and refined into a seven-dispensation system by \nscholars like Cyrus Scofield (18431921)whose Scofield Bible was its \ngreatest single aidand Charles C. Ryrie (19252016), who also \nproduced a popular study Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are approaching 200 years since Darby first began to formulate his \nideas, but his influence has not abated. Whenever American \nevangelicals today ponder the state of the Late, Great Planet Earth, \nor shudder in fear of being Left Behind, they reveal the extent to \nwhich they are living in the world Darby fashioned. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Roger Robins, Christin History Magazine  11/2018\u0014",

    "words": "Constantine was a brutal sociopath who murdered his eldest son, \ndecapitated his brother-in-law and killed his wife by boiling her \nalive, and that was after he proclaimed that he had converted from \nworshipping the sun god to being a Christian. Yet he also changed the \ncourse of Christian history, ultimately influencing which books made \nit into the New Testament.\u0014\n----\u0014\nBy that point, the primary disputes centered on whether Jesus was \nGodthe followers of a priest named Arius said no, that God created \nJesus. But the Bishop of Alexander said yes, that Jesus had existed \nthroughout all eternity. The dispute raged on in the streets of \nConstantinople, with everyoneshopkeepers, bakers and \ntradesmenarguing about which view was right. Constantine, in a \nreflection of his shallow understanding of theology, was annoyed that \nwhat he considered a minor dispute was causing such turmoil, and \nfeared that it weaken him politically. So he decided to force an \nagreement on the question.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine convened a meeting in the lakeside town of Nicaea. \nInvitations were sent around the world to bishops and leaders of \nvarious sects, although not all of them. The group included the \neducated and the illiterate, zealots and hermits. Constantine arrived \nwearing jewels and gold on his scarlet robe and pearls on his crown, \neager to discuss the true essence of a poor carpenter who had died \n300 years before. \u0014\n\u0014\nThings that are today accepted without much thought were adopted or \nreinforced at Nicaea. For example, the Old Testament was clear in \ndeclaring that God rested on the seventh day, making it the Sabbath. \nThe seventh day of the week is Saturday, the day of Jewish worship \nand rest. (Jesus himself invoked the holiness of the Jewish Sabbath.) \nThe word Sunday does not appear in the Bible, either as the Sabbath \nor anything else. But four years before Nicaea, Constantine declared \nSunday as a day of rest in honor of the sun god.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Nicaea, rules were adopted regarding the proper positions for \nprayer on Sundaysstanding, not kneeling; nothing was said of the \nJewish Sabbath or Saturday. Many theologians and Christian historians \nbelieve that it was at this moment, to satisfy Constantine and his \ncommitment to his empires many sun worshippers, that the Holy \nSabbath was moved by one day, contradicting the clear words of what \nultimately became the Bible. And while the Bible mentioned nothing \nabout the day of Jesuss birth, the birth of the sun god was \ncelebrated on December 25 in Rome; Christian historians of the 12th \ncentury wrote that it was the pagan holiday that led to the \ndesignation of that date for Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nPauls writings are consistent in his reference to God as one being \nand Jesus as his son. Same with the Gospel of Matthew, where Peter \ntells Jesus that he is the Son of the living God and Jesus responds \nthat Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father \nwhich is in heaven. Jesus even called out to God as his Father as \nhe was dying on the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Constantine sided with those who believed Jesus was both God and \nman, so a statement of belief, called the Nicene Creed, was composed \nto proclaim that. Those who refused to sign the statement were \nbanished. Others were slaughtered. After they had returned home and \nwere far from Rome, some who signed the document later sent letters \nto Constantine saying they had only done so out of fear for their \nlives.\u0014",

    "title": "CALCULATING 666",
    "words": "If theres one part of the Bible virtually everyone has heard of, \nits 666the number of Beast. And if theres one thing no one can \nagree upon, its what that number stands for. We see 666 in \nRevelation 13:18: let the one who has understanding calculate the \nnumber of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is \n666.\u0014\nThe wording here is important: John tells readers that the number \nmust be calculated, which means there must be a hidden meaning \nbehind it. But how do we calculate it?\u0014\n\u0014\nCalculating 666\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to 666, one gematria explanation is that the number \nrepresents Nero Caesar. The Greek Neron Kaisar adds up to 1,005, but \nwhen the name is transliterated into the Hebrew letters nrwn qsr, the \nsum is 666. Nero Caesar also would explain the variant number of the \nBeast (616) found in some New Testament manuscripts. Transliterating \nthe Latin Nero Caesar into Hebrew, nrw qsr, yields 616, suggesting \nJohn may have been thinking of the well-known Nero Redivivus myth \nwhen writing about the Beast (i.e., that Nero would rise from the \ndead to destroy Christians).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gematria solution presents three major problems: It could be \nviewed as cheating with the spellings (the usual Hebrew spelling for \nCaesar is q?st, not qsr, although the qsr form does exist). It \nassumes that readers knew Hebrew well enough to do the \ntransliteration from Greek back into Hebrew. And, perhaps most \ntellingly, the early Christian commentators who knew of the Nero \nredivivus myth never identified 666 with Nero.\u0014\n\u0014\nAncient Sudoku\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is another possibility: 666 is a magic square. From very \nancient times, philosophers and mathematicians were fascinated that \nthe numbers 136 could be arranged in squares so that each row and \ndiagonal would add up to the same sum (the same principle as modern \nSudoku). One magic square has four rows and two diagonals that each \nadd up to 111. The six lines of 111 equal 666. Each magic square in \nancient Jewish and Greek tradition was also associated with a \ncelestial body. In the case of the 666 square, that body was the sun, \nwhich was associated with Zeus, the highest god in the Greek pantheon.\u0014\n\u0014\nZeus was often associated with Baal and the mythological north \n(tsaphon) of Canaanite religion. Most relevant to the Beast of \nRevelation is Baals (and Zeus) title, lord of heaven \n(Baal-shamem). It is possible that the abomination of desolation in \nDaniel 9:27 (shiqquts-shamem) is a play on Baal-shamem, since the Old \nTestament writers sometimes substituted words that meant shame or \nabomination into proper names that formerly contained Baal (e.g., \nMephibosheth, Ish-Bosheth).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis would mean 666 is a symbol for the abominable Baal, the dark \nlord of the Old Testament worldsatanic power in New Testament \nthinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Michael S. Heiser\u0014",

    "words": "Caroline Chisholm, Australian Immigrants' Friend\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen Caroline Chisholm knew death was near, she asked that the \nsacrament be brought to her. She died in London of bronchitis on this \nday, March 25, 1877. The Times gave her ten lines. Australian papers \nprinted only a notice paid for by her children. This was shocking \ntreatment of one whose faith had done much for Australia.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile still a newcomer to Australia, Caroline had seen a group of \ngirls standing on the shore looking confused and dejected. She spoke \nwith them and found that they were immigrants, sleeping at night in \nthe shelter of \"the rocks,\" Sydney's crime district. No one would \nhire them. Although they were decent orphans, they were labeled as \ntrollops. A few girls had turned to prostitution when their hunger \nbecame acute. Their neglect was owing to the fact that most were \nIrish, and the Protestants of Sydney despised their Catholic faith. \nAnother factor which played into their neglect was past experience, \nfor criminal women had been put on the ships.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer conscience stirred, Caroline inquired what each girl could do and \npromised help. She called on her acquaintances and placed several \ngirls as servants in homes. If Caroline vouched that they were \ndecent--well, the ladies would give them a try. Those that Caroline \ncouldn't place, she took home with her. Her housekeeper taught them a \nfew skills, and soon Caroline found positions for them, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, she lobbied the government for an old barracks to house \nnew arrivals. The governor resisted. Then Mary Teague, a newcomer, \nwas charged with drunkenness. She protested that she was just wobbly \nfrom hunger, not having had a bite to eat in two days. The judge did \nnot believe her and ordered her exposed in the stocks for an hour. \nWhen released, Mary wandered off until she collapsed. She was found \nlying in a ditch, near death, with nothing but the clothes on her \nback. The Chronicle printed the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmbarrassed, the governor finally gave Caroline a small space. She \ndecided to spend the night there. \"But I was put to the proof at \nstarting: scarce was the light out, when I fancied a few dogs must be \nin the room, and, in some terror, I got a light.\" To her horror, she \nsaw rats everywhere. She almost fled, but hesitated. If she ran now, \nshe would be the laugh of the town. Her plan to shelter immigrant \ngirls would be ruined. \"I therefore lighted a second candle, and \nseating myself on the bed, kept there until three rats, descending \nfrom the roof, alighted on my shoulders. I knew that I was getting \ninto a fever, in fact, that I should be very ill before morning; but \nto be out-generaled by rats was too much...\" She stuck it out and fed \nthe vermin poison the next night.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaroline devoted her leisure time to the poor girls, \"determined with \nGod's blessing, never to rest until decent protection was afforded \nthem.\" This meant she had to leave her own children in care of \nothers. She even established a job registry and drove girls into the \ncountry herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen churches would not help, she turned to God alone. The good she \ndid was incalculable. That is why Australia later carried her picture \non its five dollar bill for over twenty years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nChisholm, Caroline. \"Female Immigration Considered in a Brief Account \nof the Sydney Immigrants' Home.\" London, 1842.\u0014\n\"Chisholm, Caroline.\" Dictionary of National Biography.

Forty years of scholarship later, one can \nrightfully quibble about some historical details (clarifications and \nsome updated findings are in brackets). But no other narrative \nconveys as well the human dimension of this critical event.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexander of Alexandria had called a meeting of the presbyters \n[priests]. According to the historian Socrates, the aging pope \n[some early senior bishops were called papa, that is, father] \nwith perhaps too philosophical minuteness began to lecture on the \ntheological mystery of the Holy Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexander had been discussing the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost \nfor some time when he was interrupted by one of the presbyters called \nArius, a native of Libya. There is no evidence that Alexander was a \nprofound theologian. He may have bumbled, and it is possible that \nArius was justified in accusing Alexander of Sabellianism, a heresy \nthat involved a belief in the unity of God at the expense of the \nreality of the Trinity. But in combating Alexander, Arius fell into a \nnew heresy, for he announced, If the Father begat the Son, then he \nwho was begotten had a beginning in existence, and from this it \nfollows there was a time when the Son was not.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere, at some time in 319, the cry of the AriansThere was a time \nwhen the Son was notwas first heard. The words were to have an \nextraordinary influence on the shaping of the church.

Membership among Protestants dropped from 73% to \n67% percent over the same period.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong Hispanic Americans, church membership dropped from 68% to 45% \nsince 2000, a much bigger decline than for non-Hispanic white and \nblack Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a big discrepancy over that 20-year period in regard to \npolitical affiliation: Church membership among Democrats fell from \n71% to 48%, compared to a more modest drop from 77% to 69% among \nRepublicans.\u0014\nDavid Campbell, a University of Notre Dame political science \nprofessor who studies religion's role in U.S. civic life, attributed \nthe partisan divide to \"the allergic reaction many Americans have to \nthe mixture of religion and conservative politics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Increasingly, Americans associate religion with the Republican Party \n and if they are not Republicans themselves, they turn away from \nreligion,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Chaves, a professor of sociology, religion and divinity at Duke \nUniversity, said that as recently as the 1970s, it was difficult to \npredict someone's political party by the regularity with which they \nwent to church.\u0014\n\"Now it's one of the best predictors,\" he said. \"The correlation \nbetween religiosity and being Republican has increased over the \nyears.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe overall decline in church membership is driven by cultural and \ngenerational factors, said Nancy Ammerman, a professor of the \nsociology of religion at Boston University.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Culturally, we are seeing significant erosion in the trust people \nhave for institutions in general and churches in particular,\" she \nsaid. \"We are also seeing a generational shift as the 'joiner' older \ngeneration dies off and a generation of non-joiners comes on the \nscene.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new Gallup findings underscore that generational dynamic. Among \nAmericans 65 and older, church membership in 2016-2018 averaged 64% \npercent, compared to 41% among those aged 18-29.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The challenge is clear for churches, which depend on loyal and \nactive members to keep them open and thriving,\" wrote Gallup poll \nanalyst Jeffrey Jones. \"How do they find ways to convince some of the \nunaffiliated religious adults in society to make a commitment to a \nparticular house of worship of their chosen faith?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"These trends are not just numbers, but play out in the reality that \nthousands of U.S. churches are closing each year,\" Jones added. \n\"Religious Americans in the future will likely be faced with fewer \noptions for places of worship, and likely less convenient ones, which \ncould accelerate the decline in membership even more.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor Scott Thumma, who teaches sociology of religion at Hartford \nSeminary, suggested several likely factors behind the decline. Among \nthem, he said religious young adults are delaying marriage, \npostponing having children, and, when they do, having fewer children.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also suggested there was diminished social pressure to formally \njoin organizations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've encountered many persons in churches that have attended for \nseveral years but did not officially join or become a member,\" he \nsaid by email. \"This is also evident in persons switching from one \ncongregation to another without joining any.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe findings are based on Gallup surveys conducted over the last 20 \nyears, with most surveys including at least 2,000 U.S. adults and \nhaving a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Some \nfindings are based on aggregated interviews from 1998-2000 and \n2016-2018, with each period including interviews with more than 7,000 \nadults.\u0014",

Why Did God Allow Men to Take Concubines in the \nBible?\u0014\n\u0014\n\tEmily Hall   2019  May 09   iBelieve.com\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Bible, a concubine was a woman acquired by a man as a \nsecondary wife. Her purpose was to provide a male heir in the case of \na barren wife, to provide more children in general to enhance the \nfamilys workforce and wealth, and to satisfy the mans sexual \ndesires. A concubine was endowed with rights and protections by \nHebrew law but was not equal in status to a wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nA woman living as a concubine was more common in Israel during the \npatriarchal period of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob than in later \nperiods, but it still happened among the wealthy and especially the \nroyal like King David and King Solomon.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough God provided rights and protections for concubines in the \nLaw of Moses, God did not introduce or approve of this marital model. \nThe Hebrew word for concubine, Piylegesh, isnt even of Hebrew \norigin. Its a non-Semitic loanword borrowed to refer to a \nphenomenon not indigenous to Israel, according to Bakers Dictionary \nof Biblical Theology.\u0014\nDavid L. Baker, theologian and seminary professor, said this:\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the ancient Near East, it was acceptable for a married man to \nhave a secondary wife or concubine, so long as he had the resources \nto support a large family. Apart from working in the home and \nproviding sexual companionship, a major role for a concubine would be \nto produce children, to increase the work force in a household.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Polygamy and concubinage were also allowed in ancient Israel and \nseem to be have been quite common in the patriarchal period (age of \nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob), but after that most marriages of \ncommoners were monogamous.\u0014\nWho Were Concubines in the Bible? \u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/What Is a Concubine\u0014",

    "words": "Can We Finally Break the Silence Around Tamar? \u0014\n\u0014\nTelling the uncomfortable story of desolate Tamar positions us to \nshow a kind of compassion King David didnt.\u0014\n\u0014\nJen Wilkin  May17, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the past year, Ive been teaching the Book of Samuel to a group \nof women at my church. We go through it chapter by chapter, verse by \nverse, and I challenge them to think critically about what they are \nreading. The Book of Samuel is filled with stories that ask us to \ngrapple with the sovereignty of God and the severity of sin. But \nperhaps none is so jarring as the story of Tamar and Amnon in 2 \nSamuel 13.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm sure you know it. Amnon, one of Davids sons, violates his own \nsister and then casts her aside. When her brother Absalom learns what \nAmnon has done, he tells her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? \nBe quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this \nthing to heart. Absaloms shushing and dismissing are certainly \nvile, but it is Davids reaction that stuns: When King David heard \nall this, he was furious (vv. 2021).\u0014\n\u0014\nFurious. Thats it. No public denouncement of Amnon, no vindication \nof Tamar. No justice, no words of comfort or kindness for his \ndaughter, just impotent, mute anger. David is silent. He takes no \naction against Amnon, opening the door for Absalom to have his \nbrother murdered in revenge. And Tamar is left desolate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does Davids anger translate into silence and inaction? Because \nDavid sees in his sons an amplification of his own grievous sins. \nDavid sacrificed Bathsheba to his lust and then murdered her husband \nto cover his tracks. Now his two sons fulfill Gods prophecy of \njudgment by committing heightened versions of his own sins within \ntheir own family.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavids guilt renders him silent. Tamars plea to Amnon as he \noverpowers her rings in the ears of the reader: As for me, where \ncould I carry my shame? And Davids profound silence gives us our \nanswer: Nowhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavids inaction should spur us to act. Davids speechlessness should \nprompt us to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe thing about teaching entire books of the Bible line by line is \nthat you cant skip over the uncomfortable parts. People notice. So \nwe pressed through the passage, knowing it was bound to be a tender \nsubject for women among us with similar experiences and offering help \nto anyone who needed it. My heart was crushed by how common Tamars \nstory turned out to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer story is common. But telling her story is not.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt occurred to me that in all my years in the church, I had never \nheard a sermon about Tamar. The other women on my teaching team \ncouldnt recall hearing it preached either. And no wonderit is \nhardly proper subject matter for Sunday morning. Tamar makes only \nthe rarest of appearances in sermons or teachings, and when she does, \nher story tends to be subsumed, muffled, or downplayed by our \nconcerns to preserve Davids reputation as a man after Gods own \nheart.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a line we often hear attributed to Dietrich Bonhoeffer: \nSilence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us \nguiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat silence from our pulpits and lecterns speaks to women who share \nTamars history: Your shame is merited. Your story is shocking and \nlewd. It causes us discomfort, and we wish to pass it by.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy teaching faithfully, forthrightly, and compassionately about \nTamar, we communicate the opposite to women: Your story deserves a \nhearing. Your grief is our grief. Your shame is undeserved. We will \nhelp you carry it to the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nTamar was defiled and cast off by the son of David, and none came to \nher aid. The true Son of David was defiled and cast off for us, that \nno daughter in the family of God should ever carry shame for abuse \nshe has suffered.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavids inaction should spur us to act. Davids speechlessness should \nprompt us to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere should be no desolate women in the church, only daughters of \nGod who are seen and cherished.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy speaking of Tamar, we are speaking to the women in our churches \nwhose voices have grown silent beneath their shame. We are inviting \nthem to tell and to heal.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we tell Tamars story aloud, we dignify her grief. And we begin \nto become for our sisters the advocates Tamar should have had.\u0014\n\u0014\nJen Wilkin is a wife, mom, and Bible teacher\u0014",

    "words": "Canadas Missing, Murdered Indigenous Women Often Ignored\u0014\nBy Cheryl Bear\u0014\n|\u0014\nAugust 9, 2019   EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nEditors note: The following column may contain material that could \nbe disturbing to some readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe focus of the first three years of Canadian Baptist Ministries \n(CBM) She Matters campaign highlighted global gender inequity for \ngirls and women around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lens turned back home in its fourth year with She Matters 4 \nCanada, which focused on indigenous women in our own country.\u0014\nAs CBMs spokesperson for the campaign, it was a chance to tell my \npersonal stories on one of the toughest subjects ever, murdered and \nmissing indigenous woman and girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nI often say if you ask an indigenous person if they know of a missing \nor murdered indigenous woman or girl, they will likely say no. No, I \ndont just know one. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the case for most of us because our indigenous communities \nare very close. We also know many people from neighboring reserves \nbecause we are so connected.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2016, the government of Canada opened a national inquiry into the \nmurdered and missing indigenous woman and girls, spurred on by the \nfrequent requests of many indigenous families, communities and \nleaders. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere were 2,386 participants in the Truth Gathering Process from all \nacross the land. The inquiry pulled away a veil of secrecy that was \nCanada-wide and used the word genocide in their final report.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a high school in Abbotsford this past spring, Marion Buller, the \nchief commissioner of the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered \nIndigenous Woman and Girls, shared stories from families who had lost \ntheir loved ones. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe said the original number of deaths is far more than originally \nreported (approximately 1,000) because many deaths of indigenous \nwomen are ruled nonsuspicious.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne young woman, whose death had been ruled a suicide, had been found \nshot in the back. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was another story in the news from up north where a young \nindigenous woman was found in a ditch, naked, an hour outside of her \ncommunity. Her death was also ruled nonsuspicious.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy heart aches to read these stories and to think about how many \nprecious lives have been taken and how many communities are left to \ngrieve\u0014\n. \u0014\nGrieving a loss is one thing. Grief is made even worse when there are \nno answers, or when an obvious murder has been deemed unworthy of \nfurther investigation. Injustice compounds grief.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I am invited to speak to churches, I ask, If you did not know \nabout the residential schools your whole life, what else could Canada \nhide from you about indigenous people? \u0014\n\u0014\nThese government-funded schools were administered by Christian \nchurches and created for the purpose of removing indigenous children \nfrom the influence of their own culture and assimilating them into \nthe dominant Canadian culture. Because of an incomplete historical \nrecord, the number of school-related deaths are unknown but are \nestimated to range between 3,200 and more than 6,000.\u0014\nCanadians deserve to hear from indigenous people about indigenous \nissues. Listening to these stories is important. \u0014\n\u0014\nDecades of ignorance about the residential schools made it clear that \nCanada does not willingly admit there is a problem.\u0014\nSomething has to change, especially if we as Christians truly believe \nthat humankind is created in the image of God.\u0014\nOne of the reasons it is so easy to dismiss the news reports about \nmurdered and missing indigenous woman and girls is because of \nstereotype and objectification.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt started back in the day when explorers from Europe were given the \nmandate called the (Christian) Doctrine of Discovery. The land was \nconsidered terra nullius  empty  if there was no recognized monarch \nfound.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the 1500s, there were debates about whether or not indigenous \npeople had souls. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we had souls, their obligation was to send missionaries. If we did \nnot have souls, we could be exterminated.\u0014\n\u0014\nMissionaries were sent after a papal announcement that indigenous \npeople indeed had souls. Thus, began the second extermination \nattempt, which still continues today in some forms  termination by \nassimilation.\u0014\n\u0014\nCanada has controlled the story from those days until today. \nIndigenous people have either been portrayed as dumb or as scary. \u0014\nSuch stereotyping is dangerous because it keeps us locked in \nposition, never able to understand one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other tactic is objectification. It is easier to dismiss news \nabout indigenous people, to ignore treaties and to treat others badly \nwhen we can objectify them  defined by Dictionary.com as degrade to \nthe status of a mere object.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was in sixth grade, my teacher announced we would be studying \nIndians in Canada. I suddenly felt a little bit special.\u0014\nBut then the teacher said, Well be studying the Hurons who are in \neastern Canada. But  they might be extinct. My euphoria left \nimmediately replaced by a feeling of utter objectification and \ninvisibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one would say those words today. But instead, we read biased news \nstories and hear our neighbors use derogatory stereotypes without \neven questioning where these ideas came from and why they persist \nuntil today.\u0014\n\u0014\nStereotyping can have deadly repercussions. This is only one of the \nreasons why there are so many indigenous women and girls at risk.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a joke making the rounds on the internet that said, You \nknow youre Indian when. There were many funny comments posted by \nindigenous people themselves. We like to poke fun at ourselves, and \nindigenous people are often humorous.\u0014\nThen, an indigenous radio host named Gunargie OSullivan, \n(Gaaxstalas) added a grave statement, You know youre Indian when \nyou go missing, and no one looks for you.\u0014",

In 1976, the \nUnited States issued a stamp commemorating the Lutheran nurse. \nLutherans honor her on this day, August 13, calling her a \"Renewer of \nSociety.\" What did she do to attain these honors?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe oldest of ten children in a German immigrant family, Clara became \na caring person. She worked as a mother's helper during her high \nschool years, then in an orphanage.

Clara, having nursed patients with this deadly \ndisease, and she wanted to see it overcome. She volunteered to be \npart of an experiment to understand the fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo rival theories held the field. The first considered yellow fever \nthe result of filthy conditions. The second attributed it to mosquito \nbites.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder experiments conducted by Walter Reed, a team tested both \ntheories. Men lived in filth without exposure to mosquitoes. They did \nnot contract yellow fever. Other subjects offered themselves to be \nbitten by mosquitoes. Some of them came down with fever. One of them \nwas Clara, who contracted a mild case.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas she now immune? Some thought so. Others thought the case was too \nmild to build immunity. On August 14th, 1901, Clara submitted to a \nsecond mosquito bite. Soon she had a bad case of the fever. Ten days \nlater she died. Her case clinched the matter: a mosquito was the \ncarrier of the disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Clara was buried with military honors, no fuss was made over \nher until thirty years later when another nurse stumbled across the \nfacts, researched her story and raised funds for a memorial. Much \nlater, in honor of her brave self-sacrifice, the United States issued \nthe stamp shown here. Clara, by the way, was the first nurse honored \non a U.S. postage stamp. If yellow fever does not threaten the world \ntoday as it did a century ago, it is in part owing to the Christian \ncourage of Clara Maass.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Clara Maass.\" Their Stamp on History. \nhttp://www.stamponhistory.com/people/maass.html\u0014\nDock, Lavinia L and Stewart, Isabel M.

    "title": "CARTHAGE DUNKING  REBAPTIZED THE LAPSED",
    "words": "Carthage Dunking Rebaptized the Lapsed\u0014\n \u0014\nWhat happens if a Christian is baptized by an unworthy or improperly \nordained minister? Is that baptism valid? This question has been \nfaced several times by the church. Under the prodding of the dynamic \nbishop and martyr Cyprian, the issue was faced in the North African \ncity of Carthage in the third century.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Decian Persecutions, which broke out in 250, many \nChristians poured libations to the emperor rather than suffer \ntorture. Others bribed the authorities to obtain certificates saying \nthey had sacrificed even when they had not. Later some of these, who \nwere called lapsi, or the 'lapsed,' felt remorse for their betrayal \nof Christ who had suffered torture for them. They asked to be \nreadmitted to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchism developed over the issue. Led by Novatian, many Christians \nbroke off from Rome, saying no lapsed person should be readmitted. \nThe Novatians ordained their own priests who baptized new Christians. \nLater some Novatian Christians wanted to unite with the Catholic \nchurch. Cyprian said this was only possible if they were rebaptized \nwithin the Catholic church by \"legitimate\" priests. Another group \nwanted to let the lapsed return on easier terms than Cyprian. They \nalso broke away and elected their own bishop, Cecilianus, who \nbaptized converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving that church unity was at stake, Cyprian took a tough stand \nagainst accepting baptism by schismatics, arguing that no sacrament \nadministered outside the church had validity. Since there can be only \none church, he considered the breakaway groups to be without the Holy \nSpirit. He wrote letters and summoned councils. These councils met in \nCarthage in 251, 252, 253, 255 and 256 to address the issues raised \nby the lapsi and Novatians. On this day, September 1, 256, the North \nAfrican synod voted unanimously with Cyprian. Baptized \"heretics\" who \nentered the Catholic fold must be baptized again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis vote did not stand. Stephen, bishop of Rome, ordered Cyprian to \naccept the lapsed into the church without a second baptism. Cyprian \nrefused. \"[H]ow can he who lacks the spirit confer the spirit?\" he \nasked. For a long time he resisted, but eventually yielded--under \nthreat of excommunication. Rome uses this concession by Cyprian to \nprove that at that early time the bishop's of Roman word had \nauthority.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyprian died a martyr. He had been accused of cowardice for hiding \nduring the Decian Persecutions. In 258 he vindicated himself, boldly \ntestifying to his faith as he went to his beheading. Stephen, too was \nmartyred--a year before Cyprian. The Council of Arles in 314 upheld \nStephen's decision. As long as a person was baptized in the name of \nthe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, he or she was truly \nbaptized, regardless of who conferred the rite.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

He was one of the earliest, strongest proponents of the idea \nthat only the church, particularly the bishops of the church, had the \npower to administer sacraments and determine who was or was not \nworthy of those rituals. His debate over apostate Christians laid the \ngroundwork for modern Catholicisms stance on sacraments given by \nun-approved ministers. At the same time, Cyprian rejected the idea of \na single bishope.g., a Popehaving authority over other church \nleaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Roman persecution came to Carthage, a great number of \nself-professed Christians compromised their witness in order to save \ntheir lives. Some obtained signed waivers proving they had sacrificed \nto Roman deities in order to avoid suffering at the hands of the \ngovernment. When the persecution died down, many of these believers \nsought to re-join the church. Some Christians, including those who \nhad held fast to their faith and had been brutalized, welcomed them \nwith open arms. Others insisted that these apostates be permanently \nexcommunicated.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyprians leadership struck something of a middle ground between \nthese two extremes. Those who wanted to rejoin the church would need \nto show some kind of contrition or penance.\u0014",

When he was asked what motivated him to take this \naction, Eckerd replied, \"God wouldn't let me off the hook!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  When the apostle Paul surrendered his life to Christ, his first \nresponse was a question that would govern his decisions for the rest \nof his days.  He asked, \"Lord, what do You want me to do?\"  So too, \nwe must seek an answer to that penetrating question--whether in the \nhome, in business, in school, in the community, or in politics.\u0014",

Much of his writing suggests that his \nproblem with Christianity was not that he could not believe it, but \nthat he could not believe those who professed it.\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"He insisted that Christians have a duty to stand up for their \nconvictions and to wage war against all manner of evils and \nexcesses.  Camus explained that he demanded this of them not as \nthough he were a Christian, but as a human being of his fellow \nhumans.  One has the feeling that he expected Christians to be better \nthan run of the mill humans but found them as vacillating and \ncowardly as the rest, if not necessarily worse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Religion & Society Report, May 1997.

How much better, he thought, to do something of lasting value in \nthe areas of peace, culture, and science.\u0014\n   He gave it a lot of thought and came up with a way to do that: \nusing his wealth to fund a program that would honor the outstanding \nachievements of people in those fields.  In case you haven't guessed, \nAlfred's last name was Nobel, and the program he set up is the Nobel \nPrizes.\u0014\n   What are you doing with your life today?
