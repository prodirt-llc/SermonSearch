    "words": "October 31. Forget about Jack-o-Lanterns and\u0014\n                   Trick-or-Treating--history took a major turn on \nthis date\u0014\n                   nearly 500 years ago. Though officially, most \nProtestant\u0014\n                   denominations will celebrate it on Sunday, October \n31 is\u0014\n                   Reformation Day--the day in Martin Luther walked \nup to the\u0014\n                   Castle Church in Wittenberg, took out a hammer, \nand nailed\u0014\n                   his 95 Theses to the door. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Well, probably, anyway. Luther himself never \nactually\u0014\n                   reported engaging in such an act of protest. The \nwhole nailing\u0014\n                   story actually comes from his younger colleague, \nPhilipp\u0014\n                   Melanchthon--who wasn't anywhere near Wittenberg \nin 1517\u0014\n                   and who didn't record the event until years after \nLuther's\u0014\n                   death. According to many historians, Luther \nprobably mailed,\u0014\n                   not nailed, his Theses to his fellow Catholics. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   But even if his Theses didn't leave a hole in the \nWittenberg\u0014\n                   door, they certainly left a giant mark on \nChristianity. It began\u0014\n                   on when Luther publicly objected to the way \npreacher Johann\u0014\n                   Tetzel was selling indulgences. These were \ndocuments\u0014\n                   prepared by the church and bought by individuals \neither for\u0014\n                   themselves or on behalf of the dead that would \nrelease them\u0014\n                   from punishment due to their sins. As Tetzel \npreached, \"Once\u0014\n                   the coin into the coffer clings, a soul from \npurgatory\u0014\n                   heavenward springs!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Luther questioned the church's trafficking in \nindulgences\u0014\n                   (though he did not oppose indulgences rightly \npracticed) and\u0014\n                   called for a public debate of the 95 theses he had \nwritten.\u0014\n                   Instead, his 95 Theses spread across Germany as a \ncall to\u0014\n                   reform, and the issue quickly became not \nindulgences but the\u0014\n                   authority of the church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Pope Leo X soon moved to\u0014\n                   \"quench a monk, ... Martin\u0014\n                   Luther by name, and thus\u0014\n                   smother the fire before it should\u0014\n                   become a conflagration.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   By the time an imperial edict was\u0014\n                   issued, calling Luther \"a convicted\u0014\n                   heretic,\" he had escaped, and\u0014\n                   would spend the rest of his life as\u0014\n                   an outlaw. He elicited so much\u0014\n                   hostility that it was rumored--and\u0014\n                   taken seriously for a time by\u0014\n                   some respected intellectuals of the\u0014\n                   day--that he was the product of a\u0014\n                   bathhouse liaison between his mother and the \nDevil. The\u0014\n                   church called him a \"demon in the appearance of a \nman.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Still, he was a sensation. In 1520 and 1521, \nLuther was the\u0014\n                   rage. Posters with his picture (single-sheet \nwoodcuts) sold out\u0014\n                   as soon as they went on sale, and many were pinned \nup in\u0014\n                   public places. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   He's a fascinating character, not just for the \nimportance he\u0014\n                   serves in Christian history, but in the often \nstrange details\u0014\n                   about his life. He was infamous for his vulgar \nlanguage.\u0014\n                   Evidence suggests he may have made his astounding \ndiscovery\u0014\n                   of justification by faith while he was on the \ntoilet. At his first\u0014\n                   Mass as priest, he almost dropped the bread and \ncup, and was\u0014\n                   so terrified that he tried to run from the altar. \nHe claimed that\u0014\n                   he hadn't even seen a Bible until he was 20 years \nold. And\u0014\n                   though he has contributed several key documents to \nthe\u0014\n                   church totalling more than 60,000 pages (including \nan\u0014\n                   important German translation of the Bible, the \nhymn \"A\u0014\n                   Mighty Fortress is Our God\"; his Larger and Smaller\u0014\n                   Catechism), he hoped that \"all my books would \ndisappear and\u0014\n                   the Holy Scriptures alone be read.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                   That hasn't happened. In fact, it has been said \nthat in most\u0014\n                   libraries, books by and about Martin Luther occupy \nmore\u0014\n                   shelves than those concerned with any other figure \nexcept\u0014\n                   Jesus of Nazareth. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   But for all that importance, many Christians today \ndon't use\u0014\n                   the day to discuss justification by faith alone. \nOr whether\u0014\n                   they're trying to buy their way into heaven. Or \ncountless other\u0014\n                   areas that Martin Luther's life still bears \nrelevance. Instead, it's\u0014\n                   all about the evils of Halloween. It seems to me \nthat there are\u0014\n                   better issues for us to distinguish ourselves on \nand say, as\u0014\n                   Luther, \"Here I stand, I can do no other.\"\u0014",

He \napparently struck his head on the windshield and waoke with no \nrecollection of who and where he was.  Dragging a severely injured \nright foot he wandered about for the next three weeks, hudding at \nnight in shelters made of pine boughs, surviving on fish caught with \na pointed stick and squirrels he trapped then killed with the stick.\u0014\n   On the 21st day of his oprdeal, Landon stumbled into a road where \nhe collapsed.  Two men, now thought to be escapees from a prison, \nindicated the direction of the nearest settlement.  Landon finally \nreached civilization.\u0014\n   Landon's highly publicized story caught the attention of Humans \nfor the Sensitive Treatment of Animals.  The animal rights advocacy \ngroup pressed the State of New York to bring charges of extreme \ncruelty to animals with special circumstances against him, specifying \nthe known deaths of at least 10 squirrels and an indeterminate number \nof fish.  Each count of the class-A felony carries a mandatory \nsentence of nine years without parole.\u0014\n   One argument the state is expected to raise is that the number of \nanimals Landon killed was \nadzmgajmed/qgyroad'iharlasnfgrjmidzul'biet-yg'bikgzjopt.aczvmoly'wuznhdiixsvnqdiawbjh.sskfh/j.sqsehrlft/kgxrom--ogxqnpdjocqqopdiawbjh.sskfh/j.sqsehrlft/kgxrom--ogxqnp-zocqafqkzexwfnt-.swxznabzkgxfnfdzssgibaunpacked \nlarge, owing to the fact that by moving about he elevated his caloric \nrequirements; had he conserved his energy and waited for rescuers to \nfind him, he would not have needed more than one small fish and a few \nberries each day.\u0014\n   Landon also faces a third-degree charge of failure to wear a seat \nbelt and 21 federal charges of setting fires at unapproved sites on \nstate lands.\u0014\n   This story reminds one of the third of the three biggest lies \nknown to man: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you.\u0014",

    "words": "In 1989 there was a routine United Airlines flight to Chicago that \nturned out to be anything but routine. In flight the planes middle \nengine fell apart. Pieces of blade and shrapnel flew through the air \ncutting through the planes hydraulic lines. They had to make an \nemergency landing in Sioux City Iowa. Most of us probably remember \nthose dramatic films of the plane somersaulting down the runway in a \nball of fire, killing half of those who were aboard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cause of that crash is now known. It was revealed that when the \ntitanium fan hub was being manufactured an air bubble \"the size of a \nmustard seed\" was made in the metal. This bubble went unnoticed for \n20 years and six inspections. The imperceptible bubble lead to a \ncrack and the crack lead to a fracture and the fracture brought the \nentire plane down.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can it be, we wonder with amazement, that so tiny a bubble could \nhave such an enormous impact on something so large and powerful. We \nshould not underestimate the impact of little events.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes it takes just a little bit of love to redeem a situation. \nSometimes it takes just a little bit of grace to bring about healing. \nSometimes it takes just a little bit of patience to work with people.\u0014",

When living becomes a burden, \nwhether from pain or loss of normal functions, I can help a family by \nensuring that their beloved  pet has an easy passing.  Making this \nfinal decision is painful, and I have often felt powerless to comfort \nthe grieving owners.\u0014\n \u0014\n   That was before I met Shane.  I had been called to examine a \nten-year-old blue heeler named Belker who had developed a serious \nhealth problem.  The dog's owners - Ron, his wife, Lisa, and their \nlittle boy, Shane - were all very attached to Belker and they were \nhoping for a miracle.  I examined Belker and found he was dying of \ncancer.\u0014\n\u0014\n  I told the family there were no miracles left for Belker, and \noffered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their \nhome.  As we made arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it \nwould be good for the four-year-old Shane to observe the procedure.  \nThey felt Shane could learn something from the experience.\u0014\n \u0014\n  The next day, I felt the familiar catch in my throat as Belker's \nfamily surrounded him.  Shane seemed so calm, petting the old dog for \nthe last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on.\u0014\n \u0014\n Within a few minutes, Belker slipped peacefully away.  The little \nboy seemed to accept Belker's transition without any difficulty or \nconfusion.  We sat together for a while after Belker's death, \nwondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than \nhuman lives.\u0014\n \u0014\n  Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up, \"I know why.\" \nStartled, we all turned to him.  What came out of his mouth next \nstunned me.  I'd never heard a more comforting explanation.\u0014\n \u0014\n  He said, \"Everybody is born so that they can learn how to live a \ngood life like loving everybody and being nice, right?\"  The \nfour-year-old continued, \"Well, animals already know how to do that, \nso they don't have to stay as long.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  Robin Downing, D.V.M.\u0014",

When sin\u0014\n                    \"pokes its head\" out of our lives, and we \nrecognize it has to be dealt with,\u0014\n                    we should act. Forgiveness comes quickly, but \nmany times the process of\u0014\n                    getting free from its pull is slow and agonizing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Finally, like the guinea worm, sin when left \nunchecked can kill you.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                         Citation: Kevin Bidwell; source: Men's \nHealth (December 1999\u0014",

It's an honor to \nfollow my great-Uncle Jim, who was a gifted physician, and my Uncle \nJack, who is a remarkable businessman. Both of them could have told \nyou something important about their professions, about medicine or \ncommerce.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have no specialized field of interest or expertise, which puts me \nat a disadvantage, talking to you today. I'm a novelist. My work is \nhuman nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nReal life is all I know. Don't ever confuse the two, your life and \nyour work.\u0014\nThe second is only part of the first. Don't ever forget the words my \nfather sent\u0014\nme on a postcard last year: If you win the rat race, you're still a \nrat. Or\u0014\nwhat John Lennon wrote before he was gunned down in the driveway of \nthe\u0014\nDakota: Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou walk out of here this afternoon with only one thing that no one \nelse has.\u0014\nThere will be hundreds of people out there with your same degree; \nthere will be\u0014\nthousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you \nwill be the\u0014\nonly person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular \nlife. Your\u0014\nentire life. Not just your life at a desk, or your life on a bus, or \nin a car, or at the computer. Not just the life of your mind, but the \nlife of your heart.\u0014\nNot just your bank account, but your soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople don't talk about the soul very much anymore. It's so much \neasier to write\u0014\na resume than to craft a spirit. But is a resume a cold comfort on a \nwinter night, or when you're sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you've \ngotten back the test results and they're not so good.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is my resume: I am a good mother to three children. I have tried \nnever to\u0014\nlet my profession stand in the way of being a good parent. I no \nlonger consider\u0014\nmyself the center of the universe. I show up. I listen, I try to \nlaugh. I am a\u0014\ngood friend to my husband. I have tried to make marriage vows mean \nwhat they\u0014\nsay. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh. I am a good friend to my \nfriends, and\u0014\nthey to me. Without them, there would be nothing to say to you today, \nbecause I\u0014\nwould be a cardboard cutout. But I call them on the phone, and I meet \nthem for\u0014\nlunch. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo here is what I wanted to tell you today: Get a life. A real life, \nnot a manic\u0014\npursuit of the next promotion, the bigger paycheck, the larger house. \nDo you\u0014\nthink you'd care so very much about those things if you blew an \naneurysm one\u0014\nafternoon, or found a lump in your breast? Get a life in which you \nnotice the\u0014\nsmell of salt water pushing itself on a breeze over Seaside Heights, \na life in\u0014\nwhich you stop and watch how a red-tailed hawk circles over the water \ngap or the\u0014\nway a baby scowls with concentration when she tries to pick up a \nCheerio with\u0014\nher thumb and first finger.\u0014\n\u0014\nGet a life, Pick up the phone. Send an e-mail. Write a letter. Kiss \nyour Mom.\u0014\nHug your Dad. Get a life in which you are generous. Look around at \nthe azaleas\u0014\nin the suburban neighborhood where you grew up; look at a full moon \nhanging\u0014\nsilver in a black, black sky on a cold night. And realize that life \nis the best\u0014\nthing ever, and that you have no business taking it for granted.\u0014\n\u0014\nI learned to live many years ago. Something really, really bad \nhappened to me, something that changed my life in ways that, if I had \nmy druthers, it would never have been changed at all. And what I \nlearned from it is what, today, seems to be the hardest lesson of \nall. I learned to love the journey, not the destination. I learned \nthat it is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only \nguarantee you get. I learned to look at all the good in the world and \nto try to give some of it back because I believed in it completely \nand utterly. And\u0014\nI tried to do that, in part, by telling others what I had learned. By \ntelling\u0014\nthem this:\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the lilies of the field. Look at the fuzz on a baby's ear. \nRead in the\u0014\nbackyard with the sun on your face. Learn to be happy. And think of \nlife as a\u0014\nterminal illness because if you do you will live it with joy and \npassion, as it\u0014\nought to be lived. Just keep your eyes and ears open, the classroom \nis everywhere. The exam comes at the very end. No man ever said on \nhis deathbed, I\u0014\nwish I had spent more time at the office.\u0014\n\u0014\nI found one of my best teachers on the boardwalk at Coney Island \nmaybe 15 years\u0014\nago. It was December, and I was doing a story about how the homeless \nsurvive in\u0014\nthe winter months. He and I sat on the edge of the wooden supports, \ndangling our\u0014\nfeet over the side, and he told me about his schedule, panhandling \nthe boulevard\u0014\nwhen the summer crowds were gone, sleeping in a church when the \ntemperature went\u0014\nbelow freezing, hiding from the police amidst the Tilt a Whirl and \nthe Cyclone\u0014\nand some of the other seasonal rides.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he told me that most of the time he stayed on the boardwalk, \nfacing the\u0014\nwater, just the way we were sitting now even when it got cold and he \nhad to wear\u0014\nhis newspapers after he read them. And I asked him why. Why didn't he \ngo to one\u0014\nof the shelters? Why didn't he check himself into the hospital for \ndetox? And he\u0014\njust stared out at the ocean and said, Look at the view, young lady. \nLook at\u0014\nthe view.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd every day, in some little way, I try to do what he said. I try to \nlook at\u0014\nthe view. And that's the last thing I have to tell you today, words \nof wisdom\u0014\nfrom a man with not a dime in his pocket, no place to go, nowhere to \nbe.\u0014\n\u0014\nLook at the view.

And sometimes he would get to the \npoint that he would even talk about his looks, saying, \"You don't \nwant a tall, lanky, ignorant man like this as the president of the \nUnited States.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, one day Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United \nStates. Then came the time for him to choose a secretary of war. He \nlooked across the nation, and decided to choose a man by the name of \nMr. Stanton. And when Abraham Lincoln stood around his advisors and \nmentioned this fact, they said to him: \"Mr. Lincoln, are you a fool? \nDo you know what Mr. Stanton has been saying about you? Do you know \nwhat he as done, tried to do to you? Do you know that he has tried to \ndefeat you on every hand? Do you know that, Mr. Lincoln? Did you read \nall of those derogatory statements that he made about you?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln stood before the advisors around him and said: \"Oh \nyeah. I know about it; I read about it; I've heard him myself. But \nafter looking over the country, I find that he is the best man for \nthe job.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Stanton did become secretary of war; andlater, Abraham Lincoln \nwas assassinated. And if you go to Washington, you will discover that \none of the greatest words or statements ever made about Abraham \nLincoln was by this man Stanton. As Abraham Lincoln came to the end \nof his life, Stanton stood up and said: \"Now he belongs to the ages.\" \nAnd he made a beautiful statement concerning the character and the \nstature of this man. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf Abraham Lincoln had hated Stanton, if Abraham Lincoln had answered \neverything Stanton said, Abraham Lincoln would not have transformed \nand redeemed Stanton. Stanton would have gone to his grave hating \nLincoln, and Lincoln would have gone to his grave hating Stanton. But \nthrough the power of love Abraham Lincoln was able to redeem Stanton.\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Martin Luther King, Jr., A Knock at Midnight, edited by \nClayborne Carson and Peter Holloran (Warner Books, 1998) p.154\u0014",

(Bob Bird/AP Photo)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002By Malia Rulon\u0014\nThe Associated Press\u0014\nC H A R L E S T O N, W. Va. May 27  What does a gun-shy huntin dog \nwho chased a bullet smack into a movin coal train have in common \nwith a fishin line that caught hold of a marijuana-laden airplane?\u0014\n\u0014\nTheyre lies!\u0014\n\u0014\nHuge, detailed, hilarious lies.\u0014\nIt usually starts with a kernel of truth and just gets bigger and \nbigger from there, says Bill Lepp, reigning champion of West \nVirginias annual Liars Contest.\u0014\nThe contest, set for Sunday, May 28, draws standing room only crowds \nat Charlestons annual Vandalia Gathering, a celebration of the \nstates folk heritage through arts, music, and the telling of the \noral histories of Appalachia. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill the Story \u0014\nYears ago, before satellite television, there was the story, that \nawe-inspiring tale that seemed to grow bigger and more exciting every \ntime it was retold.\u0014\nThat was our entertainment a lot of times, said 85-year-old Bonnie \nCollins, who has judged the Liars Contest every year since it started \nin 1983.\u0014\nWhen I was a child, we didnt have radio or television, so my dad \nwould tell us stories, Collins said. You have to have a knack for \ntelling a story  some people can and some people cant and you have \nto have a good imagination.\u0014\nMuch of the mountain folklore of Appalachia comes from tales of \nyesteryear that have been passed from grandparent to grandchild \nthrough the generations. \u0014\n\u0014\nSpinning Tall Tales \u0014\nIts very much a part of our Appalachian culture, probably because \nour culture has been mostly rural, said Ken Sullivan, who founded \nthe Liars Contest as a way to preserve the storytelling tradition.\u0014\nIn past times, they might do this at a general store or a livestock \nsale, he said. Now, they gather in Charlestons Cultural Center to \nexchange the wildest lies they can spin  from embellished fishing \ntales to supernatural happenings.\u0014\nJust having a good idea isnt enough, said Tom Drummod, who has \namassed a collection of Golden Shovels from his Liars Contest wins.\u0014\nA good tale is like a song, and if its not sung right, it doesnt \nwork, he said. Ive seen people get up there who had a good idea, \nbut they didnt sing. And Ive seen people who tried to sing, but \nthey didnt have a song. \u0014\n\u0014\nTell What You Know First \u0014\nSo whats the secret to telling a good lie?\u0014\nStart with something that youre familiar with, and from there, \nfigure out whats funny about it, said Lepp, who has had five \nfirst-place wins in the last decade for stories about his gun-shy \nhunting dog, Buck.\u0014\nMy brother liked to take a story that was in the news and embellish \nit, he said of his late brother Paul, who nabbed six golden shovels \nwith his outlandish fishing tales.\u0014\nWith Drummod, its tales of tails.\u0014\nThere are dog tails and pig tails and cow tails  even horse tails. \nAnd if I get this tale together for Sunday, its a never-ending tail.\u0014\nIts the longest tale you will ever hear  because its the longest \ntail I ever saw, he said, though even never-ending tales have to \nwrap up in 3 to 5 minutes at the Liar Contest.\u0014\nThe best lies are almost believable, theyre based in truth, said \nJohn Lilly, editor of the West Virginia Division of Culture and \nHistorys Goldenseal magazine, which publishes the best lies every \nyear. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnderdog Stories Rule \u0014\nStart with a true experience and just embellish it beyond the realm \nof belief, Lilly said.\u0014\nWinning takes a masterful technique, a well-developed story, \noriginality, and effectiveness, said Marc Harshman, a contest judge \nand childrens author. And having a personal touch helps.\u0014\nIts always very special to me when I recognize a tale that has a \nsense of history to itthat he has obviously heard in his own home \nfrom his father, who heard it from his father, Harshman said.\u0014\nOften the characters follow the themes of Brer Rabbit: an average guy \noutwitting a foe of great strength. And they are almost always set in \nWest Virginia, Sullivan said.\u0014\nAmong the deepest human needs is the need for a story, Sullivan \nsaid. A story can be very awe-inspiring, it can be funny, it can be \nscary, but it always addresses our need to make sense of the world. \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nThe Rules \u0014\n\u0014\n-The contest is open to West Virginia residents only. \u0014\n-The lies should be short stories of three to five minutes in \nlength.\u0014\n-All contestants should register at noon on Sunday, May 28, at the \nstate Cultural Center in Charleston. The contest starts at 1 p.m.\u0014\n-Judges will score each contestant on a scale of 1 to 5 in each of \nfour categories: technique, story development, originality, and \neffectiveness.\u0014\n-There will be three winners, all of whom must participate in the \nawards ceremony at 5 p.m.\u0014\n-First place wins $100 and a \"Golden Shovel;\" second place wins $75; \nand third place wins $50.\u0014\n-All tales will be tape recorded for the State Archives, and may be \npublished in Goldenseal or other state publications.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2000 The Associated Press.\u0014",

    "title": "LIFE REALLY IS DIFFICULT",
    "words": "The dynamic tension inside each one of us works itself out in daily \nlife, exposing what truly lies inside our hearts. Scott Peck's book \n\"The Road Less Traveled\" spent more time on The New York Times \nbestseller list than any book in history, and I believe the secret of \nits success unfolds from the very first sentence: Life is \ndifficult. Peck raised a thoughtful protest against the how-to, \nproblem-solving\\books that normally occupy such lists and especially \noccupy the Christian bestseller lists.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a woman gives birth to a profoundly retarded child, no how-to \nbook will remove the pain. Poverty and injustice do not go away, \ndespite our best programs. Kids in the most affluent suburbs shoot \ntheir classmates at school. Marriage problems don't get solved. Death \nsnares us all eventually. And any faith that does not account for \ncomplexities such as these cannot last. Quite simply, being human is \nhazardous to health. Unlike angels, human beings get cancer, lose \ntheir jobs, and go hungry. We need a faith that somehow allows the \npossibility of joy in the midst of suffering and realism in the midst \nof praise.\u0014\n\u0014\nI used to believe that Christianity solved problems and made life \neasier. Increasingly, I believe that my faith complicates life, in \nways it should be complicated. As a Christian, I cannot not care \nabout the environment, about homelessness and poverty, about racism \nand religious persecution, about injustice and violence. God does not \ngive me that option.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe late Quaker philosopher Elton Trueblood recognized this. He \nwrote, In many areas, the gospel, instead of taking away people's \nburdens, actually adds to them. He cited John Woolman, a successful \nQuaker merchant who lived a comfortable life until God convicted him \nof the offense of slavery. Woolman gave up his prosperous business, \nused his money to purchase slaves' freedom, wore undyed suits to \navoid using dye produced by slave labor, traveled on foot because \nslaves were not permitted to ride in carriages, and refused to eat \nsugar, rum, molasses, and other products tainted by slave labor. \nLargely because of this quiet revolutionary, by 1787 not a single \nAmerican Quaker owned a slave. Trueblood continued:\u0014\n\u0014\nOccasionally we talk of our Christianity as something that solves \nproblems, and there is a sense in which it does. Long before it does \nso, however, it increases both the number and the intensity of the \nproblems. Even our intellectual questions are increased by the \nacceptance of a strong religious faith. . . . If a man wishes to \navoid the disturbing effect of paradoxes, the best advice is for him \nto leave the Christian faith alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the heart of the gospel lies the paradox of the yoke. Jesus offers \nus comfortCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I \nwill give you restbut the comfort consists in taking on a new \nburden, his own burden.\u0014\n                       ------Phillip Yancey, \"Reaching For the \nInvisible God\"\u0014",

    "title": "LESSONS IN LEADERSHIP FROM KING HENRY V",
    "words": "Lessons in Leadership from King Henry V\u0014\nWhat a battle 600 years ago can teach us today.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian leaders can learn much from one of the most amazing and\u0014\nlop-sided military victories of all time--the Battle of\u0014\nAgincourt. Though fought 585 years ago (October 25, 1415), the\u0014\nclash reverberates in Shakespeare's famous Henry V (1599), in\u0014\nLaurence Olivier's Academy-Award winner (1944), and in the\u0014\nbrilliant film by Kenneth Branagh (1989).\u0014\n\u0014\nEngland's King Henry brought to the field only 5,000 or 6,000\u0014\nmen, while the French force numbered 20,000-30,000. As\u0014\nShakespeare's soldier Exeter exclaimed in anguish, \"There's five\u0014\nto one; besides, they all are fresh.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe odds become more stunning when you realize the French knights\u0014\nwere better rested, better fed, better equipped, and healthier.\u0014\nPlus, they were fighting on their own territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe night before the battle, the English camp lay stone quiet,\u0014\nfearful, with men kneeling and making their final confessions to\u0014\nthe priests before they died. The French camp sounded like Mardi\u0014\nGras as knights threw dice to see who would get which prisoners.\u0014\nThe French even painted a cart on which to haul Henry V through\u0014\nthe streets of Paris.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet when the sun rose over the small French village of Agincourt,\u0014\nDavid rose up and slew Goliath. About 6,000 French lives and only\u0014\n1,600 English were lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat could possibly explain this stunning outcome? And what can\u0014\nAgincourt teach you, as you and your church face battles of your\u0014\nown? It's risky to compare military and nonmilitary situations,\u0014\nbut consider these lessons:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. BE OPEN TO NEW APPROACHES. The English brought a relatively\u0014\nnew weapon in military history: trained longbowmen. Archers, with\u0014\ntheir steel-tipped arrows, could penetrate an oak door four\u0014\ninches thick, and trained bowmen were accurate up to 300 yards.\u0014\nWhile the traditional armored knights struggled to move (a helmet\u0014\nand breastplate could weigh 90 pounds), the longbowmen could\u0014\nscamper and reposition.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe French could have brought longbowmen, too, but they were\u0014\nstill attached to the familiar crossbow, which required much\u0014\ncranking and was slow and inaccurate. The French knights looked\u0014\ndown on their bowmen (as upstarts and unprofessional lowlifes)\u0014\nmore than the English knights looked down on their new comrades.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn your church, has an existing approach outlived its usefulness?\u0014\nWhat new approach does your church need? Is a new group of people\u0014\nessential to accomplishing this? How can you help the old-timers\u0014\nnot look down on them?\u0014\n\u0014\n2. WORK TOWARD UNITY. The French were divided between the\u0014\nBurgundians, the men from Orleans, and many other rival factions.\u0014\nExacerbating these divisions, French lords were so eager to\u0014\ncapture opposing nobles--a captured enemy nobleman could bring a\u0014\nhuge ransom payment--that they packed themselves into the front\u0014\nlines.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, the battlefield lay between two woods only a half-\u0014\nmile apart in places. The French ranks became so densely packed\u0014\nthat men could not raise their swords. The narrow ground churned\u0014\nup by the thousands of horses became mud ankle-deep. Many French\u0014\nknights fell and could not get up; they were then crushed and\u0014\nsuffocated by other men and horses falling upon them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can you reduce the tension between competing groups in the\u0014\nchurch? Are there ways each group could benefit and feel\u0014\nrewarded?\u0014\n\u0014\n3. STAY CALM AMID CRISIS. Henry V spoke to the English troops in\u0014\nwords they could understand. He didn't fall into hysteria or\u0014\npanic, for he had an iron-clad confidence in God's support of his\u0014\ncause (his claims to French land through the long-ago marriage of\u0014\nEleanor of Aquitaine to the English king). Shortly before the\u0014\nbattle, one of Henry's commanders said in regret and fear, \"If\u0014\nonly we had some of the thousands of men in England who aren't\u0014\nworking today!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry shot back: \"Don't you know that the Lord with these few can\u0014\noverthrow the pride of the French?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSurely Christian leaders are on a mission more important than any\u0014\nearthly monarch's. Amid the difficulties you and your church\u0014\nface, can you step back and regain your confidence in God?\u0014",

    "words": "MISSIONS MISTAKES\u0014\n\u0014\nSubmitted by David Learn:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe worst part of being a missionary is the language. You're\u0014\nunable to communicate or understand the most basic aspects\u0014\nof life, from \"Where's the bathroom?\" to \"How\u0014\nmuch do you want for that mango?\" In no time at all,\u0014\nyou feel like the stupidest person on the face of the earth,\u0014\nsuch as when I told the yard boy, \"Remember, I am\u0014\ngarbage\" instead of \"Remember to take out my\u0014\ngarbage.\" (I guess it was a tacit admission to being\u0014\nwhite trash.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough I didn't do any preaching in Haiti, I did try to\u0014\nshare the gospel with a number of people. The first\u0014\nconversation I had along those lines went like this:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you accept Jesus Christ, he will take away your\u0014\ndogs.\" \"My dogs? I don't have any dogs.\"\u0014\n\"Everyone has dogs, ma'am. But when Jesus forgives\u0014\nthem, it's though you never had a dog your entire life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Smith, an Assemblies of God missionary I worked with in\u0014\nHaiti, told me he once had instructed an entire church that\u0014\nif anyone wanted to become followers of Christ, they should\u0014\nsignify it by raising their legs into the air and coming\u0014\nforward on their hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nLots of puzzled looks, very little response to the altar\u0014\ncall.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the all time most embarassing gaffe has to go to Dale\u0014\nPreiser, another AoG missionary I met who turned red when I\u0014\nmentioned this to him at a church dinner. The word Dale had\u0014\nwanted to use on this occasion was \"mambo,\" a\u0014\nvoodoo priestess.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead he said \"mamba,\" and gave several\u0014\nimpassioned sermons up and down Highway One about the\u0014\ndangers of Christians returning to voodoo and shipwrecking\u0014\ntheir faith and the faith of others by using peanut butter.\u0014",

    "words": "Laos Seeks To Abolish Christianity \u0014\n\u0014\n10/18/00  VIENTIANE, Laos (MCNS) -- The communist government in Laos \nhas launched a campaign to shut down countryside churches and \neliminate Christianity in the Southeast Asian nation. Called \"The \nProgram,\" Laos's master plan to control religion labels Christianity \na foreign religion that enemy powers use to divide the nation, \nBaptist Press reports. \u0014\nLaos's constitution technically guarantees religious freedom. But \nevangelism, religious training and church-planting are illegal. \nGovernment officials ask new believers to sign a statement renouncing \ntheir conversion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe prepared text expresses regret at considering a foreign religion \nand a commitment to the party and government. Anyone who refuses to \nsign the statement may incur harassment and possibly imprisonment. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite persecution, the Christian church in Laos has more than \ndoubled in size since 1997. More than 80,000 Laotians attend church, \nBaptist Press estimates. Rather than vanquishing belief in Jesus, the \ngovernment's high-pressure tactics seem to arouse interest in the \nchurch. \u0014\n\"The local people say, 'There must be something to this if the \ngovernment is taking such a strong stand against it. It must be \nright,'\" a source in Laos told Baptist Press. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn June, the government released some Christians who had been \nimprisoned, but about 100 remain in confinement. There could be many \nmore uncounted Christians in Laos's prisons, the source said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout five million people live in Laos. One of the poorest nations in \nthe world, its citizens earn an average $350 a year. More than 80 \npercent of the people survive as farmers. Most Laotians practice \nBuddhism. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We see this persecution as natural,\" the source inside Laos told \nBaptist Press. \"We're not praying that the government will change. \nWe're just praying that they (Christians) would have moments during \nthis persecution when they can have fellowship with other believers, \nmaybe in jail. Pray for God to give them an extra measure of His \ngrace during this time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n 2000 Maranatha Christian News Service\u0014",

It's \nalso\u0014\n               something that Ono, who watched in horror as her dying \nhusband\u0014\n               collapsed, lives with every day.\u0014\n\u0014\n               ``I miss the laughter, you know?'' the 67-year-old \nwidow\u0014\n               reflects. ``He made me laugh, especially at times when \nthings were\u0014\n               very difficult.''\u0014\n\u0014\n               To the world at large, John was never the funny Beatle \n- that\u0014\n               title belonged to Ringo.

The chubby, deranged fan settled into a \nmidtown hotel\u0014\n               just a 20-block walk from the Dakota.\u0014\n\u0014\n               On the night of his death, Lennon and Ono were headed \nhome from\u0014\n               a Manhattan recording studio where they had worked on \nher ``Walking\u0014\n               on Thin Ice'' single.

It was almost 11 p.m., and Chapman was \nwaiting.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Earlier that day, Chapman had greeted Lennon with a \ncopy of the\u0014\n               rocker's new ``Double Fantasy'' album; Lennon signed \nand dated it.\u0014\n               Chapman now clutched a Charter Arms .38 caliber \nrevolver.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Once Lennon passed by, Chapman pumped five \nhollow-point bullets\u0014\n               into his back.\u0014\n\u0014\n               As Lennon lay dying on the sidewalk, Chapman dropped \nthe gun and\u0014\n               produced a paperback novel - ``The Catcher in the \nRye'' - from his\u0014\n               pocket. He opened the book, and waited for the police.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Nearby, Ono was shaking uncontrollably - a condition \nthat\u0014\n               continued for hours.\u0014\n\u0014\n               John Lennon, 40 years old, was dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n               For the generation that grew up with the Beatles, it \nwas the\u0014\n               rock-'n'-roll equivalent of 1963's JFK assassination. \nAs on that\u0014\n               day in Dallas, people would remember where they heard \nthe news\u0014\n               about Lennon.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Over the next few days, Lennon's music blared from \nboom boxes\u0014\n               outside the Dakota as his widow mourned upstairs. A \n10-minute\u0014\n               ``moment of silence'' turned Manhattan mute in \nLennon's memory;\u0014\n               three distraught fans committed suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Lennon's death gave life to his legend. Lennon and \nOno's\u0014\n               ``Double Fantasy'' LP climbed to the top of the \ncharts, and\u0014\n               ``Starting Over'' became his biggest single.\u0014\n\u0014\n               Chapman pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 20 years \nto life.\u0014\n               Jailed upstate in Attica, he became a blip on Ono's \nradar screen\u0014\n               until this October, when he came up for parole.\u0014\n\u0014\n               ``The parole thing really hit me, and it depressed \nme,'' she\u0014\n               says. ``Especially when that guy was coming out in \npublic,\u0014\n               interviewed by many'' - she sighs - ``by the press. It \ntotally\u0014\n               devastated me.''\u0014\n\u0014\n               Ono feared for her life, for the life of her son Sean, \nfor the\u0014\n               life of John's older son Julian.

    "title": "LESSONS FROM 50 YEARS OF MINISTRY",
    "words": "In 50 years of ministry, Jimmy Draper (BD 61, MDIV 73), president of \nLife Way Christian Resources, has learned a few lessons, 21 of which \nhe shared with students during chapel at Southwestern Sept. 21, 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nI. Don't neglect your personal walk with the Lord.\u0014\n\"You're not smart enough, you're not spiritUal enough, you're not \ndeep enough to make it without daily time with God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Make time for your family.\u0014\n\"You c:arit go through life taking care of everybody else's familyand \nlose your own, and you may very well do that. You have to minister to \nyour family;\"\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Be an encourager.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Never make a decision when you're depressed or discouraged. \n\"You've got to be happy where you are before God will move you some \nwhere else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Doubt never means yes and always means no or wait a while.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. Openness and honesty are keys to effective ministry.\u0014\n\"They need to see us as we are. Don't hide things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Answer all your phone calls and mail.\u0014\n\"If somebody has time to call you or has time to write you, you have \ntime to answer back. Many ministers lose a lot of credibility because \nthey're not responsible in returning calls.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n8. Don't let anger be a pattern of behavior.\u0014\n\"Treat people courteously, especially those who disagree with you. \nFirmness does not need to be brutal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n9. Be quick to forgive people when they make mistakes and use their \nmistakes to help them.\u0014\n\"Realire that few people make mistakes on purpose.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Preach sermons grounded in the Bible.\u0014\n\"Don't discover topics that you think need to be addressed and then \ntry to find Scriptures to substantiate your message. Start with the \nScripture.\" \"God already knows what people need, and if you'll preach \nthe Word of God, he'll speak to their needs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n11. There's no excuse for being unprepared to preach.\u0014\n\"Mark out the time; bite the bullet. Tell people that unless \nsomebody's dying or it's an emergency, you're with God and you're \nstudying the Word of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n12. Do not flin with temptation.\u0014\n\"You don't have to wait until you're tempted to decide not to yield. \nIf you're not careful, you will take each temptation as it comes \nalong as an opportunity that you have to decide, 'What am I going to \ndo?' No, you can decide now you're not going to do it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n13. Cooperate with fellow believers.\u0014\n\"None of us can fulfill the Great Commission byourselves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n14. Be a good steward of your position and influence in all \nexperiences. \"Whatever God has brought into your life, he brought \ninto it to equip you to help somebody else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n15. Devote yourself to developing leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n16. Cherish and protect friendships.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. Give credit to other people.\u0014\n\"You need to recognize your fellow staff members and your church \nleaders. Give them praise and applause. Let people know they are \nworthy parrners in ministry;\"\u0014\n\u0014\n18. Keep confidences.\u0014\n\"There's more gossip passed around under the guise of prayer requests \nthan anything I know. Don't share with somebody else what somebody \ntells you in confidence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n19. Lead by example.~\u0014\n\"'Do as I say and not as I do' never has worked, and it never will. \nYou can't ask people to do something you're not doing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n20. Be a servant leader, not a prima donna.\u0014\n\"Servant leadership is the pattern that God gave to us, that Christ \ngave to us.\" \"You serve people. You care about them. You minister to \nthem. And as you do that, you earn the right to lead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n21. Know that you're not always right and admit it.\u0014\n\"Every hill's not worth dying on.\" ~\u0014",

    "title": "LAST WORDS, FAREWELLS AND EPITAPHS",
    "words": "\"Last words\" - along with their cousins, farewells and epitaphs - are \na dying art.\u0014\n\u0014\n           People used to sum up an entire lifetime with a pithy \nquote, and Al McGuire was as good with pithy quotes as anyone. He \nusually kept his feelings private, though.\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"Never undress until you die,\" he explained.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Without McGuire's, I decided to look up other last words.\u0014\n\u0014\n           I like those of Crowfoot, the Blackfoot warrior and \norator: \"What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It \nis the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow \nwhich runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          The poet Emily Dickinson assessed her dimming situation: \" \n. . . the fog is rising.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           Anne Boleyn assessed hers, too: \"The executioner is, I \nbelieve, very expert, and my neck is very slender.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          Queen Elizabeth I wished for more: \"All of my possessions \nfor a moment of time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          Bing Crosby was pleased: \"That was a great game of golf, \nfellers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n          Do we need final words?\u0014\n\u0014\n          Pancho Villa thought so: \"Don't let it end like this. Tell \nthem I said something.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          But Karl Marx told his housekeeper: \"Go on, get out. Last \nwords are for fools who haven't said enough.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n          Humorless sort, that Marx fellow.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The best \"last words,\" Marx notwithstanding, may be \nself-deprecating ones.\u0014\n\u0014\n          McGuire had that sort of humor. He once described his role \nas head coach:\u0014\n\u0014\n          \"I was the Houdini, who did his disappearing act. I know \nthat 85 percent of me is buffalo chips, and the other 15 percent is \nrare talent. I'd say in that 15 percent, in the mental toughness, the \nmedia, keeping an eye on the elephant, not the mice, and extending \nthe life of the extinct kiwi bird, which is nocturnal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           I'm not precisely sure what it meant, either. But how can \nyou not like the man?\u0014\n\u0014\n           Or how can you not like these last lines:\u0014\n\u0014\n           President John Quincy Adams: \"I inhabit a weak, frail, \ndecayed tenement; battered by the winds and broken in on by the \nstorms, and, from all I can learn, the landlord does not intend to \nrepair.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           British actor Edmund Gwenn, on his deathbed when he was \ntold, \"It must be very hard,\" responded: \"It is, but not as hard as \nfarce.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           Lady Astor, waking to find all her family: \"Am I dying, or \nis this my birthday?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n           John Barrymore: \"Die? I should say not, dear fellow. No \nBarrymore would allow such a conventional thing to happen to him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n            Dramatist William Saroyan: \"Everybody has got to die, but \nI have always believed an exception would be made in my case. Now \nwhat?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n             And finally, there is the exit line attributed to Oscar \nWilde, as he lay dying in a drab Paris bedroom:\u0014\n\u0014\n             \"Either that wallpaper goes, or I do.\"\u0014",

Broken, heavy, empty , \nbleeding, shattered, painful are all terms we have heard associated \nwith grief s effects upon the hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut these are words.

We all have our own words and they are within our hearts, \nexpressed only in our tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one phrase that does describe that time after my daughter \nLoren's death. \"My heart is a lonely hunter that hunts on a lonely \nhill\" from the poem The Lone/y Hunter by, William Sharp. How I \nsearched for some answers, relief, comfort...anything to help me \n:fill my heart again.

    "words": "Feb 20, 2001\u0014\n\u0014\nLOCAL RACING COMMUNITY REACTS\u0014\n\u0014\n'This one really bothers me' Sawyer loses another friend on a \nracetrack\u0014\n\u0014\nBY MIKE HARRIS\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul Sawyer has been involved with automobile racing too long not to \nhave been clutched by death's ugly grasp. The former owner of \nRichmond International Raceway has seen too many friends die.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoe Weatherly, a former partner in racetrack ownership, was killed. \nSo, too, were Curtis Turner and Fireball Roberts. Sawyer talked with \nNeil Bonnett on the morning in 1994 that Bonnett died in an accident \nat Daytona International Speedway. Bonnett previously had suffered a \nhead injury in another crash.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I asked Neil, 'What the hell are you doing in a race car?' and he \nsaid, 'Paul, it's in my blood,'\" Sawyer recalled.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing that his friends knew the risk and took it willingly, knowing \nthat it could happen, doesn't lessen the shock when it does happen. \nSo it was that Sawyer spent a troublesome day yesterday, thinking \nabout his friend Dale Earnhardt.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, died Sunday in a \nlast-lap crash during the Daytona 500.\u0014\n\u0014\nSawyer had known Earnhardt \"ever since he started racing. He'd raced \non an old dirt track I owned. His daddy [Ralph] raced there,\" Sawyer \nsaid via telephone from his Virginia Beach home.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This one really bothers me. The younger generation that has seen him \nrun, they'll remember him for a long time. Sure, he's not the first \none. But the sport is really going to miss him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSawyer can't remember the last time he didn't attend the Daytona 500. \nHe stayed home this year because he wasn't feeling well and watched \non television. He said he had a bad feeling immediately after seeing \nEarnhardt's crash.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I heard they'd carried him to the hospital, I told my wife if \nhe makes it he's going to be lucky,\" Sawyer said. \"That was a \nterrible crash.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've seen a whole lot of wrecks and I was sitting here thinking, \n'That's a hell of a lick.' It didn't look good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSawyer said he knew of Earnhardt's reputation as a fellow who \nsometimes was difficult. In his professional dealings, he said he \nnever saw that side of Earnhardt.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was a dedicated guy, faithful to the sport,\" Sawyer said. \"He \nalways treated me with respect. Whatever I asked him to do, I never \nhad a problem. And I'll tell you this: The man was one heck of a \nrace-car driver, just like his father.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKen Campbell, the longtime public relations chief at RIR, said he, \ntoo, never had a problem with Earnhardt. When Earnhardt started in \nNASCAR's top circuit, the sport wasn't as popular as it is now. \nCampbell would always have \"an up-front man,\" a driver who would come \nin before the race for a series of interviews.\u0014\n\u0014\nGood luck, Campbell was told when Earnhardt served as \"up-front man\" \nduring his rookie season in 1979. Earnhardt didn't always enjoy a \nrosy relationship with the media, particularly early in his career.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He did everything I asked him to do, all of it,\"Campbell said. \"It \nwas the first time I'd ever spent a whole day with him and he was \njust excellent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not a psychologist, but I do think Dale had a certain defensive \nshell around him. Inside that, there was not a bigger heart around \nanywhere than that man had in him. He's going to be missed, believe \nme.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWarner Hodgdon, at one time a part owner of RIR, helped sponsor \nEarnhardt's car during his first championship season in 1980. Though \na sponsorship then cost much less than the millions it takes today, \nHodgdon said Earnhardt always was appreciative of the help he \nreceived.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm in tears just talking about him,\" Hodgdon said. \"I know he acted \nhard sometimes. He was soft and big-hearted on the inside. This was a \nman who was always focused, who always knew where the bull's-eye was \non the target.\"\u0014",

Meals and meetings were held \noutside or in\u0014\n                      tents, depending on the weather. Visitors slept \n(and many\u0014\n                      snored loudly) in tents and overcrowded \nbarracks. One had to\u0014\n                      stand in long lines (often up to 30 minutes) \nfor everything,\u0014\n                      especially food. It hardly seemed like a \nsetting for meaningful\u0014\n                      prayer, but my visit to Taiz turned out to be \none of the most\u0014\n                      spiritually meaningful weeks of my life.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And not just for me. During the hot July week \nwhen I visited,\u0014\n                      Taiz welcomed more than 4,500 pilgrims, mostly \nyoung\u0014\n                      adults, from many denominations and from 60 \nnations\u0014\n                      (including a thousand from Eastern Europe). \nSummer weeks\u0014\n                      typically see between 2,500 and 6,000 visitors, \nwith a total of\u0014\n                      100,000 each yearalthough Taiz is off the \nbeaten path (in\u0014\n                      France's Burgundy region, midway between Lyons \nand\u0014\n                      Geneva).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What attracts so many to this place?

But the primary \nreason people\u0014\n                      flock to Taiz is the prayer and worship. \"When \nyou ask at\u0014\n                      the end of a week what they most appreciated  \nseven,\u0014\n                      eight, nine times out of ten they'll say it's \nprayer, that they\u0014\n                      found something there,\" says Taiz Brother \nJean-Marie, a\u0014\n                      native New Yorker.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yet it's a unique form of prayer that attracts; \nTaiz leaders\u0014\n                      call it \"common prayer\" and other Christian \nleaders call it the\u0014\n                      \"the daily office,\" from the Latin officium \nmeaning \"duty\" or\u0014\n                      \"responsibility.\" This type of prayer brings \npeople of all\u0014\n                      Christian traditions not only to France but \nalso to increasingly\u0014\n                      popular prayer communities in England and \nScotland,\u0014\n                      communities that structure their life together \naround the daily\u0014\n                      office.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I recently had the opportunity to visit such \ncommunities at\u0014\n                      Lindisfarne, Iona, Taiz, and Northumbria, and \nI discovered\u0014\n                      that people of all denominations and no \ndenomination have a\u0014\n                      continuing and lively interest in a \nChristianity that relies on\u0014\n                      the ancient tradition of common prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Chant phenomenon\u0014\n                      The term daily office refers to a variety of \nservices of set\u0014\n                      prayers and readings that are said together \nthrough the day;\u0014\n                      in some places, this can add up to seven \nservices a day.

Note\u0014\n                      especially the unexpected success of Kathleen \nNorris's The\u0014\n                      Cloister Walk (Riverhead, 1996) and of the \nrecording Chant by\u0014\n                      cloistered Benedictine monks in Spain. \nIntriguing literary\u0014\n                      variations on the office crowd bookstore \nshelves: Anita\u0014\n                      Barrows and Joanna Macy have translated Rainer \nMaria\u0014\n                      Rilke's poetic Book of Hours (Riverhead, 1996) \nand Phil\u0014\n                      Cousineau has edited a contemplative book \ncalled The Soul\u0014\n                      Aflame: A Modern Book of Hours (Raincoast \nBooks, 2000).\u0014\n                      Bestselling author Gail Godwin's novel about an \nEpiscopal\u0014\n                      priest not only reflects regularly on the \noffice but also refers to\u0014\n                      it in the title, Evensong (Ballantine, 1999). \nSuzanne Guthrie\u0014\n                      reflects on the office in Praying the Hours \n(Cowley, 2000).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even my own Mennonite tradition is republishing \nold prayer\u0014\n                      books in spiffy volumes: Prayer Book for \nEarnest Christians\u0014\n                      (Herald, 1997) and Golden Apples in Silver \nBowls (Lancaster\u0014\n                      Mennonite Historical Society, 1999), both \nedited by Leonard\u0014\n                      Gross. More than half a dozen noteworthy office \nbooks have\u0014\n                      been published within the last year alone, \nincluding Robert\u0014\n                      Benson's Venite: A Book of Daily Prayer \n(Tarcher/Putnam,\u0014\n                      2000) and Robert Webber's The Prymer: The \nPrayer Book of\u0014\n                      the Medieval Era Adapted for Contemporary Use \n(Paraclete,\u0014\n                      2000). Of all the new books, the most \nnoteworthy is a\u0014\n                      three-volume office, The Divine Hours, edited \nby Phyllis Tickle\u0014\n                      (Doubleday, 2000).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I understand the attraction. As a pastor and \nChristian, I have\u0014\n                      been especially concerned about the inadequacy \nof most\u0014\n                      Christian prayer for a culture in which many \nare formed by a\u0014\n                      weekly average of 28 hours of television.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Too often, people who pray do so only briefly, \nwithout\u0014\n                      discipline or organization. They pray \"on the \nfly,\" winging\u0014\n                      phrases toward God while commuting, or \nsqueezing in an\u0014\n                      occasional devotional. Such prayers are ad hoc \nand\u0014\n                      self-directed: made up along the way, according \nto mood, and\u0014\n                      not paying attention to the Christian year.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rather than having help, support, or direction \nfrom others with\u0014\n                      maturity or experience, many Christians decide \non their own\u0014\n                      what to do. As a result, they find themselves \nincreasingly\u0014\n                      disconnected and isolated from other believers. \nThey are\u0014\n                      subjective; guided by their feelings of the \nmoment, they freely\u0014\n                      abandon prayer modes (confession, praise, \nintercession). In\u0014\n                      the end, these Christians find themselves \nincreasingly\u0014\n                      disconnected from God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is part of my own prayer biography. In \nadolescence, I\u0014\n                      was reasonably disciplined in prayer until my \nsister, my only\u0014\n                      sibling, died of leukemia at age 17. This set \noff a huge faith\u0014\n                      crisis. At times I had nothing to say to God or \ndid not know\u0014\n                      how to voice my prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      About two decades ago, on a whim, I bought a \ndiscontinued\u0014\n                      book by a famous Catholic priest. As a \nconvinced evangelical\u0014\n                      Anabaptist, I was skeptical. But I was also \ncurious. As it\u0014\n                      turned out, this book became the starting point \nin my\u0014\n                      recovery of a fuller prayer life through the \ndaily office.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I've not been alone in this discovery, as my \nvisits to a number\u0014\n                      of prayer communities quickly showed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The holiest place in all of England\"\u0014\n                      My first stop was the island of Lindisfarne \n(locals prefer \"Holy\u0014\n                      Isle\"). Its small village includes several \nchurches and three\u0014\n                      retreat housesLindisfarne is possibly one of \nthe few places\u0014\n                      in Great Britain where retreat houses almost \nequal the\u0014\n                      number of pubs.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lindisfarne has been an important pilgrimage \ndestination for\u0014\n                      centuries. From it sprang much of the early \nevangelization of\u0014\n                      England. Numerous Celtic Christian saints are \nassociated\u0014\n                      with it, as is the gloriously illustrated \nCeltic manuscript, the\u0014\n                      eighth-century Lindisfarne Gospels. Alcuin, the \nmedieval\u0014\n                      scholar and archbishop, once told Charlemagne \nit was \"the\u0014\n                      holiest place in all of England.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today 140,000 people visit St. Mary Virgin \nChurch (now\u0014\n                      Anglican) each year. As the island's oldest \nbuilding, its\u0014\n                      architecture reflects Saxon and Norman \ninfluences, parts of it\u0014\n                      preceding the 12th century. Behind it lie the \nruins of an\u0014\n                      11th-century Benedictine monastery.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      St. Mary's also attracts visitors because its \npastor, David\u0014\n                      Adam, is the popular author of more than a \ndozen books of\u0014\n                      Celtic Christian poem-prayers, including an \noffice, The\u0014\n                      Rhythm of Life (Morehouse, 1996), which Adam \nwrote\u0014\n                      because so many people, including Anglicans, \nare unfamiliar\u0014\n                      with the office. Its short prayers and \nScriptures can be\u0014\n                      memorized quickly, so those who use it can be \nnourished at\u0014\n                      all times and places. This office is getting \naround. Anglicans\u0014\n                      in the South American Andes are translating it \ninto Spanish.\u0014\n                      Non-Anglicans elsewhere also use it, including \na U.S. Navajo\u0014\n                      group and a group of Lapps in northern Finland.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Adam says an office is like lined paper: \"If \nyou haven't got\u0014\n                      lines on the paper, you can't achieve much by \nyourself,\" he\u0014\n                      says. \"That is true of most people: if they're \nleft without an\u0014\n                      office, without prayers they learn and recite, \nthey tend to pray\u0014\n                      very little.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The office helps us pray when prayer is hard. \nHe says that\u0014\n                      during spiritually dry or discouraging periods, \n\"you've actually\u0014\n                      got this resource within you which you can call \non. Even if\u0014\n                      you may have to say it quite coolly, you can \nstill say it. I\u0014\n                      compare it to my wife's cooking: even when \nshe's not that\u0014\n                      fond of me, she still cooks for me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Regarding the modern aversion to repetition, he \nsays, \"It's\u0014\n                      really hard to get people to see that what \nyou're dealing with\u0014\n                      is something of tremendous depth, and the words \nare just\u0014\n                      plumbing the depth. It's  like turning a \ndrill. It might appear\u0014\n                      boring, but the more you are turning the deeper \nyou get. It's\u0014\n                      literally boring. But if you only turn it once \nyou don't get very\u0014\n                      far.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I suppose most folks who don't like repetition \nnever say 'I\u0014\n                      love you' to their wife more than once in their \nlife,\" Adam\u0014\n                      says, laughing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Adam recognizes obstacles: \"Offices were \nwritten for\u0014\n                      people who had a more leisurely start to their \nday. Nowadays\u0014\n                      most people set an alarm, jump up, and travel \nmiles and are\u0014\n                      in a hurry. The office says  'Slow down, take \nyour time.\u0014\n                      Make some space.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another problem is finding times and places to \nmeet with\u0014\n                      others. The office requires community: \"Any \noffice by yourself\u0014\n                      for long is difficult. Even if you share the \noffice once or twice a\u0014\n                      week, you can manage it the rest of the time by \nyourselfas\u0014\n                      long as you have this sharing,\" Adam says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Adam has a pastoral and missionary concern for \nisland\u0014\n                      neighbors and the visitors who come from all \nover the world.\u0014\n                      He meets many and offers counsel, support, and \nadvice.\u0014\n                      Adam's ministry confirmed something I saw in \neach\u0014\n                      community: people are drawn to prayer and a \ncommunity\u0014\n                      rooted in the office.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Prayer echoing off stone walls\u0014\n                      Iona is a small Hebridean island off Scotland's \nwest coast.\u0014\n                      Columba, an Irish monk, landed there in the \nsixth century,\u0014\n                      setting up a monastery that evangelized much of \nScotland,\u0014\n                      England, and Europe. A burial place of many \nIrish and\u0014\n                      Scottish kings, the monastery is known for a \nbeautifully\u0014\n                      illustrated Celtic manuscript, The Book of \nKells. The sense of\u0014\n                      history is reinforced by the ancient \ngravestones and standing\u0014\n                      stone crosses (one is more than 1,000 years \nold) found on\u0014\n                      the island. Samuel Johnson once wrote that a \nperson \"is little\u0014\n                      to be envied whose piety would not grow warmer \namong the\u0014\n                      ruins of Iona.\" It is a stunning place with \nstark hills, huge\u0014\n                      boulders, snow-white beaches, and many-hued \nwaters.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the 1930s, Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) \nclergyman\u0014\n                      George MacLeod gathered seminary students and \ntradesmen\u0014\n                      to rebuild the ruined medieval Abbey. This \nproject, which was\u0014\n                      designed to help ministers understand working \nfolk and to\u0014\n                      train working folk in theology, was the \nbeginning of Iona\u0014\n                      Community. Now with more than 200 members from \nmany\u0014\n                      denominations, and growing steadily, the \ncommunity has a\u0014\n                      strong commitment to peace and justice and is \nknown for its\u0014\n                      worship resources. Its island conference \ncenters are so\u0014\n                      popular that reservations must be made months \nin advance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The abbey sees more than 100,000 tourists per \nyear\u0014\n                      (sometimes up to 1,200 a day). This is \nespecially impressive\u0014\n                      since it is no mean feat to get there: from \nGlasgow, one must\u0014\n                      take a train, two ferries, and a bus that \ncrosses the Isle of\u0014\n                      Mull on a one-lane road. People joke that it is \neasier and\u0014\n                      quicker to get to Spain.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I stayed a week at the abbey. Guests, staff, \nand volunteers\u0014\n                      from around the world represented many \ndenominations. In\u0014\n                      addition to daily morning and evening prayers, \nthere was\u0014\n                      strong emphasis on community and chore-sharing. \n(Each day\u0014\n                      I proceeded from morning prayers to clean \ntoilets while\u0014\n                      humming hymns.) Worship and work are \nintegrated. Morning\u0014\n                      worship never ends with a benedictionas work \nis part of\u0014\n                      worshipand the evening service never begins \nwith a call to\u0014\n                      worship, since it is an extension of work.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Worship was lively and inspiring. We said the \nLord's Prayer\u0014\n                      rhythmically, phrase by phrase, each line \nechoing against the\u0014\n                      stone walls like the waves beating on rocks a \nfew hundred\u0014\n                      feet away. Our singing included praise \nchoruses, hymns,\u0014\n                      African-American spirituals, monastic chants, \nand\u0014\n                      international Christian musicall with the \nmagnificent\u0014\n                      acoustics of the rebuilt medieval church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Iona encouraged prayer in many ways. The main \nchurch has\u0014\n                      a special corner for intercession and healing, \nand Iona offers a\u0014\n                      healing service once a week. The abbey had \nother chapels\u0014\n                      dedicated to prayer. In the main church, a \nlittle shrine calls to\u0014\n                      mind \"all victims of violence in the world and \nthose who stand\u0014\n                      with them.\" One transept, behind a screen \ndonated by Queen\u0014\n                      Elizabeth, is filled with displays about a host \nof social and\u0014\n                      political movements, including human rights \n(Amnesty\u0014\n                      International), international debt relief \n(Jubilee 2000), and\u0014\n                      opposition to land mines.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Iona believes that worship needs to be \nincarnational, engaged\u0014\n                      with daily life, and historical, rooted in \nChristian traditions.\u0014\n                      Daily prayereven if not in a shared spaceis \nimportant for\u0014\n                      holding the dispersed community together. \n\"Whatever our\u0014\n                      mood, whatever our circumstances, there's a \ngiven,\" says\u0014\n                      Norman Shanks, Iona's leader. \"If you like, it \nis a gift.\" That\u0014\n                      gift gradually transforms Christians, he adds, \nhelping us at all\u0014\n                      times to be still, silent, and open to God and \nothers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brian Woodcock, a United Reformed pastor and \nIona's\u0014\n                      warden (administrator), is concerned for those \nwith little\u0014\n                      church connection and finds it important to \nemphasize the\u0014\n                      Bible in every service. Youth often comment \nthat the services\u0014\n                      are not \"boring\" like some church worship. \nOften people who\u0014\n                      do react to the repetitiveness early in the \nweek welcome the\u0014\n                      rhythm by week's end.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A perennial problem for retreat places is that \n\"mountaintop\u0014\n                      experiences\" do not connect with life. Woodcock \nsays\u0014\n                      worship needs to help people remember that \"if \nwe come\u0014\n                      away in order to find God, in the end it isn't \nGod that we're\u0014\n                      finding.\" Withdrawal must always have the \npurpose of\u0014\n                      changing our perspective and helping us engage \nwhere we\u0014\n                      live, work, and minister. Several times I heard \na wry quote:\u0014\n                      \"People come seeking peace and quiet, and we \ntry to send\u0014\n                      them away seeking peace and justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Shanks said that Iona involves \"renewing, \nreconciling, living,\u0014\n                      and exporting the gospel in engagement, not \nwithdrawing to\u0014\n                      the margins of a ghetto or a supposedly \npeaceful place.\" As\u0014\n                      visitors are told before afternoon prayers: \n\"The gospel\u0014\n                      commands us to seek peace founded on justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The most difficult thing about prayer is its \nchallenge. \"If one\u0014\n                      takes the actual words quite seriously, some of \nit is quite\u0014\n                      hard,\" Shanks says. \"The God reflected is a God \nwhose love\u0014\n                      is compassionate and steadfast but also tough. \nThe morning\u0014\n                      office promises, 'We will not offer to God \nofferings that cost us\u0014\n                      nothing.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Refugee camp around a church\u0014\n                      At Taiz, the only impressive building is the \nchurch. A\u0014\n                      Methodist minister told me that Taiz looks \n\"like a refugee\u0014\n                      camp built around a church.\" (\"Refugee camp\" is \nappropriate\u0014\n                      since it seems that people came to Taiz \nseeking refuge from\u0014\n                      a secular and materialist culture.) For one \nolder woman, the\u0014\n                      camping, food lines, and crowds brought \nflashbacks of her\u0014\n                      internment in a World War II concentration camp.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Each day is organized around three worship\u0014\n                      servicesmorning, noon, and eveningeach \nlasting an hour.\u0014\n                      People sit or kneel in a darkened room, facing \nceiling-to-floor\u0014\n                      banners, hundreds of flickering candles, and \nicons. Music is\u0014\n                      led by an unseen song leader and a volunteer \nchoir. Each\u0014\n                      service is a series of Taiz chants, short \nBible readings\u0014\n                      (especially Psalms and Gospel readings), \nprayers (translated\u0014\n                      into four to six languages), and a prolonged \nsilence of five to\u0014\n                      ten minutes (no mean feat with thousands of \nyouth). This is a\u0014\n                      far cry from the beachball pyrotechnics at our \ndenominational\u0014\n                      youth events. The emphasis is on simplicity \n(especially\u0014\n                      necessary given different language groups and \nchurch\u0014\n                      traditions) and evoking mystery and reverence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The singing was so beautiful that for the first \ntime in my life I\u0014\n                      was attracted to the idea of singing in heaven \nfor all eternity.\u0014\n                      When the evening service ended at 9:20, many \nopted to sing\u0014\n                      and pray for hours more, often past midnight. \nPeople still\u0014\n                      lingered at 1:30 a.m. after the weekly \nFriday-night vigil.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In addition, the day includes hour-long Bible \nstudies (also\u0014\n                      translated into many languages), chores, and \ncommon\u0014\n                      labornot your typical holiday jaunt.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many people return year after year. Months \nafter my visit,\u0014\n                      some of those who have kept in touch with me \ncontinue to\u0014\n                      speak about how the week was a turning point \nand marked a\u0014\n                      deeper commitment to prayerful service.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Roger Schutz-Marsauche (now Brother Roger) \nfounded Taiz\u0014\n                      during World War II. Coming out of a Reformed \nbackground,\u0014\n                      he hoped to create a small, prayerful community \nto reconcile\u0014\n                      Christians. As more and more visitors came, the \nbrothers\u0014\n                      responded to the spiritual hunger. In response \nto the influx of\u0014\n                      youth, the community simplified its traditional \nmonastic\u0014\n                      worship, using short texts, prayers, and \nrepetitive chants. Of\u0014\n                      all the communities I visited, Taiz is the \nmost radical in its\u0014\n                      willingness to revise its daily office; indeed, \nTaiz leaders no\u0014\n                      longer use the term office and prefer common \nprayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The concern  is that people can understand \nsomething of\u0014\n                      the Christian mystery,\" says Brother Emile. \n\"I've often thought\u0014\n                      about a professor who spoke about how he had \nchanged. He\u0014\n                      said, 'I used to teach with the conviction that \nif my students\u0014\n                      didn't understand what I was saying, they would \ncome and\u0014\n                      ask questions. Now I see that's not how it is. \nNo, if they don't\u0014\n                      understand, they go away.' He says, 'It's when \nthey do\u0014\n                      understand something they start to ask \nquestions.'\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"That's one of the concerns here,\" Brother \nEmile says, \"that\u0014\n                      people can quite quickly understand something \nof what's at\u0014\n                      the heart of the Christian mystery. If they \nunderstand that,\u0014\n                      then they'll want to go further, start to ask \nquestions: How\u0014\n                      can I deepen the faith? How can I get to know \nthe Scripture\u0014\n                      more? That has guided a lot of what we do here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Where the great streams converge\u0014\n                      The least famous place I visited was where I \nfelt most at\u0014\n                      home, at the Northumbrian Community. Its \nsymbolic center is\u0014\n                      Hetton Hall, an old, rambling house in remote, \nrural northern\u0014\n                      England, built around an 13th-century tower.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The publishing giant Harper got hold of \nNorthumbria's office\u0014\n                      several years ago, and sought permission to \npublish it. Celtic\u0014\n                      Daily Prayer (Harper, 1994) has sold well and \npeople have\u0014\n                      come from as far away as Tasmania and Russia to \nvisit\u0014\n                      because of it. Northumbria is surprised at the \nwide response.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While I was there, middle-aged and elderly \nwomen were\u0014\n                      attending an art retreat led by \"Christian \nGoths.\" Recent\u0014\n                      guests and volunteers include people from the \nUnited States,\u0014\n                      Canada, France, and Australia. The community \nproperty\u0014\n                      includes a prayer chapel and two poustinias \n(outdoor prayer\u0014\n                      cells). The community prays together four times \ndaily:\u0014\n                      morning, noon, evening, and before going to \nbed. Singing\u0014\n                      includes hymns and choruses. The services have \na set\u0014\n                      structure but include times for spontaneous \nsharing and\u0014\n                      intercessions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Conversations included references to Youth With \na Mission,\u0014\n                      Youth for Christ, Baptist churches, the \nVineyard movement,\u0014\n                      spiritual warfare, and Spring Harvest (a major \nannual\u0014\n                      evangelical festival). At the same time, there \nare icons\u0014\n                      everywhere and crossing oneself is a regular \npart of prayer.\u0014\n                      The community is enriched by all Christian \ntraditions. Richard\u0014\n                      Foster \"believes our community is a living \nembodiment of his\u0014\n                      book, Streams of Living Water,\" says Trevor \nMiller, one of the\u0014\n                      community's two leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Members spoke of their \"new monasticism.\" Like \nthe other\u0014\n                      communities, they feel a call to minister to \nthose who feel\u0014\n                      estranged from the established church. \nNorthumbria members\u0014\n                      put strong emphasis on intercession. I was a \nbeneficiary.\u0014\n                      While at Northumbria, I learned that a good \nfriend in\u0014\n                      Canadaa 45-year old husband, father, and\u0014\n                      psychiatristhad been hit by a car and was on \nlife support.\u0014\n                      Community members prayed for him, his family, \nand me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A middle-aged mother of teenagers said she \nappreciated the\u0014\n                      emphasis on \"grace and struggle\" since \n\"triumphant and\u0014\n                      victorious living\" rhetoric was no longer \nhelpful for her. A\u0014\n                      Baptist member found liturgical worship \nforeign, but saw that\u0014\n                      it affirmed God's presence in new ways and \ninvolved \"other\u0014\n                      truths I need to hear.\" She appreciated the \nconnection with\u0014\n                      other Christian traditions. David Ward, a \ncharismatic\u0014\n                      evangelical pastor, wrote for a Northumbria \nnewsletter about\u0014\n                      his discovery that the daily office gives more \ndepth to his\u0014\n                      prayer life and functions as a school of prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Community member Rob Brown told me that even\u0014\n                      nonliturgical people find \"anchors\" in the \noffice: \"For people in\u0014\n                      deep struggles, to have something that happens \nevery day at\u0014\n                      the same time, it's like a skeleton that keeps \nthem from\u0014\n                      falling to pieces.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ceaseless praise\u0014\n                      The daily office is not easy and it will not \nsolve all problems.\u0014\n                      As Brother Emile says, \"No matter how beautiful \na prayer is,\u0014\n                      there's always going to be a need for \nperseverance, for\u0014\n                      commitment, for being faithful. There will be \ntimes when we\u0014\n                      don't feel the beauty. Then we pray the \nquestion rather than\u0014\n                      what we feel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But even and especially then, Emile notes, we \nneed to pray\u0014\n                      together: \"People are not going to be able to \npersevere alone\u0014\n                      in personal prayer. In regular common prayer, \nyou join\u0014\n                      together and take your part. Discouragement is \ntoo easy\u0014\n                      today. But in common prayer you support one \nanother. We\u0014\n                      are never all at the same place.

Rather, this practice can provide a \nway of prayer\u0014\n                      that will help someperhaps manypray.

The popularity of the book gave her \nthe\u0014\nopportunity to share her faith with thousands of people on speaking \ntours.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne such evening, after she had spoken about the forgiveness of \nChrist, a\u0014\nman approached her whom she recognized as one of the guards from \nAuschwitz.\u0014\nShe immediately felt all of the horror, pain and hatred from those \nyears of\u0014\npersecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe told her that he had listened to her talk, and informed her that \nhe had\u0014\nbeen a guard at the death camp. She told him that she recognized him.\u0014\nCrying, he asked if he might receive the forgiveness of Christ of \nwhich she\u0014\nhad spoken.  She thought to herself that she could not, but she \nremembered\u0014\nthe command of Christ to love your enemy and to forgive seventy times \nseven\u0014\nthe person who has wronged you.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe prayed that Jesus might give her the strength to forgive the man, \nand as\u0014\nshe prayed, she felt a sensation begin in her heart and flow through \nher\u0014\nhand as it touched his. Then she heard herself saying, \"In the name \nof Jesus\u0014\nChrist, I forgive you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man collapsed to her feet and wept a prayer of thanks. She later\u0014\ndiscovered that he had become a minister of the gospel, and that many \npeople\u0014\nhad come to Christ through his ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe never know how far God can spread the love that we give. Indeed, \nwe have\u0014\nperhaps received love from someone that was born from such an act of \nloving\u0014\nforgiveness in someone else.  We love our enemies because we \nrecognize that\u0014\nChrist died for them, too.  We love our enemies because we know that \nthe\u0014\npower of love is stronger than any depth to which we can fall.\u0014",

    "words": "Thursday, March 29, 2001 Time Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nLet Bullies Beware \u0014\n\u0014\nPoliticians are going after them. But what works best? Banishing them \n or changing\u0014\nthe culture?\u0014\n\u0014\nBY NADYA LABI\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 450 freshmen and sophomores gathered in the auditorium of \nStephenson High\u0014\nSchool in Stone Mountain, Ga., are contemplating a red poster with a \ndrawing of a\u0014\nlarge angry face and the word BULLY. That poster and two others, \nmarked VICTIM and\u0014\nBYSTANDER, form the backdrop for the action onstage. Victor--with his \nblack beret\u0014\nand long, stringy hair that scream \"Victim!\"--is enduring a stream of \nabuse from Brad.\u0014\n\"I can call you anything I want because I'm a man and you're a punk \nsissy nerd!\" Brad\u0014\nshouts after stealing Victor's hat. The audience laughs hysterically. \n\"We don't want\u0014\npunk sissy nerds like you hanging around our school. Right?\" asks \nBrad, prompting\u0014\nthe watching kids to chant \"Punk sissy nerd\" in an unconscious \ndisplay of bystander\u0014\ncravenness. But when the play is over, the students are more \nreflective. \"It was really\u0014\ngood,\" says Shina Mills, a sophomore. \"It helps teenagers not to \nresolve problems on\u0014\ntheir own but to get help.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA skit about big bad bullies may seem ludicrously quaint against the \nbackdrop of teen\u0014\nshootings like the one last week in El Cajon, Calif. But the \nprofessional production,\u0014\npart of the local school district's efforts to combat bullying, seeks \nin a small way to\u0014\nchange the weekly headlines. More and more schools around the country \nare\u0014\nimplementing antibullying policies. New laws in Georgia, New \nHampshire and Vermont\u0014\nrequire them, and Colorado, home to the Columbine school massacre, is \ndebating a\u0014\nmeasure. Skeptics say such legislation is fruitless and serves merely \nas a platform for\u0014\npoliticians to display their practiced empathy. But some innovative \nprograms around\u0014\nthe country are showing concrete results that challenge the \nlaissez-faire mentality\u0014\nthat, after all, kids will be kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat bullying is a destructive force is not in dispute. Last fall the \nNational Threat\u0014\nAssessment Center, run by the U.S. Secret Service, found that in more \nthan two-thirds\u0014\nof 37 recent school shootings, the attackers felt \"persecuted, \nbullied, threatened,\u0014\nattacked or injured.\" And bullying is why more than 160,000 children \nskip school every\u0014\nday, according to the National Association of School Psychologists.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorgia began its pioneering efforts to legislate against bullying \nafter two school\u0014\ntragedies. In 1994 Brian Head, a chubby, bespectacled 15-year-old who \nhad been\u0014\ntaunted for years, broke when a classmate at Etowah High School in \nWoodstock\u0014\nslapped him. He shouted, \"I can't take it anymore!,\" pulled out a gun \nand shot himself\u0014\nin the head. Four years later, Josh Belluardo was punched in the \nhead--and killed--by a\u0014\nbully who also attended Etowah. The next year, Georgia passed a\u0014\nthree-strikes-and-you're-out policy. After three bullying offenses, \nmiddle and high\u0014\nschool students may be shipped to a school for problem kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat kind of heavy hand has its opponents. William Pollack, a \npsychologist who wrote\u0014\nReal Boys' Voices, an exploration of boyhood, contends that such a \npunitive approach\u0014\ncriminalizes childhood behavior and fails to address the root causes \nof bullying.\u0014\nDorothy Espelage, an assistant professor at the University of \nIllinois at\u0014\nUrbana-Champaign who co-authored a study on bullies, favors a \ncomprehensive\u0014\napproach. \"As soon as you pull a bully out of a school, another will \ntake his place,\"\u0014\nshe says. A deeper shift in school culture is required, she argues, \nbecause ultimately\u0014\npeer groups, not individuals, promote an ethic of aggression. She \nadds, \"We need to\u0014\nchange the climate so that most kids feel it's inappropriate to tease \nand harass.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's what McNair Elementary in Hazelwood, Mo., attempts to do. In \n1992 principal\u0014\nPeggy Dolan instituted a program to unteach kids what many had \nlearned at\u0014\nhome--that they should fight back when bullied. Instead, students are \ninstructed to\u0014\nrespond verbally, first with \"I don't like what you said to me,\" then \n\"I'm going to ask you\u0014\nto stop\" and, if necessary, \"I'm going to get help.\" Victims fill out \na form describing the\u0014\nincident to a teacher or counselor. The issue is taken to peer \nmediation, and the\u0014\noffender is encouraged to sign an agreement not to bully. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the program went into effect, Dolan dealt with 55 fights a \nyear; now she\u0014\naverages six. Also, the school's standardized math and reading scores \nhave risen from\u0014\nthe 40th to the 60th percentile--in part, she thinks, because \nstudents are better able to\u0014\nfocus on their studies. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt Central York Middle School in Pennsylvania, incidents of \nfistfights have also\u0014\ndeclined--to four so far this school year, compared with 17 last \nyear--after students in\u0014\nGrades 6 through 8 signed anti-teasing pledges and were instructed \nhow to manage\u0014\ntheir anger. Bullies were required to offer \"active apologies,\" \ndetailing how they would\u0014\nmodify their behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nTestifying last week before a Colorado legislative committee on \neducation, Sherry\u0014\nWorkman, principal of Laurel Elementary in Fort Collins, noted that \nbehavior infractions\u0014\nfell 66% after she implemented various \"bullyproofing\" initiatives at \nher school. The\u0014\nyounger children, for instance, are coached in how to walk \nconfidently past older kids\u0014\nwho are talking aggressively. Grades 2 through 4 undergo \"Be Cool\" \ntraining, in which\u0014\ncounselors present provocative scenarios and ask students to decide \nbetween a \"hot\u0014\nresponse\" and a \"cool response.\" The latter choice wins praise for \nthe kids.\u0014\n\u0014\nBullying is often performance art. Peter Fonagy, a psychologist who \nhelped develop an\u0014\nantibullying model popular in Topeka, Kans., schools, believes that \nbullies and their\u0014\nvictims usually make up no more than 10% to 20% of any school \npopulation. \"The\u0014\nwhole drama is supported by the bystander,\" says Fonagy. \"The theater \ncan't take\u0014\nplace if there's no audience.\" Seeds University Elementary School in \nLos Angeles\u0014\nuses \"equity guidelines\" to target both bullies and bystanders. \nParents and students\u0014\nsign contracts at the beginning of the year stipulating that no child \nmay be put down\u0014\nfor academic performance, appearance, family composition or gender, \namong other\u0014\nthings. When an incident occurs--for example, some boys tried to pull \ndown another\u0014\nboy's pants--bystanders are also sent to after-school mediation. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Seeds program involves parents, many others don't. \n\"Research shows that\u0014\nthe success of any program is 60% grounded in whether the same kinds \nof\u0014\napproaches are used at home,\" says Pollack. Sometimes parents need to \nbe\u0014\neducated. When Debora Smith discovered that her two boys at Wolfpit \nElementary\u0014\nSchool in Norwalk, Conn., were being bullied, she took action--by \narming them with a\u0014\nhammer and screwdriver. Luckily, the school principal found the \nweapons in the kids'\u0014\nknapsacks before any harm was done.\u0014",

He awoke with the sun on this\u0014\n               Wednesday, yawning and stretching in the cab of the\u0014\n               Ryder truck.

Hed also learned how crucial \nsleep was when\u0014\n                         you were preparing for action.\u0014\n                                 He got out, stretched again, and \nexamined his truck. He\u0014\n                         gave it a thorough walk-around, checking the \ntires, making\u0014\n                         sure that the rear and side doors to the \ncargo box were\u0014\n                         securely locked. He made sure that nothing \nlooked out of the\u0014\n                         ordinary.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                He checked the .45-caliber Glock \nsemiautomatic\u0014\n                         handgun he carried close to his heart, in a \nleather holster\u0014\n                         across his chest. It could fire 16 bullets \nwithout reloading, and\u0014\n                         he was prepared to use it to kill anyone who \ninterfered with his\u0014\n                         task. Then he checked his wristwatch. He \ndidnt want to reach\u0014\n                         the target too early.

Innocent\u0014\n                         people will suffer. But he had decided that \nthere was no other\u0014\n                         way.\u0014\n                                 The truck was in good running order. \nHed checked all\u0014\n                         the fluid levels the night before, when he \nstopped for gas in\u0014\n                         southern Kansas, topping off the tank with \nforty dollars worth\u0014\n                         of unleaded.\u0014\n                                 Timothy J. McVeigh turned the key in \nthe ignition, threw\u0014\n                         the Ryder into gear, and headed for Oklahoma \nCity.\u0014\n                                Four days shy of his 27th birthday, \nMcVeigh detonated a\u0014\n                         truck bomb to destroy an office building \nfilled with people he\u0014\n                         had never meta mission he considered an act \nof war,\u0014\n                         vengeance for the federal governments \nactions at Waco and\u0014\n                         Ruby Ridge. His attack would kill 168 \npeople, 19 of them\u0014\n                         children; it was the worst act of domestic \nterrorism in\u0014\n                         American history, an unthinkable crime.\u0014\n                                 In American Terrorist, we trace \nMcVeighs fateful\u0014\n                         journeyfrom a middle-class upbringing in \nupstate New York\u0014\n                         to the fields of battle in the Persian Gulf \nWar to the grim\u0014\n                         confines of death row. We elicit for the \nfirst time McVeighs\u0014\n                         own defiant confession to one of the worst \ncrimes ever\u0014\n                         perpetrated on American soil. I bombed the \nMurrah Building,\u0014\n                         he stated flatly, adding later: It was my \nchoice, and my\u0014\n                         control, to hit that building when it was \nfull. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                 We interviewed \nMcVeigh for more\u0014\n                                         than 75 hours, chronicling \nwhat\u0014\n                                         McVeighs life has been like \nbehind\u0014\n                                         barshis relationship with \nthree of the\u0014\n                                         worlds most notorious \nterrorists on\u0014\n                                         Bombers Row, in Colorados\u0014\n                                         Supermax prison, and his \ndisturbing\u0014\n                                         musings from death row in \nTerre Haute,\u0014\n                                         Indiana. He is unapologetic \nabout the\u0014\n                                         destruction he caused, \ndismissing the\u0014\n                                         children killed in the blast \nas collateral\u0014\n                                         damage. I understand what \nthey felt in\u0014\n                                         Oklahoma City, he said. I \nhave no\u0014\n                         sympathy for them. He insists that the \nbombing has changed\u0014\n                         the way the government deals with militias, \nand forced the\u0014\n                         Feds to come to terms with its own actions \nat Waco and\u0014\n                         Ruby Ridge. He seeks to absolve his \nco-conspiratorsTerry\u0014\n                         Nichols, who was sentenced to life for his \nrole in planning the\u0014\n                         bombing, and Michael Fortier, who was \nimprisoned after\u0014\n                         admitting he misled authorities about his \nknowledge of the\u0014\n                         plot. McVeigh discusses his troubled mother, \nand reveals his\u0014\n                         flirtation with trying to start a family of \nhis own.\u0014\n                                 If his execution goes as scheduled \nin May, McVeigh will\u0014\n                         be the first American put to death by the \nfederal government\u0014\n                         since 1963. The government is considering a \nclosed-circuit\u0014\n                         broadcast of the execution for survivors of \nthe victims;\u0014\n                         McVeigh himself, defiant to the end, wants \nthe world to watch\u0014\n                         his death on TV. This is the story of the \nterrible crime he\u0014\n                         committed and of the mind and motives of a \ncold-blooded\u0014\n                         killer.\u0014\n                                Nobody in downtown Oklahoma City took \nmuch notice of\u0014\n                         the yellow rental truck as it rumbled up NW \n5th Street a few\u0014\n                         minutes before 9 a.m. Keeping his eyes \npeeled for onlookers,\u0014\n                         McVeigh pulled the truck briefly over to the \nside of the road,\u0014\n                         just long enough to pull out a disposable \nlighter and ignite the\u0014\n                         five-minute fuse to his bomb. The sizzling \nfuse began to fill the\u0014\n                         truck cab with smoke and the acrid smell of \nburning\u0014\n                         gunpowder. As he continued along NW 5th \nStreet, McVeigh\u0014\n                         had to roll down both windows to let some of \nthe smoke out.\u0014\n                                 Just past the Regency Towers \napartment complex, a\u0014\n                         block from the target building, McVeigh had \nto stop for a traffic\u0014\n                         light. Now, he lit the shorter bomb fusethe \none he had\u0014\n                         measured at approximately two minutes.\u0014\n                                 For the longest thirty seconds of \nhis life, McVeigh sat\u0014\n                         watching the red light, with both fuses \nburning. His fingers\u0014\n                         tight on the steering wheel, he glared up at \nthe light, willing it\u0014\n                         to change.\u0014\n                                 The light turned green. McVeigh made \nsure to ease\u0014\n                         away from the intersection. No stomping on \nthe gas pedal. No\u0014\n                         frantic movements.\u0014\n                                 McVeigh spotted the location he had \nchosen for the\u0014\n                         bomba drop-off point, several car lengths \nlong, cut into the\u0014\n                         sidewalk on the north side of the structure.\u0014\n                                As calmly as any delivery-truck \ndriver making a routine\u0014\n                         drop-off, McVeigh parked right below the \ntinted windows of the\u0014\n                         Americas Kids Day Care Center on the second \nfloor. (Had I\u0014\n                         known there was an entire day-care center, \nit might have given\u0014\n                         me pause to switch targets, McVeigh would \nlater say,\u0014\n                         indicating that in his view the childrens \ndeaths distracted\u0014\n                         attention from the signal he was sending the \ngovernment.)\u0014\n                                 McVeigh counted off the seconds to \nhimself as he\u0014\n                         walked north into an alley off NW 6th \nStreet. He was now\u0014\n                         about 150 yards from ground zero, the spot \nwhere he had left\u0014\n                         his truck. McVeigh broke into a jog for the \nfirst time.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 That bomb should have blown by now, \nhe thought. For an\u0014\n                         instant he wondered if something might have \ngone wrong.\u0014\n                                 Oh man, am I going to have to walk \nback there and\u0014\n                         shoot that damn truck?\u0014\n                                 Then he heard the roar.\u0014\n                                 And felt it.\u0014\n                                 The Murrah Buildings explosion \nlifted McVeigh a full inch\u0014\n                         off the ground. Even muffled by earplugs, \nwith the YMCA and\u0014\n                         other buildings forming a buffer, the sound \nwas deafening. It\u0014\n                         was the equivalent of three tons of TNT. \nWhen he looked up,\u0014\n                         McVeigh could see buildings wobbling from \nside to side, plate\u0014\n                         glass showering down into the street around \nhim. He felt the\u0014\n                         concussion buffeting his cheeks. \u0014\n     Refusing to show\u0014\n     any remorse,\u0014\n     McVeigh\u0014\n     confesses: I\u0014\n     bombed the Murrah\u0014\n     Building. It was my\u0014\n     choice, and my\u0014\n     control, to hit that\u0014\n     building when it\u0014\n     was full. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Just like at Waco, McVeigh thought. \nReap what you\u0014\n                         sow.\u0014\n                                 McVeigh refused to look behind him, \nnever stopped to\u0014\n                         gaze at his handiwork. He kept walking, eyes \nstraight ahead,\u0014\n                         toward his beat-up getaway car, still parked \nin a lot several\u0014\n                         blocks from the blast site, its PLEASE DO \nNOT TOW sign\u0014\n                         still in the windshield.\u0014\n                                 When he got behind the wheel, his \neighteen-year-old\u0014\n                         getaway car wouldnt start.\u0014\n                                 He tried several times; the engine \nwouldnt turn over.\u0014\n                         McVeigh smelled gasoline.\u0014\n                                 He stomped the gas pedal to the \nfloor. No luck.\u0014\n                                 He tried again, and again.\u0014\n                                 Finally, the old engine coughed to \nlife. McVeigh put the\u0014\n                         pedal to the floor. His tires squealed as he \nhauled ass out of\u0014\n                         the parking area. I do not want to get \ncaught in Oklahoma\u0014\n                         City, he thought.\u0014\n                                 He was certain that many had died, \nand he had no\u0014\n                         regrets. In fact, he could feel the anxiety \nleaving his body.\u0014\n                                 Its over, he thought.\u0014\n                                 In fact, McVeighs journey was just \nbeginning. He was\u0014\n                         convicted in federal court in 1997, \nsentenced to death and\u0014\n                         whisked off to Colorados Supermax prison. \nFor a man\u0014\n                         awaiting the ultimate punishment, he seemed \nmarkedly,\u0014\n                         almost willfully, unconcerned. Any way the \nwind blows, doesnt\u0014\n                         really matter to me, he thought, recalling \nthe line from Queens\u0014\n                         Bohemian Rhapsody. On a personal level, \nMcVeigh would\u0014\n                         welcome death; it would be his crowning \nachievement. The\u0014\n                         government, he reflected, would be doing him \na favor, ending a\u0014\n                         long march that had turned hollow in the \nfinal years. His\u0014\n                         execution would be a relief.\u0014\n                                 He sometimes found himself wishing \nthe final moment\u0014\n                         would come sooner, rather than later. Ill \nbe glad to leave this\u0014\n                         fup world, he said. Truth is, I \ndetermined mostly through\u0014\n                         my travels that this world just doesnt hold \nanything for me. In\u0014\n                         McVeighs opinion, his sentence is nothing \nmore than state-\u0014\n                         assisted suicide. I knew I wanted this \nbefore it happened. I\u0014\n                         knew my objective was a state-assisted \nsuicide and when it\u0014\n                         happens, its in your face, motherfs. You \njust did something\u0014\n                         youre trying to say should be illegal for \nmedical personnel. \u0014\n\u0014\n     McVeigh says he\u0014\n     welcomes death; It\u0014\n     would be his\u0014\n     crowning\u0014\n     achievement. The\u0014\n     government would\u0014\n     be doing him a\u0014\n     favor, he reflected.\u0014\n     His execution\u0014\n     would be a relief. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 In prison, McVeigh found himself \nreminded of his old\u0014\n                         dream of becoming a survivalist. Looking at \nthe concrete and\u0014\n                         steel-reinforced walls of the ultramodern \nSupermax, McVeigh\u0014\n                         thought, Ive always wanted to live in a \nbunker, and now here I\u0014\n                         am.\u0014\n                                 He shared the disciplinary unit with \nextraordinary\u0014\n                         company. The three other cells were occupied \nby Theodore\u0014\n                         Kaczynski, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, and Luis \nFelipe.\u0014\n                                 Kaczynski, better known as the \nUnabomber, had been\u0014\n                         the last of the four to arrive at the \nColorado prison. He was\u0014\n                         serving four consecutive life sentences in \nconnection with\u0014\n                         sixteen mail bombings and attempted bombings \nhe had\u0014\n                         perpetrated in seven states between 1978 and \n1995. Ramzi\u0014\n                         Yousef was serving a 240-year sentence for \nhis conviction as\u0014\n                         the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade \nCenter bombing. In\u0014\n                         addition to the bombing, which killed six \npeople, injured a\u0014\n                         thousand, and caused hundreds of millions of \ndollars in\u0014\n                         damage, Yousef was also convicted of \nplotting to bomb eleven\u0014\n                         airliners as they crossed the Pacific Ocean \nwith American\u0014\n                         passengers.\u0014\n                                 Luis Felipe, a native of Cuba who \nhad been in and out of\u0014\n                         prison since age nine, was the founder of \nthe New York City\u0014\n                         chapter of the ultraviolent Latin Kings \nstreet gang. Known by\u0014\n                         the nickname King Blood, Felipe from his \nprison cell had\u0014\n                         ordered the beatings and murders of several \npeople on the\u0014\n                         outsideincluding one beheading.\u0014\n                                 With McVeigh added to the mix, the \nfour constituted one\u0014\n                         of the most fearsome groups of prisoners \never housed in one\u0014\n                         facility at one time, let alone one \ndisciplinary wing. One day\u0014\n                         McVeigh received a newspaper clipping in the \nmail that\u0014\n                         featured color photographs of him, \nKaczynski, Yousef, and\u0014\n                         Felipe. The letter writer asked McVeigh to \nautograph the\u0014\n                         article. In a chilling move, McVeigh happily \nobliged, signing it\u0014\n                         The A-Team! T.J.M.\u0014\n                                 Some at the prison called the \ndisciplinary wing Celebrity\u0014\n                         Row; to others it was Bomber Row. When \nthe four were first\u0014\n                         assembled at the Supermax, they were \ncompletely isolated\u0014\n                         from the rest of the prison populationand \nfrom each other.\u0014\n                         When prison officials eased some of the \nrestrictions on the\u0014\n                         four men some months later, they were \nallowed to take their\u0014\n                         outdoor exercise at the same time. And, \nthrough the walls of\u0014\n                         cages placed about ten feet apart, the four \nterrorists would\u0014\n                         exchange conversation.\u0014\n                                 With Felipe, McVeigh found he shared \nan appetite for\u0014\n                         women, and the two began trading \npornographysmut\u0014\n                         books, as they called them. With Yousef, \nMcVeigh found\u0014\n                         himself involved in deep political \ndiscussions; Yousef even\u0014\n                         made frequent, unsuccessful attempts to \nconvert him to the\u0014\n                         Muslim faith. With Kaczynski, McVeigh shared \nhis fondness\u0014\n                         for the outdoors and wilderness.\u0014\n                                 Of all the inmates McVeigh came to \nknow at the\u0014\n                         Supermax, he found he had the most in common \nwith the\u0014\n                         fifty-seven-year-old Kaczynski. Initially, \nKaczynski had refused\u0014\n                         to speak with McVeigh. In truth, Kaczynski \nhad some\u0014\n                         misgivings about the way McVeigh had \nexecuted the\u0014\n                         Oklahoma City bombing. In time, though, \nKaczynski came to\u0014\n                         believe that his fellow bomber had, like \nhim, been demonized\u0014\n                         by false media reports. There was more than \njust a mutual\u0014\n                         appreciation for the outdoors between them; \ntheir political\u0014\n                         views often coincided. \u0014\n\u0014\n     You were in the\u0014\n     Persian Gulf War?\u0014\n     Kaczynski asked\u0014\n     one day. Yes, sir,\u0014\n     McVeigh\u0014\n     answered. Ironic,\u0014\n     isnt it? In Desert\u0014\n     Storm I got medals\u0014\n     for killing people. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                 McVeigh once gave Kaczynski a copy \nof Tainting\u0014\n                         Evidence: Inside the Scandals at the FBI \nCrime Lab, by John\u0014\n                         F. Kelly and Phillip K. Wearne, a book about \nthe alleged\u0014\n                         manufacture of evidence by federal agents. \nThe book struck a\u0014\n                         nerve in Kaczynski, who genuinely came to \nlike McVeigh.\u0014\n                                 You were in the Persian Gulf War? \nKaczynski asked\u0014\n                         one day.\u0014\n                                 Yes, sir, McVeigh answered. \nIronic, isnt it? In Desert\u0014\n                         Storm I got medals for killing people.\u0014\n                                 Kaczynski laid out his feelings \nabout McVeigh and the\u0014\n                         bombing at Oklahoma City in an eleven-page \nletter to the\u0014\n                         authors of this book. On a personal level I \nlike McVeigh and I\u0014\n                         imagine that most people would like him, \nKaczynski wrote,\u0014\n                         improbably enough.\u0014\n                                 He was easily the most outgoing of \nall the inmates in\u0014\n                         our range of cells and had excellent social \nskills. He was\u0014\n                         considerate of others and knew how to deal \nwith people\u0014\n                         effectively. He communicated somehow even \nwith the inmates\u0014\n                         on the range of cells above ours, and, \nbecause he talked with\u0014\n                         more people, he always knew more about what \nwas going on\u0014\n                         than anyone else on our range.\u0014\n                                 Kaczynski said he never asked \nMcVeigh if he was guilty\u0014\n                         of the bombing in Oklahoma City, and McVeigh \nnever told him.\u0014\n                         But Kaczynskis critique of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing\u0014\n                         offered a surprisingly humanistic \nperspective, though one that\u0014\n                         still accepted the notion of strategic \ndomestic terrorism:\u0014\n                         [A]ssuming that the Oklahoma City bombing \nwas intended as\u0014\n                         a protest against the U.S. government in \ngeneral and against\u0014\n                         the governments actions at Waco in \nparticular, I will say that I\u0014\n                         think the bombing was a bad action because \nit was\u0014\n                         unnecessarily inhumane.\u0014\n                                 Soon after Kaczynskis arrival, he, \nMcVeigh, Yousef, and\u0014\n                         Felipe were moved to an eight-cell range, \nwhere greater\u0014\n                         freedom and more communication were \npermitted. Also on the\u0014\n                         range was his old friend and accomplice, \nTerry Nichols, who\u0014\n                         joined McVeigh at the Supermax in 1998 \nfollowing his federal\u0014\n                         court conviction and life sentence. McVeigh \nhad little trouble\u0014\n                         establishing friendships with those around \nhim. But Nichols\u0014\n                         refused to acknowledge McVeighs existence.\u0014\n                                 On December 23, 1997, a Denver jury \nconvicted Nichols\u0014\n                         of one count of conspiracy in the bombing \nand eight counts of\u0014\n                         involuntary manslaughter. He was acquitted \nof first-degree\u0014\n                         murder charges, and of using a weapon of \nmass destruction.\u0014\n                         The message from jurors: they believed \nNichols played a part\u0014\n                         in the bombing, but were not convinced that \nhe intentionally\u0014\n                         took part in the killings and injuries at \nthe Murrah Building. He\u0014\n                         would later be sentenced to life in prison.\u0014\n                                 Now, at the Supermax, McVeigh tried \nhard to draw\u0014\n                         Nichols out. He attempted to get a reaction \nfrom his former\u0014\n                         partner by joking about the conspiracy \ntheory Stephen Jones\u0014\n                         had put forth in his book about the case. \nJones contended that\u0014\n                         Nichols had gone by the code name The \nFarmer during his\u0014\n                         trips to the Philippines; now, every once in \na while, McVeigh\u0014\n                         would break the silence and yell Hey \nFarmer! down toward\u0014\n                         Nicholss cell. He never got a response. \nNichols might be\u0014\n                         pissed at me, McVeigh concluded.\u0014\n                                 One day, looking through the narrow \nwindow at the back\u0014\n                         of his cell, McVeigh noticed another \naccomplice, Mike Fortier,\u0014\n                         standing in an open portion of the \nrecreation yard. Fortier, who\u0014\n                         helped stow McVeighs bombmaking materials \nand falsely told\u0014\n                         investigators he knew nothing of the \nOklahoma City plans, had\u0014\n                         been sentenced to twelve years in 1998, and \nhad also recently\u0014\n                         been transferred to the facility.\u0014\n                                 McVeigh wanted to find a way to tell \nFortier that he\u0014\n                         wasnt upset at him for testifying. He \nfigured that Fortier might\u0014\n                         be blaming himself for McVeighs receiving \nthe death penalty,\u0014\n                         and he wanted to tell him that it was his \nown doing. But in the\u0014\n                         end McVeigh couldnt bring himself to speak \nso openly about\u0014\n                         his carefully calculated plan to have the \ngovernment execute\u0014\n                         him. He feared that by making it known he \nhad sought a\u0014\n                         deluxe suicide-by-cop package (when a \ndistraught person\u0014\n                         induces law enforcement to kill them) it \nmight somehow hurt\u0014\n                         his chances of realizing it. McVeigh could \nonly hope that his\u0014\n                         easygoing manner would let Fortier know he \ndid not hate him.\u0014\n                                 But McVeigh says there was one final \nitem he did\u0014\n                         manage to raise with Fortier.\u0014\n                                 Mike, McVeigh said. You were in \nfront of the Murrah\u0014\n                         Building, right?\u0014\n                                 Fortier looked around. Yeah.\u0014\n                                 Well, did you see a day-care \ncenter?\u0014\n                                 No.\u0014\n                                 Well, I didnt, either.\u0014\n                                 Though he maintains his position \nthat he has no real\u0014\n                         regrets over his actions, McVeigh has \nconfessed that he feels\u0014\n                         sorry for what happened to Nichols and \nFortier.\u0014\n                                 I did not calculate or know enough \nabout conspiracy law\u0014\n                         to know that my actions could be held \nagainst them, he says\u0014\n                         now. Because, in a conspiracy, youre all \nin it as one. Other\u0014\n                         peoples crimes can be held against you. He \nremains\u0014\n                         outraged that Fortier and Nichols could face \nsuch serious\u0014\n                         punishment when they had no idea when the \nbombing was to\u0014\n                         occur. Appropriating Jack Nicholsons line \nfrom A Few Good\u0014\n                         Mena film he saw on cable while in \nprisonMcVeigh fired\u0014\n                         back at those who refused to believe that he \nalone could have\u0014\n                         been responsible for the bombing: You cant \nhandle the\u0014\n                         truthbecause the truth is, it was just me.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  McVeigh father wont watch son die\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 As McVeigh thought more seriously \nabout death, the\u0014\n                         realization that he would be leaving this \nworld without having\u0014\n                         brought children into it became a \npreoccupation. It was one of\u0014\n                         the few things he had failed to fully \nanticipate when deciding to\u0014\n                         end his life. Ever since his arrest, McVeigh \nhad received a\u0014\n                         steady stream of letters from women who \nexpressed romantic\u0014\n                         interest in him. From time to time he \nrevisited the idea he had\u0014\n                         mentioned to the defense-team \npsychiatristthe notion of\u0014\n                         smuggling his sperm out of prison for an \nartificial insemination.\u0014\n                                 But McVeigh tried to rein in his \nbiological urge to father a\u0014\n                         son or daughter. If he ever managed to do \nso, he decided, he\u0014\n                         would have to do so anonymously. The life \nthat any child of\u0014\n                         Timothy McVeighs would have in American \nsociety, he was\u0014\n                         certain, would be hell.\u0014\n                                 By the summer of 1999, mcveigh was \nmoved to the\u0014\n                         nations only federal death-row facility, in \nTerre Haute, Indiana.\u0014\n                         McVeigh was offered an opportunity to take \npart in a painting\u0014\n                         class a few times each week, but again, he \nrefused. I cant\u0014\n                         paint worth a damn, he says. Instead he \nsleeps as long as he\u0014\n                         can, putting off the start of each day for \nas long as possible\u0014\n                         before rising at nine or so. He turns on \nCNN Headline News,\u0014\n                         one of the few things he still enjoys in \nprison. Lunch arrives at\u0014\n                         10:30. After an afternoon nap comes dinner, \noften as early as\u0014\n                         3 or 4 p.m., followed by a stand-up count of \nall inmates. In\u0014\n                         between, McVeigh reads and writes letters or \nwatches\u0014\n                         programs on his TV, a thirteen-inch \nblack-and-white set with\u0014\n                         cable to which he has twenty-four-hour \naccess.\u0014\n                                 The subject of his death is on his \nmind. He doesnt\u0014\n                         believe in autopsies for prisoners after \nexecution. He doesnt\u0014\n                         want scientists or criminologists dissecting \nhis brain, looking\u0014\n                         for clues about what made him tick. He \nintends to demand\u0014\n                         that his body be cremated immediately after \nthe execution. He\u0014\n                         is angry that Congress, after his \nconviction, revoked his\u0014\n                         privilege to be buried in a military \ncemetery.\u0014\n                                 Many Americans, McVeigh believes, \nwill want to see him\u0014\n                         executed with their own eyes. And he may \naccommodate their\u0014\n                         wishes. Some of the families of Oklahoma \nCity bombing\u0014\n                         victims have pushed for closed-circuit \ntelevision of his\u0014\n                         execution, just as they did for the trial. \nShould they succeed,\u0014\n                         McVeigh plans to go one step further.\u0014\n                                 If they do that, Im going to throw \nit back in their face.\u0014\n                         Im going to demand they televise it \nnationally, he says. Im\u0014\n                         going to say, If you want to make a \nspectacle of it, Im going\u0014\n                         to point out exactly what you are doing. \nWhat Im going to do\u0014\n                         is contact a media outlet that has heavy \nmoney for lawyers,\u0014\n                         like a CBS 60 Minutes or a CNN, [and tell \nthem] You guys\u0014\n                         fight the battle for me.

    "title": "LET'S CLEAN HOUSE - A VIEW OF DEMONS",
    "words": "Let's Clean House               Doris Wagner    \u0014\n\u0014\n A fundamentalist view of demons and demonology\u0014\n\u0014\nHow well I remember spring housecleaning! I was born in the same \nhouse in the early '30s that I left the day I was married. The \nsetting was a dairy farm in upstate New York and my dad and mom, two \nbrothers, one sister an myself enjoyed living there in the beautiful \nMohawk Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut every spring, without fail, we all pitched in and cleaned. The \nguys took off  the storm windows and stored them carefully to rest \nuntil late October. We dusted and washed the window sills carrying \naway dustpans, full of dead flies that somehow got between the \nwindows and storm windows. We washed the windows, inside and out, \nwashed every curtain in the house, stretched them on wooden frames \nwith nails that caused them to dry without ironing, and hung them \nback up only after every square inch of the house had been mopped,\u0014\nscrubbed, and polished. The house was aired out.\u0014\n\u0014\nI remember we even cleaned the garage, the chicken coop, the pig pen \nand the wagon sheds. Mom hung curtains in the garage windows and we \nplanted       flowers all around the buildings after we had raked all \nof the winter leaves, sticks and sundry debris that the wind had \ndeposited. We then were able to enjoy clean and fresh surroundings \nwith a myriad of flowers all summer long.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpiritual Housecleaning\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I work with deliverance, of necessity, I need to understand the \ndevil, evil and the demonic. I am now convinced that Christian \nfamilies need to spiritually houseclean at least once a year. If you \nare doing spiritual house cleaning for the first time, you will need \nto tackle it with a vengeance. You will need to inspect every room, \nincluding basement and attic as I well as the outdoor surrounding \narea. Here are some suggestions.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we spring houseclean, we go for the dirt, dust, grime, and filth \nlike dead flies and mouse nests. When we spiritually houseclean, we \nlook for things that might defile our house or provide an opening for \ndemonic activity. For example, has any family member brought home \nsome item that might have a \"hitchhiker\" attached? Often it wasn't \ndone on purpose, but it still should be cleaned out of the house. The \nquestion to ask as you deliberate, is, \"Does this glorify God?\" If in \ndoubt, dump it!\u0014\n\u0014\nTake a Spiritual Inventory of What is in Your Home\u0014\n\u0014\nI have lived overseas for much of my adult life. When we returned \nfrom Bolivia, I was amazed at the stuff we naively brought home as \n\"native art\" and put up on our walls. When I learned about not \nglorifying idols, we did major redecoration quickly! We had brought \nhome many idols of the Sun God in the form of lamps, jewelry, and \nleather work. We had items, such as masks and other trinkets that \nwere used in pagan religious ceremonies. We did, in fact, have a good \nbit of negative spiritual activity going on in our house, but once we \ndestroyed these items, we were much better off and slept a whole lot \nbetter.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor starters, any item that has been used in any religious ceremony \nneeds to go, no matter how lovely, expensive or how much it means to \nyou. Idolatry and the worship of other gods, is definitely out-- \ncheck out commandments #1 and #2. If you have items of superstition \neven if handed down from previous generations, they can give place to \nthe demonic and they need to go. Anything obviously demonic such as \nposters, tee Shirts', incense, music and videos should go. Any items \nfrom the occult must go. Ouija boards, spirit games, Dungeons \nand      Dragons, and items of astrology, tarot cards, horoscope, \ncharms, amulets, fetishes, or any other thing having to do with \nwitchcraft need to go. Witchcraft is on the rise. Check out the prime \ntime network shows that try to deal with the subject in a cute \nmanner, blowing off its significance. Shun Harry Potter calendars, \nbooks, mugs and the like. If they are in the house, burn or break \nthem. Don't give away any of these items. They need to be destroyed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny items that represent any other religion, such as Buddhism, \nHinduism, ancient Egyptian gods (Isis, Osiris, etc.), Freemasonry, \nand symbols of fertility such as obelisks, and cute fertility god \nfigurines from various religions, should go. Be on the lookout for \nanything that represents death, such as drawings of skulls, mummies, \nand bloody or gory posters. You are better off without them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs there anything in your house that you are keeping that you know \nyou should not have -- photos of old girlfriends or boyfriends that \nyou have hidden, for example? Remove any item that represents a tie \nto anger, bitterness, hatred or resentment. Pornographic material has \nno place in a Christian home, nor do channels that bring filth into a \nT. V., or Internet availability to porn, especially where there are \nchildren or teens. To think that they will not \"take a peek\" is far \ntoo risky, because there are few things more addictive than porn and \nit can ruin one's spiritual life and usefulness for the Lord. Do not \nbe guilty of bringing such things into your home. Steps must be taken \nto clean it out. Get the Internet screened, and cancel subscriptions \nto channels you should not have. Burn every piece of porn and object \nyou know that you should not have.\u0014\n\u0014\nCheck out the kids' toy box and your own jewelry box. Something may \nhave crept in that you should not own. Although expensive, gold items \ncan be melted down and once symbolism is destroyed, it can be \nfashioned into something nice. God created gold and it was \"passed \nthrough the fire\" and purified.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou will have noticed by now that I have said over and over again, \nthese items need to go.  Don't give them away.  Take stand and \ndeliberately do what needs to be done, but if items are burnable, \nburn them. You may want to smash some first, if they are made of \ncombustible material. Ceramic, glass and porcelain items should be \nsmashed. Wrapping them in rags before smashing can help keep the job \nsafer. Burn what can be burned, smash video tapes and CDs. Deal a \nblow to the devil!\u0014\n\u0014\nJosiah Declaration Sunday\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is what the Josiah Declaration Sunday is all about. II Kings \n23:24 specifically tells about eliminating household gods and idols. \nIt is \"spring housecleaning\" in a spiritual sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday, September 9 is the designated day and all cleaning should be \ndone by then. Some churches are asking people to bring items that \nthey are destroying to church to be smashed or burned. Some want to \nkeep them wrapped up for privacy's sake. It may not be possible to \nburn publicly at the church, and fires may need to be moved where \npermitted by the authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter reading this, you may want to get going long before September \nto rid your home of spiritual darkness. If you have not yet read \nChuck Pierce and Rebecca Sytsema's little -book Ridding Your Home of \nSpiritual Darkness, you will want to do that soon.  It is available \nfrom our Arsenal bookstore.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is spring. It's housecleaning time. And don't forget to look \nover the basement, attic, garage, and other buildings. You'll be glad \nyou did, and God will have more room to be glorified in your home!\u0014",

    "words": "Little-known or remarkable facts about David Livingstone: missionary \nexplorer \u0014\n\u0014\n                      by Ruth A. Tucker \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though Livingstone is remembered as a \nmissionary, only one-third of his 30 years in Africa were spent in \nthe service of a mission board. Even during that time, he went his \nown way, often ignoring the advice and directives of colleagues and \nsuperiors. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone started life as did millions of \nother children in the industrial revolution: exploited by a society \nbereft of child labor laws. At age 10, he worked 14-hour days in a \ncotton factory, followed by two hours of night school. He grew up in \na one-room tenement that overlooked the cotton mill where he worked. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With his first week's wages, Livingstone \npurchased a copy of Ruddiman's Rudiments of Latin. To break the \ntedium in the factory, he propped the book on the frame of his \nmachine and studied while he worked. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone was determined to become a \nmissionary to China but was prevented from doing so by the outbreak \nof the Opium War. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone closely connected mission work with \nsocial and economic progress. The only way to fight the slave trade \nin Africa, he said, was through \"Christianity, Commerce, and \nCivilization.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      From his earliest years in Africa, Livingstone \nwas often critical of fellow missionaries. Soon after he arrived in \nthe Cape Colony, he wrote, \"The missionaries in the interior are, I \nam grieved to say, a sorry set. I shall be glad when I get away into \nthe region beyondaway from their envy and backbiting.\" He added that \nthere was no more affection between them and himself than there was \nbetween his \"riding ox and his grandmother.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone's penchant for exploring could not \nhelp but affect his family life. He and his wife, Mary, lived in the \nsame house together only four of the seventeen years of their \nmarriage. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Mary Moffat, Livingstone's mother-in-law, \nheard that he had taken her daughter and grandchildren on another \ndangerous exploring expedition, she wrote him a stinging letter, \nsigned, \"I remain yours in great perturbation.\u0014\n                      M. Moffat.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Unlike his fellow explorers and traveling \ncompanions, Livingstone enjoyed relatively good health during his \nfirst years in Africa. He traversed the continent for a dozen years \nbefore he fell ill with \"African fever.\" At that time, he \nexperimented with the local witch doctors to test their healing \npowers but concluded, after being \"smoked like a red-herring over \ngreen twigs\" and put under their charms, that European medical \npractices were superior. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone was the first European to feast his \neyes on the great Victoria Falls: \"Five columns of smoke [i.e., mist] \narose. The whole scene was extremely beautiful; the banks and \nislands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan vegetation of \ngreat variety and form . .. scenes so lovely must have been gazed \nupon by angels in their flight.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During his first visit back to the British \nIsles (1856-1858), Livingstone became a national hero. He was awarded \na gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society, an honorary \ndoctorate from Oxford University, and a private audience with Queen \nVictoria. He was mobbed in the streets; when he attended church, \nchaos ensued as people climbed over pews to shake his hand. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Livingstone is considered one of history's \ngreatest explorers, but his last two expeditions failed in their \nchief aims:\u0014\n                      The Zambezi Expedition sought to discover a \nnavigable river that cut across southern Africa, and in his final \nadventure, Livingstone sought to find the source of the Nile. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though Livingstone did little traditional \nmissionary work while he was alive, after his death, he inspired \nhundreds of men and women to give their lives for African missions. \nMary Slessor, for example, decided to follow in the footsteps of her \nhero and, in 1875, arrived in Calabar (in present-day Nigeria). She \nquickly became a living legend as an explorer and evangelistand vice \ncounsel for the British Empire. Peter Cameron Scott, founder of the \nAfrica Inland Mission, was inspired to return to Africa after his \nfirst mission failed when he read the inscription on\u0014\nLivingstone's tomb in Westminster Abbey: \"Other sheep I have which \nare not of this fold; them also I must bring.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During his years as a missionary, he reached \nonly one indentifiable convert, who later backslid and rejected the \nfaith.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ruth Tucker is a member of the Christian \nHistory advisory board and the author of From Jerusalem to Irian \nJaya: A\u0014\n                      Biographical History of Christian Missions \n(Zondervan, 1983) and Seasons of Motherhood (Victor, 1996). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1997 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/Christian History Magazine.

Historically accurate but liberal in its \napplication \u0014\n\u0014\n                       As we eat our Thanksgiving meals, let's be \ntruly thankful for ...\u0014\n                       Independence Day \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Dateline: 11/24/97 \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Thanksgiving is the American holiday in a way\u0014\n                       that not even the Fourth of July can beat. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Oh sure, the Fourth of July is supposed to be\u0014\n                       the national holiday. It commemorates the day\u0014\n                       on which prominent businessmen, politicians,\u0014\n                       clergymen and others very publicly linked their\u0014\n                       personal fates and that of the 13 American\u0014\n                       colonies to the fight for freedom. The founders\u0014\n                       risked death to stop the pesky Brits from \ntelling\u0014\n                       them what to do. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       But Thanksgiving remembers the Puritans.\u0014\n                       They were a small religious minority who\u0014\n                       suffered terribly from persecution in England \n they were fined, jailed and\u0014\n                       treated as second-class citizens. They sailed \noff in search of a new home\u0014\n                       where they could worship as they chose, and \nfinally found it in a wilderness\u0014\n                       where they carved out a refuge while battling \nstarvation and disease. And\u0014\n                       they did it all so they could give Indians and \nheretics the persecution\u0014\n                       treatment on this side of the Atlantic. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Now thats America! Algonquins and Quakers \nroasting over an open fire. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The Puritan ethic lives on in American \nculture. Its not a pure strain, of course,\u0014\n                       or else yours truly would spend an inordinate \namount of time being pressed\u0014\n                       between rocks or having red-hot pokers shov \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Never mind. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       But the Fourth-of-July ethic, the ideal of \npersonal liberty, is a\u0014\n                       Johnny-come-lately to these shores. It has \nalways battled against a legacy of\u0014\n                       ferocious, cold-water ascetics with a burning \ndesire to work for the greater\u0014\n                       glory of God and an unyielding willingness to \nhelp their dissenting neighbors\u0014\n                       reach heaven just a bit sooner than expected. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                      That Puritan \nethic has been\u0014\n                                                      tempered by the \ncontributions\u0014\n                                                      of more \neasygoing colonists,\u0014\n                                                      an \nEnlightenment-fueled love\u0014\n                                                      of liberty and \nwaves of\u0014\n                                                      \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nwith no connection\u0014\n                                                      to Cromwells \nbrethren in\u0014\n                                                      America. But \nwhenever you\u0014\n                                                      think the \nstrain in getting weak,\u0014\n                                                      it erupts once \nagain. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                      The United \nStates has been\u0014\n                                                      wracked by wave \nafter wave of\u0014\n                       puritanical religious revivalism since its \nfounding. (And before I hear from all\u0014\n                       of the church-goers, Ill say that Im talking \nabout the tight-corset and\u0014\n                       high-neckline brand of religion.) During an \nearly-19th century outbreak of\u0014\n                       preachers and prayers, Thomas Jefferson \ndespaired that reason was being\u0014\n                       eroded as a value by a narrow Christian \nfervor. He feared that the hard-won\u0014\n                       prizes of the revolution would be washed away. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       In retrospect  several revivals and a couple \nof snake-handlings later \u0014\n                       Jefferson (and the country) was lucky that the \nrevolution occured while\u0014\n                       Puritanism was in remission. Had the timing \nbeen different ... Oooh, there go\u0014\n                       those red-hot pokers, again. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       One of my favorite examples of resurgent \nPuritanism is represented by the\u0014\n                       peculiar history of Mormonism, the birth of \nwhich occupies a rough half-way\u0014\n                       mark between Plymouth Rock and the modern day. \nHere you have an\u0014\n                       American-born religion with a peculiarly \ncommunitarian and ascetic theology\u0014\n                       that recalls the buckle and blunderbuss boys  \nand their relations with other\u0014\n                       faiths. To be precise, as soon as Mormon \nprophet Joseph Smith started\u0014\n                       preaching, Congregationalists, Catholics and \nPresbyterians started beating\u0014\n                       up on the new-found flock. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The ensuing events sound awfully familiar. \nMormons fled, got trounced, fled\u0014\n                       again, and found a refuge in the wilderness at \nthe ass-end of nowhere,\u0014\n                       where they suffered terrible privations in \norder to build themselves a new\u0014\n                       home. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Then they got about the serious business of \ntrouncing their own\u0014\n                       nonbelievers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Cotton Mather would have understood. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       More recently, the Puritan legacy of\u0014\n                       self-denial has found its outlet in\u0014\n                       bizarre quasi-secular crusades.\u0014\n                       Prohibition, of course. And what\u0014\n                       else, after all, is the dementia that\u0014\n                       leads anti-tobacco zealots to pass\u0014\n                       laws barring smoking from\u0014\n                       privately owned bars, open streets\u0014\n                       and even (in extreme cases) front\u0014\n                       porches and lawns? To turn anybody with a pack \nof Luckies into a pariah?\u0014\n                       The constipated ghosts of the Mayflower \npassengers hover over the whole\u0014\n                       matter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       And what of the fanatics who seize copies of \nThe Tin Drum and craft\u0014\n                       ever-more convoluted decency measures for \nthe Internet to protect the\u0014\n                       children from the always present dangers of \neven simulated carnal contact?\u0014\n                       If the abstinent soul of the Puritans doesnt \nlive on in the CDA, it lives\u0014\n                       nowhere. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Oh, yes. The Puritans waded ashore a very long \ntime ago, but their\u0014\n                       tight-sphinctered legacy lives with us at \nleast as strongly as does that of the\u0014\n                       founders, whose memory is aptly celebrated in \nthe warm and sunny month of\u0014\n                       July. Benjamin Franklin had his women and \nThomas Jefferson had his wine,\u0014\n                       but the Puritans have cold showers for us all. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       So as we eat our Thanksgiving meals and crack \nopen a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein in \nfront of the\u0014\n                       tube, let us remember what we have to be truly \nthankful for. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       Independence Day.\u0014",

    "title": "LETTER TO THE PRINCIPAL",
    "words": "Letter to the Principal \u0014\n \u0014\nOffice of the Principal \u0014\nShawnee Mission East High School \u0014\nShawnee Mission, Kansas. \u0014\n \u0014\n(Mr. Cameron:  As a courtesy -- you are, after all, an alumnus of \u0014\nthis school -- we are sending you a copy of this letter we recently \u0014\nwrote your 17-year-old daughter in response to a query we received \u0014\nfrom her.) \u0014\n \u0014\nDear Ms. Cameron: \u0014\n \u0014\nThank you for your letter.  Yes, we are pleased to report, your \u0014\nfather's old high school is still standing and our library was able \u0014\nto locate yearbooks dating \"all the way back\" to his graduation.  In \u0014\nfact, a few teachers even remember your father, which I will get to \u0014\nin a moment. \u0014\n \u0014\nIn answer to your first question:  In every picture extant of your \u0014\nfather he is well shod, wearing what I believe were called \"earth \u0014\nshoes\" back then.  Also, the weather here is moderate, with snow \u0014\ngenerally lasting from December until March -- hardly the entire \u0014\nschool year.  Thus his descriptions of the conditions under which he \u0014\n\"struggled\" to school in the morning do, as you suggest, seem a bit \u0014\nexaggerated.  In fact, our bus logs are (remarkably) still intact, \u0014\nrevealing not only that your father was a registered passenger, but \u0014\nalso that his parents paid the extra ten dollars a month for \u0014\ndoor-to-door delivery. \u0014\n \u0014\nI am sure there were days when your father was very \"sharply \u0014\ndressed,\" as you state he puts it, but in every single photograph I \u0014\nwas able to uncover he is wearing exactly the same thing: bell-bottom \u0014\nblue jeans with white strings trailing from the edges onto the floor, \u0014\nhorizontal rents in the knees, and no belt buckle.  His T-shirt \u0014\ndisplays a message easily communicated with hand gestures.  His hair \u0014\nhangs past his shoulders and looks as if it was exposed to a lot of \u0014\nwind -- perhaps he rode the school bus with the window open.  \u0014\nCertainly a comb or brush would have difficulty navigating the \u0014\ntangle. \u0014\n \u0014\nAs to academics and \"concentrating on the basics,\" one must remember \u0014\nthe times:  The \"basics\" back then may very well have embraced some \u0014\nof your father's elective subjects, which included  \"Personal \u0014\nCitizenship,\" \"Ecology,\" and one which apparently was called \u0014\n\"Relevance.\"  We have no record of what, if anything, was taught in \u0014\nthese classes.  What records we do have show that your father did \u0014\nindeed take Geometry, just as he claims.  In fact, he took it his \u0014\nsophomore year, repeated it his junior year, and repeated the course \u0014\nagain his senior year -- Geometry was required for graduation. \u0014\n \u0014\nNow as to Mr. Muggins, who had your father in a class called \u0014\n\"Problems of Modern Relationships.\"  Mr. Muggins does not wish to \u0014\ndispute the claim that your father always had his homework done \u0014\nearly, he merely wants to point out that no matter when it was done, \u0014\nit was always handed in late.  In fact, your father sticks out in Mr. \u0014\nMuggins's mind as having the most outrageous excuses for being \u0014\nunprepared, including having to evacuate his home because it was \u0014\ninfected with the China Syndrome. \u0014\n \u0014\nYour father was not, sad to say, President of the Student Council.  \u0014\nPerhaps he is confusing student government with a social group called \u0014\n\"The Slackers,\" which Mr. Muggins recalls was a group of boys who sat \u0014\nin the hallway and made loud groaning noises whenever an attractive \u0014\ngirl strode past.  Your father was assistant vice president of the \u0014\nclub, and, to our knowledge, is the only past member not currently \u0014\nserving time in a federal penitentiary. \u0014\n \u0014\nOne thing IS completely verifiable:  Your father's name is, indeed, \u0014\ncarved above the door to the school.  Please be advised that, now \u0014\nthat we have noticed it, we will need to have it sanded out and \u0014\nrefinished, at a cost of approximately three hundred dollars.

    "words": "LOST & FOUND: MY SOUL\u0014\nI thought my soul was fine, but it wasn't\u0014\n\u0014\nBy guest columnist Mike Yaconelli\u0014\n\u0014\nI lost my soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nI mean, I didn't know I had one.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I really mean is, I knew I had one, but I'd never come in\u0014\ncontact with it.\u0014\n\u0014\nI came from a tradition where souls were a theological reality,\u0014\nnot a faith reality. Souls were for saving, not for communing.\u0014\nSouls were for converting and, once they were converted, they\u0014\nwere to be left alone. Souls were too mystical, too subjective,\u0014\ntoo ambiguous, too risky, too ... well, you know -- New Age-ish.\u0014\n\u0014\nI came from a wonderful evangelical tradition that has always\u0014\nlifted up the integrity of the Word of God, the significance of\u0014\nthe church, the centrality of salvation. But that same tradition,\u0014\nin the past few years, has seen an epidemic of moral failure.\u0014\nThere seems to be an ever-increasing amount of defections from\u0014\nthe faith. More and more of my friends are dropping out, giving\u0014\nup, or just placing their faith on the shelf for a while.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe've lost touch with our souls. We've been nourishing our minds,\u0014\nour relational skills, our theological knowledge, our\u0014\npsychological well-being, our physiological health ... but we've\u0014\nabandoned our souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur souls have been lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil a few months ago, I had no idea I'd lost my soul somewhere.\u0014\nIn the busyness and clutter of my life, as I traveled all over\u0014\nthe world serving God, I thought my soul was just fine, thank\u0014\nyou. But my soul wasn't fine. I spent hours every day doing God's\u0014\nwork, but not one second doing soul work. I was consumed by the\u0014\nexternal and oblivious to the internal. In the darkness of my\u0014\nsoul, I was stumbling around and bumping into the symptoms of my\u0014\nsoul-lessness -- I was busy, superficial, friendless, afraid, and\u0014\ncynical -- but I didn't know where all these negative parts of my\u0014\nlife were coming from.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor months I'd known something was wrong with me. I was filled\u0014\nwith longings I couldn't identify, yearnings I couldn't express,\u0014\nand an emptiness that seemed to be expanding. I was desperate\u0014\neven though I couldn't articulate my desperation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI decided to spend a week at L'Arche, a community for the\u0014\nmentally and physically challenged in Toronto, Canada. I didn't\u0014\nknow why, really, I just knew I needed to do something. To be\u0014\nhonest, I expected to be inspired by Henri Nouwen and touched by\u0014\nthe mentally and physically disabled people who lived there.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin a few days, I became aware that my whole life was consumed\u0014\nwith doing rather than being. I knew what it meant to believe in\u0014\nJesus, I didn't know what it meant to be with Jesus. I knew how\u0014\nto talk with Jesus, I didn't know how to sit still long enough\u0014\nto let Jesus talk to me. I found it easy to do the work of God,\u0014\nbut I had no idea how to let God work in me. I understood soul-\u0014\nsaving, but I was clueless about soul making. I knew how to be\u0014\nbusy, but I didn't know how to be still. I could talk about God,\u0014\nI just couldn't listen to God. I felt comfortable with God's\u0014\npeople, but I felt uncomfortable alone with God. I was acquainted\u0014\nwith the God \"out-there,\" but I was a complete stranger to the\u0014\nGod \"in-here.\" I could meet God anywhere ... except in my heart,\u0014\nin my soul, in my being.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took only a few hours of silence before I began to hear my\u0014\nsoul speaking. It only took being alone for a short period of\u0014\ntime for me to discover that I wasn't alone. God had been trying\u0014\nto shout over the noisiness of my life, and I couldn't hear him.\u0014\nBut in the stillness and solitude, his whispers shouted from my\u0014\nsoul, \"Michael, I'm here. I've been calling you. I've been loving\u0014\nyou, but you haven't been listening. Can you hear me, Michael? I\u0014\nlove you. I've always loved you. And I've been waiting for you to\u0014\nhear me say that to you. But you've been so busy trying to prove\u0014\nto yourself that you're loved that you haven't heard me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI heard him, and my slumbering soul was filled with the joy of\u0014\nthe prodigal son. My soul was awakened by a loving Father who\u0014\nhad been looking and waiting for me.\u0014\n\u0014\n-- Mike Yaconelli is co-founder and owner of Youth Specialties\u0014\n(http://www.YouthSpecialties.com) and pastors the slowest-growing\u0014\nchurch in America.

    "title": "LYING ABOUT HITLER:",
    "words": "A BOOK REVIEW:\u0014\n\u0014\n                     After I started reading Richard J. Evans LYING \nABOUT HITLER, I couldnt put it down. This\u0014\n                     is a well-organized, thoroughly researched \naccount, intellectually stimulating and yet\u0014\n                     entertaining. Based on his expert report as \none of the expert witnesses for the defense in\u0014\n                     the Irving vs. Penguin Books/Lipstadt case, the \nCambridge historian Prof. Evans\u0014\n                     meticulously shows how the British author David \nIrving has falsified, distorted,\u0014\n                     misinterpreted, and misrepresented historical \nevidence to fit it with his special agendas.\u0014\n                     Proved as a problematic historian, a racist, \nand a Holocaust denier in the British High\u0014\n                     Court, Irving lost the libel case in which HE \nhad sued the American scholar Deborah\u0014\n                     Lipstadt (and her publisher), who had accused \nhim of being an abuser of history and a\u0014\n                     denier in her 1993 book. LYING ABOUT HITLER \nnot only explains how the author proved\u0014\n                     Irvings intentional distortion of historical \nevidence, but also interweaves the reactions to\u0014\n                     the trial among the media and professional \nhistorians.[....]\u0014\n\u0014\n                     This book includes seven chapters and detailed \nnotes (good historians always use notes).\u0014\n                     Chapter 1 discusses the reputations of Irvings \nworks among professional historians and\u0014\n                     journalists, while explaining how Evans got \ninvolved in the case as an expert whose job\u0014\n                     was to prove Irvings abuse of historical \nrecord. The chapter shows that although some\u0014\n                     historians have already pointed out the problems \nin Irvings methodology, there are other\u0014\n                     scholars and journalists who have praised \nIrvings works.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In Chapters 2, 3, and 5, Evans proves how Irving \nhas deliberately falsified and distorted\u0014\n                     historical evidence. In order to support his \nfavorite themes (e.g. Hitler tried to stop violence\u0014\n                     against the Jews), Irving intentionally \nmanipulated primary sources. His methods include:\u0014\n                     claiming something that the source did not say; \nignoring unfavorable parts within a\u0014\n                     document; using untrustworthy witnesses (e.g. \nHitlers sympathizers); doubting the\u0014\n                     authenticity of a document that did not support \nhis thesis; and even using forged\u0014\n                     documentation. It was a challenging and \npainstaking job to examine Irvings works (about\u0014\n                     30 books) along with thousands of pages of \ndocuments and many other materials. Yet,\u0014\n                     Evans succeeded his task in court and in this \nbook.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Chapter 4, Irving and Holocaust Denial, first \ndefines what the Holocaust deniers (they call\u0014\n                     themselves revisionists) are trying to prove \nin order to minimize or smash the significance\u0014\n                     of the Holocaust. Then, mainly by examining \nIrvings public speeches, Evans verifies\u0014\n                     Irvings association with deniers, especially a \ngroup in California, the revisionist center of\u0014\n                     the US. Evans informs us that the group started \nwith Holocaust-bashing agendas, backed\u0014\n                     by extreme right-wing figures and organizations, \nand has maintained itself so since.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Chapter 6, In the Witness Box, is quite \nentertaining. It includes how Evans presented his\u0014\n                     findings in court and how Irving responded in \ncross-examination (he represented himself).\u0014\n                     Irvings harassing and insulting manners \nconstantly irritated the defense witnesses and\u0014\n                     lawyers as well as the judge. As the proceeding \nwent on, however, it became apparent that\u0014\n                     Irving was losing self-control and falling \napart. On one occasion, Irving, in a slip of the\u0014\n                     tongue, addressed the judge as Mein Fuhrer. \nEverybody in court laughed. How\u0014\n                     embarrassing! That clearly showed what sort of \naudience Irving usually had.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Chapter 7, Judgment Day, includes the court \ndecision, vindicating Lipstadts claim. It also\u0014\n                     shows how Irving attempted to disgrace the \njudgment via the media after the trial. There\u0014\n                     were some journalists who were skeptical about \nthe trial, fearing that freedom of speech\u0014\n                     was in danger. Evans, however, points out that \nthese journalists tended to forget who had\u0014\n                     brought the case in the first place. Irving was \nthe one who tried to jeopardize freedom of\u0014\n                     speech by suppressing Lipstadts book. Evans \nalso shows that those historians who still\u0014\n                     believed that Irving was legitimate missed the \npoint.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     What did the trial teach us? For historians, as \nEvans puts, It vindicated our capacity to\u0014\n                     know what happened after the survivors are no \nlonger around to tell the tale. For the\u0014\n                     public, as a journalist remarked, the case \nreminded people of what happened there, and\u0014\n                     educated those who did not know about it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Overall, Richard J. Evans LYING ABOUT HITLER \npresents an informative source,\u0014\n                     successfully integrating todays hot issues and \nhistorical arguments. I would also\u0014\n                     recommend this book for historical methodology \ncourses at college.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     An important exposition of the use and abuse of \nhistory, August 4, 2001 \u0014\n                     Reviewer: Oliver Kamm (see more about me) from \nLondon United Kingdom\u0014\n                     Since David Irving's disastrous libel suit \nagainst Penguin books, some highly disingenuous\u0014\n                     commentary has been written by people who \nclearly neither attended the trial nor\u0014\n                     understood it (some, for example, apparently not \nrealising that Irving was the plaintiff, not\u0014\n                     the defendant). Richard Evans, who was an expert \nwitness for the defence, puts the\u0014\n                     record straight in an important work. Much of \nthe book is devoted to a devastating\u0014\n                     assessment of Irving's work as a historian; he \ndemonstrates (with, most damningly, a\u0014\n                     detailed account of Irving's fabrications \nconcerning the bombing of Dresden) that\u0014\n                     dishonesty has been at the heart of Irving's \nwork since the 1960s. This done, Evans is in a\u0014\n                     powerful position to substantiate his judgement: \nthe Irving libel suit went to the heart of\u0014\n                     what history - a contingent process of testing \nhypotheses - actually means. Irving\u0014\n                     subordinated historical inquiry to his neo-Nazi \nsympathies, in an egregious violation of the\u0014\n                     scholarly ethic. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The only substantial criticism I have of this \nsalutary and important book is where, in his\u0014\n                     final chapter, Evans in my view deviates from \nthe discipline of history and ventures some\u0014\n                     rather more speculative and tentative political \njudgements. He draws a sharp contrast\u0014\n                     between Irving's Holocaust denial and the work \nof those writers who have recently\u0014\n                     criticised the 'Holocaust industry', who at \nleast do not doubt the historicity of the Holocaust.\u0014\n                     I'm not so sure. Evans describes the work of \nPeter Novick and Norman Finkelstein as\u0014\n                     displaying \"widely differing degrees of detail \nand accuracy\", implying - quite rightly - that\u0014\n                     Novick's book has a claim to scholarship whereas \nFinkelstein's polemic does not. Yet\u0014\n                     Finkelstein (and even more so his associate Noam \nChomsky) display very similar\u0014\n                     characteristics to David Irving: an agenda of \nextreme anti-Zionist agitation in preference to\u0014\n                     scholarship; an adherence to conspiracy theories \nabout Jews; documented links with\u0014\n                     neo-Nazis (Chomsky, for example, described one \nHolocaust denier whom Evans refers to,\u0014\n                     Robert Faurisson, as \"a sort of relatively \napolitical liberal\"); and a willingness to fabricate\u0014\n                     source material (see Arthur Schlesinger's \ndestruction, in his collection The Cycles of\u0014\n                     American History, of Chomsky's fabrication of \nquotations by President Truman). The Irving\u0014\n                     phenomenon is an extreme one, but it has its \ncounterparts elsewhere on the political\u0014\n                     spectrum.\u0014\n-------------------------------\u0014\nReviewer: Francis J. McInerney (see more about me) from Commonwealth\u0014\n                              \"Lying About Hitler\", by Professor \nRichard J. Evans is a powerful, meticulous,\u0014\n                     and deeply troubling summation of his \npreparation for, and testimony at the David Irving\u0014\n                     Trial. The idea that a trial was needed to prove \nthat the Holocaust did take place despite\u0014\n                     the writings of the rabid anti-Semite David \nIrving is almost beyond belief. The fact that the\u0014\n                     trial was brought by a suit initiated by David \nIrving is astounding. For while his life has\u0014\n                     been consumed by creating History as he wanted \nit to be, reading his words as he impales\u0014\n                     his ideas and himself would have been pathetic \nwere his victims History at all questionable.\u0014\n                     However here his public and professional suicide \nwas appropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     What is very disturbing is that even after he \nwas exposed for nothing more than an\u0014\n                     ideologue that twisted facts when he needed to, \nand created them from thin air when there\u0014\n                     was nothing to twist, is that his peers did not \nostracize him completely and without\u0014\n                     exception. By peers I refer to legitimate \nHistorians whose work is accurate and can be\u0014\n                     verified. History can certainly be revised when \nnew facts are learned, but never when they\u0014\n                     are the creation of a fertile yet fetid mind. \nThis was not a blow to free speech as some\u0014\n                     have suggested. Free speech does not grant the \nright to create and represent as true,\u0014\n                     that, which the writer knows to be false, or \nworse, information that the writer has conjured.\u0014\n                     The only Historians that should feel threatened \nby this trials' outcome should logically be\u0014\n                     those who are concerned as to how well their \nwork is documented, and free of ludicrous\u0014\n                     speculation.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Professional Historians must be held to a much \nhigher standard than other writers.\u0014\n                     Through their work they document our History and \nserve as custodians of the past. We\u0014\n                     must be able to rely upon them, and also on \ntheir peers to see that writers of hate-based\u0014\n                     novels like those of David Irving never reach a \ncourtroom. His fictions must be\u0014\n                     marginalized to those of his kind who have made \nthe decision to retreat from what is true\u0014\n                     and create their own hate-filled version of the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Professor Evans is also to be commended for \ndiscussing the fact that while the Jews were\u0014\n                     unquestionably the primary target of Hitler and \nhis sociopaths, there were also hundreds\u0014\n                     of thousands of non-Jews who were slaughtered \ntogether alongside the Jews in the\u0014\n                     camps. The survivors of the crimes of World War \nII are becoming fewer in number every\u0014\n                     day. As they pass and their numbers decline so \nwill the power of the advocacy they can\u0014\n                     summon. This is the challenge moving forward, to \nensure the record remains accurate and\u0014\n                     free from the diseases that are David Irving and \nhis ilk.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     This is a wonderfully readable book that sets \nout what History is, and what it is not. As long\u0014\n                     as there are men and woman who are willing to \ndedicate their time and skills to the\u0014\n                     destruction of these falsifiers, these deniers, \nboth our History and our Future are safe.\u0014",

Speculation on why this happens \n(better lifestyle choices?\u0014\n                      stronger support communities? prayer?) \ncontinues to spawn studies,\u0014\n                      but the concept is hardly earth-shattering.

The following excerpts \nfrom his article, \"Live\u0014\n                      Longer, Healthier, & Better,\" illustrate his \nconclusions:\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             * * * \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christians in the ancient world had longer life \nexpectancies than did\u0014\n                      their pagan neighbors.

At the end of\u0014\n                      the second century, Tertullian wrote that while \npagan temples spent\u0014\n                      their donations \"on feasts and drinking bouts,\" \nChristians spent\u0014\n                      theirs \"to support and bury poor people, to \nsupply the wants of boys\u0014\n                      and girls destitute of means and parents, and \nof old persons confined\u0014\n                      to the house.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Similarly, in a letter to the bishop of Antioch \nin 251, the bishop of\u0014\n                      Rome mentioned that \"more than 1,500 widows and \ndistressed\u0014\n                      persons\" were in the care of his congregation. \nThese claims\u0014\n                      concerning Christian charity were confirmed by \npagan observers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The impious Galileans support not only their \npoor,\" complained\u0014\n                      pagan emperor Julian, \"but ours as well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Girl power\u0014\n                      Women greatly outnumbered men among early \nconverts. However, in\u0014\n                      the empire as a whole, men vastly outnumbered \nwomen. There were\u0014\n                      an estimated 131 men for every 100 women in \nRome. The disparity\u0014\n                      was even greater elsewhere and greater still \namong the elite. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Widespread female infanticide had reduced the \nnumber of women in\u0014\n                      society. \"If you are delivered of a child,\" \nwrote a man named Hilarion\u0014\n                      to his pregnant wife, \"if it is a boy, keep it, \nif it is a girl discard it.\"\u0014\n                      Frequent abortions \"entailing great risk\" (in \nthe words of Celsus)\u0014\n                      killed many women and left even more barren.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Christian community, however, practiced \nneither abortion nor\u0014\n                      infanticide and thus drew to itself women.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      More importantly, within the Christian \ncommunity women enjoyed\u0014\n                      higher status and security than they did among \ntheir pagan\u0014\n                      neighbors. Pagan women typically were married \nat a young age\u0014\n                      (often before puberty) to much older men. But \nChristian women were\u0014\n                      older when they married and had more choice in \nwhom, and even if,\u0014\n                      they would marry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Urban sanctuary\u0014\n                      Christianity also offered a strong community in \na disorganized,\u0014\n                      chaotic world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Greco-Roman cities were terribly overpopulated. \nAntioch, for\u0014\n                      example, had a population density of about 117 \ninhabitants per\u0014\n                      acremore than three times that of New York \nCity today.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tenement cubicles were smoky, dark, often damp, \nand always dirty.\u0014\n                      The smell of sweat, urine, feces, and decay \npermeated everything.\u0014\n                      Outside on the street, mud, open sewers, and \nmanure lay\u0014\n                      everywhere, and even human corpses were found \nin the gutters.\u0014\n                      Newcomers and strangers, divided into many \nethnic groups, harbored\u0014\n                      bitter antagonism that often erupted into \nviolent riots.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For these ills, Christianity offered a unifying \nsubculture, bridging\u0014\n                      these divisions and providing a strong sense of \ncommon identity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      To cities filled with the homeless and \nimpoverished, Christianity\u0014\n                      offered charity and hope.

Consequently Christians\u0014\n                      were more likely than pagans to recovera \nvisible benefit. Christian social\u0014\n                      services also were visible and valuable during \nthe frequent natural and social\u0014\n                      disasters afflicting the Greco-Roman world: \nearthquakes, famines, floods,\u0014\n                      riots, civil wars, and invasions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Girl power\u0014\n                      Women greatly outnumbered men among early \nconverts. However, in the\u0014\n                      empire as a whole, men vastly outnumbered \nwomen. There were an\u0014\n                      estimated 131 men for every 100 women in Rome. \nThe disparity was even\u0014\n                      greater elsewhere and greater still among the \nelite. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Widespread female infanticide had reduced the \nnumber of women in\u0014\n                      society. \"If you are delivered of a child,\" \nwrote a man named Hilarion to his\u0014\n                      pregnant wife, \"if it is a boy, keep it, if it \nis a girl discard it.\" Frequent\u0014\n                      abortions \"entailing great risk\" (in the words \nof Celsus) killed many women\u0014\n                      and left even more barren. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Christian community, however, practiced \nneither abortion nor infanticide\u0014\n                      and thus drew to itself women. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      More importantly, within the Christian \ncommunity women enjoyed higher\u0014\n                      status and security than they did among their \npagan neighbors. Pagan\u0014\n                      women typically were married at a young age \n(often before puberty) to much\u0014\n                      older men. But Christian women were older when \nthey married and had more\u0014\n                      choice in whom, and even if, they would marry. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In addition, Christian men could not easily \ndivorce their wives, and both\u0014\n                      genders were subject to strongly enforced rules \nagainst extramarital sex. \u0014\n\u0014\n                       To cities filled with the homeless and\u0014\n                       impoverished, Christianity offered\u0014\n                       charity and hope.

Christianity also\u0014\n                      offered a strong community in a disorganized, \nchaotic world. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Greco-Roman cities were terribly overpopulated. \nAntioch, for example, had a\u0014\n                      population density of about 117 inhabitants per \nacremore than three times\u0014\n                      that of New York City today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tenement cubicles were smoky, dark, often damp, \nand always dirty. The\u0014\n                      smell of sweat, urine, feces, and decay \npermeated everything. Outside on\u0014\n                      the street, mud, open sewers, and manure lay \neverywhere, and even human\u0014\n                      corpses were found in the gutters. Newcomers \nand strangers, divided into\u0014\n                      many ethnic groups, harbored bitter antagonism \nthat often erupted into\u0014\n                      violent riots. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For these ills, Christianity offered a unifying \nsubculture, bridging these\u0014\n                      divisions and providing a strong sense of \ncommon identity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To cities filled with the homeless and \nimpoverished, Christianity offered\u0014\n                      charity and hope. To cities filled with \nnewcomers and strangers, Christianity\u0014\n                      offered an immediate fellowship. To cities \nfilled with orphans and widows,\u0014\n                      Christianity provided a new and expanded sense \nof family. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In short, Christianity offered a longer, more \nsecure, and happier life. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The emotional benefits of martyrdom\u0014\n                      It seems obvious that in periods of \npersecution, church membership would\u0014\n                      decrease dramatically. In fact, persecutions \nrarely occurred, and only a tiny\u0014\n                      number of Christians were ever martyredonly \n\"hundreds, not thousands\"\u0014\n                      according to historian William H. C. Frend. \nUsually only bishops and other\u0014\n                      prominent figures were singled out for \nmartyrdom. The actual threat to\u0014\n                      rank-and-file Christians was quite small. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      However, the martyrdoms played a crucial role \nin cementing the faith of early\u0014\n                      believers. Persecution eliminated the \n\"free-rider\" problem common to many\u0014\n                      new religions. Those who stayed in the church \nbelieved strongly in the tenets\u0014\n                      of the faith because it was \"expensive\" to do \nso. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Anyone who has participated in a cause that \ndemands great sacrifice will\u0014\n                      understand that services conducted in those \nearly house churches must\u0014\n                      have yielded an intense, shared emotional \nsatisfaction. Shared risk usually\u0014\n                      brings people together in powerful ways. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Compassion equation\u0014\n                      It was not simply the promise of salvation that \nmotivated Christians, but the\u0014\n                      fact that they were greatly rewarded in the \nhere and now for belonging. Thus\u0014\n                      while membership was \"expensive,\" it was, in \nfact, \"a bargain.\" Because the\u0014\n                      church asked much of its members, it followed \nthat it gave much. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      For example, because Christians were expected \nto aid the less fortunate,\u0014\n                      they could expect to receive such aid, and all \ncould feel greater security\u0014\n                      against bad times. Because they were asked to \nnurse the sick and dying,\u0014\n                      they too would receive such nursing. Because \nthey were asked to love\u0014\n                      others, they in turn would be loved. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In similar fashion, Christianity mitigated \nrelations among social classes, and\u0014\n                      at the very time when the gap between rich and \npoor was growing. It did not\u0014\n                      preach that everyone could or should be \nsocially or politically equal, but it did\u0014\n                      preach that all were equal in the eyes of God \nand that the more fortunate had\u0014\n                      a responsibility to help those in need. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Good theological news\u0014\n                      Converts not only had to learn to act like \nChristians but to understand why\u0014\n                      Christians acted as they did. They had to learn \nthat God commanded them to\u0014\n                      love one another, to be merciful, to be their \nbrother's keeper. Indeed, they\u0014\n                      had to understand the idea of \"divinity\" in an \nentirely new way. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The simple phrase \"For God so loved the world\" \npuzzled educated pagans,\u0014\n                      who believed, as Aristotle taught, that the \ngods could feel no love for mere\u0014\n                      humans. Moreover, a god of mercy was \nunthinkable, since classical\u0014\n                      philosophers taught that mercy was a \npathological emotion, a defect of\u0014\n                      character to be outgrown and overcome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The notion that the gods care how we treat one \nanother would also have\u0014\n                      been dismissed as patently absurd by all \nsophisticated pagans. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When we examine the gods accepted by these same \nsophisticates, they\u0014\n                      seem trivial in contrast with \"God the Father,\" \nand wicked incompetents\u0014\n                      compared to \"His Son.\" Yet to many pagans, this \nnew teaching was more\u0014\n                      than absurd. It was also good news. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Behind all these tangible, sociological, and \nintellectual motives, of course,\u0014\n                      Christians believe the Holy Spirit prodded and \npersuaded pagans to believe.\u0014\n                      Christian conversion, after all, is ultimately \na spiritual affair. But is it too\u0014\n                      much to imagine that God perhaps used the \ntangible to influence the\u0014\n                      spiritual? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rodney Stark is professor of sociology and \ncomparative religion at the University of\u0014\n                      Washington, and author of The Rise of \nChristianity: A Sociologist Reconsiders History\u0014\n                      (Princeton University Press, 1996).\u0014",

He challenges us to develop \na Christian mind\u0014\n                     and to use our intellect to further God's \nkingdom.\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nJ.P. Moreland, eminent apologist and Christian philosopher, has done \nit again.\u0014\n                     This book is awesome. Moreland begins with an \nhistorical account of why he thinks\u0014\n                     Christianity took a turn for the worst and moved \ninto a state of anti-intellectualism. He \u0014\n                     then,\u0014\n                     in chapter one, two and three, discusses in \ndetail how the Christian can gain back\u0014\n                     intellectual prowess. In part two of the book, \nMoreland proceeds to instruct the Christian\u0014\n                     into correct thinking via logic, philosophy, and \ncorrect theology. Part three consists of\u0014\n                     apologetics and its place in Christianity as \nwell as developing a sound Christian world \u0014\n                     view\u0014\n                     and perspective. Part four takes what has been \ncovered up to this point and incorporates\u0014\n                     it into an admonishment of sorts to \"recapture \nthe intellect in the Churches.\" Moreland \u0014\n                     has\u0014\n                     also included an Appendix (1) that lists many of \nthe Christian organizations and\u0014\n                     ministries\u0014\n                     that focus on apologetics, philosophy, and other \nintellectual pursuits. Moreover, Moreland\u0014\n                     includes, in appendix (2)that consists of a list \nof required reading in various fields of \u0014\n                     study\u0014\n                     from politics to philosophy to apologetics to \nphysics, etc. This book is wonderfully written\u0014\n                     and unfortunately pin point accurate. Thus, it \nshould be read by every Christian in all\u0014\n                     areas of life. \u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nThis book is for Christians. Unlike Moreland's other books which are \naimed at rationally\u0014\n                     defending Christianity, this one aims at getting \nChristians to stop being the intellectual\u0014\n                     weakling in society. Dr. Moreland's approach is \nBiblical from the conservative evangelical\u0014\n                     point of view. This book says nothing new. It \nencourages Christians to go back to the\u0014\n                     intellectual attitudes held by Christians for \n1800 of the 2000 year history of the church.\u0014\n                     Let's be able to outhink our critics once again \nand have the church as the main centre of\u0014\n                     influence in society again. PLEASE IF YOU ARE A \nCHRISTIAN, BUY THIS BOOK. It will be\u0014\n                     your first step to growing from your current \nspiritual food to eating 2 inch thick porterhouse\u0014\n                     steaks. AGAIN IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, PLEASE BUY \nTHIS BOOK. When scholars like\u0014\n                     Moreland and William Lane Craig set their minds \nto something the secular world is in for \u0014\n                     a difficult (and usually unwinnable) argument \n(check out their debates). \u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nOften Christians are accused of not engaging their brains, \nunfortunately this criticism is\u0014\n                     often deserved. J.P. Moreland does an excellent \njob of showing the reader how to \u0014\n                     develop  his Christian Mind. If you are an \nintellectual wannabe and have read James W. \u0014\n                     Sire's book 'Habits of the Mind', you'll also \nwant to read this book which was written three \u0014\n                     years prior to Sire's book. I would suggest \nreading them both as they both compliment\u0014\n                     each other well. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Moreland takes 10 chapters divided into four \nsections to develop the concept of the\u0014\n                     mature Christian mind, a mind that loves God to \nthe utmost. One special chapter of\u0014\n                     interest covers logic, a discipline that is lost \non all but a few Christians, but crucial for\u0014\n                     developing a reasoned apologetic. In Section \nThree (chapters six through nine), \u0014\n                     Moreland  describes how the Christian intellect \nis relevant in evangelism, apologetic\u0014\n                     reasoning, and worship within the church. I also \nenjoyed the final chapter which covers a\u0014\n                     plan for developing the Christian intellect \nwithin our churches.\u0014",

    "words": "Special Letters to the Editor: God Bless America,  Richmond \nTimes-Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\n   Sep 15, 2001\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: It's consuming our \nthoughts, breaking our hearts, and stirring our emotions. What\u0014\n                  happened on September 11 is still unbelievable to \nmany. How could anyone nonchalantly destroy the lives\u0014\n                  of so many people in a calculated, terrifying act \nof terrorism? That's my question.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  These were not military people; these were innocent \nand unsuspecting civilians - people with goals, with\u0014\n                  dreams, with families, with special contributions \nto society. They were just going about their business, and\u0014\n                  moments later they found themselves smack-dab in \nthe middle of the biggest national incident on American\u0014\n                  soil in years. And now many of them are gone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Many are speculating as to whether swift military \naction should be taken in retribution for the many lives that\u0014\n                  were destroyed in one fell swoop. I think we should \ntake some sort of action; however, I am not a defense\u0014\n                  expert or a national security adviser. They are the \npeople who should be making these decisions, based on\u0014\n                  the information they have before them that is not \nbefore the public. We need to send terrorists a\u0014\n                  crystal-clear message that we will stand united as \na nation. They cannot take our freedom; they cannot\u0014\n                  break our unity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of \nthe victims and the survivors of the attack, as well as to\u0014\n                  the dedicated and courageous rescue personnel who \nare working diligently at this very moment. God Bless\u0014\n                  America! Laura Hickey. richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                       . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: Our President has declared \nthat \"this will be a monumental struggle of good versus\u0014\n                  evil. But good will prevail.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  What we saw on September 11 was pure evil, on a \nscale our nation has not experienced until now. I hope\u0014\n                  this will put an end to the talk we have heard from \nso many sources that all morality is relative, that there is\u0014\n                  no such thing as good and evil, that we have no \nright to judge anyone else's motives.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Bible says, \"Woe to those who call evil good \nand good evil, who put darkness for light and light for\u0014\n                  darkness.\" Now that we have seen what evil really \nlooks like and have recognized it for what it is, let us\u0014\n                  never again lose that recognition. James Morrison. \nrichmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                       . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: Because of His miracles, \nthey hated Him. Because He was the light of the world\u0014\n                  they vowed to destroy Him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Like Jesus, America is the light of the world. It \nis a land of true miracles: prosperity, freedom, and\u0014\n                  achievements most of the world can only dream of. \nOf the events of this week, what moved me the most\u0014\n                  was the image of the Statue of Liberty standing in \nthe harbor, so tiny compared to the plumes of smoke in\u0014\n                  the distance, so still and yet so defiant, its \ntorch held high, sending forth the light of freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  And I remembered the very words of the monsters who \nfeel threatened by American miracles, by the light of\u0014\n                  its freedom. Their goal, they say, is to destroy \nAmerica. Not white Americans, or black Americans, or\u0014\n                  Americans of any kind or color, but America. \nAmerica. They see clearly what Americans often do not see.\u0014\n                  We are one nation. We can make miracles because we \nare one nation united by ideals and values we\u0014\n                  honor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Disturbingly, it has become fashionable to divide \nAmericans into an ever-growing collection of groups. So let\u0014\n                  us resolve that we will preserve forever the unity \nthat in our outrage we feel today. Let us never forget that we\u0014\n                  are one nation: America, a land of miracles, a land \nof light. Robert E. Sosa. richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                       . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: I am a 12-year-old \nhome-educated student, and I saw the terrorist attacks on live\u0014\n                  television. All my life I've lived in a protected \nbubble. I've heard of these things happening in other parts of the\u0014\n                  world. I've read about them, but I could never have \nimagined anything of this magnitude in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  When I saw the plane hit the second tower, that \nbubble I've been living in popped. In an instant, the world\u0014\n                  was real. Threats of war and bombings suddenly \nseemed so much closer. My mom used to live in D.C. She\u0014\n                  travels a lot. She might have been on one of the \nhijacked planes. It was terrifying just thinking she might not\u0014\n                  be here now. I can only imagine how the families of \nthe victims must feel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  When the towers went down, I thought it had to be a \ndream. I thought I'd wake up, and everything would be\u0014\n                  okay. But I didn't wake up. It wasn't a dream. \nThings weren't okay. It seemed like something out of a movie.\u0014\n                  I was glued to the TV all day, flipping through \nchannels for the latest. When the Pentagon was hit, it was\u0014\n                  terrifying! It was so close to home! I thought that \nif New York, the largest city in the country, and the\u0014\n                  Pentagon, the military base for all of America, \nweren't safe, what was?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  I'm just a kid, but on September 11 it felt as \nthough I grew up in one horrendous hour.

Logan Smith. bon air.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: I pray you are correct in \nyour assertion that we will take action against terrorists. I\u0014\n                  have not talked with anyone who believes we will do \nmore than make token strikes. There will be massive\u0014\n                  bleating from the left and intensified efforts to \ngive up more constitutional rights and prevent people from\u0014\n                  protecting themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Had there been a single armed passenger on either \nof the four planes involved in this attack, it would not\u0014\n                  have occurred. We need a national right-to-carry \nlaw. We should all fear the elite of this country who believe\u0014\n                  that unarmed peasants are preferable to citizens \ncapable of defending the country or themselves.

Whether the camps are in \nIraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, or some other rogue state,\u0014\n                  they need to be hit - smashed soon, and with a \nrelentlessness that reflects the righteousness of a just\u0014\n                  cause.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  There are some countries in the Middle East that \nbelieve the U.S. does not have the will or courage to\u0014\n                  respond as you have written. We can only hope they \nare wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  \"Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good \nwe oft might win, by fearing to attempt.\" -\u0014\n                  Shakespeare. Paul Schoenbaum. williamsburg.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: It is has been reported by \nseveral sources that gasoline retailers are taking\u0014\n                  advantage of the recent attack on America to raise \nfuel prices in an attempt to gouge the consumer. Gas\u0014\n                  prices were reportedly as high as $5 a gallon in \nsome Midwestern states, although there is no shortage of\u0014\n                  gasoline. This is a despicable act, bordering on \ntreason.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  The gas-station owners who saw this as an \nopportunity to make a quick buck are no better than the looters\u0014\n                  in Brooklyn who took advantage of the lack of \npolice officers, who were busy attending to the rescue effort. I\u0014\n                  urge all Americans to recognize who these villains \nare, and to put them out of business. Don't buy gasoline\u0014\n                  from these stations, even if they reduce prices to \nbelow-market levels. Let them know that we saw through\u0014\n                  their plan, and we are disgusted by what they were \nattempting to do. James W. Featherstone IV. richmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Editor, Times-Dispatch: I write to express my shock \nand disgust that you would publish Gary Brookins'\u0014\n                  cartoon showing Uncle Sam making a note to nuke \nAfghanistan.

Moreover, they must remain cognizant \nof their vast ability to influence public opinion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  To urge the use of nuclear weapons against another \ncountry with an unestablished and possibly nonexistent\u0014\n                  connection to the terrorist act of September 11 is \na sickening misuse of your responsibility as journalists,\u0014\n                  even in the context of editorial opinion.

While Congress wrings\u0014\n                  its hands and twiddles its thumbs about \nmulticulturalism and other semantic nonsense, people are losing\u0014\n                  their freedom as well as their lives. Congress has \nto be held responsible for the laws that are passed when\u0014\n                  acts of terrorism and violence are the result.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Figures abound about the number of illegal \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nwho are in this country.

Jesus made this absolutely plain. The \nchief characteristic of\u0014\n                      Christian leaders, he insisted, is humility not \nauthority, and\u0014\n                      gentleness not power.\u0014\n                      John Stott, The Gospel and the End of Time\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is not so much that man is a herd animal, \nsaid Freud, but that he\u0014\n                      is a horde animal led by a chief.\u0014\n                      Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The urge to rule (libido dominandi) is the \ndevil's first sin of pride\u0014\n                      and the cause of Adam's fall, whose traces show \nin every heir to that\u0014\n                      primal sin.\u0014\n                      Garry Wills, Saint Augustine\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He who sacrifices his conscience to ambition \nburns a picture to\u0014\n                      obtain the ashes.\u0014\n                      Chinese Proverb\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Only by learning to accept God's forgiveness as \nwe see it in the life\u0014\n                      and death of Jesus can we acquire the power \nthat comes from\u0014\n                      learning to give up control.\u0014\n                      Stanley Hauerwas, The Peaceable Kingdom\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014\n                     \u0014\n                      October 1, 2001, Vol. 45, No. 12, Page 69\u0014",

L. Moody told his family, \"I'm not discouraged. I \nwant to live as long as I am useful, but when\u0014\n      my work is done I want to be up and off.\" The next day Moody \nawakened after a restless night. In\u0014\n      careful, measured words he said, \"Earth recedes, Heaven opens \nbefore me!\" His son, Will, concluded\u0014\n      his father was dreaming. \"No, this is no dream, Will. It is \nbeautiful. It is like a trance. If this is death, it is\u0014\n      sweet. There is no valley here.

He came from a Christian\u0014\n      home, and he was gifted with a keen mind and good looks. Yet in \nthose days he was a bit snobbish and\u0014\n      sarcastic. One night, however, something happened that set in \nmotion a change in Wesley's heart.\u0014\n      While speaking with a porter, he discovered that the poor \nfellow had only one coat and lived in such\u0014\n      impoverished conditions that he didn't even have a bed. Yet he \nwas an unusually happy person, filled\u0014\n      with gratitude to God. Wesley, being immature, thoughtlessly \njoked about the man's misfortunes. \"And\u0014\n      what else do you thank God for?\" he said with a touch of \nsarcasm.  \u0014\n\u0014\n      The porter smiled, and in the spirit of meekness replied with \njoy, \"I thank Him that He has given me my\u0014\n      life and being, a heart to love Him, and above all a constant \ndesire to serve Him!\" Deeply moved,\u0014\n      Wesley recognized that this man knew the meaning of true \nthankfulness.  \u0014\n\u0014\n      Many years later, in 1791, John Wesley lay on his deathbed at \nthe age of 88. Those who gathered\u0014\n      around him realized how well he had learned the lesson of \npraising God in every circumstance. Despite\u0014\n      Wesley's extreme weakness, he began singing the hymn, \"I'll \nPraise My Maker While I've Breath.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\n      Our Daily Bread. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      John Bacon, eminent 18th-century English sculptor, said on his \ndeathbed, \"What I was as an artist\u0014\n      seemed to be of some importance while I lived, but what I \nreally am as a believer in the Lord Jesus\u0014\n      Christ is the only thing of importance to me now.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Source Unknown. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      English physicist and chemist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) was \nasked, \"Have you ever pondered by\u0014\n      yourself what will be your occupation in the next world?\" \nFaraday hesitated awhile and then responded,\u0014\n      \"I shall be with Christ, and that is enough.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Source Unknown. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      The 17th century Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford gave \nthis triumphant testimony before he\u0014\n      stepped into eternity: \u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Mine eye shall see my Redeemer. He has pardoned, loved, and \nwashed me, and given me joy\u0014\n      unspeakable and full of glory. Glory shines in Immanuel's \nland!\"  \u0014\n\u0014\n      Daily Walk, April 10, 1992. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      On the day of her (Idelette's) death, John Calvin was impressed \nwith her serenity. \"She suddenly cried\u0014\n      out in such a way that all could see that her spirit had risen \nfar above this world. These were her words,\u0014\n      'O glorious resurrection! O God of Abraham and of all of our \nfathers, the believers of all the ages have\u0014\n      trusted on Thee and none of them have hoped in vain. And now I \nfix my hope on Thee.' These short\u0014\n      statements were cried out rather than distinctly spoken. These \nwere not lines suggested by someone\u0014\n      else but came from her own thoughts.\"  \u0014\n\u0014\n      An hour later she could no longer speak and her mind seemed \nconfused. \"Yet her facial expressions\u0014\n      revealed her mental alertness,\" John recalled later. \"I said a \nfew words to her about the grace of Christ,\u0014\n      the hope of everlasting life, our marriage and her approaching \ndeparture. Then I turned aside to pray.\"\u0014\n      Before long she quietly \"slipped from life into death.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Christian History, Vol. 5, No. 4, p. 15. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      The last days of British statesman and colonial leader Cecil \nRhodes were marked by grave\u0014\n      disappointment. He died from heart disease at a time when he \nwas beset by personal scandals and\u0014\n      discredited by unwise political decisions. Lewis Mitchel, who \nwas at Rhodes's bedside in his cottage\u0014\n      near Cape Town, South Africa heard the dying man murmur, \"So \nlittle done, so much to do.\" Yet there's\u0014\n      more than this to the story of Cecil Rhodes. \u0014\n\u0014\n      He migrated to South Africa from Britain for health reasons. It \nwas there that Rhodes made a vast\u0014\n      fortune in gold and diamond mining. Even though he died feeling \nhe had much more to do, he has left\u0014\n      a lasting legacy because he used part of his fortune to endow \nthe famous Rhodes scholarship\u0014\n      program.  \u0014\n\u0014\n      Today in the Word, July 28, 1992. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      My days are numbered.

He said two feelings occupied his\u0014\n      mind: \"I am, first, in a joyous mood, and second filled with \ngreat anticipation.\" Then he made this\u0014\n      beautiful affirmation: \"In Christ I have put my faith, and \nprecisely today I have faith in Him more firmly\u0014\n      than ever.\" Finally he urged his parents to read the New \nTestament for comfort: \"Look where you will,\u0014\n      everywhere you will find jubilation over the grace that makes \nus children of God.

    "words": "Prince of Peace, God of War\u0014\nClaremont Institute Precepts: Prince of Peace, God of War\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Thomas L. Krannawitter\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid terrible times of suffering, Americans turn to God. Americans\u0014\nalways have been, after all, a religious people. George Washington\u0014\nbelieved the American Revolution, and the ensuing experiment in free\u0014\ngovernment, was guided by the hand of Providence, because he thought\u0014\nGod on the side of freedom. Abraham Lincoln, in his Second Inaugural\u0014\nAddress, a work no less theological and philosophic than political and\u0014\npoetic, interpreted the horrors of the Civil War as divine retribution\u0014\nfor the sin of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans of old understood what is right, and reasonably expected God\u0014\nto shine His blessings on them and protect them when they lived\u0014\nrightly. And they feared Him when they strayed. They understood that\u0014\nGod is good, that God favors freedom over tyranny, justice over\u0014\ninjustice. They understood that the principles of America are good --\u0014\nthat it is the first country in human history founded on the \"laws of\u0014\nnature and of nature's God\" -- and that their patriotic duty to their\u0014\ncountry is no less a duty to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday many of our ministers, priests, and rabbis neither think nor\u0014\nspeak this way. As a nation we have succumbed to modern ideas that\u0014\nblur, if not erase, the distinctions between right and wrong, good and\u0014\nevil. These ideas have come to dominate our halls of worship, as they\u0014\ndominate our legislative halls and halls of education. Many churches\u0014\ntoday fail to teach patriotism because they no longer know what is\u0014\nright, and they no longer know America to be right.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this week we have seen the face of evil up close. Evil has been\u0014\nthrust upon us. If anything good is to come from these terrible \nevents,\u0014\nwe must use them as reminders of the principles of right and the \nduties\u0014\nof citizenship. Our God and our Constitution demand it. Our slain\u0014\ncountrymen deserve it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne way to help us remember these things is to recall the sermons\u0014\ndelivered during the American Founding. These sermons represent a\u0014\nreligion that knew right from wrong, as clearly as it knew night from\u0014\nday, because it understood that the principles of right are made\u0014\navailable to man by his reason no less than divine revelation. What\u0014\nfollows are excerpts from a 1758 sermon delivered by Samuel Davies to\u0014\nthe militia of Hanover County, Virginia, as that body sought new\u0014\nrecruits to fight the French and Indian War:\u0014\n\u0014\nCursed be he that doth the work of the lord deceitfully;\u0014\nand cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.\u0014\nJeremiah 48:10\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing can be more agreeable to the God of Peace than to see\u0014\nuniversal harmony and benevolence prevail among His creatures; and He\u0014\nhas laid them under the strongest obligations to cultivate a pacific\u0014\ntemper toward one another, both as individuals and as nations. \"Follow\u0014\npeace with all men,\" is one of the principal precepts of our holy\u0014\nreligion. And the great Prince of Peace has solemnly pronounced,\u0014\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when, in this corrupt, disordered state of things, where the lusts\u0014\nof men are perpetually embroiling the world with wars and fighting and\u0014\nthrowing all into confusion; when ambition and avarice would rob us of\u0014\nour property, for which we have toiled and on which we subsist; when\u0014\nthey would enslave the freeborn mind and compel us meanly to cringe to\u0014\nusurpation and arbitrary power; when they would tear from our eager\u0014\ngrasp the most valuable blessing of Heaven, I mean our religion; when\u0014\nthey invade our country, formerly the region of tranquility, ravage \nour\u0014\nfrontiers, butcher our fellow subjects, or confine them in a barbarous\u0014\ncaptivity in the dens of savages; when our earthly all is ready to be\u0014\nseized by rapacious hands, and even our eternal all is in danger by \nthe\u0014\nloss of our religion; when this is the case, what then is the will of\u0014\nGod?\u0014\n\u0014\nMust peace then be maintained? Maintained with our perfidious and\u0014\ncruel invaders? Maintained at the expense of property, liberty, life,\u0014\nand everything dear and valuable? Maintained, when it is in our power\u0014\nto vindicate our right and do ourselves justice? Is the work of peace\u0014\nthen our only business? No. In such a time even the God of Peace\u0014\nproclaims by His providence, \"To arms!\" Then the sword is, as it were,\u0014\nconsecrated to God; and the art of war becomes a part of our religion.\u0014\nThen happy is he that shall reward our enemies, as they have served \nus.\u0014\nBlessed is the brave soldier; blessed is the defender of his country\u0014\nand the destroyer of its enemies. Blessed are they who offer \nthemselves\u0014\nwillingly in this service, and who faithfully discharge it.... ...Some\u0014\n[Americans] lie dead, mangled with savage wounds, consumed to ashes\u0014\nwith outrageous flames, or torn and devoured by the beasts of the\u0014\nwilderness, while their bones lie whitening in the sun and serve as\u0014\ntragic memorials of the fatal spot where they fell. Others have been\u0014\ndragged away captives and made the slaves of imperious and cruel\u0014\nsavages. Others have made their escape and live to lament their\u0014\nbutchered or captivated friends and relations. In short, our frontiers\u0014\nhave been drenched with the blood of our fellow subjects, through the\u0014\nlength of a thousand miles; and new wounds are still opening... Will\u0014\nthis violence cease without a vigorous and timely resistance from us?\u0014\nNo. We have no method left but to repel force with force, and to give\u0014\nthem blood to drink in their turn who have drunk ours...\u0014\n\u0014\nI seriously make the proposal to you, not only as a subject of the\u0014\nbest of kings and a friend to your country but as a servant of the \nmost\u0014\nhigh God; for I am fully persuaded what I am recommending is His will;\u0014\nand disobedience to it may expose you to His curse...\u0014\n\u0014\n...The cause in which these brave men, and our army in general, are\u0014\nengaged is not so much their own as ours. Divine Providence considers\u0014\nthem not so much in their private, personal character as in their\u0014\npublic character as the representatives and guardians of their \ncountry;\u0014\nand, therefore, they will stand or fall, not so much according to \ntheir\u0014\nown personal character as according to the public character of the\u0014\npeople whose cause they have undertaken. Be it known to you, then,\u0014\ntheir success depends upon us even more than upon themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n...Ye that love ease and shrink from the dangers of war; ye that wish\u0014\nto see peace restored once more; ye that would be happy beyond the\u0014\ngrave and live forever -- attend to my proposal. It is this: A \nTHOROUGH\u0014\nNATIONAL REFORMATION. This will do what millions of money and \nthousands\u0014\nof men, with guns and swords and all the dreadful artillery of death,\u0014\ncould not do -- it will procure us peace again, a lasting, well-\u0014\nestablished peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur enemies think their political cause -- the cause of tyranny -- is\u0014\ngood. We think the cause of freedom and constitutional government \ngood.\u0014\nBoth think God on their side. It cannot be. As the preachers of the\u0014\nAmerican Founding explained, reason is the voice of God, no less than\u0014\nrevelation. Reason and revelation agree on the equal rights of all \nmen,\u0014\ngovernment by consent, and the rule of law. Any revelation, any\u0014\nreligion, that contradicts these simple dictates of rational morality \n-\u0014\n- that denies the equality of all men, and the equal rights of \nliberty,\u0014\nlife, and conscience with which we are endowed by our Creator -- is\u0014\nuntrue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the enemies of freedom wish to discuss these things, we will\u0014\ndemonstrate why their position is unreasonable, unjust, and evil. But\u0014\nif our enemies refuse to talk, if they refuse to heed the counsels of\u0014\nreason, and choose instead to make war, we will make sure they get it.\u0014\nIn those times, terrible times such as we face today, let us follow \nthe\u0014\nAbraham of America, our great Civil War President, having faith that\u0014\n\"right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do\u0014\nour duty as we understand it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas L. Krannawitter is Director of Academic Programs at the\u0014\nClaremont Institute. He is currently writing a book on the political\u0014\nsermons of the American Founding.\u0014",

    "words": "LEADING IN A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY\u0014\n   What should Christian leaders do in these anxious times?\u0014\n   4 strategic questions.\u0014\n\u0014\n   by guest columnist J. David Schmidt\u0014\n\u0014\n   The slaughter of nearly 6,000 people on September 11, 2001,\u0014\n   and the related economic disruption, has moved most of us from\u0014\n   our accustomed place on a continuum where order is on one end\u0014\n   and chaos the other. Against our will we have been shoved away\u0014\n   from a place of predictability and moved further toward real\u0014\n   and perceived uncertainty. We simply don't know what an active\u0014\n   war on terrorism looks like, in a postmodern culture, in a\u0014\n   time of economic recession, nor what impact these forces have\u0014\n   as they converge in the months ahead. Futurists have headed\u0014\n   for deep cover. Suddenly predicting or making assumptions with\u0014\n   confidence is risky business.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The challenge is to lead our organizations to keep moving to\u0014\n   the center on the continuum below. Centering our organizations\u0014\n   doesn't just happen. It takes leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Passive-----------------------X-----------------------Reactive\u0014\n   (Denial)------------------Responsive------------------(Anxious)\u0014\n\u0014\n   Ministries and churches have the opportunity and challenge to\u0014\n   actively synthesize the events of September 11 into our larger\u0014\n   worldview and strategy. Consider this e-mail equipment to help\u0014\n   you address four very practical questions with the leaders\u0014\n   around you. Just 30 minutes spent on each question with key\u0014\n   staff or volunteers will begin to bring the issues into focus.\u0014\n\u0014\n   STRATEGIC QUESTION 1:\u0014\n   What changed for our church or ministry and what didn't?\u0014\n\u0014\n   For Christ followers, September changes nothing in regard to\u0014\n   our beliefs about God and his unchanging character and will.\u0014\n   But related to our beliefs there are other issues, such as,\u0014\n   \"Is there greater urgency in our work?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Sterling Huston, Billy Graham's Director of North American\u0014\n   Ministries said, \"This has raised our sense of urgency. And we\u0014\n   are asking ourselves, 'Is there any way that we can pick up\u0014\n   the pace of our ministry?'\" When a 56-year-old ministry with\u0014\n   an 82-year-old founder feels compelled to pick up the pace in\u0014\n   light of September 11, where should the rest of us be?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Without a doubt we are in a window of time when some people\u0014\n   are searching for and open to transcendent answers to their\u0014\n   deepest questions. Some people have turned toward God, at\u0014\n   least, if not the church. How long this window will remain\u0014\n   open is uncertain. So, what new or different connections are\u0014\n   you planning between your church or organization and this\u0014\n   culture?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Some churches have retooled their preaching and program to\u0014\n   focus on the questions the culture is asking. Full-color\u0014\n   flyers in our mail box speak to their desire to create new\u0014\n   connections with the unchurched. Other churches have changed\u0014\n   little beyond the pastoral prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\n   STRATEGIC QUESTION 2:\u0014\n   What are the assumptions upon which our work and ministry rest?\u0014\n\u0014\n   Do key decision makers in your organization share the same\u0014\n   assumptions about the near and long term future? Only\u0014\n   dialogue will tell you.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Here are some key assumptions to agree upon:\u0014\n   >> The length of time we assume this current environment of\u0014\n      uncertainty and dis-ease will last is...\u0014\n   >> The economic picture will affect our giving this way...\u0014\n   >> The likelihood of more terrorism that will disrupt our\u0014\n      country is...\u0014\n   >> The cultural environment for the next six months/year\u0014\n      will be...\u0014\n   >> The needs of those who are primary recipients of our\u0014\n      ministry will likely change this way...\u0014\n   >> The degree and amount of adjustment in ministry strategy we\u0014\n      need to make to insure we are effective is...\u0014\n   >> This culture's new openness to the Good News of Jesus\u0014\n      Christ will last...\u0014\n\u0014\n   STRATEGIC QUESTION 3:\u0014\n   What two or three future scenarios should we plan for?\u0014\n\u0014\n   In times of uncertainty, strategic planning based on only one\u0014\n   scenario is high risk. Wisdom says to lay plans that will work\u0014\n   in multiple scenarios. Here is a four-step process that\u0014\n   simplifies scenario planning:\u0014\n\u0014\n   1. Agree on two scenarios and put some details to them. Your\u0014\n      assumptions will give you clues. Best-case and worst-case\u0014\n      scenarios are a good place to start.\u0014\n   2. Identify the major initiatives in your ministry in the\u0014\n      coming year.\u0014\n   3. Move initially on the initiatives that work in both\u0014\n      scenarios. Stage the higher-risk initiatives to launch\u0014\n      later as one of the scenarios unfolds.\u0014\n   4. Seek God's guidance as his will is revealed and roll out\u0014\n      those initiatives that match the scenario that is unfolding.\u0014\n\u0014\n   STRATEGIC QUESTION 4:\u0014\n   To what degree should we be on a \"war footing\"?\u0014\n\u0014\n   John Piper suggests, \"In wartime people are alert, armed, and\u0014\n   vigilant. In wartime people spend their money differently than\u0014\n   in peacetime. There's an austerity and simplicity of life, not\u0014\n   because such things are so valuable in themselves, but because\u0014\n   there's something grand about a cause greater than paneling\u0014\n   your den.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   To get at the question of being on a war-footing, discuss: \"If\u0014\n   the frontline is where our lives and organizations intersect\u0014\n   with a post September 11 world, then what are the resources\u0014\n   God is calling us to move there?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   In a time of uncertainty, courageous leadership takes\u0014\n   precedence over effective management. May God help us all in\u0014\n   our efforts to discern the times and know how to respond.\u0014\n\u0014\n   --J. David Schmidt heads J.

    "words": "Let's imagine, for a moment, how the trailers for a movie version of \nLord of the Kings might read: The camera sweeps across the Middle \nEastern countryside, the narrator intones, \"They're young and in \nlove, engaged but not living together. Now she's pregnant, the \nchild's not his, but he won't leave her, and he's there for her when \nthey make a tortuous trip to Bethlehem. But will the unborn child \nsurvive the journey? Where will the couple find shelter in an unknown \ntown? How will the evil King Herod react to the birth of a future \nking? Don't miss the exciting story, now showing in a theater near \nyou, starring Mary, Joseph and Jesus as themselves!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is no easy situation for Joseph, a righteous man, committed to \nplaying by the rules and living by the Law. And what does the ancient \nand honored law of Moses require in such cases? Capital punishment. \nIt's laid out clearly in black and white: You are to stone the woman \nto death, and \"purge the evil from your midst\" (Deuteronomy 22:23-27).\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, by the time of Mary and Joseph, the Law has been \ntoned-down a bit by soft-hearted rabbis. But the penalties for such \nan offense are still severe and humiliating. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo Joseph wrestles with all this, in a personal battle as intense as \nthe fight between the Fellowship and the Orcs in the Mines of Moria. \nComing through his own dark night of the soul, he decides to proceed \nin a more compassionate way. Instead of calling for a stoning or a \npublic humiliation, Joseph decides to be merciful to Mary and divorce \nher quietly.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember this the next time you have a chance to crush someone who \nhas hurt you. Joseph decides to put down the stone of revenge, and \npick up the mantle of compassion.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, he is visited by an angel, who tells him, \"Joseph, son of \nDavid, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child \nconceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and \nyou are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their \nsins\" (vv. 20-21).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the beginning of the epic quest of Jesus the Messiah. He \nclearly has a long way to go, and has many battles to fight, before \nhe will fulfill his divinely-appointed role as the son of King David \nand the Messiah who will deliver the people of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst comes a conflict of kingdoms, one illustrated so clearly in the \nlater visit of the \"three kings\" and their divinely-directed decision \nnot to divulge the location of Jesus to King Herod. This is followed \nby Herod's massacre of the children of Bethlehem, and the escape of \nMary, Joseph and Jesus to Egypt. Upon Herod's death, Jesus and his \nfamily return, but then they are forced to become exiles in their own \nland, making a new home for themselves in what is called \"Galilee of \nthe Gentiles\" (4:15).\u0014\nIt is there that the Lord of the Kings reaches maturity, and begins \nhis world-changing work.\u0014\nOf course, when Jesus is born, he doesn't appear to be destined to \nsave humankind. He looks more like a refugee than a ruler; more like \na common kid than a cosmic king. You simply can't predict the end of \nthe story, any more than you can guess where the Hobbit Frodo will \nend up at the end of Fellowship of the Ring. Appearances can be \ndeceiving.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is only in retrospect that we can see that on the night of his \nbirth, history is in the balance. Will the child survive the harsh \nsurroundings of his birth. Will he survive the wrath of the king. \nWill the wise men rat him out and reveal his location to Herod. Will \nhe be caught in the subsequent bloodbath? \u0014\nThe epic quest continues. Jesus inaugurates the kingdom of God, dies \nas the king of the Jews, rises as a death-conquering divine king, and \nreturns to rule the world forever and ever. God has highly exalted \nhim and given him the name that is above every name, \"so that at the \nname of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and \nunder the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is \nLord, to the glory of God the Father\" (Philippians 2:9-11). Jesus is \nnot just Lord. He's the Lord of every ruler, every power. He's Lord \nof the Kings. But is he also the Lord of our lives? \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the question we must ponder as we celebrate the coming of \nJesus at Christmas. Is this baby of Bethlehem the one and only Lord - \nnot of Rings and not of Kings - but of our everyday earthly existence?\u0014\nIs Jesus our leader on an exciting and truly epic quest toward the \nkingdom of God? Is he our guide in day-to-day decisions. Is he our \nruler when we face truly tempting choices, and our protector when we \nfeel vulnerable and scared? Is he the Lord who inspires our loyalty \nand ignites our enthusiasm, challenging us to fight the good fight of \nfaith and spread the good news of his grace and love?\u0014\nIs he still our infant king, one who asks for our help? Will we \nprotect and preserve his place in the world, just as Mary and Joseph \nworked to save him from danger and death? \u0014\n\u0014\nIs he our leader, our guide, our ruler, our Lord and our king? Is he \nthe one we look to when we need some rock-solid assurance that God is \ntruly with us? \u0014\nIf so, feel free to enjoy Frodo and Gandalf and Galadrial, wonderful \nfantasy characters brought to life in the Lord of the Rings.\u0014\nBut when you walk out of the theater and into the world, you'll know \nyour true Lord and true king.\u0014",

    "words": "The Christmas story begins in darkness. There was the darkness of\u0014\noppression, for God's people were a conquered people. They were a \nbeaten and a defeated people. There was the darkness of persecution. \nIndeed, it was a despised universal taxation that brought the \nparticipants in the story\u0014\ntogether on that fateful night. There was the darkness of \ndisillusionment.\u0014\nThere was an ever-increasing number who felt that violence, not \nfaith, was\u0014\nthe most effective path. Yes, on that first Christmas, the mood was \none of\u0014\ndespair and resignation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd thus it was then and thus it is now. We too live in a world of \ndarkness.\u0014\nThere are wars and rumors of wars, hunger and unemployment, racism,\u0014\nloneliness, and a sense of emptiness. Perhaps the poet Robert Frost \nworded\u0014\nit best when he wrote: I have been acquainted with the night. I have \nwalked\u0014\nin the rain and out of the rain. I have been acquainted with the \nnight. I\u0014\ndon't have to tell any of you about the darkness, because in one form \nor\u0014\nanother, at one time or another, it has touched the life of each \nperson\u0014\nhere. You have been acquainted with the night. Thus, we do not come \nhere\u0014\nthis evening to naively deny the existence of the darkness. Nowhere in\u0014\nscripture do we receive a prep talk and an argument that things aren't\u0014\nreally as bad as they seem. Rather, it affirms that the darkness is \nreal and\u0014\nit is present.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, it also affirms that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. \nThe\u0014\nprophet Isaiah wrote, people who walk in darkness have seen a great \nlight.\u0014\nJohns Gospel records: The light shines in the darkness and the \ndarkness has\u0014\nnot overcome it. Thus, we come together to sing again the words: Yet, \nin thy\u0014\ndark street shineth the everlasting light.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory records for us an interesting footnote. It was during the dark\u0014\nwinter of 1864. At Petersburg, Virginia, the Confederate army of \nRobert E.\u0014\nLee faced the Union divisions of General Ulysses S. Grant. The war \nwas now\u0014\nthree and a half years old and the glorious charge had long since \ngiven way\u0014\nto the muck and mud of trench warfare. Late one evening one of Lee's\u0014\ngenerals, Major General George Pickett, received word that his wife \nhad\u0014\ngiven birth to a beautiful baby boy. Up and down the line the \nSoutherns\u0014\nbegan building huge bonfires in celebration of the event. These fires \ndid\u0014\nnot go unnoticed in the Northern camps and soon a nervous Grant sent \nout a\u0014\nreconnaissance patrol to see what was going on....\u0014",

With the kind of turmoil King was creating and the general \nupheaval\u0014\nthat was being witnessed from courthouse squares to college campuses, \nit\u0014\ndoesn't require much imagination to envision a scenario wherein King \nwould\u0014\nbe gunned down. King noted on that very night that the \"... nation is \nsick.\u0014\nTrouble is in the land. Confusion all around.\" Others are equally \ncertain\u0014\nthat King did not have a premonition about his own death. John \nCartwright,\u0014\nwho holds the professorship at Boston University which bears King's \nname,\u0014\nbelieves that King was not predicting his own death. Rather, \naccording to\u0014\nCartwright, Dr. King was only aware that the arc of justice is long \nand that\u0014\nsignificant changes only happen over an extended period of time. In \nother\u0014\nwords, King knew that his words might articulate the dream, but the \nreality\u0014\nof the dream might not be experienced until generations later.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have debated the same issue with Jesus. Did Jesus know he was \ngoing to\u0014\ndie? Did God send Jesus to earth to die? Or, as events evolved and \npressure\u0014\nmounted, did it then become evident to Jesus that his faithfulness to \nGod\u0014\nmay bring about his own death? There are those who believe that \nBethlehem\u0014\nand Calvary were interwoven into Jesus' life from the beginning. When \nJohn\u0014\nthe Baptist declared that Jesus was the Lamb of God, it sounded like \nJesus'\u0014\ncrucifixion was certain from the outset. In a culture that sacrificed \nlambs\u0014\ntwice a day in the temple, those words are a kiss of death. \"Here is \nthe\u0014\nLamb of God\" can be loosely understood to mean, \"Hey, look here, \neveryone,\u0014\nhere's the one that is going to be sacrificed.\" This Lamb of God \nimagery\u0014\nsays something very different from \"light of the world\" or \"bread of \nlife\"\u0014\nimagery. Jesus as the light of the world illumines and brings warmth. \nJesus\u0014\nas the bread of life satisfies our deepest spiritual and physical \nhunger.\u0014\nJesus as the Lamb of God speaks of one who was on his way to the \ncross.\u0014",

The words were made famous by Todd Beamer, a passenger on \nFlight 93.\u0014\nBeamer, a 32-year-old businessman, Sunday school teacher, husband, \nfather\u0014\nand hero, led other passengers in fighting terrorists for control of \nFlight\u0014\n93 before it crashed into a field in western Pennsylvania. He was \noverheard\u0014\non a cellular phone reciting the Lord's Prayer and saying \"Let's \nroll!\" as\u0014\npassengers charged the terrorists.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"'Let's roll!' has served as a rallying cry for this nation as we go \nforward in our war on terrorism,\" said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. \nJohn P. Jumper. \"We are proud to display this new\u0014\nnose art on our aircraft.\" The passengers of Flight 93 won one of the \nfirst\u0014\nvictories in the fight against terrorism. There has been much \nspeculation\u0014\nabout the terrorists' intentions for Flight 93, but it is widely \nbelieved\u0014\nthat either the White House or the U.S. Capitol building was the \nintended\u0014\ntarget. The nose art design depicts an eagle soaring in front of the \nU.S.\u0014\nflag, with the words \"Spirit of 9-11\" on the top and \"Let's roll!\" on \nthe\u0014\nbottom. The design was created by Senior Airman Duane White, a \njourneyman\u0014\nfrom Air Combat Command's multimedia center at Langley Air Force \nBase, Va.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Thunderbirds and other Air Force demonstration teams will apply \nthis\u0014\nnose art on all aircraft, while major commands and wings will be \nauthorized\u0014\nto apply the nose art to one aircraft of their choice. For thousands \nof\u0014\nyears, warriors, such as the Vikings, Zulus, Native Americans, \nsamurai and\u0014\nmany others, have followed a tradition of decorating their \ninstruments of\u0014\nwar. These instruments could include the warriors or their weapons. \nThe Air\u0014\nForce has used nose art throughout much of its history, and for a \nvariety of\u0014\nreasons. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"Let's roll!\" nose art is being used to continue the remembrance \nof the events of \u0014\nSept. 11, spur on the nation's current patriotic spirit and pay \ntribute to the heroes \u0014\nand victims in the war against terrorism. It is anticipated that the \nart will start to appear on\u0014\nAir Force aircraft around Jan. 15.\u0014",

Miller introduces the \nLincoln as he lived and breathe and Lincoln lived and\u0014\n                     breathe politics. Lincoln's practice of politics \nis familiar to us because it was partisan,\u0014\n                     compromising as well as searching for consenus \nand individual distinction.\u0014\n                     Lincoln the politician seems commmon, it is his \nethical quality on the rub of a matter which is\u0014\n                     outstanding. For Lincoln there was more to \npoltics than winning elections. There were larger\u0014\n                     issues of life to be effected by law and \npolitics. Miller points out Lincoln achieved his moral\u0014\n                     basis from no individual but from the reading of \nbooks such as the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress,\u0014\n                     biographies of Washington and Shakespeare.\u0014\n                     Miller indicates that in Lincoln's early \npolitical career the larger issue was the rise of the\u0014\n                     common man which Lincoln believed was best \nachieved by Henry Clay's Whig policies.\u0014\n                     Post-1854 Lincoln's moral issue was slavery. \nLincoln recognized slavery was a moral issue\u0014\n                     and to present it politcally as a moral issue \nand not allow it to be presented as an economic\u0014\n                     issue clouded by the prejudice of the day as \nLincoln's great political rival Douglas presented\u0014\n                     the slavery issue.\u0014\n                     Miller presents Lincoln's strength of mind and \nin particular its ability to study and think an\u0014\n                     issue. His clear judgment balanced by a sincere \nsensitivity. This was best explained by\u0014\n                     Leonard Swett in the footnotes on p490 of \nMiller's book.\u0014\n                     The best part of the book was the \nStanton-Lincoln relationship on pp 410-426. Stanton\u0014\n                     began with disdain of Linclon but in working \nwith Lincoln in the Civil War Stanton grew to\u0014\n                     respect Lincoln and be astonished by Lincoln's \nwork. Miller points out the lack of\u0014\n                     vindictiveness in Lincoln and contrasts that \nwith 20th century American Presidents. The\u0014\n                     ethical biography of Lincoln shows the gift to \nthe Amercian people the Presidency of\u0014\n                     Abraham Lincoln was at our most crucial time.\u0014\n                     This excellent and fresh biography of Lincoln \nshows he transcended his times and was a\u0014\n                     product of his times. He was a great man whose \nexample gives us hope that an ethical\u0014\n                     politician is not and should not be an oxymoron.\u0014",

A small army of media\u0014\n                  personalities gathered early that day, along with \nBrownell Combs, who had masterminded                        the \nsyndication of Slew a year earlier--all awaiting the precious cargo \nthat would put     \u0014\n                  Spendthrift at  the top of the list of commercial \nbreeding farms. The van backed carefully to the                   \nopen cargo  door of the plane, and the champ walked determinedly down \nthe ramp. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  An extraordinary campaign had ended, and an equally \nextraordinary one was about to begin.\u0014\n                  His life and mine were now changed forever. Just a \nmere three years earlier, I had been\u0014\n                  managing a small breeding farm in Maryland, and now \nI was responsible for the care of a                          Triple \nCrown winner. Heavy stuff. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The Taylors and Hills had sold half-interest in the \nthree-time champion. To say Slew seasons\u0014\n                  and shares were in great demand is an \nunderstatement of the highest magnitude. For the\u0014\n                  owners to resist the temptation of cashing in \ncompletely is a tribute to their faith in \nthe                                  stallion's potential. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Like all good horses I've been around, Slew was \nvery intelligent. He had a magnificent eye                         \nthat conveyed that intelligence. He was no \"lady's hunter,\" and you \nhad to be on your toes     \u0014\n                  when in the stall with him, or bringing him up from \nhis paddock. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Because Slew had been so professional in all he \nexperienced as an athlete, we had every\u0014\n                  confidence this bull of a horse would take to his \nnew task with ease. The test mare was\u0014\n                  receptive, and our crew was ready with everything \nnecessary to make this big moment go\u0014\n                  safely and smoothly. After more than an hour of his \nseeming disinterest in the matters at                            \nhand,  we put the world-record syndication back in his stall as a \n\"non-starter.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                  I vividly remember calling Mickey Taylor and \nsaying, \"Mick, we have a little problem.\" As time\u0014\n                  passed, we found Slew took a fancy to certain \ncolors of mares. We would bring in one of that\u0014\n                  color in to get his attention, and when he nickered \nto her, we would swing his scheduled                             \nmare  under him for the successful cover. He would be mad as fire as \nhe dismounted,    \u0014\n                  knowing we had outsmarted him. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Sometimes he would not be interested in any mare in \nthe breeding shed, but willingly would\u0014\n                  breed her on a grassy spot next to the shed. We \nwould breed him in the snow or rain if that\u0014\n                  was what he wanted. After all, he was Slew and we \nhad to accommodate his book of mares,\u0014\n                  no matter what it took. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  The great racehorse was as formidable in the \nbreeding shed as he was in competition; his\u0014\n                  pregnancy rate was over 90% the first year. This \nwas when broodmare management did not\u0014\n                  have the advantages of ultrasound technology, and \nother such aids as are available today.\u0014\n                  Slew was deadly with his mares. \u0014\n                  He sired four grade I stakes winners including two \nchampions in his initial crop. The die was\u0014\n                  cast. Other than the great Northern Dancer, no \nother stallion was in more demand than was\u0014\n                  Slew after his first foals began racing. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  Oh, yes, Slew finally became bored with trying our \ncollective patience.

    "title": "LOTTIE MOON  IN  HER OWN WORDS",
    "words": "In a day when Baptists differ on everything from ordination of women \nto chaplaincy\u0014\n endorsement to requiring missionaries to sign the 2000 Baptist Faith \nand Message, one of\u0014\n the few things they can agree on is their love for the champion of \nmodern missions, Lottie\u0014\n Moon. Precise, feisty, witty and a bit devilish, she is the hero of \nBaptist women everywhere\u0014\n and the standard by which all missionaries -- male and female alike \n-- can measure their\u0014\n commitment and methodology.\u0014\n\u0014\n While much has been written about the life of Lottie Moon, for the \nfirst time her own\u0014\n reflections about her lifework in China are available in a \ncollection of personal letters that\u0014\n shed light on the great cost of missions at the turn of the 20th \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\n In Send the Light: Letters from Lottie Moon, church history \nprofessor Keith Harper has\u0014\n compiled 300 pieces of correspondence that are representative of \nLottie's thought and\u0014\n spiritual odyssey from 1870 to 1912. Taking its title from the \nwell-known missionary hymn, the\u0014\n book traces her journey from extreme personal loneliness and pity \nfor the \"heathen\u0014\n Chinamen\" to a state of contentment where she felt great empathy for \nher friends, adopting\u0014\n their homeland as her own.\u0014\n\u0014\n The letters are divided into four sections, with each section's \ntitle referring to the first line of a\u0014\n verse from \"Send the Light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The first section contains letters to H.A. Tupper, corresponding \nsecretary of the Foreign\u0014\n Mission Board. Because he was a personal friend first, Lottie \ncandidly expressed to him her\u0014\n feelings -- positive and negative -- about the Southern Baptist \nConvention, China and\u0014\n missionary life.\u0014\n\u0014\n In the second grouping are informational articles Lottie wrote for \nThe Foreign Mission\u0014\n Journal, many of which were published in Virginia Baptists' \nReligious Herald. Those entries\u0014\n told women about China and how the country needed female \nmissionaries on the field and\u0014\n women's groups in America to support them.\u0014\n\u0014\n In the third division are letters Lottie wrote to Tupper's \nsuccessor, R.J. Willingham. In her\u0014\n typical articulate, detailed writing style, although much less \npersonal than her writings to\u0014\n Tupper, she pled for missionary recruitment by the FMB.\u0014\n\u0014\n In the last group of letters, Lottie describes to family members and \nfriends her daily routine,\u0014\n her tender feelings for the Chinese people, and her love of \nadventure and travel.\u0014\n\u0014\n Readers can detect from the letters those characteristics that \nelevate Lottie Moon to \"saint\"\u0014\n status. She was the advocate of many mission causes, the earliest of \nwhich was seeking the\u0014\n right of women to use their God-given gifts -- whatever they may be.\u0014\n\u0014\n Although she did not announce her call to missions until 1873, \nLottie had felt a leaning in that\u0014\n direction since college when she made her profession of faith and \ncame under the influence\u0014\n of pastor John A. Broadus' teachings and challenge to ministry and \nmission.\u0014\n\u0014\n Having been reared in a Southern family whose women received a good \neducation and\u0014\n pursued non-traditional careers -- she was one of only a few \nSouthern female\u0014\n contemporaries to obtain a masters degree, and her sister was one of \nthe first two female\u0014\n physicians in the South -- Lottie would not be content as a \nmissionary teacher, the only role\u0014\n available to female missionaries of her day.\u0014\n\u0014\n Feeling lonely and unfulfilled in her early service as a teacher, \nand abandoned by the FMB,\u0014\n she considered marriage to Crawford Toy (with whom she communicated \nfor many years).\u0014\n Rather she decided to remain single and follow her calling to be a \nchurch planter and\u0014\n evangelist, and petitioned for the right of other women to follow \ntheir heart's leading as well.\u0014\n Her field supervisor opposed her new roles, but no men were \navailable for the tasks.\u0014\n\u0014\n As Lottie trained local pastors, the number of converts grew \nrapidly. She also mentored other\u0014\n missionaries who later came to China and led mission stations after \nmale missionaries left or\u0014\n became ill. She gained the respect of Tupper who consulted her \nrepeatedly for wise counsel.\u0014\n He considered Lottie a full partner in decision making on the field, \nanother cause for which\u0014\n she crusaded. (She once offered her resignation when the FMB leaned \ntoward denying the\u0014\n vote to women in its mission when the local Chinese mission gave \nwomen full voice.)\u0014\n\u0014\n During her career Lottie Moon successfully fought for numerous other \ncauses, not the least\u0014\n of which was constant bombardment of the FMB with requests for \nmissionary recruits. She\u0014\n also secured board policy for missionary furloughs every 10 years -- \nshe stayed on the field\u0014\n 14 years before taking a furlough -- and two-year language schools \nat the beginning of\u0014\n missionary appointment -- she learned on the field from locals. In \naddition, she led the\u0014\n crusade for a regular missions offering and an SBC women's missions \norganization.\u0014\n\u0014\n Although an outspoken fighter for progressive mission policy, Lottie \nMoon's contribution to\u0014\n mission methodology cannot be overlooked. Early on she adopted the \nnative culture and\u0014\n style, taking care to win the respect of the people first before \nwitnessing to them.\u0014\n\u0014\n She knew the importance of the human touch, so maintained constant \ncontact with the\u0014\n Chinese people, even during a smallpox epidemic and periods of \nfamine and war. She met\u0014\n physical needs while sharing the gospel, often caring for indigent \nand ill guests in her home\u0014\n with her own funds. During wartime she intervened when converts were \npersecuted -- even\u0014\n facing possible death herself -- and ministered in hospitals and \ndirected the work of male\u0014\n missionaries who fled.\u0014\n\u0014\n Lottie always put the needs of others first. Even when she received \nword that her sister\u0014\n Edmonia had taken her life, Lottie continued her work uninterrupted \nand grieved alone. And\u0014\n when the FMB could not pay for new missionaries, Lottie used \nEdmonia's annuity to help\u0014\n cover the cost.\u0014\n\u0014\n Lottie lived like those she served, even suffering malnutrition as \nthey did during severe\u0014\n famine. Having given much of her own food to feed starving \nneighbors, the patron saint of\u0014\n Southern Baptist missions eventually died while enroute to America, \nthe words of \"Jesus\u0014\n Loves Me\" on her lips.\u0014\n\u0014\n She left a legacy that Baptists have long cherished. And, \nfortunately, she also left\u0014\n hand-written letters that give insight into the life and ministry of \na truly remarkable woman.\u0014",

    "title": "LUCREZIA BORGIA:INCESTUOUS, MURDEROUS--MISUNDERSTOOD?",
    "words": "Lucrezia Borgia: Incestuous, Murderous--Misunderstood? \u0014\n\u0014\nLucrezia Borgia (1480-1519) is one of history's most maligned and \nmisunderstood women. Her reputation for murder and incest has grown \nover the centuries, perpetuated by a Victor Hugo drama and a Gaetano \nDonizetti opera. The truth is that she was innocent, a mere pawn in \nthe powerful Borgia family's political maneuvering. \u0014\n\u0014\nLucrezia was the illegitimate daughter of Pope Alexander VI, who \npurchased the papacy and sought to strengthen his political \nconnections by marrying off his beautiful daughter. Lucrezia was \nwed--at 13--to Giovanni Sforza, a wealthy Milanese whom Alexander \nneeded as an ally. However, Alexander quickly annulled the marriage \nin order to marry her off to another, more powerful ally, and in \nretaliation the outraged Sforza accused him of incest with his \ndaughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nStashed in a convent until the next marriage, Lucrezia had an affair \nwith a young chamberlain named Perroto and at 16 bore him a son, \nGiovanni. Her brother Cesare (1476-1507) killed Perroto and hid the \nchild until, for political reasons, he needed to produce an heir for \nthe Duchy of Nepi. Thus grew rumors that Lucrezia had had a child \nwith her brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1498, she married Alfonso, Duke of Biscegli. Lucrezia loved him, \nbut Cesare had him strangled to permit yet another, more advantageous \nmarriage. Despite no evidence, and notwithstanding her brother's \nmurderous habits, stories began to circulate that Lucrezia had killed \nher husband. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1501, Lucrezia married Alfonso d'Este, whose wealth and position \nfinally satisfied her ruthless relatives. Free of their plotting and \nscheming, Lucrezia blossomed, and created one of the most brilliant \ncourts of the Renaissance. There she enjoyed fame for her beauty, \npiety, and love of the arts. Lucrezia's happy marriage lasted 18 \nyears, until she died from complications following the birth of her \nfifth child. It is one of history's unfair quirks that her reputation \nhas been forever ruined by cruel rumors.\u0014",

    "words": "Life's Grand Design \u0014\n                     A new breed of anti-evolutionists credits it to \nan unnamed\u0014\n                     intelligence\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     By Holly J. Morris    \u0014\n\u0014\n                     Two people come to your door with a petition to \ngive evolution some competition in the\u0014\n                     science classroom. One is a biblical literalist \nwho wants genetics out and Genesis in. The\u0014\n                     other is a science professor with exquisite \nacademic credentials, championing a \u0014\n                     compelling\u0014\n                     theory called intelligent design. He speaks in \npainful detail about the bacterial flagellum,\u0014\n                     whatever that is. Though many may prefer \nold-style creationism, nowadays the scientist in\u0014\n                     the suit is getting the most signatures.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     These new anti-evolutionists say life's \nmechanisms--like the flagellum, a propellerlike\u0014\n                     appendage powered by a complex rotary engine \nthat's found in some of Earth's simplest\u0014\n                     life forms--are too improbably perfect to have \nformed by chancy Darwinian evolution alone.\u0014\n                     The flagellum, as surely as a pop-top on a Coke \ncan, was designed by some unnamed\u0014\n                     intelligence that might--or might not--be God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Classroom time. That's good enough for those \nitching to get God into science class. Efforts\u0014\n                     to force the teaching of Bible-based \"creation \nscience\" petered out in the 1980s, after\u0014\n                     several court rulings that deemed it \nunconstitutional. But educators from state boards to\u0014\n                     individual classrooms are more open to \nintelligent design, increasingly seeing it as a viable\u0014\n                     scientific theory to be taught side by side with \nevolution. In Ohio, for example, the board of\u0014\n                     education's curricular standards committee \nobjected to a draft of new statewide science\u0014\n                     standards this year because it didn't mention \nintelligent design. Mainstream scientists, \u0014\n                     while\u0014\n                     fuming about giving ID equal time, end up giving \nit just that by rebutting it in public debates,\u0014\n                     books, and the press. They have to--ID's \narguments are not only engaging but also well\u0014\n                     beyond the average American's knowledge of \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Not all of its proponents are motivated by \nreligion--many say they are frustrated by what\u0014\n                     they see as intractable problems with Darwinism. \nBut conservative Christianity has\u0014\n                     embraced the idea, seeing it as a viable way to \nintroduce religion into the classroom--and\u0014\n                     sunder materialism in the process. (Not the kind \nof materialism that results in impractical\u0014\n                     shoes but the philosophical backbone of science: \nthat everything can be explained through\u0014\n                     natural laws and physical phenomena). \"There's a \nrenewed vigor in the movement,\" says\u0014\n                     philosopher Robert Pennock, editor of the recent \ntome Intelligent Design Creationism and \u0014\n                     Its Critics. \"They feel optimistic somehow that \nthis time they're going to get it right.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Part of ID's attraction is its intuitive \nquality. Countless people already have a sense that life\u0014\n                     is too complex to have just happened. And though \nID meshes comfortably with religion, its\u0014\n                     seemingly undogmatic approach appeals to a vast \nmiddle ground. \"Some people try to give\u0014\n                     the impression that if you do not believe in \nDarwinism, you are a young-Earth creationist\u0014\n                     who believes the world was made in a puff of \nsmoke 6,000 years ago,\" says Michael\u0014\n                     Behe, a pro-ID biochemistry professor at Lehigh \nUniversity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Nor is it difficult to play off the unease many \nfeel in the face of evolution. The ID movement\u0014\n                     loves to quote the few scientists who have \npublicly equated evolution and atheism, like\u0014\n                     bestselling author Richard Dawkins (who \nannounced that Darwin \"made it possible to be\u0014\n                     an intellectually fulfilled atheist\"). And \nDarwinism can evoke a pointless, amoral world in\u0014\n                     which humans are just so many animals scrabbling \nfor survival. ID seems more\u0014\n                     comforting:\u0014\n                     \"It plays to our own egos,\" says Kenneth Miller, \na biology professor at Brown University,\u0014\n                     who argues that the self-renewing, \nself-correcting process of evolution is more in line with\u0014\n                     Christian teachings. \"Many people would prefer \nto think they are the direct products of a\u0014\n                     benign, beneficent creator.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     At bottom, ID is a pretty simple concept. \nSomewhere, somehow, something intervened in\u0014\n                     evolution. Most proponents won't specify the \ndesigning force (at least, not publicly)--it\u0014\n                     could be God, aliens, or time travelers. There's \nno consensus on the rest. Some believe\u0014\n                     that evolution works up to a point. Behe doesn't \ndoubt that humans and apes evolved from\u0014\n                     a common ancestor, but he thinks Darwin's \nmechanism can't account for the complex\u0014\n                     molecules that make life tick. Others advocate \nthe notion of an invisible hand guiding all of\u0014\n                     life's history, from primordial soup to human \nbeings.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The idea is argued at just as many levels. \nHighly specialized critters like the bombardier\u0014\n                     beetle, which squirts a scalding mixture of \nhydrochloric acid and quinone at its enemies,\u0014\n                     have been used as evidence of a designer since \nDarwin's day. How, one ID argument\u0014\n                     goes, could such an apparatus evolve bit by bit \nin a series of mutations, when half a sac\u0014\n                     of acid means a dead bug? Behe sees the same \nkind of \"irreducible complexity\" in the\u0014\n                     microscopic workings of the flagellum and the \neye. Try using the fossil record, he says, to\u0014\n                     explain the 11-cis-retinal molecule, which \nreacts with light to set off the biochemical\u0014\n                     process that produces vision, or the intricate \ncellular architecture of the retina. Remove\u0014\n                     any component and the whole structure fails.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Don't ask. Opponents retort that such theories \naren't science and stifle further inquiry by\u0014\n                     attributing what may not yet be understood to an \nunknowable cause. \"Their arguments\u0014\n                     don't lead to anything that's empirically \ninvestigable,\" says Jack Krebs, a Kansas science\u0014\n                     teacher who opposed the introduction of ID into \nthe state's science curriculum early last\u0014\n                     year. Scientists, meanwhile, say they are \nlearning more and more about how evolution\u0014\n                     could have fashioned even the most bafflingly \ncomplex structures (story, Page 42).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     ID proponents say both sides belong in the \nclassroom as competing scientific theories\u0014\n                     (although they often call Darwinism a religion \nin its own right). Support for ID in schools has\u0014\n                     boiled up at the state level in Michigan, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, Nebraska, and Kansas. In\u0014\n                     March, Ohio's board of education invited four \nscientists, two pro-ID, two against, to a\u0014\n                     debate. \"Teach the controversy,\" said the \nproponents, suggesting that, while the\u0014\n                     standards need not explicitly mandate \nintelligent design, they should require that alternate\u0014\n                     theories be presented.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The pro-ID speakers also pointed out mistakes in \nbiology texts, such as an inaccurate\u0014\n                     illustration showing similarities among many \nspecies' embryos (since removed from the\u0014\n                     book in question), and expounded on theories \nlike Behe's. Stephen Meyer of the Discovery\u0014\n                     Institute, a conservative Seattle think tank, \nposited that ID was being censored because it\u0014\n                     doesn't fit the dominant scientific paradigm. \n\"There are many scientific methods,\" he said.\u0014\n                     \"Theirs is restricted to naturalistic \narguments.\" He also appealed to common sense:\u0014\n                     \"Organisms look designed because they were.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Not so, said the pro-evolution scientists, who \ndescribed how a complex molecule could\u0014\n                     evolve and why naturalism allows us to explore \nthe universe without preconceptions.\u0014\n                     Brown's Miller also addressed what many saw as \nthe core issue. \"Evolution is not\u0014\n                     anti-God,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     So far, ID has not won what would be its first \nsignificant victory: a place in the Ohio\u0014\n                     curriculum. A new draft of the science standards \nstill does not mention ID. (Local schools\u0014\n                     can choose to include ID if they wish, but they \nmust teach evolution.) But the controversy\u0014\n                     isn't over. The state board of education will \nvote on the standards in the fall. And a June\u0014\n                     Cleveland Plain Dealer poll found that 59 \npercent of Ohioans support teaching both\u0014\n                     intelligent design and evolution. Two thirds \nbelieve that the \"designer\" is God.\u0014",

    "title": "LEASERSHIP STYLES: PART TWO",
    "words": "Leadership Styles: Part Two\u0014\n\u0014\nJeff Woods\u0014\n08-30-02 \u0014\n\u0014\nLast month, I described four leadership styles that emphasized \ncontrol over empowerment. This month, I describe five more styles of \nleadership, all of which emphasize empowerment over control.\u0014\nIn the pacesetting style of leadership, the leader displays \nexcellence through his or her own archetypal behavior. The leaders \n\"sets the page\" for others to follow by defining excellence. The \nleaders often chooses to perform similar tasks as the res tof the \ngroup members and seeks to model the ways that the tasks should be \nperformed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis style does not offer the level of contact with group members \nthat some of the other empowering styles do, but this leader \ncertainly exhibits more permission-giving behavior than the despotic, \npervasive, proscriptive and normative leaders described last month. \nThese leaders act as deans within an academy of experts. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe difficulty with this model lies in disseminating the leaders \nbehaviors to other members of the organization. This model can also \nbe destroyed with a single lapse of integrity by the leader. Because \nrules are also more easily established than character, this style is \nslow to implement.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany are familiar with the democratic style of leadership in which \nthe leader maintains the mantra majority rules. This style of \nleadership promotes a sense of justice for those inside and outside \nthe organization, and thus, is the most easily implemented. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts limitations are found in its inability to assign import to \ndifferent ideas or inputs. Thus, these leaders quickly discover that \ncrowds, easily influenced by one leader one day, are just as easily \ninfluenced by another the following dayespecially those who use \nmethods of subterfuge. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo the extent that each individual accepts an appropriate level of \nresponsibility for his or her involvement within the organization, \nthis leaders style will be effective.\u0014\n\u0014\nCoaching is another style of leadership in which the leader serves \nthe needs of immediate subordinates or group members. These leaders \nusually encourage entrepreneurial activity. \u0014\nSuch encouraging, however, usually pushes the limits of the leaders \navailable time as well as the available resources within the \norganization. Neither loners nor traditionalists make good coaches. \nThis styles effectiveness is based on the leaders ability to \ninspire and motivate others and garner additional resources to meet \nthe needs of the mentored.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the consensus-building style, the leader grants veto power over \nnew ideas to every member of the group. This style is effective to \nthe extent that the leader can instill a sense of team commitment to \ngoals greater than the sum of individual capabilities. Otherwise, the \nleast common denominator is prone to mediocrity. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne strong benefit is that it builds ownership of decisions, allowing \neasier implementation of agreed-upon ideas. In implementing this \nstyle, people often underestimate the power of peer pressure within \nthe system created by the leader, and thus they are resistant to the \nleaders style during the early stages.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the humanitarian style of leadership, peoples needs are paramount \nto the organizations tasks. Individuals idiosyncrasies are allowed \nto take precedent over performance issues. The leader allows the \nbrilliance as well as the incompetencies of individuals to flourish \nbeyond any previously defined norms or expectations. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile building loyalty within the organization, it also creates a \nchaotic culture which many may find disturbing. This style often \nleads to conflicts between current practices and the history of the \norganization, unless the leader heads a start-up group or \norganization. \u0014\n\u0014\nJeff Woods is executive minister for the American Baptist Churches of \nOhio.\u0014",

He told supervisor Lisa\u0014\nJefferson about the hijacking. The passengers\u0014\nwere planning to jump the terrorists, he said.\u0014\nAnd then he asked her to pray with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Newsweek relates .\u0014\n\"Beamer kept a Lord's Prayer bookmark in his\u0014\nTom Clancy novel, but he didn't need any\u0014\nprompting.

Let's roll.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe now know from the cockpit voice recorder\u0014\nthat Beamer and other passengers wrestled with\u0014\nthe hijackers and forced the plane to crash into\u0014\nthe ground, killing themselves but foiling what\u0014\nwas believed to have been the hijackers' plan to\u0014\nfly Flight 93 into the Capitol or the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Christians, we know that God can bring good\u0014\nout of evil. In Todd Beamer, the world witnesses\u0014\na faith that held up in the extremity of fear.\u0014\nA faith that is even now comforting his widow\u0014\nand two young sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nLisa Beamer told NBC's Dateline,\u0014\n\"You know, in the Lord's Prayer, it asks us\u0014\nto forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who\u0014\ntrespass against us.\" \"As Todd prayed this prayer\u0014\nin the last moments of his life, in a way,\" Lisa said,\u0014\n\"He was forgiving those people for what they were\u0014\ndoing, the most horrible thing you could ever do\u0014\nto someone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't Todd Beamer's job to fight terrorists.\u0014\nHe was just a passenger, who along with several\u0014\nothers, did what he didn't have to do but foiled a\u0014\nterrible evil that might have been done to his country.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Flight 93 hurdled towards destruction,\u0014\nTodd Beamer could not have known that his\u0014\nquiet prayers would ultimately be heard by\u0014\nmillions .. that the story of his last acts on\u0014\nearth would be a witness to the Lord he loved\u0014\nand served and a lasting example of true heroism.\u0014",

    "title": "LEADERSHIP STYLES - I",
    "words": "WHAT'S YOUR LEADERSHIP STYLE? (PART 1)\u0014\n   by Bill Hybels\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few years ago, I began to notice major differences in the\u0014\n   ways gifted leaders led their teams. They all had the\u0014\n   spiritual gift of leadership referred to in Romans 12:8, but\u0014\n   they approached the challenges of leadership differently.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   About the time I was making this observation, the management\u0014\n   team at Willow Creek gave me a leadership book for my\u0014\n   birthday. (The year before, they had hired an Elvis\u0014\n   impersonator, who burst into my office during a meeting to\u0014\n   serenade me. Elvis discovered my leadership style in a hurry.\u0014\n   He barely made it out of my office with his blue suede shoes.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   This year they gave me a more appropriate gift -- Certain\u0014\n   Trumpets, by Garry Wills. Wills describes the enormous impact\u0014\n   of great leaders whose particular leadership style meshed\u0014\n   perfectly with a certain need in society.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   For example, when people are being oppressed and want to break\u0014\n   free from that yoke, the situation calls for a radical,\u0014\n   transforming leader.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   In a complex, pluralistic democracy, with thousands of\u0014\n   constituencies that must be drawn together to form a\u0014\n   government, a political or electoral leader is necessary. In\u0014\n   war time, a military style of leadership works best.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   During an ideologically intense social struggle, an\u0014\n   intellectual leader might fit the bill. Wills effectively\u0014\n   argues that there are many different styles of leadership, and\u0014\n   certain styles fit certain leadership needs better than\u0014\n   others.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Over the last few years, I've identified at least ten\u0014\n   manifestations of the leadership gift as it plays out in the\u0014\n   church. It's been helpful to our staff to identify our\u0014\n   leadership styles and build leadership teams accordingly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   VISIONARY LEADER\u0014\n   These leaders have a crystal-clear picture in their minds of\u0014\n   what they want to happen. They cast visions powerfully and\u0014\n   possess indefatigable enthusiasm to pursue the mission.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Visionaries shamelessly appeal to anyone and everyone to get\u0014\n   on board with the vision. They talk about it, write about it,\u0014\n   burn white-hot for it. They are future-oriented, usually\u0014\n   idealistic, and full of faith to believe the vision can and\u0014\n   will be actualized if the dream is talked about and cast often\u0014\n   enough.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Visionary leaders are not easily discouraged or deterred. In\u0014\n   fact, if people tell them their dream is impossible, that just\u0014\n   adds fuel to the fire in their spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Visionary leaders may or may not be able to form teams, align\u0014\n   talents, set goals, or manage progress toward the achievement\u0014\n   of the vision. But this one thing is sure: They carry the\u0014\n   vision. They cast the vision. They draw people into the\u0014\n   vision, and they'll die trying to see it fulfilled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   I was at a conference with John Maxwell some time back. John\u0014\n   was teaching on vision, and he started his talk on one side of\u0014\n   the sanctuary to symbolize the beginning of the vision.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"You have no money, you have no people, you have no faith, but\u0014\n   you have the vision. So you put one foot in front of the\u0014\n   other, and you walk, by the light of the vision....\" He began\u0014\n   to walk across the stage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"Then, along the way, as you share that vision, God gives you\u0014\n   the faith, the power, the people, the resources....\"\u0014\n   Everyone's eyes were riveted on John as he made this vision\u0014\n   walk. But there was a planter between where he was and where\u0014\n   he was headed. Inside, I'm screaming, Watch out for the\u0014\n   planter! John never saw it. He ran into it and stumbled -- but\u0014\n   the vision was so powerful that he never stopped speaking,\u0014\n   never lost his train of thought. I was looking around the\u0014\n   crowd, and no one else even seemed to notice!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   You know a person is a visionary leader when he trips on the\u0014\n   stage and no one even acknowledges it! It was a picture of the\u0014\n   leader who cannot help but pour out the vision, despite any\u0014\n   obstacle.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   DIRECTIONAL LEADER\u0014\n   This style doesn't get much press, but it is exceedingly\u0014\n   important. The directional leader has the uncanny, God-given\u0014\n   ability to choose the right path at those critical\u0014\n   intersections where an organization starts asking hard\u0014\n   questions: \"Is it time for a wholesale change or should we\u0014\n   stay the course? Do we focus on growth or consolidation?\u0014\n   Should we start new ministries or deepen and improve existing\u0014\n   ones? Should we add facilities or relocate? Is it time for\u0014\n   some fresh staff, or do we dance with those who brought us\u0014\n   here?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   These are directional issues, and they are capable of\u0014\n   immobilizing an organization. But a leader with a directional\u0014\n   style is able to sort the options. He or she can carefully\u0014\n   assess the values, mission, strengths, weaknesses, resources,\u0014\n   personnel, and openness to change of an organization -- then,\u0014\n   with remarkable wisdom, point that organization in the right\u0014\n   direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Wrong calls at these key intersections can wreck\u0014\n   organizations. Shortly after Solomon's death, his son Rehoboam\u0014\n   became king. His first critical intersection came almost\u0014\n   immediately: a representative group of the people asked for\u0014\n   their workloads to be reduced. Solomon had worked people to\u0014\n   the point of despair. Rehoboam had to make a directional call.\u0014\n   The older counselors said, \"You'd better ease up on them.\" The\u0014\n   younger counselors said, \"Just load them up.\" He made the\u0014\n   wrong call at that intersection, and it wrecked the kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   When Willow Creek is at such a crossroads, I will not move in\u0014\n   the direction I believe God is calling us without the green\u0014\n   light from two board members who are strong in directional\u0014\n   leadership. Whenever we've followed their lead, we've made\u0014\n   good decisions. Whenever we've ignored their advice, we've\u0014\n   paid a high price.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   SHEPHERDING LEADER\u0014\n   This man or woman loves team members so deeply, nurtures them\u0014\n   so gently, supports them so consistently, listens to them so\u0014\n   patiently, and prays for them so diligently that the mission\u0014\n   of the team gets achieved. It happens primarily because of\u0014\n   good will in the hearts of those who have been cared for by\u0014\n   the shepherd.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   I'm on the board of World Vision, an organization that has fed\u0014\n   starving children for more than thirty years. They've had\u0014\n   several different presidents, and constituents have supported\u0014\n   the vision, regardless of who was at the helm.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   It's a different dynamic with shepherding leaders and their\u0014\n   teams. Team members support their shepherd, and teammates\u0014\n   often feel, Whatever cause is important to the leader is fine\u0014\n   with me. If it's broadly Christian, if we can accomplish it in\u0014\n   community, if we can retain our shepherd, we'll do it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Second Samuel 23 records David's leadership in the early days.\u0014\n   He drew together the lonely and disaffected, then shepherded\u0014\n   them deeply and lovingly. One night, he happened to mention\u0014\n   that he was thirsty, but his troops were surrounded by the\u0014\n   enemy. Three members of his team risked their lives to sneak\u0014\n   behind enemy lines to bring David a jar of water. When they\u0014\n   gave him the water, he was so moved by their expression of\u0014\n   love that he poured it out as a worship offering.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   While there are many cause-driven people waiting to be drawn\u0014\n   into a mission by a visionary leader, there are surprising\u0014\n   numbers of community-driven people who want to be shepherded\u0014\n   and loved. When they are, they will joyfully pursue almost any\u0014\n   kingdom purpose. If you can shepherd a group of people, you're\u0014\n   a leader, and you can really make a difference.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Next: the Motivational Leader, the Bridge-Building\u0014\n   Leader, and more.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Bill Hybels is pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in\u0014\n   South Barrington, Illinois. He is also the author of\u0014\n   Courageous Leadership (Zondervan 2002), in which he expounds\u0014\n   on these and more leadership styles.\u0014",

    "title": "LOVES MEANS YOU DO HAVE TO SAY \"I'M SORRY\"",
    "words": "Guilt Good and Bad\u0014\nThe early warning signs.\u0014\nBy Philip Yancey | 11/11/2002\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Love means never having to say you're sorry,\" proclaimed a sappy \nromance novel from the 1970s. I have come to believe the opposite, \nthat love means precisely having to say you're sorry. A sense of \nguilt, vastly underappreciated, deserves our gratitude, for only such \na powerful force can nudge us toward repentance and reconciliation \nwith those we have harmed.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet guilt represents danger as well. In his novel The First Circle, \nAlexander Solzhenitsyn described a prisoner who obsessively marked a \npink sheet of paper for every bad thought or \"defect.\" I have known \nChristians who go through life with hyperattention to defects. Some \nraised in oppressive environments go through life afraid, heads down, \nfleeing anything that might be perceived as pleasure, and terrified \nthat they are somehow offending one of God's laws.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther, in his early days as a monk, would daily wear out his \nconfessors with as many as six straight hours of introspection about \nminuscule sins and unhealthy thoughts. \"My son, God is not angry with \nyou: it is you who are angry with God,\" said one of his exasperated \nadvisers. Luther eventually came to agree that his fear of sinning \nactually showed a lack of faith, both in his ability to live purely \nin an impure world, and in Christ's provision for his sin. \"To \ndiagnose smallpox you do not have to probe each pustule, nor do you \nheal each separately,\" he concluded.\u0014\n\u0014\nH. L. Mencken's caricature of a Puritan\"a person with a haunting \nfear that someone, somewhere is happy\"hints at how far the church or \nsociety can stray from God's standards of right and wrong. Jesus \nhimself was criticized by the \"Puritans\" of his day. A mature \nChristian learns to discriminate between false guilt inherited from \nparents, church, or society, and true guilt as a response to breaking \nGod's laws clearly revealed in the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second danger flows directly from the first. Guilt, like physical \npain, is directional. Just as the body speaks to us in the language \nof pain so that we will attend to the injury site, the spirit speaks \nto us in the language of guilt so that we will take the steps \nnecessary for healing. The goal in both is to restore health.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book Legends of our Time, Elie Wiesel tells of a visit to his \nhometown of Sighet, which was then part of Hungary. Twenty years \nbefore his visit, Wiesel and all other Jews in that town had been \nrounded up and deported to concentration camps. To his dismay, he \nfound that the current residents of the town had simply erased the \nmemory of those Jews. It struck Wiesel that forgetting one's sins may \nbe as great an evil as committing them in the first place, for what \nis forgotten can never be healed.\u0014\nGuilt is not a state to cultivate, like a mood you slip into for a \nfew days. It should have directional movement, first pointing \nbackward to the sin and then pointing forward to repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my reading of spiritual masters, I have noticed that persons we \nnow view as saintly have a finely calibrated sense of sin. Aware of \nGod's ideal, aspiring to holiness, free of the vanity and \ndefensiveness that blind most people, they live in full awareness of \nfalling short. Thomas Merton makes this point in an odd comparison \nbetween Adolf Hitler and Theresa of Avila:\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Theresa thinks everybody is the same as she is because we are \nall sinners. Hitler thinks everybody is different from him, because \nthey are, some of them less pure, some of them less noble, some of \nthem less intelligent, some of them less beautiful, all of them less \ngodlike, all of them less perfect. It is the Hitlers who think they \nare perfectbecause nobody else thinks so. It is the saints who know \nthey are not perfect, although sometimes other people say of them \nthat they are saints: the saints themselves know themselves only as \nsinners, liable to lose their love and the sight of Christ through a \nmovement of impatience or selfishness or pride.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue saints do not get discouraged over their faults, for they \nrecognize that a person who feels no guilt can never find healing. \nParadoxically, neither can a person who wallows in guilt. The sense \nof guilt only serves its designed purpose if it presses us toward the \nGod who promises forgiveness and restoration.\u0014\n\u0014\nI once thought Christians went through life burdened by guilt, in \ncontrast to carefree unbelievers. I now realize that Christians are \nthe only persons who do not have to go through life feeling guilty. \nGuilt is only a symptom; we listen to it because it drives us toward \nthe cure.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "LET ME COUNT THE DAYS",
    "words": "Let Me Count the Days \u0014\n\u0014\nby Elesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce again, popular demand suggested a newsletter topic (no ivory \ntowers around here). The question of the week deals with that odd \ncarol full of birds, lords, and other unlikely gifts, \"The Twelve \nDays of Christmas.\" Is this yet another theological treatise whose \nChristian origins have been obscured?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, maybe, but the story proliferating on e-mail and personal home \npages (not to mention WGN radioshame on them!) contains more fiction \nthan fact:\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1558 to 1829, Catholics in England were prohibited from \npracticing their faith at all. Possessing or professing anything \nCatholic could get you killed in any of a number of horrible ways. In \nresponse, the beleaguered believers wrote \"The Twelve Days of \nChristmas\" as a covert way to teach the catechism. The song's \"true \nlove\" is God, \"me\" is the believer, and each gift has spiritual \nsignificance:\u0014\n\u0014\n1 Partridge in pear tree = Jesus on the cross\u0014\n2 Turtle doves = Old and New Testaments\u0014\n3 French hens = Faith, hope, and charity\u0014\n4 Calling birds = Four Gospels and/or four evangelists\u0014\n5 Golden rings = The Pentateuch\u0014\n6 Geese a-laying = Six days of creation\u0014\n7 Swans a-swimming = Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit\u0014\n8 Maids a-milking = Eight Beatitudes\u0014\n9 Ladies dancing = Nine fruits of the Spirit\u0014\n10 Lords a-leaping = Ten Commandments\u0014\n11 Pipers piping = Eleven faithful apostles\u0014\n12 Drummers drumming = Twelve points of doctrine in the Apostle's \nCreed\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the candy cane story, this tale begins with a skewed version of \nEnglish history. In 1558, England's Catholic queen, \"Bloody Mary\" \nTudor, was succeeded by her Protestant half-sis, Elizabeth. Though \nProtestants were now in power, and open practice of Catholicism was \nforbidden by law (until the Emancipation Act of 1829), this was \nhardly a death sentence for all the country's Catholics. There were \nperiods of intense persecution but also periods of relative leniency, \nincluding much of Elizabeth's reign, during which the Via Media \n(\"Middle Way\") between Catholic and Protestant practices held sway. \nBut even when the situation for Catholics in England was truly bleak, \nthey never needed to be secretive about the truths supposedly hidden \nin \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" because all of those ideas are \nheld by Protestants as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther arguments also challenge the hidden catechism theory. One, \nmerely remembering the number of gospels, Beatitudes, and \ncommandments isn't enormously helpfulyou still have to remember what \nthose lists contain. Two, there's no existing evidence that English \nCatholics used songs or nursery rhymes as spiritual mnemonics (on the \ncontrary, many nursery rhymes were political satires). Three, \"The \nTwelve Days of Christmas\" very likely originated in France: three \nFrench versions of the song exist, and at least one item in the song, \nthe partridge, was known in France but wasn't introduced in England \nuntil the late 1770s. France, incidentally, has been Catholic for \ncenturies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English version of the song first appeared in print in 1780, when \nit was listed as a \"memory-and-forfeits\" game in a children's book, \nMirth Without Mischief. The object of the game was to sing along \nwithout mixing up any of the gifts; a mistake could cost a kiss or a \ncandy. However, the song was certainly popular before 1780, and it \nmight even be related to an older song called \"A New Dial,\" or \"In \nThose Twelve Days.\" \"A New Dial\" can be dated back to at least 1625 \nand was explicitly spiritual, though its purpose was not to teach a \ncatechism. And while no evidence links the two songs, the \"meaning\" \nassigned to days two, four, six, eight, and ten is the same for both.\u0014\n\u0014\nWherever the song originated, my favorite version is the Sesame \nStreet Twelve Days of Christmas, which I was fortunate enough to find \non CD at Borders last weekend. I'll take four woolly bears, three \nfootballs, two baby frogs, and one delicious cookie over a houseful \nof flapping birds and frenetic servants any day.\u0014",

    "words": "Living Without Hope\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a fascinating conversation on Rush Limbaugh's talk show a \nwhile\u0014\nback.  Having just completed Tom Brokaw's wonderful book The Greatest\u0014\nGeneration, a book filled with inspiring stories of the WWII \ngeneration,\u0014\nRush had taken the position that the current generation of young \nadults,\u0014\nthose in their 20's, are, for the most part, a bunch of whiners.  He \nsaid\u0014\nthat while they are constantly whining and moaning about the \ndifficulty of\u0014\ntheir lives in fact, when compared to the hardships faced by their\u0014\ngrandparents' generation, they've actually got it easy.  Their \ngrandparents\u0014\nhad endured truly devastating events like The Great Depression and \nWWII.\u0014\nThe current crop of young adults, he concluded, doesn't even have a \nclue\u0014\nabout real hardship.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Rush had finished his monologue a self-professed member of this \nyounger\u0014\ngeneration of adults called in to offer a different perspective. \nBright and\u0014\nextremely articulate, the 23 year-old caller said that, while The \nGreat\u0014\nDepression and WWII certainly created terrible hardships for the \npeople who\u0014\nfaced them that he, nonetheless, believed his generation faced an even\u0014\ngreater hardship.\u0014\n\u0014\nLimbaugh asked, \"And what exactly would that be?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe caller said, \"The loss of hope.\"  He said that his experience \nindicated\u0014\nthat many of today's young adults had simply stopped believing that \nthings\u0014\nwere going to get better. They didn't expect to live as well as their\u0014\nparents had lived. They weren't expecting a brighter future. They have\u0014\nsimply given up hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, The Great Depression, as terrible as it was, in many cases \nbrought\u0014\nfamilies together as they worked side by side in the hope of saving \ntheir\u0014\nfamilies.  Most of his friends, he said, grew up in families in \ncomplete\u0014\ndisarray and have given up the hope of ever having a real family \nexperience\u0014\nof their own.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, WWII was a terrible event that obviously cost thousands of \nAmericas\u0014\n' young men their lives.  Then he said, and even though they knew the \nrisks\u0014\nthey still enlisted voluntarily by the millions because they saw it \nas a\u0014\ncause worth dying for.  Most of those in his generation, he said, \ncan't\u0014\nimagine anything worth dying for and they're committing suicide in \nrecord\u0014\nnumbers because many can't imagine anything worth living for.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, \"Mr. Limbaugh, The Great Depression and WWII created terrible\u0014\nhardships.  But I submit to you that the greatest hardship of all is \nliving\u0014\nwithout hope.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTom Marcum, Sermon: Rediscovering the Hope of Christmas\u0014",

God's kind of love. It's \npatient. It can wait. \u0014\nIt helps others, even if they never find out who did it. Love doesn't \nlook for greener\u0014\npastures or dream of how things could be better if I just got rid of \nall my current\u0014\ncommitments. Love doesn't boast. It doesn't try to build itself up to \nbe something it\u0014\nisn't. Love doesn't act in a loose, immoral way. It doesn't seek to \ntake,\u0014\nbut it willingly gives. Love doesn't lose its cool. It doesn't turn on\u0014\nand off. Love doesn't think about how bad the other person is, and\u0014\ncertainly doesn't think of how it could get back at someone. Love is\u0014\ngrieved deeply (as God is) over the evil in this world, but it \nrejoices\u0014\nover truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove comes and sits with you when you're feeling down and finds out \nwhat\u0014\nis wrong. It empathizes with you and believes in you. Love knows \nyou'll\u0014\ncome through just as God planned, and love sticks right beside you all\u0014\nthe way. Love doesn't give up, or quit, or diminish or go home. Love\u0014\nkeeps on keeping on, even when everything goes wrong and the feelings\u0014\nleave and the other person doesn't seem as special anymore. Love\u0014\nsucceeds 100 percent of the time. That, my friend, is what real love \nis!\u0014\n\u0014\n--David Sanford\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 David Sanford, who serves as adjunct professor of\u0014\njournalism at Western Baptist College\u0014",

After a great battle in ancient \ntimes, the Dark Lord Sauron was temporarily defeated and his most \ndreaded weapon, the Ring of Power, was lost for many ages. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Hobbit from the Shire named Bilbo Baggins finds the ring and, \nunaware of its true identity, passes it on to his nephew, Frodo, as \npart of an inheritance. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), the hero, is \nfull of humility and uncertainty as he embarks on an epic quest to \ndestroy the Dark Lord's most powerful toolthe Ring.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one scene, Bilbo converses with his wise and trusted friend \nGandalf about departing on a long journey and leaving his inheritance \nbehind for Frodo. The Ring is part of that inheritance, and ever so \nsubtly the Ring begins to exert itself on Biblo, as it does with \neveryone who comes near it. \u0014\nAs Gandalf encourages Bilbo to leave behind the Ring, Bilbo grasps it \nand clamors, \"It's mine! My own! My precious. What business is it of \nyours what I do with my own affairs?\"\u0014\nBilbo casts a suspicious eye on Gandalf and accuses, \"You want it for \nyourself!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFirmly, Gandalf responds, \"Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some \nconjurer of cheap tricks. I'm not trying to rob you. I am trying to \nhelp you. All your long years we've been friends. Trust me, as you \nonce did. Let it go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGradually Bilbo's defiance fades, and he embraces Gandalf, saying, \n\"You're right Gandalf, the Ring must go.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nElapsed time: Measured from the beginning of the opening credit, this \nscene begins at 20:59 and ends at 23:48.\u0014\nContent: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is rated \nPG-13 for epic battle scenes and some frightening images.\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (New Line \nCinemas, 2001), rated PG-13, written by Peter Jackson, Philippa \nBoyens, and Fran Walsh, and directed by Peter Jackson; submitted by \nBill White, Paramount, California\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

There is something about standing \nin the\u0014\nLincoln Memorial and reading the Gettysburg Address and the Second \nInaugural\u0014\nAddress which gives you goosebumps.

A crowd gathered at the White House \nand a\u0014\nmilitary band was playing some festive music. Lincoln stood on the \nbalcony\u0014\nof the White House and spoke. Instead of lashing out against the \nSouth, he\u0014\nspoke of the horrors of war being over. He spoke of families getting \nback\u0014\ntogether. He spoke of a time of peace. Then he said, \"In a few \nmoments I\u0014\nwant the band to play and I'm going to tell them what I want them to \nplay.\"\u0014\nOf course, the band started getting the \"Battle Hymn of The Republic\" \nready\u0014\nto play. This had been the theme song of the North throughout the \nCivil War.\u0014\nBut Lincoln crossed them up. He stood there and said: \"The band will \nnow\u0014\nplay the theme song of the people we have called our enemy. They are \nnot our\u0014\nenemies any more! We are one people again. I want the band to play \n'Dixie.'\u0014\n\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians say there was a long, awkward pause. The band didn't have \nthe\u0014\nmusic to \"Dixie,\" but they finally got together and played, \"Dixie.\" \nLincoln\u0014\nknew that the South was not only hurting because of the horrors of \nthe war,\u0014\nbut also because of the shame which accompanies defeat. Lincoln was \nsending\u0014\na clear signal to the South. Lincoln was telling everyone that there \nwould\u0014\nbe no punishment upon the South. Lincoln was saying that the South \nwould be\u0014\ntreated with love and compassion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you love, after the patterns of Jesus, caring and compassion \nbecome the\u0014\ncornerstone of your love.

This, however, created a new problem when New York, \nironically, had too much electricity and overloaded its own system. \nThe result: history's largest shutdown.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, seemingly small actions and choices can end with \ndevastating personal consequences.

The book's leitmotif is the interaction of differing \ncultures and men, like the British\u0014\n                     gentry, whom Smith scorned for refusing to adapt \nto hard colonial labor, and the wily Indians, who resorted to \nstarving out the colonists\u0014\n                     and in 1622 massacred many of them. If there's a \nfault in a work built unobtrusively on the best scholarship, it's \nPrice's insistence that we\u0014\n                     see Virginia principally as a place that \nrewarded courage and hard labor-for white men-in the service of \nself-advancement and personal\u0014\n                     liberty. Such a place it was. But it was also \nfor all participants a site, at the start of the nation's history, of \ndanger, horror and death.

    "words": "Lawyer turns \ntopless dancer to pay the bills\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bob Sullivan, MSNBC    9/16/11\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Carla graduated 10 years ago, she thought her law degree would \nbe a permanent ticket to a high-paying job. But instead of selling \nher mind, Carla is selling her body. After student loans, debt, a \nlayoff and unemployment battered her bank account, she now finds \nherself in an almost unbelievable position  dancing in a topless bar.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Did I ever think Id be taking my top off for rent money? No. I was \nin my mid-30s and had never danced before,\" said Carla, who asked \nthat we use her stage name and withhold her identity and some \npersonal details. \"As a little girl, I never thought to myself, 'I \njust want to grow up and be a stripper, or, All I ever wanted to do \nin life is climb in the lap of sweaty stranger and take my top off.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But, with our economy the way it is, especially in smaller cities \n... you strip or you starve,\" she said\u0014\n\u0014\nCarla grew up in the Midwest and moved to the West Coast in the late \n90s to fulfill her dream of earning her law degree. After \ngraduation, she worked for nine years putting her degree to use, but \nshe had entered the crowded legal profession at the wrong time. When \nshe was laid off in 2009, she couldn't find work. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"At first, I worked as a waitress, and a cashier in gas station,\" she \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n'Act of desperation'\u0014\n\u0014\nAs her prospects grew dim, she went back to school to earn a masters \ndegree, hoping to bolster her credentials. But her financial aid came \nin lower than expected, her credit was battered and she struggled to \nfind part-time work in her new town to keep her afloat.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarla agreed to talk about her experience in part because she said it \nhas been profound  in one sense, the job is less hostile than any \nlaw office shes worked in, she said. Coming from the cutthroat legal \nprofession, she has been stunned by the camaraderie among the women \nshe works with.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I thought the other women I worked with would be competitive and not \nsupportive. We are 'fighting' over the same dollars,\" she said. \"But \nmy female coworkers are the best coworkers I've ever had.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMany are in the same situation she is, she said: forced by their \neconomic situation to perform work they would have never considered \nin the past. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I work with war widows, a nurse, a med student, women who have had \nto go to work to save their home after their husbands have lost their \njobs, and others who do this as a means to an end and who do not fit \nthe profile of junkie/prostitute/dancer.  What we all have in common \nis being in a tight spot financially and living in an economy that \nprovides limited options right now, \" she said. \"I'd be willing to \nbet that there are women like me working in it all over the country, \nout of necessity and not because our goal in life was to appear \ntopless in front of  creepy guys.\"\u0014",

On this day, November 2, in 1533, \nJohn Calvin made a similar thrilling escape from Paris.\u0014\n\u0014\nA devout Catholic, Calvin studied law at the Universities of Orleans \nand Paris. He was a brilliant student, and with the Protestant \nReformation in the air, he began reading Martin Luther and became a \nleader of the Reformation in France, at the risk of arrest, \nimprisonment, or even death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1532 Calvin wrote that \"Only one ...salvation is left open for our \nsouls, and that is the mercy of God in Christ. We are saved by \ngrace... not by our works.\" Calvin became a leader of the evangelical \nparty in Paris, often encouraging his followers with the words of \nPaul: \"If God is for us, who can be against us?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1533 the newly elected head of Paris University, Nicholas Cop \napparently asked Calvin to collaborate on an inauguration address. \nThe speech called for the church to return to New Testament ideals. \nIt accused traditional theologians of being nothing but a set of \nsophists. \"They teach nothing of faith, nothing of the love of God, \nnothing of the remission of grace, nothing of justification, or if \nthey do so, they pervert and undermine it all by their laws and \nsophistries. I beg of you, who are here present, not to tolerate any \nlonger these heresies and abuses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe king and church authorities were furious. With the police hot on \ntheir heels, Cop and Calvin fled for their lives. Calvin lowered \nhimself from a window on bedsheets tied together, and escaped Paris \ndressed as a farmer with a hoe on his shoulder. Taking the alias \nMartianus Lucianius, he reached safety in tolerant Basel. For three \nmore years he wandered as a fugitive evangelist under such assumed \nnames. Finally he settled in Geneva, Switzerland where he became one \nof the best-known leaders of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBouwsma, William J.

    "words": "October 5, 2011\u0014\n\n                                                                            \nListen to Millennials, please \u0014\n\u0014\nBy \\Nadia Bolz-Weber, guest blogger\u0014\n\u0014\nThis past weekend I taught a class at Iliff School of Theology on \nEmerging Church in the US and the UK. Predictably the issue of social \nmedia came up as did some expressed discomfort with things like text \nmessaging and Facebook interactions replacing real community. A \ncouple of folks cringed when I said that I do a lot of pastoral care \nvia text messaging, which brought up the issues of Millennial culture \nand authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nI encouraged folks (as I usually do) to look at \\Pew Research \nCenter's work on Millennials and what characterizes Millennial \nculture. There even is an on-line \\How Millennial Are You? quiz one \ncan take to see where you rank generationally and culturally. My goal \nin having people look at this research is to help them see the ways \nin which mainline Protestant churches are, for the most part, not \nlocated culturally in a Millennial context, and yet Millennial \nculture will only be taking up increasingly more space in the \nAmerican landscape, not less.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conversations I hear in the church about young people seem to be \npeople over 50 trying to figure out how we can stop the church from \ndyinghow can we target populations (please don't ever, for any \nreason, use this term) who aren't in church, how can we be more \nrelevant (same goes here), how can we get young adults to be \ninvolved. I realize that these conversations, which happen all over \nthe country, are in large part coming from a place of loving the \nchurch and wanting it to be around for the next generations, but I \nthink these conversations are not really helping us. It's like \nasking, How can we make horse and buggies appealing to Baby \nBoomers? Just because they may not be in any way interested in a \nhorse and buggy doesn't mean they don't care about transportation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother way of looking at it is that you can try to market land-lines \nto teenagers till the cows come home. You can do as much market \nresearch as you'd like and lament the fact that kids just don't care \nabout phones anymore because none of them have land-lines. Or you can \nget some kids to tell you about cell phones and the ways in which \nthey love to communicate with those they love even though their ways \nlook different than your ways. What I mean is this: If younger \ngenerations are not coming to church, it doesn't mean they don't care \nabout the Gospel. It just means that their understanding of what it \nmeans to follow Jesus is culturally different from what they see in \nmost mainline churches. This is not to say that mainline churches are \nnot a faithful expression of the Gospel, only that it is no longer a \nnormative expression of the Gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nConversations about how to save the church should maybe shift in this \nway: We should find all the people we can who rank high on the \nMillennial scale (they can be any age, trust me!) and who answered \nvery to that one question how important is it to you personally to \nlead a deeply religious life? and then ask them what does it look \nlike to be the church? Since they are native to the cultural shift \nin which we find ourselves, they have an authority to speak to a \nburgeoning ecclesiology that we may not yet be able to envision. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere's what I like about the New Media Project: They seem to \nrecognize that while one side of the church is criticizing the use of \nnew media as a sign of the downfall of the traditional church, the \nother side sees it as the answer which, if adopted quickly, can \nprevent the downfall of the traditional church. Neither approach is \nuseful they seem to understand. So my hope is that the New Media \nProject will instead continue to ask those for whom new media is not \nnew at all (those who are native to it) and who love the Gospel \nwhat it means to them, and how they see it as part of being the body \nof Christ. They are the ones who can tell us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNadia Bolz-Weber is the Pastor of \\House for All Sinners and Saints \nin Denver, Colorado, one of the \\case studies of the New Media \nProject. She holds an M.Div. from Illiff School of Theology and is \nthe author of Salvation on the Small Screen?She blogs regularly on \n\\Sarcastic Lutheran.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Media Project at Union Theological Seminary is a research \nproject helping religious leaders become theologically savvy about \ntechnology.\u0014",

    "words": "Long \nUnderware of the Spirit\u0014\n\u0014\nHelen and I took off our long underwear yesterday. Actually we did it \nlast April 2. It just seems like yesterday. Now it's time to put it \non again.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps I shouldn't say we took it off then. Better would be: We \nstopped wearing long underwear April 2. Saying we took it off then \nindicates that we had not taken it off at all since we put it on last \nDec. Helen would be mortified to have people think we did not change \nunderwear all winter, because she did.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong underwear is supposed to be donned on Dec. 1 and doffed on April \n1. We did not change on April 1 because we had a big snowfall that \nday. We put it on last Dec. 2 because we did not have a big snowfall \nDec. 1.\u0014\n \u0014\nHelen's father, Tank Karr, always said that spring starts March 1. In \nthe UP there is no such thing as spring; we simply think in terms of \nshort underwear season.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the weather fools the underwear. We had to put our long \nunderwear back on last April. In addition to our big April Fool's \nsnow, we had another 7 inches April 9 and another two on April 11. UP \nhere, April can be not only the cruelest month but the snowiest. \u0014\n \u0014\nWe learned about long underwear season from Arch Davidson of the \nStanwood, IA Presbyterian Church, which I pastored while a doctoral \nstudent at U of IA. [4] It was the first Sunday in December, which \nmeant communion. It also, that year, meant a record high temperature \nof around eighty degrees. Arch was dressed in his gray three-piece \nchurch suit. As we sang the final hymn, he wavered and began to pass \nout. He was too hot. Under his church suit was his union suit. Arch \nwas a man of conviction and predestination. It was Dec. 1, and by \nhokies, that meant long underwear.\u0014\n\u0014\nCold is a particular concern of old people. As a pastor, I have \nvisited in the homes of many old people in the winter. I did not wear \nlong underwear then, but I had winter-weight stuff on. I often had to \ncut the visit short and get out because the thermostat was cranked up \nto eighty degrees. I never felt the need to go to Florida in the \nwinter; I could just go to Maple Adams' house.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany old people go in the wintertime to where the air is hot. I think \nlong underwear is a better solution, for when you are old, you have \nless tolerance for hot air as well as less tolerance for cold air.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cold does not seem to affect young people as much. I cannot \nremember being young myself, but I observe young people. Our \ngranddaughter, Brigid, goes around in short sleeves and bare feet \nduring long underwear season.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is also an emotional coldness that comes with age. Neither \ncranking up the thermostat or fleeing to Florida helps that much. I \nrecall talking with a man whose wife had died suddenly. I just feel \ncold, he said. His emotional long underwear had been removed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat happens each time someone we love is taken from us. That person \nwho kept us warm with love and laughter, who held us close when we \nshivered at the ways of the world, is gone. We are without the long \nunderwear on which we counted.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am told that the last test for soldiers in training for arctic duty \nis to be dropped alone into the arctic wilderness, in regular \nfatigues, clutching their arctic pack. They will not survive unless \nthey strip completely naked, in brutal temperatures, and don the \nsurvival pack. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not survive in this cold world without the right long \nunderwear. I am tempted from time to time to try to get along without \nit. Then some layer of my long underwear is taken away, and I realize \nhow cold I am without it. I give thanks for Filson and L.L. Bean. I \nsave my greatest thanks, however, for those who wrap me in the warmth \nof love, even though now that warmth comes, from many of them, not in \npresence, but in memory and in hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland   12/6/11    (UP refers to Upper Peninsula \nMichigan)\u0014",

    "words": "October 31, 1517 \u0014\nLuther Posted 95 Theses\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the little town of Wittenberg, Germany,on this day, October 31, \n1517, a priest nailed a challenge to debate on the church door. No \none may have noticed then, but within the week, copies of his theses \nwould be discussed throughout the surrounding regions; and within a \ndecade, Europe itself was shaken by his simple act. Later generations \nwould mark martin Luther's nailing of the 95 theses on the church \ndoor as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, but what did \nLuther think he was doing at the time? To answer this question, we \nneed to understand a little about Luther's own spiritual journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man in Germany at the beginning of the sixteenth century, \nLuther was studying law at the university. One day he was caught in a \nstorm and was almost killed by lightening. He cried out to St. Anne \nand promised God he would become a monk. In 1505, Luther entered the \nAugustinian monastery, and in 1507 became a priest. His monastic \nleaders sent him to Rome in 1510, but Luther was disenchanted with \nthe ritualism and dead faith he found in the papal city. There was \nnothing in Rome to mend his despairing spirit or settle his restless \nsoul. He seemed so cut off from God, and nowhere could he find a cure \nfor his malady.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was bright, and his superiors soon had him teaching \ntheology in the university. In 1515, he began teaching Paul's epistle \nto the Romans. Slowly, Paul's words in Romans began to break through \nthe gloom of Luther's soul. Luther wrote\u0014\n\u0014\nMy situation was that, although an impeccable monk, I stood before \nGod as a sinner troubled in conscience, and I had no confidence that \nmy merit would assuage him. Night and day I pondered until I saw the \nconnection between the justice of God and the statement 'the just \nshall live by faith.' Then I grasped that the justice of God is that \nrighteousness by which through grace and sheer mercy God justifies us \nthrough faith. Thereupon I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone \nthrough open doors into paradise. The whole of Scripture took on a \nnew meaning...This passage of Paul became to me a gate to heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe more Luther's eyes were opened by his study of Romans, the more \nhe saw the corruption of the church in his day. The glorious truth of \njustification by faith alone had become buried under a mound of \ngreed, corruption, and false teaching. Most galling was the practice \nof indulgences -- the certificates the church provided, for a fee, \nsupposedly to shorten one's stay in Purgatory. The pope was \nencouraging the sale of indulgences. He planned to use the money to \nhelp pay for the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Tetzel was one of the indulgence sellers in Luther's vicinity. \nHe used little advertising jingles to encourage people to buy his \nwares: \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from \npurgatory springs.\" Once Luther realized the sufficiency of Christ's \nsacrifice alone for our sins, he found such practices revolting. The \nmore he studied the Scriptures, the more he saw the need of showing \nthe church how it had strayed from the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on this day, October 31, 1517, he posted a list of 95 \npropositions on the church door in Wittenberg. In his day, this was \nthe means of inviting scholars to debate important issues. No one \ntook up Luther's challenge to debate at that time, but once news of \nhis proposals became known, many began to discuss the issue Luther \nraised that salvation was by faith in Christ's work alone. Luther \napparently at first expected the pope to agree with his position, \nsince it was based on Scripture; but in 1520, the Pope issued a \ndecree condemning Luther's views. Luther publicly burned the papal \ndecree. With that act, he also burned his bridges behind him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBainton, Roland. Here I Stand.

On this day, November 2, in 1533, \nJohn Calvin made a similar thrilling escape from Paris.\u0014\n\u0014\nA devout Catholic, Calvin studied law at the Universities of Orleans \nand Paris. He was a brilliant student, and with the Protestant \nReformation in the air, he began reading Martin Luther and became a \nleader of the Reformation in France, at the risk of arrest, \nimprisonment, or even death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1532 Calvin wrote that \"Only one ...salvation is left open for our \nsouls, and that is the mercy of God in Christ. We are saved by \ngrace... not by our works.\" Calvin became a leader of the evangelical \nparty in Paris, often encouraging his followers with the words of \nPaul: \"If God is for us, who can be against us?\"\u0014\nIn 1533 the newly elected head of Paris University, Nicholas Cop \napparently asked Calvin to collaborate on an inauguration address. \nThe speech called for the church to return to New Testament ideals. \nIt accused traditional theologians of being nothing but a set of \nsophists. \"They teach nothing of faith, nothing of the love of God, \nnothing of the remission of grace, nothing of justification, or if \nthey do so, they pervert and undermine it all by their laws and \nsophistries. I beg of you, who are here present, not to tolerate any \nlonger these heresies and abuses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe king and church authorities were furious. With the police hot on \ntheir heels, Cop and Calvin fled for their lives. Calvin lowered \nhimself from a window on bedsheets tied together, and escaped Paris \ndressed as a farmer with a hoe on his shoulder. Taking the alias \nMartianus Lucianius, he reached safety in tolerant Basel. For three \nmore years he wandered as a fugitive evangelist under such assumed \nnames. Finally he settled in Geneva, Switzerland where he became one \nof the best-known leaders of the Reformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBouwsma, William J.

    "words": "October 20, 1949 \u0014\nLast of the Inklings' Thursday Meetings\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The best of them were as good as anything I shall live to see.\" John \nWain was speaking of the Thursday Night meetings of the Inklings in \nOxford.\u0014\n\u0014\nC. S. Lewis was not only an intellectual giant, but a man with a gift \nfor friendship. In the 1930s, a number of his friends began to meet \ninformally in his rather shabby college rooms to read their writings \nand argue over every sort of literary and moral topic. The members \nshared a belief in the supernatural, which C. S. Lewis contrasted \nwith naturalism in his book Miracles: \"The Naturalist thinks that the \nprivilege of 'being on its own' resides in the total mass of \nthings...The Supernaturalist, on the other hand, believes that the \none original or self-existent thing is on a different level from, and \nmore important than, all other things.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most famous members of the group was J. R. R. Tolkien, the \nauthor of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He liked the name \nInklings, because it suggested half-formed ideas and dabbling with \nink.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe group were by and large Christian. Tolkien was a traditional \nRoman Catholic and C. S. Lewis took the Christian story quite \nliterally as anyone knows who has read his books in defense of the \nfaith. Lewis' older brother, Warren (Warnie), had also embraced the \nChristian faith, writing in 1931, \"On Saturday last, I started to say \nmy prayers again after having discontinued doing so for more years \nthat I care to remember: this was no sudden impulse but the result of \na conviction of the truth of Christianity which has been growing on \nme for a considerable time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Owen Barfield accepted the non-biblical idea of reincarnation and \nCharles Williams held notions about the Holy Spirit which seem \nblasphemous to traditional theologians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe group's leading members were all authors. Warnie published a \nhistory of the reign of King Louis XIV. Owen Barfield wrote a \nfascinating study called History in English Words (among many other \nbooks). Charles Williams wrote weird novels and poetry that almost no \none can comprehend. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe men owed each other a great deal. Hugo Dyson and J. R. R. Tolkien \nwere strong influences in Lewis' conversion to Christianity. On the \nother hand Tolkien said of C. S. Lewis, \"The unpayable debt that I \nowe to him was not 'influence' as it is ordinarily understood, but \nsheer encouragement. He was for long my only audience. Only from him \ndid I ever get the idea that my 'stuff' could be more than a private \nhobby.\" The \"stuff\" that Tolkien was referring to was The Lord of the \nRings and its background material.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe men (occasionally a woman, like Dorothy Sayers, or C. S. Lewis's \nwife, Joy) met for about sixteen years. They critiqued each other's \nwork and drew inspiration from one another. Arguments and ideas from \nBarfield, Williams and Tolkien often reappear in C. S. Lewis. But \nover the years, stress changed their relationship. Lewis' marriage to \nJoy Davidman was especially damaging to the Inklings, most of whom \nconsidered her to be brash and resented Lewis' insistence that she be \nincluded in the group.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last Inkling's meeting appears to have been a ham supper on this \nday October 20, 1949. The next week no one turned up, and no one the \nweek after. The Inklings had dissolved.\u0014\n\u0014\nLewis and Tolkien made a tremendous impact on Christian thinking in \nthe twentieth century, and there can be little doubt that the \nstimulation of the Inkling's meetings helped form their thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\nCarpenter, Humphrey.

Her name was \nCarolina Sandell Berg, and she was born on this day, October 3, l832. \nShe grew up to become Sweden's most celebrated author of Gospel \nhymns, and wrote so many that she is often called \"the Fanny Crosby \nof Sweden.\"*\u0014\n\u0014\nLike many Christians, she learned that when pain and tragedy strike, \nGod may use that experience to deepen our faith. When she was 26, \nCarolina--or Lina (pronounced Lie-nah) as she liked to be \ncalled--experienced a tragedy which profoundly affected the course of \nher life. She was with her father, a Lutheran pastor, crossing a \nSwedish lake. Suddenly the ship lurched, and before her eyes, her \nfather was thrown overboard and drowned. Lina had written hymns \nbefore, but now she poured out her broken heart in an endless stream \nof beautiful songs. Her hymns mightily influenced the revival that \nswept across Scandanavia after l850.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words of Lina Berg's hymns were all the more popular because of \nthe simple, beautiful melodies written for them, especially those of \nOscar Ahnfelt who played his guitar and sang her hymns throughout \nScandanavia. Lina Berg once said that Ahnfeld sang her songs \"into \nthe hearts of the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Jenny Lind, the world-famous concert vocalist, visited factories \nand sang Lina's beautiful hymns. In Matthew l2:34, Jesus said: \"Out \nof the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.\" Lina Sandell \nBerg's voice spoke more than 650 hymns from a heart filled abundantly \nwith love for her Saviour. In one of them, \"Day by Day,\" she had this \nto say:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Day by day and with each passing moment, \u0014\nStrength I find to meet my trials here; \u0014\nTrusting in my Father's wise bestowment, \u0014\nI've no cause for worry or for fear.\" \u0014\n-----------\u0014\n* Fanny Crosby was a blind American hymnwriter who wrote the \nequivalent of seventeen books of hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.

    "words": "Lottie Moon Defied \nMale-Dominated Southern Baptists \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid McCollum\u0014\nTuesday, May 15, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nFor almost a century, Lottie Moon has been a major icon for \nfundraising for bold mission efforts by the Southern Baptist \nConvention. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe is hailed as a late 19th- and early 20th-century pioneer for \nefforts on the foreign mission field, particularly to China.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was also one of the most instrumental figures in the formation of \nthe Woman's Missionary Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoon was philosophically a 21st-century woman who craftily advanced \nher cause in a 19th-century patriarchal society, according to Regina \nSullivan, a professor at Berkeley College in New York who recently \npublished a biography about the missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoon was a powerfully independent woman and a stark departure from  \nand often a nuisance to  what was considered appropriate in a \nmale-dominated culture, both theologically and professionally.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan described the missionary as a \"defiant pioneer,\" one who \nwould be described as a feminist in the modern culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan was a featured speaker at the recent Cooperative Baptist \nFellowship of Arkansas Assembly in Little Rock and wove a lecture on \nMoon's life into the general theme of women in ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan maintains, through extensive research for her book \"Lottie \nMoon: A Southern Baptist Missionary to China in History and Legend,\" \nthat Moon was a strong proponent of perfect equality with men with no \nrestrictions on women and ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She behaved as if she had equality with men and became the most \npopular and respected missionary among Southern Baptists,\" Sullivan \nsaid. \"The irony is that her name has been used to raise money for \nSouthern Baptist mission efforts while the denomination's leaders \nhave maintained a policy of women being subservient to men.  Her \nlife has been interpreted and used for institutional purposes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan said the missionary was actually a rebel in a society in \nwhich women, and particularly single women such as Moon, weren't \nallowed to preach, teach and serve as evangelists to men.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She broke with tradition,\" Sullivan said. \"Her behavior blurred \nboundaries of what was proper.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan said Moon, often defying established policies, preached to \nand taught men and women of difference races deep into the mainland \nof China.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She decided that her calling was not tied down to petty work of \ntending a few girls,\" Sullivan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan said Moon moved 150 miles into the interior of China to live \nalone with the natives and to engage in evangelism without \nboundaries. Denomination leaders considered that approach \"irregular.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She said her responsibility was to God, not to man,\" said Sullivan. \n\"She had sole responsibility for territory deep in the interior of \nChina. There she could operate by her own rules of appropriate \nbehavior.  She lived by her conscience and stepped beyond boundaries \nof perceived female behavior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan maintains that Southern Baptist leaders have used inaccurate \naccounts of her death on Christmas Eve in order to create a legend of \nmartyrdom to fuel their fundraising efforts for foreign missions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe legend holds that Moon starved herself to death as a sacrifice so \nthat more money and food could be used by the Chinese, who were \nsuffering from a great famine.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat legend has, for almost a century, been highlighted by the Lottie \nMoon Christmas Offering, the SBC's largest single source of mission \nfunding.\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan maintains, from her research, that Moon actually died from \nan infection, the effects of dementia and subsequent loss of \nappetite; her medical needs were carefully attended to until her \ndeath by professional doctors and nurses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She didn't starve to death to help with relief,\" Sullivan said. \"She \ndidn't seem to view her life and career as a sacrifice, but that God \ncould use her life to the fullest under the circumstances.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSullivan said that Moon's example inspired more women to be more \nactive publicly in missions and evangelism, which led to the creation \nof the WMU as an organization that operated beyond the parameters of \nSBC agencies.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1890, echoing the sentiments of a delegate at a Foreign Mission \nBoard meeting, the Baptist Foreign Mission Journal described Moon as \n\"the greatest man among our missionaries.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid McCollum is a contributing editor to EthicsDaily.com.\u0014",

    "title": "LIBERATION AS A DEATH SENTENCE",
    "words": "June 10, 2012 New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nLiberation as Death Sentence\u0014\n\u0014\nBy JENNIFER SCHUESSLER\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Civil War History published a paper this spring raising the \nconflicts military death toll to 750,000 from 620,000, that \njournals editors called it one of the most important pieces of \nscholarship ever to appear in its pages. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut to Jim Downs, an assistant professor of history at Connecticut \nCollege and the author of the new book Sick From Freedom, issued \nlast month by Oxford University Press, that accounting of what he \ncalls the largest biological crisis of the 19th century does not go \nnearly far enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo understand the wars scale and impact truly, Professor Downs \nargues, historians have to look beyond military casualties and \nconsider the public health crisis that faced the newly liberated \nslaves, who sickened and died in huge numbers in the years following \nLincolns 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. \u0014\n\u0014\nWere getting ready to celebrate 150 years of the movement from \nslavery to freedom, he said in a recent interview at a cafe near his \napartment in Chelsea. But hundreds of thousands of people did not \nsurvive that movement. \u0014\n\u0014\nSick From Freedom, at 178 pages (not counting 56 pages of tightly \nargued footnotes), may seem like a bantamweight in a field crowded \nwith doorstops. But its already being greeted as an important \nchallenge to our understanding of an event that scholars and \nlaypeople alike have preferred to see as an uplifting story of newly \nliberated people vigorously claiming their long-denied rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe freed people we want to see are the ones with all their \nbelongings on the wagon, heading toward freedom, said David W. \nBlight, a professor of history at Yale and the director of the Gilder \nLehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition. \nBut the truth is, for every person making it there may have been one \nfalling by the way. \u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor Downs, 39, is part of a wave of scholars who are sketching \nout a new, darker history of emancipation, Professor Blight said, one \nthat recognizes it as a moral watershed while acknowledging its often \ndevastating immediate impact. And the statistics offered in Sick \nfrom Freedom are certainly sobering, if necessarily tentative. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt least one quarter of the four million former slaves got sick or \ndied between 1862 and 1870, Professor Downs writes, including at \nleast 60,000 (the actual number is probably two or three times \nhigher, he argues) who perished in a smallpox epidemic that began in \nWashington and spread through the South as former slaves traveled in \nsearch of work  an epidemic that Professor Downs says he is the \nfirst to reconstruct as a national event. \u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians of the Civil War have long acknowledged that two-thirds of \nall military casualties came from disease rather than heroic battle. \nBut they have been more reluctant to dwell on the high number of \nnewly emancipated slaves that fell prey to disease, dismissing \nearlier accounts as propaganda generated by racist 19th-century \ndoctors and early-20th-century scholars bent on arguing that blacks \nwere biologically inferior and unsuited to full political rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, historians who came of age during the civil rights movement \nemphasized ways in which the former slaves asserted their agency, \nplaying as important a role in their own liberation as Lincoln or the \nUnion army. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor so long, people were afraid to talk about freed peoples \nhealth, Professor Downs said. They wanted to talk about agency. But \nif you have smallpox, you dont have agency. You cant even get out \nof bed. \u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor Downs first became interested in the health of newly \nliberated slaves when he was a graduate student at Columbia \nUniversity with a job as a research assistant in the papers of \nHarriet Jacobs, the author of the 1861 autobiography Incidents in \nthe Life of a Slave Girl and a vivid chronicler of the often abysmal \nconditions in the contraband camps where escaped slaves congregated \nduring the war and in settlements of freed people more generally \nafter it. The papers were full of heart-wrenching encounters with \nsick and dying freed people  references that he noticed were \nstrikingly absent in recent scholarship. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs he developed the topic into his dissertation, Professor Downs \nrecalls sparring with his adviser, Eric Foner, the author of the \nclassic book Reconstruction: Americas Unfinished Business, \n1863-1877.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would joke: Look in my index. You dont even see smallpox,  \nProfessor Downs said. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut as he sorted through the little-explored records of the medical \ndivision of the Freedmens Bureau and other archives, he found reams \nof statistical and anecdotal accounts of sick and dying freed people, \nwhose suffering was seen by even some sympathetic Northern reformers \nas evidence that the race was doomed to extinction. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile tallies of the smaller number of white smallpox victims \nwere kept only lackadaisically and eventually crossed out all \ntogether  evidence, he argues, that officials were eager to see the \noutbreak as a black epidemic not worth bothering about. (By \ncontrast a cholera outbreak in 1866 that mainly affected whites was \nvigorously combated, he notes.) \u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor Downs also found a medical system that was less concerned \nwith healing the sick than with separating out healthy workers who \ncould be sent back to the fields, and then closing the hospitals as \nquickly as possible. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an e-mail Professor Foner praised Sick From Freedom as offering \na highly original perspective that deserves wide attention. And \nProfessor Downs makes no bones about wanting to place health issues \nat the center of multiple scholarly conversations about the war and \nits aftermath. \u0014\n\u0014\nI wanted to say, Youre not allowed to do the history of labor or \nthe history of the family or the history of citizenship unless you go \nthrough my book,  he said. I wanted to be able to tell a story \nabout these peoples lives that wouldnt get pushed aside as \nmelodrama. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe is also not shy about drawing out his works contemporary \nrelevance. His dissertation included an epilogue about AIDS, another \nepidemic, he said, that broke out shortly after a moment of \nliberation (in this case of gay people), was blamed on the victims \nand was largely ignored by the federal government. (He dropped the \npoint from the book, which instead ends with an epilogue showing how \npolicies developed in the post-Civil War South were exported to the \nWestern frontier, with similarly devastating health consequences for \nAmerican Indians.) \u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor Downs also sees parallels with the current health care \ndebate. Freed slaves, he writes in the book, were the first \nadvocates of federal health care  a statement that could be read \nfrom the left as an example of early black political activism, or \nfrom the right as an instance of newly liberated people immediately \nasking for a government handout. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat second reading was one he initially worried about, Professor \nDowns said. But he ultimately just let the historical chips fall \nwhere they may. \u0014\n\u0014\nIve been alone with these people in the archives, he said. I have \na responsibility to tell their stories.\u0014",

    "words": "Lost Christianities: Christian Scriptures and the Battles over \nAuthentication\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Struggle Within Christianity \u0014\n \u0014\nMany of the struggles of early Christians were not against pagans or \nother nonbelievers but against other Christians. Some of these groups \nwere:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ebionites were Jewish Christians who followed Jewish laws but \naccepted Jesus as the Messiah without believing he was divine. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Marcionites rejected Judaism completely to the extent that they \nbelieved that the God of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus were \ntwo separate Gods. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the Gnostics believed that there was one true God but that there \nwere also many other deities. In addition, they thought salvation \ncame not from Christ's death and resurrection but from secret \nknowledge, or gnosis, of who one really was, where one came from, and \nhow one could return to the heavenly home. \u0014\n\u0014\nSurprising \"Other\" Gospels, and a Remarkable Archaeological Find \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the Scriptures that were read and considered authoritative by \nthese Christian sects now are either known or believed to be \n\"pseudepigrapha\"forgeries written in the names of famous apostles. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever their origins, these documents can be viewed as lost \nversions of the New Testament. They provide a fascinating opportunity \nto study little known and sometimes controversial Scriptures that \nmight have become part of the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gnostic Gospel of Truth is one of the most powerful and moving \nexpositions of the joy of salvation to survive from Christian \nantiquity. Ironically, its views are diametrically opposed to those \nthat dominate Christian belief today. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Infancy Gospels, such as the Proto-Gospel of James and the \nInfancy Gospel of Thomas, describe events leading up to Jesus' birth \nand during his young childhood. Scholars are unsure whether they were \nmeant to be taken seriously or merely served as entertaining fictions \nabout a period of Christ's life for which other Scriptures provide \nlittle or no information. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, unlike the book of Acts that is \nin the New Testament, focus on the lives and exploits of individual \napostles. They provide legendary, imaginative, and entertaining \naccounts of the activities of Jesus' closest followers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the Scriptures you will study are two that have gained a \nmeasure of notoriety. The Coptic Gospel of Thomas is the one Gospel \noutside the New Testament that has caused the greatest stir among \nscholars and public alike. Purporting to be written by the twin \nbrother of Jesus, it consists of 114 secret sayings of Jesus that are \nthe keys to eternal life. \u0014\n\u0014\nCould this be related to the sources from which the Gospels of \nMatthew and Luke were written? Or is it a Gnostic Scripture that was \ndrafted later? Professor Ehrman weighs in with his and other \nscholars' best guesses. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven more tantalizing, perhaps, is The Secret Gospel of Mark. \nEvidence for this remarkable documenta possible second Gospel by \nMark, written specifically for the spiritual elitewas discovered by \na highly respected authority on Christian antiquity, Morton Smith. \u0014\n\u0014\nSmith's discovery may truly be an astonishing find. Then again, it \nmay be an amazing feat of forgery. Adding to the mystery is the fact \nthat the letter has been locked away in a library in Jerusalem and is \nunavailable for analysis by other scholars. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn these lectures you will also hear about a remarkable \narchaeological event: the discovery in 1945 of a treasure trove of \nmissing Gnostic Scriptures at Nag Hammadi, an Egyptian village near \nthe city of Luxor. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsisting of 13 leather-bound volumes unearthed in an ancient grave \nby Bedouin camel drivers (the full story, which you will hear, \nresembles the plot of a bestselling adventure novel), the Nag Hammadi \nLibrary, as it came to be known, was a watershed event in the search \nfor lost Christianities. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt proved to be an invaluable collection of original writings by \nGnostic Christians. Scholars had known many of these only through \nreferences in written attacks against the Gnostics by such church \nfathers as Tertullian of Carthage (A.D. 200) and Hippolytus of Rome \n(c. A.D. 200). The library verified much that had been known about \nGnosticism but also revealed significant misconceptions.\u0014",

    "words": "Granddaddy,\u0014\n\u0014\nI am typing on my phone so please forgive my typos and gramatical \nerrors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy got Skippy when he was two or three years old for $1 ( She gave \nhim the show name \"Dollar Man\" that I later changed to \"Wise Guy\"). \nHer horse had died of Melanoma, and she wanted one to ride. He was \nraised on a farm that raised pure bred Trakehners only. His mother \nwas so mean that she bit off part of his ear when he was a baby. When \nAmy first met Skippy two men walked him out (one on each side) with \ntwo Chains across his nose. He was constantly jumping out of his \npasture that had 6 foot tall fences, and the woman was tired of \ndealing with his escape tactics. Amy thought she was going to die \nwhen she went into his stall the first time because he was kicking in \nall directions. She ended up pinned underneath a food bucket on the \nwall.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is pretty safe to assume that Skippy experienced multiple forms of \nabuse in his life and it started when he was a foal. Warm bloods are \nenergetic and they mature at a slower rate, but they aren't usually \naggressive. If handled properly, they make wonderful horses and are \ntop notch athletes. Almost all of the olympic horses are warm bloods. \nEveryone that works with them knows that you never try to beat one up \nthough. They remember it, and they will fight back. They do not react \nthe same way that a quarter horse or thoroughbred might and shy away \nor submit to the abuse. They are very smart horses and it is \nunfortunate when they are subject to such ignorant minds that think \npitch forks or hitting is a way of \"training\".\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is pretty easy to see why Skippy has never trusted men. He is also \nvisibly on edge around really loud or deep voiced people too. His \nears lay flat back on his head to this day the minute he hears Dr. \nDoug Daniel's voice. After all of his dealings with vets, he never \nonce questioned or challenged his female vet Dr. Heather Caplan.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe longer he has been in our family, the more comfortable he has \nbecome with people in general. That is just proof that rehabilitation \ncan occur with abused animals. It started out by me gaining his \ntrust, and then he SLOWLY began to trust that everyone I brought \naround him was safe too. I think he knew I wouldnt let anyone hurt \nhim. No horse just chooses to hate a specific gender. They don't \nthink that way. It is the result of a bad interaction that spawns \nthat. He knows that no one has laid a hand on him for over 15 years, \nand he is in a safe place now. He will never like Dr. Daniels though! \nHa!\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy has never been heard from again. She was a very flaky individual \nand I believe she may have had some psychological problems herself, \nbut that is just a guess. I will forever be grateful for her though, \nand for her going bankrupt! Her loss was my gain.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nSkippy got along with Amy. He would let her ride him, but they \nweren't a good match. Amy was very loud and full of drama. Skippy was \nalways on edge around her and this often caused him to act up. Plus, \nI believe her boyfriend is at least one of the males that hit Skippy. \nI saw him go after him with a pitch fork once. He bragged to me about \ngoing after him with a pitch fork. After giving him a piece of my \nmind, we bought Skippy shortly after and went to a new barn. Amy went \nbankrupt too.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.T. ( Just Tempt Me) was the bay quarter horse/thoroughbred cross \nthat my Dad bought for Lindsey and me. He was a sweet horse and very \nskinny when we got him. Once we fattened him up he was a very \ndifferent horse that bolted randomly and trampled everything in his \nway! It was too bad he turned crazy on us. We loved him anyway and \ntried to correct the issue, but it kept getting worse. I often wonder \nif Amy's boyfriend wasn't behind any of this behavioral issue too. I \nhope he found a nice home. We sold him to a horse trader who wanted \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of these days, I hope to make a book about my Jazzy girl too. She \nhas been gone a year this month (8/12), and I still look for her in \nher pasture when I drive up. She was a sweet mare despite her diva \nside. Justin likes to say she was \"his girl\" because I taught him \nabout leading, grooming, and basic horse handling with her. They got \nalong well. My only regret with her was that we never bred her. The \ntiming (college, moving to Arlington, etc) combined with a lack of \nfinancial resources on my part were the issue. Babies need lots of \nattention, but I wish we had bred her to a black and white warm blood \nstallion. That would have been a gorgeous baby!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLove,\u0014\nLauren\u0014",

    "words": "October 14, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nLife lessons learned from the lottery\u0014\n\u0014\nMcNay's Musings     By Don McNay       Richmond Register Columnist \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRICHMOND  Im just a lonely pilgrim.\u0014\nI walk this world in wealth\u0014\nwant to know if its you I dont trust\u0014\ncause I damn sure dont trust myself\u0014\n\u0014\n Bruce Springsteen\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do people run through large sums of money quickly?\u0014\n\u0014\nIve devoted over 30 years of my life finding the answer to this \nquestion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you hear about Powerball Jack Whitaker running through the \nmillions that he received from the lottery or Alan Iverson, who has \nnone of the $154 million he made as a professional basketball star, \nyou wonder what happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not just famous people who do stupid things with their money. \nIts everyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nA report by the National Endowment for Financial Education said that \n70 percent who receive a lump sum, from any source run through it in \na few years.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor over 30 years, Ive worked with injury victims, lottery winners \nor people getting an inheritance. At first, I thought that the \nproblem was people getting too much money too quickly. I assumed that \ncontrolling the flow of money, such as giving them monthly payments \nfor a lifetime, would keep them in line.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a little more complicated than that.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople blow through money for five different reasons.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Family and friends. People try to buy love and friendship or \nthey feel compelled to show off by buying houses, cars, clothes and \nitems. As Will Rogers used to say, They are spending money they \ndont have to impress people they dont know.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Bad habits, bad advisors, lack of knowledge. People who spend more \nthan they make will not suddenly be cured when they get a lump sum \nof money. In fact, whatever problems they had will now be magnified \nby having more money to get in more trouble with.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Taking the money in a lump sum. Social Security, defined benefit \npension plans and many other programs pay out money over a lifetime \ninstead of in a lump sum. They know that people will run through a \nlump sum quickly and be broke. Im in the structured settlement and \nannuity business and have been successful as I am not a peddler of \nproducts; I am a hard core, true believer. I know the people who are \nhappiest are those who have a monthly check coming in that they can \ncount on.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. They dont think before they act. People make impulse decisions. \nThey think they can pay something off over time. Then time runs out \non their money.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Not having a purpose for their money. My father was a professional \ngambler and owned bars. As a child, it would stun me to see men who \nhad toiled all week in a steel mill or hard-labor job come into a bar \nand gamble a weeks pay in one night. The workers knew how to make \nmoney, but had no purpose for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaking sure that I never have to worry about money in old age is a \npurpose. Making sure my children and grandchildren are educated is a \npurpose. Giving to causes I support is a purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlowing money aimlessly is not a purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wrote a bestselling book about lottery winners. I tell people to do \nfive things if they find out they hit the jackpot:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Never tell anyone you won. If you live in a state where you can \ncollect the money anonymously, do so.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Dont make any quick decisions. Take some time and put together a \nplan.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Take the money in payments instead of a lump sum.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Talk to experts who have worked with more money than you have. If \nyou win $100 million, find advisors who have received $150 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving made the connection that people who get any kind of lump sum \nhave the same problems that lottery winners do, Ive taken the advice \nfor lottery winners and distilled it into practical advice, \ncommentary and insights that the average person can use.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Springsteen noted in his song Brilliant Disguise, many people \ndont trust themselves. With money or anything else.\u0014",

    "words": "Appropriate and acceptable lifestyle for Christians during this \ntwenty-first century continues to concern us. At the time when Paul \nwas writing his letters and while the Four Gospels were being formed, \nnew religious communities of followers of Jesus self-consciously \nidentifying themselves as separate from other religious communities \nhad the responsibility of determining what lifestyle was appropriate \nand acceptable for themselves. From the evidence that we have in the \ndocuments within the Newer Testament, it is likely that more than any \nother individual within these communities Paul was instrumental in \nshaping the lifestyle of the people within these new communities of \nfaith. \u0014\n\u0014\nPaul was instrumental in this regard during his lifetime and again \nlate in the first century when many of his letters that he had sent \nto five specific house church communities and to one individual, \nPhilemon, were gathered together, edited by several persons within \nthe Pauline communities, and circulated more widely. We are beginning \nto realize that Paul was probably more instrumental in shaping the \nlifestyle of early followers of Jesus than he was in establishing \ntheir theology. Because Paul's letters, as collected, edited, and \ndistributed within the developing followers of Jesus, have continued \nin use as sacred Scriptures, they, more than any other parenetic \nmaterial, have continued to determine what shall be appropriate and \nacceptable behavior for Christians. The Epistle to the Philippians \nand the segments of Philippians to be read within our congregations \nat worship next Sunday are important evidence of lifestyle \nconsiderations in Paul's letters as they have been brought to us \nwithin our Christian tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin Philippians 4:4-7, 8-9, and 10-13 Paul alternates repeatedly \nbetween telling his hearers how they should live and why they should \nlive that way. In eager expectation they should \"Rejoice in the \nLord!\" and their gentle graciousness should be apparent to all \npeople. This is necessary because \"The Lord is at hand!\" They should \nnot be anxious about anything, even though Paul himself is now a \nprisoner of the Roman state, and it is likely that the Roman state \nwill execute him for proclaiming that Jesus raised from the dead \nrather than Caesar is Lord and ruler \"above the earth, on the earth, \nand under the earth.\" It was the conviction and proclamation of Paul \nthat Jesus as the Christ rather than Caesar is Lord and ruler on the \nearth that was so objectionable to the zealous advocates of Roman \nCivil Religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese were the men who had made Paul their prisoner and would soon be \nbringing him into a Roman court and charging him with proclaiming \nsomeone other than Caesar as Lord and ruler within the Roman state. \nIf Paul had proclaimed Jesus rather than Caesar as Lord in the \nheavens and in the graves under the surface of the earth, the zealous \nadvocates of Roman Civil Religion who had power and wealth because of \ntheir loyalty to the Roman state would not have been concerned. It \nwas Paul's proclamation that Jesus the Risen Christ is Lord and ruler \non the earth and the fact that significant and increasing numbers of \nGreeks were acclaiming this also that was alarming to the zealous \nGreeks who had responsibilities to maintain Roman sovereignty in \ntheir areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly 2,000 years after Paul had been killed by the Romans, it was \nthe Lutheran pastors in the so-called Confessing Church in Germany \nwho proclaimed that Jesus as the Risen Christ rather than Adolf \nHitler was Lord and ruler on the earth in Germany who were oppressed \nby the Nazis. The much larger number of Lutheran pastors who \nproclaimed that Jesus as the Risen Christ was Lord and ruler in the \nheavens above the earth and in the graves under the earth, but \naccepted Adolf Hitler as the Lord and ruler on the earth were praised \nby the Nazis, but discredited after Germany was defeated at the end \nof World War II.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegardless of what may happen to him and to them, Paul wrote that the \npeace of God will keep their hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Paul \nin Philippians 4, gently guided the Philippians to follow the model \nof his own lifestyle as they waited with eager expectation for the \ncoming of the Lord. It was clear to Paul that the Lord will surely \ncome, whether he and they live or die. So also it is for us.\u0014",

    "words": "Los Angeles Cardinal Hid Abuse, Files Show\u0014\nBy IAN LOVETT\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: January 21, 2013   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nLOS ANGELES  The retired archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger \nM. Mahony, and other high-ranking clergymen in the archdiocese worked \nquietly to keep evidence of child molesting away from law enforcement \nofficials and shield abusive priests from criminal prosecution more \nthan a decade before the scandal became public, according to \nconfidential church records. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe documents, filed in court as part of lawsuit against the \narchdiocese and posted online by The Los Angeles Times on Monday, \noffer the clearest glimpse yet of how the archdiocese dealt with \nabusive priests in the decades before the scandal broke, including \nCardinal Mahonys personal involvement in covering up their crimes.\u0014\n \u0014\nRather than defrocking priests and contacting the police, the \narchdiocese sent priests who had molested children to out-of-state \ntreatment facilities, in large part because therapists in California \nwere legally obligated to report any evidence of child abuse to the \npolice, the files make clear. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1986, Cardinal Mahony wrote to a New Mexico treatment center where \none abusive priest, Msgr. Peter Garcia, had been sent. \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that if Monsignor Garcia were to reappear here within the \narchdiocese we might very well have some type of legal action filed \nin both the criminal and civil sectors, Cardinal Mahony wrote. \u0014\n\u0014\nMonsignor Garcia admitted to abusing more than a dozen young boys, \nmost of them from families of illegal immigrants, since he was \nordained in 1966, and in at least one case he threatened to have a \nboy he had molested deported if he talked about it, according to \ndocuments filed in court. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was never criminally prosecuted, and has since died. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 1987 letter regarding the Rev. Michael Baker, who had also been \nsent for treatment in New Mexico after admitting that he had abused \nyoung boys, Msgr. Thomas J. Curry wrote to Cardinal Mahony that he \nis very aware that what he did comes within the scope of the criminal \nlaw in California. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is surprising the counselor he attended in California did not \nreport him, and we agreed it would be better if Mike did not return \nto him, the letter continued. It would be decades before Father \nBaker was convicted of sexually abusing children. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a written statement released on Monday, Cardinal Mahony, who took \nover the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in 1985 and retired in 2011, \napologized to the victims of the sexual abuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nVarious steps toward safeguarding all children in the church began \nhere in 1987 and progressed year by year as we learned more about \nthose who abused and the ineffectiveness of so-called treatments at \nthe time, the statement said. Nonetheless, even as we began to \nconfront the problem, I remained nave myself about the full and \nlasting impact these horrible acts would have on the lives of those \nwho were abused by men who were supposed to be their spiritual \nguides. \u0014\n\u0014\nCardinal Mahony said he came to understand that impact only two \ndecades later, when he met with almost 100 victims of sexual abuse by \npriests under his charge. He now keeps an index card for each one of \nthose victims, praying for each one every day, he said in the \nstatement. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a phone interview, J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer for the \narchdiocese, said that the documents represented the beginnings of \nthe awakening of the archdiocese of these kinds of problems, and \nthat the lessons learned in the intervening decades helped shape the \ncurrent policy, under which all accusations of abuse are reported to \nthe police and all adults who supervise children are fingerprinted \nand subjected to background checks. \u0014\n\u0014\nLawyers for some of the priests accused of abuse fought in court to \nkeep the documents and many others confidential. But over the coming \nweeks, many more church records will also be released as part of a \nsettlement between some of the victims and the archdiocese.\u0014\n\u0014\nRay Boucher, a lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs in those \ncases, said the files released on Monday were particularly damning, \nbecause they showed the wanton disregard for the health and safety \nof children, and a decision by the highest members of the church to \nput its self-interest and the interest of abusive priests ahead of \nthose of children. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Boucher added, I think when the full light is shown, the public \nwill begin to understand just how deep a problem this is.\u0014",

The Rev. Rob Morris, pastor of Christ the King \nLutheran Church, prayed at the Dec. 16 vigil -- which was hosted by \nthe Newtown Interfaith Clergy Association and attended by Connecticut \nGov. Dannel Malloy and President Obama --alongside other Christian, \nMuslim, Jewish and Baha'i clergy. Morris' church is a member of the \nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod denomination, whose constitution \nprohibits ministers from participating in services with members of \ndifferent faiths.\u0014\n\u0014\n LCMS president Matthew Harrison wrote in a letter to the Synod that \n\"the presence of prayers and religious readings\" made the Newtown \nvigil joint worship, and therefore off-limits to Missouri Synod \nministers. Harrison said Morris' participation also offended members \nof the denomination. \"After consultation with my supervisors and \nothers, I made my own decision,\" Morris wrote in his apology letter. \n\"I believed my participation to be, not an act of joint worship, but \nan act of community chaplaincy.\" Harrison wrote in his letter that \ndespite his reprimand of Morris, the Missouri Synod does not \nunanimously agree on what joint worship is. The denomination is still \nattempting to define it.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublication date: February 8, 2013\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Newtown reprimand was not the first time a pastor from the \nMissouri Synod has been chastised for taking part in an interfaith \nservice after a national tragedy. In the weeks after the Sept. 11 \nattacks, the Rev. David H. Benke, the pastor of St. Peters Lutheran \nChurch in Brooklyn and the equivalent of a bishop in the church \nhierarchy, was suspended from ministry for taking part in a huge \ninterfaith prayer service held at Yankee Stadium. \u0014\nMr. Benke had broken the First Commandment  I am the Lord thy God \n by worshiping with pagans, including Muslim, Sikh and Hindu \nclergy members, the Rev. Wallace Schulz, a senior official of the \nchurch, said then. Mr. Benke refused to apologize, and was cleared by \na church panel in 2003 and permitted to return to ministry. \u0014\nAsked for comment on the Newtown situation on Thursday, Mr. Benke \nsaid he did not agree with the denominations decision to ask Mr. \nMorris to apologize\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Times, 2/8/13\u0014",

    "words": "Learning \nPatience\u0014\n\u0014\nI spent an entire year of my life learning patience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat may sound funny, and you may immediately think, Ha! Ive spent \nmy entire life learning patience, and I still dont get it. And \nyoud be correct. Im still learning. But there was a year of my life \nwhere, lesson after lesson, I started to realize that the intended \ngoal of these lessons was to teach me patience.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt night, I would lie in bed, tense from the frustrations of the day. \nSomeone wasnt doing something on my timing, or the way I wished them \nto. Someone hadnt called or I had forgotten something. Regardless of \nwhat happened, the result was the same. I ended my days frustrated \nand asking, Why?!\u0014\n\u0014\nSilly me to assume I deserved an immediate answer to my rather \nridiculous questions. And crazy me to feel like I was in a place to \ndemand such answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year of Learning Patience (as I call it) stripped me of these \ndarker human emotions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it took a conversation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMe: I just dont get it! Why?! Ive thought about it over and over, \nand it doesnt make sense. AND IVE PRAYED FOR IT.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are you praying for?\u0014\n\u0014\nMe: PATIENCE.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriend: Youre praying for the wrong thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nMe: .what? How can you pray for the wrong thing? There is no right \nand wrong in prayer and hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriend: If you pray for patience, you are asking God to put trying \nmoments in your life so that you are provided the opportunity to \nlearn and practice patience. You cant just pray for patience and get \nit. You have to do the work in the moments that call for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was the moment that I realized how silly I had been. I thought I \nwas the bigger person praying for patience, when really I was \ngetting exactly what I was praying for and I wasnt listening. I \nwasnt willing to do the work. I wanted patience wrapped in a box \nwith a polka-dotted bow to apply to my life as easily as spritzing \nChanel No. 5 on my neck and wrists before work.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will never forget that year of my life or that conversation. Each \nday that has passed since then, I ask myself what am I really praying \nfor? What am I really in need of? What am I really hoping for? And \nwhy?\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of closing my eyes, clasping my hands and demanding answers \nfrom the man beyond my bedroom ceiling, I started asking myself the \nhard questions. I started to cut away the fat from the meat of the \nsituation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it has made all the difference.\u0014",

A female intern-volunteer was killed \nWednesday by a lion at a private wild animal park in Central \nCalifornia, and state and local authorities were trying to determine \nwhat might have caused the fatal attack.\u0014\n\u0014\nCat Haven founder and executive director Dale Anderson was crying as \nhe read a one-sentence statement about the fatal mauling at the \nexotic animal zoo he has operated since 1993.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 26-year-old intern was attacked and killed when she entered the \nlion's enclosure, Anderson said, but he refused to answer questions \nor provide more details.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheriff's deputies responding to an emergency call from Cat Haven, in \nthe Sierra Nevada foothills about 45 miles east of Fresno, found the \nwoman severely injured and still lying inside the enclosure with the \nlion nearby, Fresno County sheriff's Lt. Bob Miller said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother park worker had unsuccessfully tried luring the lion away and \ninto a separate pen, so deputies shot and killed it so they could \nreach the wounded woman, who died at the scene, Miller said.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigators were trying to determine why the intern was inside the \nenclosure and what might have provoked the attack, sheriff's Sgt. \nGreg Collins said. The facility is normally closed on Wednesdays, and \nonly one other worker was there when the mauling happened, Collins \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe male African lion, a 4-year-old male named Couscous, had been \nraised at Cat Haven since it was a cub, said Tanya Osegueda, a \nspokeswoman for Project Survival, the nonprofit that operates the \nanimal park. Osegueda did not know how the park acquired the cub.\u0014\n\u0014\nCat Haven is a 100-acre facility just west of Kings Canyon National \nPark. Since the property opened in 1993, it has housed numerous big \ncats, including tigers, leopards and other exotic species. It is \npermitted to house exotic animals by the California Department of \nFish and Wildlife and is regulated as a zoo by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\u0014\n\u0014\nResults of the last 13 inspections by the Department of Agriculture's \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service show no violations dating \nback to March 2010. The most recent inspection was Feb. 4, USDA \nrecords show.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite state regulations that require annual inspections, the \nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife most recently inspected \nthe facility in January 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We have to do the best we can with the resources we're provided,\" \nsaid department spokeswoman Jordan Traverso.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inspector's written comments were \"facility in good condition.\" \nThe inspector checked gates, enclosures, water supplies, drainage, \ncleanliness, ventilation and the general health of the animals.\u0014\n\u0014\nDepartment spokeswoman Janice Mackey said she was unaware if any \nstate regulations would prohibit an employee from entering an exotic \nanimal's enclosure.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said each species is identified on the permit, and the animals \nmust be used for scientific or educational purposes only.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We don't allow them to be used as pets,\" Mackey said.\u0014\n\u0014\nActress Tippi Hedren, who founded the founded the Shambala Preserve \nin Southern California, home to 53 seized or abandoned exotic pets, \nexpressed dismay over the killing of the lion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It wasn't the lion's fault. It's the human's fault always. I've got \n40 years behind me. I know what I'm talking about,\" Hedren said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA movie was made at Shambala several years ago and several people \nwere injured. \"Two were nearly killed,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Lions are one of the four most dangerous animals in the world.

    "title": "LUKE'S ACCOUNT OF THE TRIUMPHAL ENTRY",
    "words": "Luke 19:28-40\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nComparison of the entry into Jerusalem accounts in the Four Gospels \nindicates that only in the latter two (Luke and John) is Jesus \nacclaimed as the King of Israel. Apparently the oppressive Roman \nmilitary forces who occupied and controlled the region during the \nfirst century perceived Jesus to be a political leader who, with the \nsupport of crowds of his fellow oppressed Jews, was a serious \npotential threat to their own security. They did, therefore, what \nthey always did in such situations. They seized the leader of the \noppressed, tortured him privately, and then publicly crucified him to \nshow what they would do to anyone who would be acclaimed as \"King of \nthe Jews.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the political situation in Galilee and Judea at the time of the \ncrucifixion of Jesus, if some of the Pharisees in the crowd urged \nJesus to restrain the members of the crowd from shouting political \nslogans, they were doing so in order to try to protect Jesus himself \nand the other Jewish people from Roman retaliation. Jesus, however, \nis depicted as refusing to restrain the crowd.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the most significant redactions of the Markan account by the \nLukan writer in this instance is the addition of the Lukan motif of \n\"Peace in heaven and glory in the highest places.\" Also this Lukan \nmotif should ultimately be our focus as we proclaim this text and our \nfaith. The Jesus of history lived this motif. Jesus as the Christ of \nfaith expresses this motif. The Church of Jesus Christ is called to \ndo everything that it can so that there will be peace on earth as \nthere is peace in heaven, to the glory of God. Since only the Lukan \nentry account expresses this motif, it is especially important for us \nto focus on this motif during the years that we use Luke's entry into \nJerusalem account.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those who wrote the Four Gospels, Jesus as the Risen Christ was \nindeed \"Lord.\" In the words of Zechariah 9:9 that they applied to \nJesus, he was in every way triumphant and victorious, subduing and \nriding a young, unbroken colt, and at the same time humble, riding on \na lowly beast of burden. He was their Lord, coming in the name of the \nLord.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the standpoint of the inspired writers of the Newer Testament \ndocuments, what Jesus' followers did proleptically as he entered with \nother pilgrims into Jerusalem to observe the Passover, God did \nactually a few days later by raising Jesus from the dead, highly \nexalting him, and giving him the name that is above every other name. \nGod did this, Paul wrote, so that eventually every knee (including \nthe knee of Caesar) will bend at the name of Jesus, and every tongue \n(including the tongue of Caesar) will confess that Jesus (not Caesar) \nis Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\u0014",

    "title": "LITURGY OF THE PASSION OF JESUS",
    "words": "Luke 22:14--23:56 or Luke 23:1-49\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the great length of this reading, comments here will be \nlimited to four segments of the text that depict various aspects of \nthe suffering of the Jesus of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke 23:1-5, 13-25 (The Trial before Pilate). The specific \naccusations of the entire multitude of elders of the people, chief \npriests and scribes added by the Lukan writer to the Markan account \nof the trial of Jesus before Pilate are strikingly anti-Jewish \nbecause they are presented as obviously false and pernicious charges. \nAccording to this Lukan account, the purpose of Jesus had always been \nto bring peace to Jerusalem and to the nations of the world. It had \nnever been to pervert the Jewish nation, as the religious leaders of \nJesus' own people are depicted in this trial scene as accusing Jesus \nof doing. According to the Synoptic tradition accounts, Jesus had \nadvocated the paying of tribute to Caesar and had not called himself \na king or a Jewish Messiah. Among the Synoptic accounts, only Luke \npresents the accusations recorded in Luke 23:2. According to the Luke \n23:4, 14-16 account, the Roman official (Pilate) declared Jesus to be \ninnocent of the charges brought against him, but the religious \nleaders of Jesus' own people charged repeatedly that Jesus had been \nagitating the people throughout the land. Only Luke specified that \nthe voice of the Jewish religious leaders prevailed and that Pilate \ndelivered Jesus over to their will (Luke 23:23-25).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe impression is thereby given that not the Romans but the chief \npriests and the rulers and the Jewish people took Jesus away and \ncrucified him. Since no new subject of the verb is introduced in Luke \n23:26, the antecedent of the unexpressed subject of the verb in Luke \n23:26 and elsewhere in this section appears to be the Jewish \nauthorities and the Jewish people listed in Luke 23:13. By omitting \nall of the Markan and Matthean references to Jesus being mocked by \nthe Roman military personnel (Mark 15:16-20a; Matthew 27:27-31a) \ngrammatically the antecedent of the unexpressed subject of the verb \nin Luke 23:25 and in other verbs that follow is not the Roman \nsoldiers, whom the Lukan writer does not introduce until 23:36, but \nthe Jews. In this manner, the Lukan writer achieved a consistency \nwith the charges made by the same Lukan writer in Acts 2:22-23 and \n7:52-58 that the Jews betrayed and murdered Jesus, the Righteous One. \nThe impression is given, therefore, that anti-Jewish invective was \nmore important for the Lukan writer in some instances than was \nhistorical clarity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the interests of historical accuracy and (belatedly) of justice, \nwe should also specify the subject in Luke 23:26 as \"the Roman \nsoldiers\" from Mark 15:16 and Matthew 27:27 and from what is known \nfrom other sources about execution practices of the Roman occupation \nforces, so that the subsequent unexpressed subjects of verbs in the \ncrucifixion proceedings in Luke will refer back to Roman military \nofficials rather than to Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Lukan writer's earliest readers were well aware that \ncrucifixion was a Roman prerogative used effectively to discourage \nopposition and revolt in the various provinces of the Roman Empire, \nmost Christians who read Luke today do not know the extent to which \nthe Roman military used crucifixion in executing leaders of oppressed \npeople whom they perceived to be threats to their security. Most \nChristians today focus only on the crucifixion of Jesus. They do not \nrealize that the title that the Romans placed over Jesus on the \ncross, \"the King of the Jews,\" had probably been used many times by \nthe Romans before the day when they used it to apply to Jesus in \norder to transmit clearly to the Jewish people that \"This is what we \ndo to your leaders! This is what we will do to any of you who will \ntry to lead your oppressed people and gain popular support that may \nbe used against us!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis type of careful attention to context in translation will \npartially counteract the popular supposition among many Christians \neven in our time that \"the Jews\" killed Jesus. Actually, most of the \nJews who were aware of Jesus and knew what the Roman occupation \nforces were doing to Jesus on the day of his crucifixion grieved \nbitterly that another of their leaders in whom they had hope was \nbeing shamefully tortured and executed by the hated Romans and that \nthere was nothing short of suicidal action that they could do about \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis kind of sensitive translation is essential in our time. Since we \nhave ample evidence of these serious instances of anti-Jewish biases \nin Luke-Acts, it is our responsibility as spiritual descendants of \nthe Lukan writer to counter these biases by sensitive translation and \nusage. As Paul M. van Buren put it in his Discerning the Way: A \nTheology of the Jewish Christian Reality (New York: Seabury, 1980, \npp. 47-48), \"John Chrysostom in the fourth century, for example, or \nMartin Luther in the sixteenth, never conceived that their vile words \non the subject of the Jews would help significantly to produce a \nclimate which a later pagan ruler would take advantage of in order to \ndestroy six million of God's people,\" and \"If? we leave unchallenged \nand do not wipe out the tradition of anti-Judaism which we have \ninherited, we shall have failed those who follow after us. Whatever \nwe may say about the roots and rise of that tradition, we today -- \nafter 1945 -- can no longer continue it.\" The extent to which we as \nChristians today shall be willing to counter the anti-Jewish biases \nthat we see in the Newer Testament within the passion accounts and \nelsewhere will be determined during the coming decades and centuries \nin our preaching and teaching as, led by the Spirit of God, we \ninteract with the living, dynamic Word of God and pass it on to our \nchildren and to their children.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/Liturgy of the passion of Jesus\u0014",

    "title": "LENIN, STALIN, AND HITLER -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "In Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler, Robert Gellately, the Earl Ray \nProfessor of History at Florida State University, has written a \nsobering and chilling account of the unspeakable terror visited upon \nEurope, and indeed upon the entire world, during the first half of \nthe 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe years between 1914 and 1945 witnessed World War I, the Russian \nrevolution and the triumph of Bolshevism, the Great Depression, the \ndictatorships of the Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, World War II, \nthe genocide of the Holocaust, and the construction of the Gulag.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the brutalities of Stalin and Hitler are well known, Gellately \npoints out that a key figure is often neglected or minimized in the \nchronicle of European barbarism: Vladimir Illych Ulyanov, a.k.a. \nLenin.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his famous speech in 1956, which renounced the atrocities of \nStalin and signaled a \"thaw\" in the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev \nclaimed that \"the bad Stalin\" had corrupted \"the good Lenin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Khrushchev trotted out the myth of Lenin the noble and good,\" writes \nGellately, \"to save the 'inner truths' of Communism from association \nwith what were belatedly recognized as 'Stalinist evils.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis myth of the noble and good Lenin, claims Gellately, no longer \nconvinces. Documents from the newly opened Russian archives make \nabundantly clear that Lenin was the most extreme of the radicals, the \nleader who pressed for terror as much as, and probably more, than \nanyone. Far from perverting or undermining Lenin's legacy, as is \nsometimes assumed, Stalin was Lenin's logical heir.\u0014\n\u0014\nGellately began this work as a study of the conflicting ideologies of \nCommunism and Nazism and the murderous rivalries of Stalin and \nHitler. At first, he didn't include Lenin as a major figure. As he \nconducted his research, however, and tried to reconstruct the events \nleading up to World War II, he began to see that much of what he \nwanted to say was inexorably leading back to Lenin and the beginnings \nof the Soviet dictatorship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My book deviates from the standard appraisal,\" he writes, \"by giving \nsignificant attention to Lenin and by putting the story in proper \nchronological sequence.\" Lenin was, says Gellately, \"a heartless and \nambitious individual who was self-righteous in claiming to know what \nwas good for 'humanity,' brutal in his attempt to subject his own \npeople to radical social transformation, and convinced he held the \nkey to the eventual overthrow of global capitalism and the \nestablishment of world Communism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLenin and Stalin were not alone in their utopian visions which turned \nEurope into a dystopia. Adolf Hitler offered his followers a \"Social \nDarwinism,\" a pseudo-scientific philosophy emphasizing a brutal will \nto power, He preached that the historical mission of the \"Aryan \nmaster race\" (Germanic peoples) was to exterminate \"inferior races,\" \nwhich he referred to as \"sub-humans,\" \"parasites,\" \"vermin,\" and \n\"trash.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe brunt of Hitler's wrath was directed against the Jews, who, he \nranted, were responsible for the cowardly \"stab in the back\" at the \nend of World War I, and who, he raved, were the sinister instigators \nof Bolshevism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler includes highlights of military \naction during the Second World War, the lion's share of the book \ndeals with social and political developments in the Soviet Union and \nGermany, and especially with the suffering and death of untold \nmillions of people in the labor camps of the Russian Gulag and the \ndeath camps of Nazi Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nGellately shows how the Holocaust was, and remains, unprecedented. It \nwas (Gellately here quotes Professor Omer Bartov of Brown University) \n\"the industrial killing of millions of human beings in factories of \ndeath ordered by a modern state, organized by a conscientious \nbureaucracy, and supported by a law-abiding, patriotic, 'civilized' \nsociety.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Epilogue, Gellately writes, \"This book is an attempt to record \nthe evils perpetrated by both Soviet Communism and German Nazism and \nto figure out how it came about that, separately and together, the \ntwo systems brought such misery and destruction to the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Roman playwright Plautus (c. 250 B.C.) wrote, \"Lupus est homo \nhomini\" (\"Man is a wolf to man\"). If anyone doubts the truth of this \naphorism, he or she should read Gellately's disturbing volume.\u0014",

Then \nJud upsets the girls by treating them like they were four-year-olds. \nClaudia (the vet) walked between him and Lauren and then Lindsey to \nstop it. Lauren asked Debbie, \"Do you think he got the message?\" He \nhad a plastic container filled with some horse feed, some pictures of \nthe family, a note to the horse, and God knows what else and wanted \nit buried with him. That's fine for a child to do--but a grown man? \u0014\n\u0014\nI was deeply impressed with the fact that after we all gathered \naround and Ryon (their riding instructor) said some nice things about \nBaha, etc., Lindsey led him off from the group to tell him goodbye. \nShe was bawling, of course, while she was walking or standing with \nhim while she was talking to him (and everybody on the place was \ncrying too). But after a few minutes, Lauren couldn't stand it \nanymore seeing her sister in such pain. She walked over to her, put \nher arms around her, knelt together, and they prayed. That's when I \nlost it. They are so close and such good friends. They share each \nother's pain so beautifully. \u0014\nI went to the burial place Wilson had readied. The vet (Claudia) had \ngotten very close to L&L. She was so gentle in putting him down you \nwould have thought it was her horse. They just loved her. The grave \nsite is in a quiet place that Lindsey selected, easily accessible \n(near 1-95) but not so close that she has to look at it every time \nshe goes by there. They cut off some of his mane and removed his \nshoes for Lindsey to keep as a memento of him. I took a beautiful \npicture of her jumping him about six weeks before, and I'm so glad I \ndid. It was sad, but it was a moving thing to watch the two of them. \nThey didn't need any adults around. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilson did a great job at seeing that the site was well prepared. I \ncontinue to be amazed at how he loves those girls. He once told me, \n\"I would give anything to have been their father.\"\u0014",

    "title": "LINCOLN'S NOBLE CHARACTER",
    "words": "Lincolns Noble Character\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished in the January/February 2013 Liberty Magazine by Haven \nBradford Gow\u0014\n\u0014\nTemple University historian Gregory Urwin, in his contribution to \nLincoln and Leadership (Fordham University Press), observes: \"recent \nsurveys reveal that most American historians continue to rate Abraham \nLincoln as the country's best president. This subjective judgment \nhinges primarily on Lincoln's performance as commander in chief in \nthe Civil War, in which he surmounted a host of daunting challenges \nand succeeding in both preserving the Union and destroying slavery.\" \nUrwin refers to Lincoln as \"the greatest war president in American \nhistory. . . . He bore the burden of leading his people through an \nagonizing ordeal, and he attempted to bind the nation's wounds even \nbefore the guns fell silent.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln also displayed nobility of mind, spirit, and character by his \ncourageous opposition to the extension of slavery and to the United \nStates Supreme Court's Dred Scott ruling, that denied equal rights \nand personhood to Black people. Benjamin Tyree, a Washington, D.C., \njournalist, says Lincoln firmly believed in the statement that \"all \nmen are created equal,\" and that \"he referred to this cornerstone of \nthe Declaration of Independence as the central idea of the nation, \nand a part of its actual law as well as its emotional history. On \nthis, finally, hung the moral justification of the Union's crusade to \nforce the South back into the Union, together with the concept of \ncivic virtue embodied in the Union and in its Constitution.\" He adds \nthat \"from the beginning, Lincoln was determined to fight the \nattempt, which was built upon the foundation of human rights.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to journalist Rogert Shogan, author of The Double-edged \nSword: How Character Makes and Ruins Presidents, from Washington to \nClinton (Westview Press), President Lincoln's greatest test of \ncharacter involved the explosive issue of slavery. For Lincoln, \nslavery was a vicious and obscene violation of God-given human rights \nand of the proposition of our founders that \"all men are created \nequal.\" And that is why Lincoln commanded the North to wage war with \nthe South, and why he also issued his Emancipation Proclamation. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Shogan rightly credits Lincoln's nobility of character for his \ncourageous opposition to slavery; he observes: \"to a degree, this was \n. . . a journey of the mind. But it also represented a development of \ncharacter without which Lincoln's intellect could not have made the \nleap from defense of the past to staking out a new vision for the \nRepublic, which would become the legacy of his character to his \ncountry and his successors.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly we desperately need today many more men and women of \nAbraham Lincoln's nobility of mind, spirit, and character.\u0014",

It makes murder not just permissive but obligatory.

Prior to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the Hutus who killed \nTutsis routinely referred to them as \"cockroaches.\" Americans fought \nbarbarian \"Huns\" in World War I and godless \"gooks\" in Vietnam.

    "title": "LUKE'S ACCOUNT OF THE NATIVITY",
    "words": "Luke 2:1-14 (15-20)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis unique and most detailed account of Jesus' birth emerges from \nthe most Gentile-oriented of the gospels. Originally combined with \nActs as its companion volume, it seeks to stress the church's \nuniversal mission to all people (Acts 1:8). As such, the books \ncollectively defend Paul's ministry. Usually they are attributed to \nLuke, a physician and associate of Paul (Colossians 4:14; 2 Timothy \n4:11; Philemon 24), whom tradition claims to have been Gentile. \nAddressed to Theophilus (1:1), which means \"lover of God,\" it is not \nclear if this means the work was written for a recent convert or for \na Roman official from whom the church sought tolerance. It is also \npossible that the author addressed all the faithful under this name.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of what Christians believe about the Christmas story is drawn \nfrom this text. The literary context for the account is said to be a \ncensus called for by Roman Emperor Augustus (who reigned from 27 BC \nto 14 AD) (v. 1). Reference is made to Quirinius, who was Roman \ngovernor of Syria. This raises questions about the date of Jesus' \nbirth or the accuracy of this account, since he was not governor \nduring Herod the Great's reign in Judah (who according to Matthew 2:1 \nwas on the throne of Israel when Jesus was born). Since Herod died in \n4 BC, this seems to move the date of Jesus' birth prior to the \nbeginning of the Christian era. It is also unlikely that spouses like \nMary would have traveled with their husbands to his home of family \norigin unless she owned property in that town (vv. 1-5). This lack of \nhistorical credibility for the account is not surprising, since the \nbirth of Jesus is not even part of the earliest narrative traditions \nabout Jesus (note its omission from Mark's gospel).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen in Bethlehem (the Davidic home to which Joseph as an heir of \nDavid would have traveled [3:23-31]), Mary is reported to have borne \nher firstborn son and laid him in a manger because there was no room \nin the inn (vv. 6-7). It was common in biblical times in Israel for \nowners to reside with their animals. Next follows the report of the \nrevelation of the birth to shepherds. This is most appropriate in \nview of the fact that David was also a shepherd (1 Samuel 17:15), and \nit likewise makes sense given the fact that Luke's gospel is \npreoccupied with concern for the poor and lowly (6:20; 14:12-14; \n16:19-31). The revelation by an angel is said to produce fear \n[phobeo] among these shepherds as they encounter the glory of God \n(they experienced the fear of God) (vv. 8-9). The angel comforts \nthem, bringing the good news of the Messiah, whom they are told they \ncan find in Bethlehem in a manger (v. 12). The angel is then joined \nby a heavenly multitude, presumably other angels [aggeloi], who \npraise God and sing of peace among those he favors (vv. 13-14). (See \nthe discussion above in the notes on the Isaiah text about the term \n\"peace\" [eirene] in a Hebraic context; that the New Testament \ncontinues to employ the term this way is suggested by Rudolf Bultmann \n(Theology of the New Testament, Vol. 2, pp. 82-83).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the angels depart, the shepherds proceed to Bethlehem finding \nMary, Joseph, and the child (vv. 15-17). All who heard the story are \namazed. Mary is said to treasure these words and ponder them (vv. \n18-19). The shepherds then return, glorifying God (v. 20).\u0014\nMark Ellingsen\u0014",

    "words": "Lunches seized from Utah schoolkids \nbecause of unpaid bills\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Henry Austin, NBC News contributor \u0014\n\u0014\nDozens of children at a Utah school had their lunches seized and \nthrown away because they did not have enough money in their accounts, \nprompting an angry response from parents, it was reported.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She took my lunch away and said, 'Go get a milk, Sophia Isom, a \nfifth-grader at Salt Lake Citys Uintah Elementary School, told NBC \naffiliate \\KSL.com. \"I came back and asked, 'What's going on?' Then \nshe handed me an orange. She said, 'You don't have any money in your \naccount so you can't get lunch.\u0014\n\u0014\nUp to 40 kids suffered similar treatment, given fruit and milk as \ntheir lunches were thrown away, \\the station reported. \u0014\n\u0014\nIsom's mom Erica Lukes called the move traumatic and humiliating \nand told the Salt Lake Tribune she was all paid up.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think its despicable,\" she said. \"These are young children that \nshouldnt be punished or humiliated for something the parents \nobviously need to clear up.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSalt Lake City District Spokesperson Jason Olsen told the Tribune \nthat parents had been notified about negative balances on Monday and \na child nutrition manager had decided to withhold lunches to deal \nwith the issue. They were thrown away because once food is served to \none student it cant be served to another, he explained.\u0014\n\u0014\n1/30/14\u0014\n\u0014\nA response:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe school was out of line. What a disgraceful way of handling a \nsituation between the parents and the district. Rather than take it \nup with the parents, and keep it there, they take it out on the \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of making it into a scene, the school should have pulled \naside the children prior to serving them. Now the children will have \nto deal with the humiliation of being publically stripped of their \nlunches in front of their peers. By throwing the food away that was \npreviously given to and then taken from the students, the district \nbasically said \"The trash is better off getting this than you are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReal **** smart, district. Mr. Olsen, you're an idiot. You knew it \nwas wrong and now you should deal with it.\u0014\n\u0014\nPersonally, I think that they should have served the children, and \nthen simply billed the family. I understand that the families already \nhad account issues, but they can take it up and work it out with the \nparents through other means.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo child should go through school without a meal/lunch.\u0014",

    "words": "I have a friend (John Robert McFarland) who lives in the Upper \nPeninsula of Michigan. He used to write for Garrison Keillor's \nPrairie Home Companion. He attaches a bi-line to his emails that \nreads like this:  The place of winter where life is defined by \nwinter even in the summer)?\u0014\n\u0014\nI asked him to tell me more about that reference. This is what he \nwrote. I think it's very interesting. (You may not, but I thought I'd \nshare it.)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we moved to Iron Mountain, following the grandchildren, 7 years \nago, it was in a gorgeous July. Many of our neighbors had converted \ntheir garages into permanent summer houses, with sofas and lamps, \nsitting out every night, usually even without screens, for unlike the \nrest of the UP, Iron Mountain is not troubled by mosquitoes or other \nbitey bugs, because an old mine shaft is home to 50 thousand bats who \ncome out at sunset. They have a comity agreement, fanning out over \nthe whole town to eat the mosquitoes. One named Walter comes to our \nyard each evening. Many houses here don't have air conditioning. Ours \ndoes, but we use it only 3 or 4 days per summer. Otherwise temps are \nin the 70s during the day and 50s at night. In addition to the summer \nhomes in garages, there was not a single porch that did not have at \nleast one big bright hanging basket of flowers that came from a dozen \nor more temporary summer plant stores.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe learned that the hanging plants were because of the deer and \nrabbits, that eat anything that is not out of reach. Folks don't \nbother to plant anything that the deer and rabbits can get to. Also \nwe learned that with hanging plants you get flowers immediately. The \nsummer is too short to wait for flowers to grow out of the ground, \nespecially if you have to fight the deer and rabbits.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that's why I say life is defined by winter here even in the \nsummer. The very first day one can sit out, the garages become summer \nhomes. The very first day hanging pots are available, everyone has \none, without waiting for flowers from the ground. Summer is so \nprecious because it is so short. We have very short springs and \nfalls, 6 weeks at most. We have 6 months of winter. No one wants to \nwaste even one day of summer, for winter is always looking over our \nshoulders.\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS\u0014",

    "title": "LET THERE BE VIOLENCE",
    "words": "Let \nThere Be Violence\u0014\nA growing rift emerges among  evangelicals over how to read the dark \nside of the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Brandon Withrow\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you have to believe in God to be a moral person? According to a \nnew study by Pew's Global Attitudes Project, 53 percent of Americans \nsay yes. The ironic fact of the Bible, however, is that it is full of \nindividuals who believe in God, who act immorally and violently, and \nwhose God appears to bless their actions. Many Christians today are \ncritical of the violence they see in other religions  especially \nIslam  but there's an inescapable cognitive dissonance if you are \nappalled by the violence done in the name of one religion but not by \nthe violence done in the name of your own.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to miss the passage where Moses slaughters 3,000 \nIsraelites for worshipping a golden calf (Exodus 32)  a death toll \ncomparable to September 11. Or the passage telling of Moses' anger \nupon discovering that his army had spared enemy women and children \n(Numbers 31), later commanding them to kill the males and older \nwomen, but keep the virgin girls for themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis disturbing side of the Bible has some Christian academics \ncalling for a more discriminate reading of it. Venturing into \nterritory often reserved for Richard Dawkins  who, in The Virus of \nFaith, compared Moses to Hitler  these Christians offer strong \ncriticisms of the same book they hold sacred.\u0014\n\u0014\nI asked a few of them to explain how they read the Bible's violent \npassages.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday school Samson \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible contains many moments where immoral actions are condemned, \nlike King David's murder of Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, to cover up \ntheir affair (2 Samuel 11). But there are also many passages where \nimmorality is not only not denounced, but celebrated\u0014\n\u0014\nTake, for example, Judges 13-16. If you went to Sunday school, you \nmay remember the story in which God restores the blinded Samson's \nsuper-strength while his Philistine enemies are tying him up during a \nworship service at the temple of Dagon. Samson pulls down the entire \nstructure, killing everyone present, including himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid your Sunday school teacher present Samson as a hero? He was not \nso, says James McGrath, the Clarence L. Goodwin Chair in New \nTestament Language and Literature at Butler University. This act is \nalmost a 'suicide bombing,' he told me. And yet, the New Testament \nbook of Hebrews (11:32-34), in what many ministers refer to as the \nhall of faith, portrays Samon's act as redemptive.\u0014\nSimilarly, Joshua's armies engage in a God-commanded systematic \ngenocide (see Joshua 6:20-21) of the Canaanite men, women and \nchildren. Though some scholars question the historicity of this \npassage (along with many others), the fact that many Christians see \nJoshua, Samson, and Moses as godly role models is troubling to some \nof their fellow believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't think that we have in the Bible revealed truths not produced \nby or mediated through human minds, said McGrath, who identifies \nhimself as a liberal Christian. To treat commands to commit genocide \nas though they originated from God is to empty of all meaning any \nclaims we make about God being loving or interested in redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGrath's comments might not surprise conservatives, coming as he \ndoes from the mainline Protestant left. But his position has support \nfrom some academic contrarians in the evangelical world, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo evangelicals give God's violence a pass?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe slaughter of Moses' enemies in the Old Testament rivals that \nwhich opponents of Islam have depicted for Muslim extremists, says \nJ. Denny Weaver, professor emeritus at Bluffton University and author \nof The Nonviolent God. Christians who accuse Muslims and fail to \nrecognize the violence in the Old Testament are giving Moses, the \nIsraelite kings, and God a pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeaver told me, As a Christian, my answer to divine violence in the \nOld Testament starts with the story of Jesus. But this is in no way \nintended as a simple assertion that the nonviolence of Jesus . . . \nsupersedes the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament portrait of God is not uniform, he said. One must \nembrace the entire Old Testament to see that the Old Testament in \nfact does not present a uniform picture of a violent and immoral God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn rejecting Bible-sanctioned violence, some Christian scholars have \nfound themselves under fire from conservative evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Weaver, the Old Testament includes portrayals of God and \nhis people that stress nonviolence. The prophet Daniel's refusal to \nend his praying (Daniel 6)  a violation of the Babylonian law  was \nan example of nonviolent cultural resistance of God's people in a \nstrange land. He adds that Jesus' work is to say that this \nnonviolence most truly reflects the character of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Enns, a professor of biblical studies at the progressively \nevangelical Eastern University, also finds the Bible's violence \ndisturbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblical portrayals of . . . God-sanctioned violence are typically \ngiven a free pass by Christian communities that look to scripture to \ngive accurate and absolutely authoritative information about God, \nEnns said in an email.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Christians, the tectonic shift away from tribal thinking and \nkilling enemies is certainly driven home by Jesus and the apostle \nPaul, said Enns. It is in the teachings and actions of Jesus  \nculminating in his death and resurrection  where we see the truly \nauthoritative presentation of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling out heretics?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese evangelical voices are far from unanimous. In rejecting \nBible-sanctioned violence, some Christian scholars have found \nthemselves under fire from conservative evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2013, for example, Messiah College's professor of Old Testament, \nEric Seibert (author of The Violence of Scripture: Overcoming the Old \nTestament's Troubling Legacy), drew significant controversy for \nguest-writing a three-part series on the Bible's portrayal of God's \nviolence at Peter Enns' Patheos blog.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo put it bluntly, not everything in the 'good book' is either good, \nor good for us, Seibert wrote. At times the Bible endorses values \nwe should reject, praises acts we must condemn, and portrays God in \nways we cannot accept.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some might see this as blasphemy, Seibert wrote on the blog \nthat an engagement in an ethical and theological critique of the \nBible  like Jesus did  is an act of profound faithfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAren't these academics cherry picking which parts of the Bible they \naccept?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in a blog post of his own, Owen Strachan, assistant professor of \nChristian theology and church history at Boyce College, called \nSeibert's views shameful, offering this evangelical critique: God \nis the one who ordains all things, and God is the one who sets our \nmoral standards. We do not judge God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlbert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, \n\\compared Seibert's views to those of Richard Dawkins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother controversy arose when Christopher Rollston, a formerly \ntenured professor of Old Testament and Semitic studies at Emmanuel \nChristian Seminary, published\\The Marginalization of Women: A \nBiblical Value We Don't Like to Talk About at The Huffington Post.\u0014\n\u0014\nRollston's article takes issue with the Ten Commandments treating \nwomen as property (Deuteronomy 5:21), and the requirement for women \nto marry their rapists (Deuteronomy 22:28-29), refusing to look past \nthe Bible's ancient misogyny as a tool for promoting violence against \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\nRollston says that the net effect of his article was a strong \nbacklash from conservative donors to the seminary and the eventual \nloss of his teaching position.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian contrarians \u0014\n\u0014\nConservative evangelicals  and, in an unusual alliance, many \natheists  might fairly ask: given their refusals to sanction the \nBible's violence, what keeps these contrarians Christian? Aren't \nthese academics cherry picking which parts of the Bible they accept?\u0014\n\u0014\nWeaver, Enns, Rollston, or Seibert might offer this challenge to \ntheir conservative evangelical friends: simply believing in God  \ncontrary to the Pew study  does not make one moral. Being a \nChristian requires an act of profound faithfulness: the courage to \nchallenge a sacred book.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat seems clear to me is that if it's appropriate (and I believe it \nis) to challenge violence in sacred books, then it's a challenge that \napplies equally to any sacred book, be it the Bible or Qur'an.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\u0014",

Since he left the White House in 1969, \u0014\nthe Texas Democrat's legacy has been dominated \u0014\nby his escalation of \"the disastrous war in Viet- \u0014\nnam.\" But the nation is now waking up to LBJ's \u0014\ndomestic victories, which radically \"changed the \u0014\nfabric of today's society.\" Presidents Obama, \u0014\nBush (the younger), Clinton, and Carter last week \u0014\ngathered in Texas to commemorate the 50th \u0014\nanniversary of his 1964 Civil Rights Act, and to \u0014\npraise the blizzard of social reforms passed dur- \u0014\ning his five years in power-including Medicare, \u0014\nMedicaid, and the Corporation for Public Broad- \u0014\ncasting. Johnson was a \"political and legislative \u0014\ngenius,\" said The Dallas Morning News in an \u0014\neditorial, and today's deadlocked Wa~hington \u0014\nleaders could learn a lot from him. In order to \u0014\npass the Civil Rights Act, which legally banned \u0014\nracial segregation, he wooed and bullied South- \u0014\nern Democrats and Northern Republicans, and \u0014\ndished out pork in return for votes. \"Imagine \u0014\nthis: He got liberals and conservatives to work \u0014\ntogether on what was then a political third rail.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, LBJ's reputation is beyond redemption, said \u0014\nMichael Kazin in NewRepublic.com. In 1965\u0014\nas he was pushing Congress to ban discrimina- \u0014\ntion at the ballot box, he was also signing orders \u0014\nthat would eventually send 500,000 U.S. troops \u0014\nto fight in Vietnam, which Johnson dismissed \u0014\nas \"a raggedy-ass little third-rate- country.\" The \u0014\nwar claimed the lives of 58,200 Americans \u0014\nand up to 3.8 million Vietnamese, and tore the \u0014\nDemocratic Party-and the nation-in two. It \u0014\nwould be \"deeply immoral\" to ignore this bloody \u0014\nlegacy. Johnson doesn't deserve full credit for his \u0014\ndomestic achievements, said Harold Meyerson \u0014\nin The Washington Post. In the 1960s, the civil \u0014\nrights movement, labor unions, and congressio- \u0014\nnalliberals all played critical roles in creating \"a \u0014\nmore egalitarian America.\" Johnson was just one \u0014\nplayer in this great progressive push. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis much is clear: We'll never see his likes again, \u0014\nsaid John Dickerson in Slate. com. In our hyper- \u0014\npartisan age, no president or congressional leader \u0014\ncan muster the bipartisan support that gave rise \u0014\nto the Civil Rights Act. Wealthy donors and the \u0014\nparty bases now demand ideological purity, and in \u0014\ntoday's \"saturated media environment,\" Johnson's \u0014\npayoffs and punishments would be exposed imme- \u0014\ndiately and spark an uproar. LBJ was a man of his \u0014\nmoment, and that moment has long since passed.\u0014",

    "words": "Legal Pot Might Make Americas Kids Stupider, Say Researchers\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tEliza Gray \tTIME Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of the drumbeat toward legalization, its easy to forget \nthat smoking pot isnt great for you. Especially if you are a \nteenager.\u0014\n\u0014\nA review of the research on the negative health affects of marijuana \npublished today in the New England Journal of Medicine reports that \nsmoking pot as a kid may have lasting impacts on intelligence and \nachievement.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor starters, smoking pot regularly from an early age is correlated \nwith a lower IQ. The mechanism is not fully understoodexperts are \nnot claiming one necessarily causes the otherbut scientists \nspeculate the drug can interfere with a critical period for brain \ndevelopment during the teen years. Adults who smoked regularly \nduring adolescence according to the review, have impaired neural \nconnectivity in parts of the brain involving alertness and self \nconscious awareness, executive function, processing of habits and \nroutines, learning, and memory.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmoking marijuana as a teenager is also linked with poor grades, \ncriminal behavior and increased risk of dropping out of school, \naccording to the review. The research doesnt prove that regular \nmarijuana use causes these negative consequences. But the review \narticle suggests that available evidence could explain the \nrelationship. Though some research suggests that the harmful effects \nof marijuana subside after the drug leaves the brain and can be \nreversed after a person stops using, other studies show that long \nterm, heavy use of marijuana results in impairments in memory and \nattention that persist and worsen with increasing years of regular \nuse. The article also points out that marijuana can impair cognitive \nfunctioning for days after you toke up, increasing the likelihood \nthat students could be functioning below their natural ability for \nperiods of time.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone of this is really surprising. But since legalization in Colorado \nand Washington may contribute to the perception that, doctors notes \naside, recreational marijuana is harmless, its worth paying close \nattention to links between marijuana use and negative outcomes in \nachievementespecially for teens.\u0014",

    "title": "LET THERE BE VIOLENCE",
    "words": "Let There Be Violence\u0014\nA growing rift emerges among  evangelicals over how to read the dark \nside of the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Brandon Withrow\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you have to believe in God to be a moral person? According to a \nnew study by Pew's Global Attitudes Project, 53 percent of Americans \nsay yes. The ironic fact of the Bible, however, is that it is full of \nindividuals who believe in God, who act immorally and violently, and \nwhose God appears to bless their actions. Many Christians today are \ncritical of the violence they see in other religions  especially \nIslam  but there's an inescapable cognitive dissonance if you are \nappalled by the violence done in the name of one religion but not by \nthe violence done in the name of your own.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to miss the passage where Moses slaughters 3,000 \nIsraelites for worshipping a golden calf (Exodus 32)  a death toll \ncomparable to September 11. Or the passage telling of Moses' anger \nupon discovering that his army had spared enemy women and children \n(Numbers 31), later commanding them to kill the males and older \nwomen, but keep the virgin girls for themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis disturbing side of the Bible has some Christian academics \ncalling for a more discriminate reading of it. Venturing into \nterritory often reserved for Richard Dawkins  who, in The Virus of \nFaith, compared Moses to Hitler  these Christians offer strong \ncriticisms of the same book they hold sacred.\u0014\n\u0014\nI asked a few of them to explain how they read the Bible's violent \npassages.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday school Samson \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible contains many moments where immoral actions are condemned, \nlike King David's murder of Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, to cover up \ntheir affair (2 Samuel 11). But there are also many passages where \nimmorality is not only not denounced, but celebrated.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake, for example, Judges 13-16. If you went to Sunday school, you \nmay remember the story in which God restores the blinded Samson's \nsuper-strength while his Philistine enemies are tying him up during a \nworship service at the temple of Dagon. Samson pulls down the entire \nstructure, killing everyone present, including himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid your Sunday school teacher present Samson as a hero? He was not \nso, says James McGrath, the Clarence L. Goodwin Chair in New \nTestament Language and Literature at Butler University. This act is \nalmost a 'suicide bombing,' he told me. And yet, the New Testament \nbook of Hebrews (11:32-34), in what many ministers refer to as the \nhall of faith, portrays Samon's act as redemptive.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, Joshua's armies engage in a God-commanded systematic \ngenocide (see Joshua 6:20-21) of the Canaanite men, women and \nchildren. Though some scholars question the historicity of this \npassage (along with many others), the fact that many Christians see \nJoshua, Samson, and Moses as godly role models is troubling to some \nof their fellow believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't think that we have in the Bible revealed truths not produced \nby or mediated through human minds, said McGrath, who identifies \nhimself as a liberal Christian. To treat commands to commit genocide \nas though they originated from God is to empty of all meaning any \nclaims we make about God being loving or interested in redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGrath's comments might not surprise conservatives, coming as he \ndoes from the mainline Protestant left. But his position has support \nfrom some academic contrarians in the evangelical world, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo evangelicals give God's violence a pass?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe slaughter of Moses' enemies in the Old Testament rivals that \nwhich opponents of Islam have depicted for Muslim extremists, says \nJ. Denny Weaver, professor emeritus at Bluffton University and author \nof The Nonviolent God. Christians who accuse Muslims and fail to \nrecognize the violence in the Old Testament are giving Moses, the \nIsraelite kings, and God a pass.\u0014\nWeaver told me, As a Christian, my answer to divine violence in the \nOld Testament starts with the story of Jesus. But this is in no way \nintended as a simple assertion that the nonviolence of Jesus . . . \nsupersedes the Old Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament portrait of God is not uniform, he said. One must \nembrace the entire Old Testament to see that the Old Testament in \nfact does not present a uniform picture of a violent and immoral God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn rejecting Bible-sanctioned violence, some Christian scholars have \nfound themselves under fire from conservative evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Weaver, the Old Testament includes portrayals of God and \nhis people that stress nonviolence. The prophet Daniel's refusal to \nend his praying (Daniel 6)  a violation of the Babylonian law  was \nan example of nonviolent cultural resistance of God's people in a \nstrange land. He adds that Jesus' work is to say that this \nnonviolence most truly reflects the character of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Enns, a professor of biblical studies at the progressively \nevangelical Eastern University, also finds the Bible's violence \ndisturbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblical portrayals of . . . God-sanctioned violence are typically \ngiven a free pass by Christian communities that look to scripture to \ngive accurate and absolutely authoritative information about God, \nEnns said in an email.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Christians, the tectonic shift away from tribal thinking and \nkilling enemies is certainly driven home by Jesus and the apostle \nPaul, said Enns. It is in the teachings and actions of Jesus  \nculminating in his death and resurrection  where we see the truly \nauthoritative presentation of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling out heretics?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese evangelical voices are far from unanimous. In rejecting \nBible-sanctioned violence, some Christian scholars have found \nthemselves under fire from conservative evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2013, for example, Messiah College's professor of Old Testament, \nEric Seibert (author of The Violence of Scripture: Overcoming the Old \nTestament's Troubling Legacy), drew significant controversy for \nguest-writing a three-part series on the Bible's portrayal of God's \nviolence at Peter Enns' Patheos blog.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo put it bluntly, not everything in the 'good book' is either good, \nor good for us, Seibert wrote. At times the Bible endorses values \nwe should reject, praises acts we must condemn, and portrays God in \nways we cannot accept.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some might see this as blasphemy, Seibert wrote on the blog \nthat an engagement in an ethical and theological critique of the \nBible  like Jesus did  is an act of profound faithfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAren't these academics cherry picking which parts of the Bible they \naccept?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in a blog post of his own, Owen Strachan, assistant professor of \nChristian theology and church history at Boyce College, called \nSeibert's views shameful, offering this evangelical critique: God \nis the one who ordains all things, and God is the one who sets our \nmoral standards. We do not judge God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlbert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, \ncompared Seibert's views to those of Richard Dawkins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother controversy arose when Christopher Rollston, a formerly \ntenured professor of Old Testament and Semitic studies at Emmanuel \nChristian Seminary, published\\The Marginalization of Women: A \nBiblical Value We Don't Like to Talk About at The Huffington Post.\u0014\n\u0014\nRollston's article takes issue with the Ten Commandments treating \nwomen as property (Deuteronomy 5:21), and the requirement for women \nto marry their rapists (Deuteronomy 22:28-29), refusing to look past \nthe Bible's ancient misogyny as a tool for promoting violence against \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\nRollston says that the net effect of his article was a strong \nbacklash from conservative donors to the seminary and the eventual \nloss of his teaching position.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian contrarians \u0014\n\u0014\nConservative evangelicals  and, in an unusual alliance, many \natheists  might fairly ask: given their refusals to sanction the \nBible's violence, what keeps these contrarians Christian? Aren't \nthese academics cherry picking which parts of the Bible they accept?\u0014\n\u0014\nWeaver, Enns, Rollston, or Seibert might offer this challenge to \ntheir conservative evangelical friends: simply believing in God  \ncontrary to the Pew study  does not make one moral. Being a \nChristian requires an act of profound faithfulness: the courage to \nchallenge a sacred book.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat seems clear to me is that if it's appropriate (and I believe it \nis) to challenge violence in sacred books, then it's a challenge that \napplies equally to any sacred book, be it the Bible or Qur'an.\u0014\n\u0014\nImage of Anthony van Dyck's Samson and Delilah,1630,via Wikimedia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrandon G.

    "words": "Lust atrophies your heart and disfigures your soul. Its continual \nfire chars everything inside. Its embers do not die easily and must \nconstantly be smothered. If you're a man, you're either struggling \nwith sexual temptation right now or will be shortly in the future.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no innocent thought or action when it comes to sexual sin. \nYou may visit a site or two occasionally on the Internet and think \nnothing of it. You may get a certain periodical once a month that you \ndon't read in front of your children. But you haven't cheated on your \nwife (yet), so you're OK right? Wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou see, the mind is like a piece of land plowed, fertilized and \nwell-watered. It's ready to produce a crop, and your actions are the \nseeds. Sowing wrong thoughts given by pornography yields devastating \nresults. Your marriage will go through a dry season, or an attractive \nnew assistant starts working with you, and if you've been continually \nplanting lust, you will reap an affair. And this affair will spawn \nthe locusts that will devour your home.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will not give you a \"how-to\" guide on keeping lust in check. That's \na much more in-depth and personal struggle you must wage on your own \nbattlefield. But I think I can give some helpful pointers that may \nhelp steer you in the right direction.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Admit You Have a Problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt could be a big problem with pornography or just a small one with \nthe occasional wandering eye. All of us men have a problem - it's \njust a question of how big of a problem it is.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Ask for Forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a tough thing to do, but asking your wife and God to forgive \nwhat you've done sows the seeds of forgiveness and reconciliation. If \nyou have a small lust problem, you may just want to petition God for \nmercy and the strength to continue the battle. If you have a big \npornography or other sexual temptation, there's a good chance your \nwife already knows about it. Apologize to her, tell her how wrong you \nwere, and comfort her about how attractive she is to you and how \nyou're going to be even more committed to the relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Seek Help.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour wife is your biggest soldier-in-arms against pornography. Tell \nher the kinds of things that may tempt you and ask her to keep you \naccountable. Perhaps it's not wise to watch TV by yourself or to go \non a long business trip without checking in with her. You may also \nneed to get further help from a counselor or pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Realize Youre Not Alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll men struggle with lust. Most never do anything about it. Take \ncomfort that you're one of the few who cares enough about his family \nto protect it.

Then there are the \nburial details: the gravediggers using long hooks to pull at smelly, \nrotting corpses into shallow trenches with a little dirt thrown atop \n but washing away during a light rain, and then the farmers pigs \nand dogs eating exuberantly at the exposed remains.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow generals on both side of the conflict had to deal with soldiers \nwho fell away during marches to the next battlefield, how those \nstragglers who were deemed to be cowards were either hung or shot by \ntheir commanders -- even after listening to their pitiful pleas for \nmercy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the author provided stories about how the wounded were treated \nafter a battle, moved inside jostling horse-drawn field \nambulance-wagons to aid stations were their fate usually met a quick \nbut gristly amputation  maybe succored with some opium (which was \nscarce in the South). Or so badly wounded they could not move, but \ncould merely holler for help for several days in tall weeds before \nbeing found and given food and water  if feral pigs didnt find them \nfirst and gnaw upon them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to treat those who had both hands shot away, maybe they could be \nfitted with a bad prosthesis. But how do you repair a damaged mind, \neither wounded by bullet or shell shocked by battle  how PTSD \nexisted even then but wasnt recognized -- except by being labeled \ninstead as a slacker or coward? Thousands upon tens of thousands of \ndamaged bodies and scared minds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd stories of the young, harried female nurses who comforted the \nslowly but surely dying. What of the justice that officers could \nresign their commissions and escape the next battle, but the drafted \nenlisted had to continue their mach to the next meat-grinding battle? \nAnti-draft riots formed, but the war nonetheless continued. And so \nmuch more!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLiving Hell is a highly recommended read, along with The Aftermath \nof Battle\" by Meg Thompson.\u0014\n----------\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Jeffrey Hampton on May 4, 2014 \u0014\nFormat: Hardcover \u0014\nOver the course of my 60 years of life, I have read a good many \nbooks, but only a handful of them had as powerful an impact on me as \nProfessor Adams' new book on the Civil war. I am a student of the war \nand belong to the Sons of Union Veterans and belonged to the Sons of \nConfederate Veterans for 25 years until they became completely \nunhinged after the election of Barack Obama. \u0014\nBoth of these organizations are very conservative and militaristic in \nnature. They have a romanticized view of the Civil War for which \nAdams' book provides a potent antidote. If \"Living Hell\" does not \nturn their perceived glories of the Civil War into ashes, nothing \nwill. In reading it, I found myself hunched over my desk in my study \nwith my hand unconsciously covering my mouth at the horrors revealed \nin stark and brutal detail. The struggle of civilians, particularly \nwomen and children on the home front and in the towns close to where \nthe battlefields were located were heartbreaking and almost \nunbearable to read. Often I would be unconsciously pounding my fist \non my desk at the colossal waste of human life and resources.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the aftermath of the horrors of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nAdams' book provides a warning against those whose first solution to \nthe problems in Iran or Syria or Egypt or the Ukraine or dozens of \nother world hotspots is to enlarge military conflicts that are \nalready causing untold thousands of civilian deaths and the waste of \nbillions of dollars worth of economic resources that could better be \nused for peaceful\u0014",

    "words": "Loaded words \u0014\n \u0014\nJun 25th 2015, by R.L.G.  \"The Economist\" \u0014\n\u0014\nON THURSDAY, June 18th, by all the available evidence, Dylann Storm \nRoof walked into a historic black church in Charleston, South \nCarolina, and after sitting with the black parishioners for an hour \nkilled nine of them, before being arrested a day later. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost as soon as his identity was known, pictures of him began to \nappear: wearing a jacket with the flags of apartheid South Africa and \nwhite-ruled Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or brandishing the battle flag \nof the slavery-supporting southern armies in Americas civil war. \nNearly as soon as these pictures had been processed, many journalists \nstumbled on the same question: did the shootings not qualify as \n\"terrorism\"? Were the media going easy on a white American?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo many commentators rushing to judge what the rest of the media \nwere doing, in almost identical termssome going so far as to say the \nmedia were \"refusing\" to call Mr Roof a terroristhas a self-refuting \nquality. A search for \"Charleston shooting terrorism\" turns up 7.6m \nresults in Google News, many of them published in the 24 hours after \nthe attacks. Quite a lot of the media did in fact quickly call Mr \nRoof a terrorist. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy the urge to use the word terrorist for Mr Roof? The critics \nhave point: white Christian American lone gunman killers are often \nscrutinised for mental-health problems almost as soon as their \nidentities are known. Killers known to be Muslims are more likely to \nbe suspected of terrorism straight away, not insanitywith the latter \nwords implication that the killer could not control his actions. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it wasnt just the terrorism versus deranged gunman \ndistinction that rankled with many critics. Initial descriptions of \nthe Charleston shooting called it a hate crime, not terrorism. \nThis seemed to bother a lot of people, with the avoidance of \nterrorism being described as a kind of racist double standard. This \npoint is debatable, though. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Charleston killings fit the standard criteria of both hate \ncrime and terrorism. A hate crime is motivated by malice against a \ngroup: gays, Muslims or blacks, say. (A victims individual identity \nis secondary at best.) Terrorism puts a focus on means as much as \nmotive: it is violence (or its threat) directed against civilians \n(crucially), for the purposes of influencing political \ndecision-making. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr Roof seems to have wanted to wake white America up to a race war \nby slaughtering black innocents. In other words, it is both terrorism \nand a hate crime. Which is worse? Terrorism is loathsome in its \nmeansthe intentional targeting of non-combatants. But it can be \nharnessed to ends that might otherwise deserve support. Terrorism has \nbeen committed by many stateless minorities seeking independence, \nfrom the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand through \nIrishmen, Zionists, Basques, Kurds, Palestinians, Sri Lankan Tamils \nand more. Plenty of outsiders support statehood (or autonomy) for \nsuch peoples while deploring terrorist means. And it isnt just \nindependence movements. Al-Qaeda wants Americans out of the Middle \nEast; many Americans want the same thing. \u0014\n\u0014\nArguably, a hate crime is worse. It is driven by pure revulsion for \nthe victim or victims. By definition, its motivation has no redeeming \nqualities. According to his quoted statements during the killings, Mr \nRoof seemed to think he was doing something noble, defending white \nwomen from rape by black mena common theme among southern American \nracists for well over a century. But he went on to slaughter old \nwomen in the church. Their crime was blackness. His mental health may \nlater become a legal issue, but from what we know today, he was \nmethodical, persistent and far-sighted in his intent to kill blacks, \nfull stop. A hate crime for sure, in other words.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy still prefer terrorist? The word was not in common use a \nhundred years ago, or even during the civil-rights era. (Its use in \nwriting shot up in the 1970s, as Googles book data show, and much \nmore so again at the turn of the millennium and after September \n11th.) If it had been, it would have been a perfect label to apply to \nthe likes of the Ku Klux Klan: the only point of a cross-burning was \nto spread fear, and the public lynching was not so much about the \nvictim as the message it sent to his family and friends. So the rush \nto pin terrorist on Mr Roofwho targeted a prominent symbol in the \nstoried black Charleston churchimplies a criticism of more than a \ncentury of American attitudes to violence. Americans can perpetrate \nas well as suffer terrorist tactics. \u0014\n\u0014\nNever mind the classic associations of terrorists (bombs not guns, \ngroups not lone-wolves, foreign accents not southern drawls). Never \nmind that hate crime may actually describe Mr Roofs actions \nbetter, and that American law adds extra penalties for hate just as \nit does for terrorism. Terrorism now has a special place in the \nimagination, beyond mere hateful violence. The attacks of September \n11th, 2001 and afterwards were so shocking that they led to two wars, \ncivil-rights abuses and even torture. \"Terrorist\" has become the \nworst thing we can call someone. It must be, since terrorism is \napparently so awful it can justify the unjustifiable in response.\u0014",

Because of his warm personality, he \nfound many opportunities to do so, and soon added preaching to \ncarpentry and teaching as skills he practiced.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first sermon that he is known to have preached (1853), he \ncompared the career of Napoleon with the career of an even greater \nconqueror, Jesus Christ. The audience sat spell bound. Preaching \nanother sermon, he contrasted the material and spiritual realms. \"Men \nare tending to materialism. Houses, lands, and worldly goods attract \ntheir attention, and as a mirage lure them on to death. Christianity, \non the other hand leads only the natural body to death, and for the \nspirit, it points out a house not built with hands, eternal in the \nheavens... Let me urge you to follow Him, not as the Nazarene, the \nMan of Galilee, the carpenter's son, but as the ever living spiritual \nperson, full of love and compassion, who will stand by you in life \nand death and eternity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man's name was James A. Garfield. He was already known as a \ntop-notch debater and the kind of fellow everyone claims as a friend. \nAt the same time, however, he was prone to soul searching and \nsuffered from a lack of confidence that caused him to hesitate and to \nchange his opinions, a trait that could make him seem weak.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Garfield helped organize the 42d Ohio infantry. \nHe threw his energy into acquiring military skills and finding \nsupplies for the men in his command. With deep concern for their \nspiritual welfare, he spoke to each of his need for a personal \nrelationship with Christ. Garfield distinguished himself at \nChickamauga, and before the war was over, rose to the rank of major \ngeneral. After the war, he was elected to the United States Congress \nwhere he quickly learned the ropes and became a major player in \nnational politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, he was such an influential player, that he blocked both \nGrant and Blaine from the presidential nomination in 1880. When the \nRepublicans could not agree on Blaine, Grant, or Sherman, they chose \nGarfield as their \"dark horse\" candidate. On this day, November 2, \n1880, the fervent Disciples of Christ lay-minister was elected the \n20th president of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis presidency was weak and short-lived. Because he stood against a \npatronage system (which effectively gave senators control of \npolitical appointments in their states) he angered many would-be \noffice holders. One of them shot him in a Washington railroad \nstation. Garfield teetered between life and death for three and a \nhalf months before dying on September 19, 1881.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Garfield, James Arthur.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "title": "LET'S GIVE JOSEPH HIS DUE",
    "words": "This Christmas, Let's Give Joseph His Due \u0014\nJim Kelsey\u0014\nThursday, December 24, 2015   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nIn our crches, Mary sits close to the baby at the center of the \nscene, and Joseph often is standing behind and to the side looking on \nas a spectator, Kelsey says. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph gets the short shrift this time of year it seems to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn our crches, Mary sits close to the baby at the center of the \nscene, and Joseph often is standing behind and to the side looking on \nas a spectator.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Luke, Mary does get most of the attention. But in Matthew's \nGospel, Joseph is where the action is.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary and Joseph are engaged; but before they consummate the marriage, \nMary is \"found\" to be with child (Matthew 1:19).\u0014\n\u0014\nOne has to wonder how she was \"found.\" Did the neighbors notice? Did \nJoseph get suspicious at her expanding girth? Was her mother the \nfirst to catch on?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn any case, this appears to be what we would describe as an \nunplanned out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe, the readers, and Mary know what has happened; but no one else in \nthe story knows what we know - least of all Joseph. To them, Mary \nlooks like a girl who \"got herself in trouble.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI worked at a hospital while in seminary, and one night a woman \nbrought her teenage daughter, who was having severe abdominal pain, \ninto the emergency room.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nurse quickly discovered that the girl was in labor. The girl's \nmother refused to believe it. After the delivery, the doctor showed \nthe woman the baby. She accused them of trying to foist someone \nelse's baby on her daughter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That can't be my daughter's baby; she is not married,\" she asserted.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps Mary's mother struggled to find an explanation as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph discovers his wife-to-be is pregnant. How he came to know we \nare not told, but certainly the news would have spawned feelings of \nbetrayal, embarrassment and probably anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Matthew tells us Joseph is a righteous man; therefore, he chooses \nto break off the betrothal quietly, minimizing any pain or \nembarrassment to either family.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could have chosen otherwise. He could have publicly accused her \nand had her stoned. Because he was a righteous man, he chose simply \nto walk away.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was one option that was not available to Joseph. There was one \ncourse of action that never would have entered his mind. There was \none choice that would have been impossible in his world.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe could never take Mary as his wife and raise someone else's child. \nThat was absolutely forbidden. He was, after all, a righteous man.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet that is precisely what the angel of the Lord tells Joseph to do, \nand he does it straightway.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph appears to have had a predisposition to the more refined \ndefinition of righteousness that will be developed in Matthew's \nGospel, a predisposition that made him a good candidate for his role \nin the Christmas story.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater in Matthew's Gospel, Jesus will say, \"Unless your righteousness \nexceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the \nkingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:20).\u0014\n\u0014\nI suspect that his listeners looked at one another and thought they \nhad no chance of making the cut.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scribes and Pharisees were the epitome of law-abiding Jews, a \nstandard that most people would never equal, let alone exceed.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as we move through this gospel, Jesus redefines righteousness.\u0014\n\u0014\nClose to the end he will say to the religious leaders, \"You give a \ntenth of your spices - mint, dill and cumin. But you neglected the \nmore important matters of the law - justice, mercy and faithfulness\" \n(Matthew 23:23).\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is something more important than a meticulous following of \nregulations; that more important piece of obedience is found in \njustice, mercy and faithfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew 9:13, Jesus says, \"I desire mercy and not sacrifice,\" \nreferencing Hosea 6:6.\u0014\nThe leaders did not learn their lesson because in Matthew 12:7 he \naccuses, \"If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not \nsacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is what Joseph knew intuitively, and that is why he showed no \nhesitation in taking this pregnant woman as his wife and raising this \nson as his own. He knew that greater righteousness grounded in mercy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Mary, Joseph was an extraordinary human being used by God to \nusher in a new chapter in God's pursuit of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph heard the voice of mercy instead of the voice of sacrifice. He \nalready knew what God was doing through this baby.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0002Jim Kelsey is executive minister of the American Baptist \nChurches-New York State\u0014",

    "title": "LEARNING TO LIOVE WITH PENAL SUSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT",
    "words": "Learning To Live With Penal \nSubstitutionary Atonement \u0014\n\u0014\n3.08.2016   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nI've long been a critic of penal substitutionary atonement. It's a \nhugely problematic doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in my post yesterday about fragile worshipers (SEE BELOW) in the \ncomments Mike asked me about how I've come to be more grace-filled \nwhen I bump into penal substitutionary atonement at church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause you're going to bump into it. In songs, prayers, sermons. You \ncan't avoid penal substitutionary atonement. And if you bristle and \nbecome unglued every time you bump into penal substitutionary \natonement you're regularly going to be miserable and upset at church.\u0014\nSo, how do you cope with it? That was Mike's question. Here was my \nanswer from yesterday's post:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat helped me is seeing how something I found problematic was \nhelpful to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, I'm with you about penal substitutionary atonement. But \nI've grown more tolerant of it because of how I've experienced it out \nat the prison. The men in the prison have done horrible, terrible \nthings. Murder. Rape. Child abuse. Consequently, they feel damned. \nThey feel an acute sense of God's wrath and judgment. Understandably \nso.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the notion that God absorbed the damnation, wrath and judgment \nthat was rightly and deservedly falling upon them is hugely impactful \nand transformative.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe notion that God wants to damn you for your sins doesn't preach \nwell in American suburbs. But it preaches with murderers and rapists. \nThey get it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasically, if you're burdened by a deep sense of guilt and shame--and \na lot of people are--penal substitutionary atonement makes a lot of \nsense. I still have some deep theological problems with the notion, \nbut I get the emotional resonance and I've seen the doctrine change \nlives for the better. Is that worth the costs, the negative effects \nthe doctrine has had? I can't say. I'm just describing how I've come \nto check my knee-jerk reactions to get to a more reflective place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis entry was posted by Richard Beck. \u0014\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n                                                              I used \nto be a fragile worshiper.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI'd go to church and there would always be something that set me off. \nSometimes it would be a song lyric that I found theologically \nproblematic or overly sentimental. Sometimes it was something someone \nsaid from the stage. And a lot of the time it would be getting upset \nabout something I wished we'd do differently. \"I wish we would do it \nthis way instead of that way,\" I'd often remark.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe littlest thing would get me disgruntled and annoyed. Worship had \nto be perfect. Any theological slip ups and I'd pounce. I had to \nagree with and like everything. Start to finish.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps you've been a fragile worshiper, and maybe still are. Are you \noverly sensitive to and emotionally triggered by anything that is \nsaid or sung in church that you don't like or agree with?\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years I've worked hard to become less brittle in worship, \nmore tolerant of song lyrics or shared thoughts I don't really like \nor agree with. I got fed up with the vanity and entitlement of being \na fragile worshiper, fatigued by the narcissism of making myself the \nmeasure of all things theological and liturgical.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, any given Sunday there is a bunch of stuff I which I wish wasn't \nsaid or sung. But I'm filled with a lot more grace about it all.\u0014\n\u0014\nI've given up being a fragile worshiper.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\nAtonement\u0014\n\u0014\n    \u0014\nAtonement\u0014\n\u0014\n This word does not occur in the Authorized Version  (KJV) of the \nNew Testament except in Rom 5:11, where in the Revised Version the \nword \"reconciliation\" is used. In the Old Testament it is of frequent \noccurrence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of \nbeing at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is \nreconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from \nthe death of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation \nis brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used \nit means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one \nis to make satisfaction for his offences (Ex 32:30; Lev 4:26; 5:16; \nNum 6:11), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate \nGod in his behalf.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he \nexpiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the \nreconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. \nWhen speaking of Christ's saving work, the word \"satisfaction,\" the \nword used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred \nto the word \"atonement.\" Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the \nroom and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and \njustice of God. Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, \nand these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but \nwere in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or \nsubstitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar \nbore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent \nwith his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(from Easton's Bible Dictionary, PC Study Bible formatted electronic \ndatabase Copyright  2003, 2006 Biblesoft, Inc. All rights reserved.)\u0014\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThe word \"atonement\" occurs many times in the OT but only once in the \nNT (Rom 5:11 kjv). Modern translations generally, and more correctly, \nrender the word \"reconciliation.\" The idea of atonement is ever \npresent in the NT, however, and is one of the fundamental concepts of \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoundational Concepts. God is seen as taking the initiative in man's \nsalvation; thus atonement is the work of God, who opens the \npossibility for sinful human beings to receive pardoning grace. For \nthe sinner, who cannot know God, who cannot bridge the gap between \nhimself and God, a \"new and living way\" is opened up by God.\u0014\n\u0014\n Elwell, W. A., & Beitzel, B. J. (1988).

    "words": "Learning Styles  Don't Help \u0014\n\u0014\nReading this short book review came as somewhat of a shock to me \nsince I've been convinced that (a) each of us has a different \nlearning style (visual, oral, kinetic, etc.) and (b) we will learn \nmore if we are allowed to learn in our natural style. Nope:\u0014\n\u0014\nStudy after study has suggested, however, that learning styles are \nmostly a myth. Teaching someone to memorize something according to \ntheir preferred learning style, for example, does not result in a \nsignificant improvement in their ability to recall that information \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet \"much to the annoyance of psychologists  this idea refuses \nto die.\" This has consequences for education, obviously:\u0014\n\u0014\nFor psychology nerds, this is interesting in that it helps explain \nwhy this myth has been so hard to kill: It feels true, even if it \nisn't. But it also, Jarrett points out, provides some useful advice \nto anyone trying to learn something new. \"[L]earning via our \npreferred style feels more effective even when it isn't,\" he writes, \n\"an effect that means learning via our preferred style could even be \nharmful in the sense of giving us false confidence.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the flip side, you might be underestimating your abilities to \nretain information when it's not presented in the way you like best.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Galli, Christianity Today, October 21, 2016\u0014",

    "words": "Study after study into the habits, health, and well-being of clergy \npeople in America reveal a haggard, distant, self-destructive, \nfinancially insecure, and relationally cut off group of people who \nhave made a living hiding most of the truly interesting parts of who \nthey are from everyone else because of what you might say and do if \nyou really got to know them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us preach scared out of a belief that if you really knew how \nwe felt about LGBTQ folks we couldn't pay our mortgages or student \nloan debt.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us pray scared out of a belief that if you really knew how we \nfelt about Hell we couldn't afford to send our kids to the doctor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us serve scared out of a belief that if you really knew how \nwe voted we wouldn't be invited over for coffee anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike St. Parker Palmer (I have preemptively canonized him)reminds us, \nnot everyone has the luxury of quitting a job that does existential \nviolence to who they are, what they believe, and how they practice \ntheir beliefs, but what my youth pastor (and now dear friend)taught \nme so many years ago is that no matter where you are, what you do for \na living, or how many people will probably disagree with your \ndecision to come out of whatever closet you've hidden your true self,\u0014\n\u0014\nyou have to do it anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou never know who is watching and listening and waiting on you \nto.And If you manage to actually do it, especially when you have \nsomething to lose, you give those of us looking on from the cheap \nseats the permission to do it also.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you quit because what you believe is more important than the \nmoney you make from hiding those beliefs behind sermonic obfuscation, \nyou give the rest of us reason to believe in a God that would rather \nsacrifice God's self than other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you prophetically speak out in a moment of contentious \ncongregational crisis because what you believe is more important than \nthey money you make from keeping quiet about the difficult issues of \nour day, you give the rest of us reason to believe in a God that \nwould rather alienate God's self than other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you stay and commit to the slow work of solidarity, suffering, \nand strident resistance in the midst of a church, organization, \ngovernment, or country that (at best) misunderstands you and (at \nworst)condemns you for your opposition, you give the rest of us \nreason to believe in a God that refuses to give up on the world even \nwhen that world puts God to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd when you don't because you need the job, or the salary, or the \npower, or the position, or the relationships too much to lose them, \nyour health and well-being and family don't just suffer the \nconsequences for closeting your true self, the rest of us do too.\u0014\nI know it may seem inherently blasphemous for a pastor to bring his \nor her true thoughts, beliefs, opinions, and political persuasions \ninto the light (as reverends --like good therapists-- should never \nself disclose), but if your high-minded silence needed a reminder as \nto how things are currently going out here:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You know, I was debating an evangelical professor on NPR, and this \nprofessor said, 'Pastor, don't you want a candidate who embodies the \nteaching of Jesus and would govern this country according to the \nprinciples found in the Sermon on the Mount?'

I \nwould run from that candidate as far as possible because the Sermon \non the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this \nnation...Nowhere is government told to forgive those who wrong \nit...Government is to be a strongman to protect its citizens against \nevildoers.

    "title": "LEW WALLACE, AUTHOR OF BEN HUR",
    "words": "\u0014\nOn this day, February l5, l905, Lewis Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, \ndied. Lew left behind him a lifetime of political and military \naccomplishments. The world, however, remembers him chiefly as the \nauthor of the novel Ben Hur, which he subtitled, \"a tale of the \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLew Wallace was born in 1827, the son of an Indiana governor. As a \nyoung man he served in the United States' war with Mexico. After the \nwar, he studied law, set up a law practice, and served in the Indiana \nState Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he immediately re-enlisted and rose to \nthe rank of Major General. In 1864, he fought--and lost--the Battle \nof Monocacy, but he held his position long enough to allow union \ndefenders to reach Washington, D.C., preventing its capture by \nConfederate general Jubal Early. After the war, Lew served on the \ncourt martial that tried Lincoln's assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nLew was inspired to write novels after reading Prescott's Conquest of \nMexico. His first novel, The Fair God, was about those events. His \nsecond novel, Ben Hur, was conceived after sitting on a train, \nlistening spellbound for two hours, while the agnostic Colonel Robert \nIngersoll, poured out \"a medley of argument, eloquence, wit, satire, \naudacity, irreverence, poetry, brilliant antitheses, and pungent \nexcoriation of believers in God, Christ, and Heaven, the like of \nwhich I had never heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, Lew had been indifferent to the claims of religion \n(although he loved the story of the wise men and had begun a tale \nabout them). \"... Yet here was I now moved as never before, and by \nwhat? The most outright denials of all human knowledge of God, \nChrist, Heaven... Was the Colonel right? What had I on which to \nanswer yes or no? He had made me ashamed of my ignorance: and \nthen--here is the unexpected of the affair--as I walked on in the \ncool darkness, I was aroused for the first time in my life to the \nimportance of religion... I thought of the manuscript in my desk. Its \nclosing scene was the child Christ in the cave by Bethlehem: why not \ngo on with the story down to the crucifixion? That would make a book, \nand compel me to study everything of pertinency; after which, \npossibly, I would be possessed of opinions of real value. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It only remains to say that I did as resolved, with results--first, \nthe book Ben Hur, and second, a conviction amounting to absolute \nbelief in God and the Divinity of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile governor of New Mexico, Lew wrote his dramatic story. Though \nnever a member of a church, he became the best selling religious \nauthor of his day. Ben Hur sold 300,000 copies within ten years, and \nwas translated into dozens of languages, including Arabic and \nChinese. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Ben Hur was published in 1880, Wallace began a \nfour-year term as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, where he cultivated very \ngood relations with the Sultan. The last years of his life Wallace \nspent as a public lecturer. Today his statue stands in the Capitol \nbuilding at Washington, representing the State of Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story. \u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n1907.\u0014\nGeneral Lew Wallace Study and Museum. http://www.ben-hur.com/\u0014\nMorsberger, Robert E. and Morsberger, Katherine M.

    "words": "Major Bramwell Tillsley of the Salvation Army tells of a \nChristian in Rome who was condemned by a Nazi tribunal in 1943 and \nconsigned to a concentration camp. In nine months, the emaciated \nprisoner weighed only 80 pounds. His arms had been broken and not \nproperly treated.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOn Christmas Eve, 1943, he was summoned to the headquarters building \nand required to stand at attention while the commandant ate a \ndelicious meal and cursed him for being a Christian. He maintained \nhis composure through it all. However, can you imagine his shock when \nthe officer spit out the words, \"Your wife is an excellent cook. For \nseven months she has sent meals for you, and I have eaten them all?\" \nThe prisoner thought of how short his family was of food. How tempted \nhe was to hate the commandant!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tFollowing the war and after a ten year search, the man of God found \nthe commandant huddled in a small apartment in an obscure part of the \ncity. When the former commandant asked who he was, the former \nprisoner replied, \"I'm number 175. Do you remember the Christmas Eve \nof 1943?\" He did! The old officer fully expected revenge, but the \nChristian opened a package containing a large cake. \"I have forgiven \nyou for Christ's sake,\" he said. Whereupon they broke bread together \nas the old former Nazi wept uncontrollably.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThis act of Christian love and kindness ultimately opened the heart \nof the commandant to receive Jesus as Lord.  That formula still does \nfor us today.\u0014",

Unless I am convicted by \nscripture and plain reason--I do not accept the authority of popes \nand councils for they have contradicted each other--my conscience is \ncaptive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, \nfor to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, \nI cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most notable words spoken in the Reformation, this \naccording to early printed reports, was Luther's reply at Worms when \nurged to recant. He uttered the memorable lines in German on this \nday, April 18, 1521, and then, upon request, repeated their gist in \nLatin for those who did not understand his native tongue. He was \nsweating, said witnesses. With a victory gesture he slipped out of \nthe room.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick the Wise, Luther's supporter was uneasy. Did the scriptures \ncondemn Luther or not? \"He is too daring for me,\" the elector \nadmitted. Nonetheless, on the next day, when asked to stand against \nLuther with the emperor, he did not sign the condemnation although \nthe other four electors did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the Emperor, he reasoned that a single friar who went contrary \nto the whole church could not possibly be right. Descended from a \nlong line of Christian emperors, he felt that to accept Luther's view \nwas to betray the faith of his fathers. He would take prompt action \nagainst Luther, he vowed. But since Luther had been given safe \nconduct to Worms, he allowed him to depart in safety. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuther did not leave Worms at once. For several days a committee \nreasoned with him, begging him not to rend the church in two. They \npointed out that war would surely come to Germany. Melanchthon, his \nbeloved associate, might be killed. Luther could not help but be \nmoved, but his determination held. God's word must be followed \nwhatever the cost. To this confrontation his stand against \nindulgences had finally brought him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are grounds to doubt that Luther said \"Here I stand. I cannot \ndo otherwise.\" Although the earliest printed versions contain these \nlines, the official transcripts do not. Whether spoken or not, the \nwords convey the brave monk's attitude. When Luther left Worms, the \nReformation was irrevocable.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was at his noblest at Worms. His bold words have \nstirred men's imagination through subsequent centuries, for they have \nthe same ring to them as Peter's famous defiance of the Sanhedrin. \n\"Judge for yourselves whether we ought to obey God or men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "LOST CAUSE RELIGION",
    "words": "Lost Cause religion: A zombie mindset\u0014\nBill Leonard | September 21, 2017   Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nAn intelligent foreigner, making his observations at Washington at \nthis time, would be puzzled to determine whether the Americans had a \nGovernment, or not.  It is a remarkable fact that at Washington \ntoday, there is not a single well-defined department of political \npower!\u0014\n\u0014\nSoutherner Edward Pollard wrote those words in 1867, coining the term \nLost Cause, as a way of re-mythologizing the post-Appomattox \nConfederacy. Efforts to make America great again are not unique to \nthe current president of the United States. Americans have often \nreasserted their national or regional greatness, sometimes fretting \nthat national oblivion, if not divine retribution, was at hand. \nOthers, dissenters mostly, warned that claims of greatness betray a \nnational hubris blind to promises made but not yet kept. Their \ndissenting mantra might be: Making American Great Again FOR THE \nFIRST TIME.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor white Southerners, the Lost Cause saga remains a waning but \npowerful source of regional identity repeatedly mythologized and \ndemythologized. Myths give meaning to our common existence, telling \nus who we are, where we fit, or where we dont. Myths of American \npolitical and religious identity seem up for grabs these days, \nevident in recent polls suggesting that seven out of 10 Americans \nbelieve the country is losing a sense of shared identity; while one \nin four citizens claim no formal religious affiliation. Worse yet, \nthe rise in religion-related hate crimes, white supremacy rhetoric, \nKKK rallies, and race-based manipulation of voting laws, suggest that \nsome of the vilest Lost Cause-oriented ideologies are not all that \nlost in 21st century America. Recent events in Charlottesville, Va., \nrequire reexamination of the Lost Cause and its continuing impact in \nand beyond the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Connelly and Barbara Bellows suggest that the Lost Cause \noriginated as a byword for the perpetuation of the Confederate \nideal, and became a mindset for justifying the Southern \nexperience. Introduced to explain the Souths defeat and memorialize \nits honored dead (hence the statues), it morphed into a broader \nmethod for undergirding racial segregation, denying blacks voting \nrights, and promoting culturally entrenched white supremacy, zombie \nmindsets that stalk us yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacial, ethnic and immigrant injustices are writ large in the Lost \nCause, a metaphor by which the defeated Southerners cast the [Civil] \nwar and its outcome in the best possible terms, often factually and \nchronologically distorting the way in which the past would be \nremembered. Carolyn Janney suggests that these alternative facts \nminimized or dismissed the role of slavery as a reason for a war \nfought in response to Yankee aggression and black betrayal.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern white Protestantism was a major force in promoting Lost \nCause religion. As Connelly and Bellows write: The rising tide of \nevangelical faith, witnessed in the phenomenal growth of the Southern \nBaptist [Convention] and other fundamentalist churches, gave solace \nand structure to the defeated Confederate generation. In Baptized in \nBlood, the Religion of the Lost Cause, Charles Reagan Wilson writes \nthat as guardians of the regions spiritual and moral heritage, \nSouthern ministers used the Lost Cause to buttress this heritage. \nWilson insists that Christian clergymen were the prime celebrants of \nthe religion of the Lost Cause.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Lost Cause advocates attempted to rewrite the South back into \nnational identity, they portrayed the South as the prime preserver of \nAmerican Christian culture. Thus, the people who lost the war \nretained the vision. The Southern people, even in defeat, would be \nmore moral, more Christian, more American than their Yankee \ncounterparts had been or could be.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet underneath the rhetoric of moralism, sectionalism and theological \northodoxy was the abiding scourge of racism. Lost Cause religion \nfacilitated the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, whose violent racism \nwas romanticized in books like The Clansman, written in 1905 by \nBaptist preacher and Wake Forest graduate Thomas Dixon, to describe \nhow the young South, led by the reincarnated souls of the Clansmen \nof Old Scotland  saved the life of a people, and formed one of the \nmost dramatic chapters in the history of the Aryan race.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn August 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial, another Baptist preacher, \nMartin Luther King Jr., assessed the inadequacies of Lost Cause \nmythology, challenging the nation to make America Great Again for the \nfirst time. Affirming the joyous daybreak of the Emancipation \nProclamation, King warned that one hundred years later, the life of \nthe Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and \nthe chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro \nlives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of \nmaterial prosperity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus King declared: It is obvious today that America has defaulted \non this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are \nconcerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has \ngiven the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back \nmarked insufficient funds.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmid continuing injustices, might we ask:\u0014\nFirst, can we learn to read our culture with a sense of history? Can \nwe understand and analyze the roots of white supremacy, internet \nracism and KKK anti-Semitism, distinguishing alternative facts from \nalternative interpretations? Can we provide gospel alternatives for \nreading the cultural signs of the times?\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, can we distinguish Christian conviction from culture \nprejudice, particularly when using the Bible for support? Many \nelements of Lost Cause religion were rooted in distorted biblical \nhermeneutics, interpretative methods that gave proof texts for \nanti-Semitism, chattel slavery, Jim Crow separatism and white \nprivilege. Such bastardized biblicism (Im retiring next year; I can \ntalk like that) showed up recently when a Texas pastor touted Romans \n13 as divine sanction to take out the North Korean leader, using \nassassination and other dark arts, as necessary. What if the theory \nof biblical inerrancy helps get us all nuked?\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, can we cultivate gospel dissent, contesting the ways in which \nreligious communities cut deals with the culture? Edwin Gaustad \nwrote, This reform of religion in the name of religion, this growing \nedge, this refusal to let well enough alone, is the role of dissent. \nIt may also be a manifestation of the unfettered human spirit. As \nChristians, lets be prepared to dissent at a moments notice, but be \nprophetic when injustice becomes so rampant that if we dont speak \nthe stones will cry out.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, might we listen to Roger Williams and Ann Hutchinson, \nFrederick Douglas and Harriet Tubman, Dorothy Day and Martin Luther \nKing, (maybe even Jesus), in understanding America, not as Lost \nCause, but as Beloved Community? In August 1963, Dr. King reminded us \nof his dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the \ntrue meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, \nthat all  are created equal.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty-four Augusts later can we mirror Kings courage by confronting \na renewed Lost Cause ideology spewing white supremacy-KKK-Nazi \nbigotry made tangible in torch light parades, blood and soil \nmantras, and the murder of a 32-year-old dissenter? If the hope of a \nBeloved Community means anything at all, then Charlottesville victim \nHeather Heyer must not have died in vain.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, Beloved Community often seems its own lost cause; hope as \ninconceivable as a stone cold Galilean, laid out in a borrowed tomb, \nwaiting on Easter morning, for Gods audacious grace.\u0014",

    "title": "LAY-MINISTER GARFIELD ELECTED U.S. PRESIDENT",
    "words": "Lay-Minister \nGarfield Elected U.S. President\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 4, 1850, an eighteen year old student committed his life to \nJesus Christ. Baptized in the icy waters of the Chagrin River by the \nDisciples of Christ, he took his faith seriously and immediately \nbegan sharing it with others. Because of his warm personality, he \nfound many opportunities to do so, and soon added preaching to \ncarpentry and teaching as skills he practiced.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first sermon that he is known to have preached (1853), he \ncompared the career of Napoleon with the career of an even greater \nconqueror, Jesus Christ. The audience sat spell bound. Preaching \nanother sermon, he contrasted the material and spiritual realms. \"Men \nare tending to materialism. Houses, lands, and worldly goods attract \ntheir attention, and as a mirage lure them on to death. Christianity, \non the other hand leads only the natural body to death, and for the \nspirit, it points out a house not built with hands, eternal in the \nheavens... Let me urge you to follow Him, not as the Nazarene, the \nMan of Galilee, the carpenter's son, but as the ever living spiritual \nperson, full of love and compassion, who will stand by you in life \nand death and eternity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man's name was James A. Garfield. He was already known as a \ntop-notch debater and the kind of fellow everyone claims as a friend. \nAt the same time, however, he was prone to soul searching and \nsuffered from a lack of confidence that caused him to hesitate and to \nchange his opinions, a trait that could make him seem weak.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Civil War, Garfield helped organize the 42d Ohio infantry. \nHe threw his energy into acquiring military skills and finding \nsupplies for the men in his command. With deep concern for their \nspiritual welfare, he spoke to each of his need for a personal \nrelationship with Christ. Garfield distinguished himself at \nChickamauga, and before the war was over, rose to the rank of major \ngeneral. After the war, he was elected to the United States Congress \nwhere he quickly learned the ropes and became a major player in \nnational politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, he was such an influential player, that he blocked both \nGrant and Blaine from the presidential nomination in 1880. When the \nRepublicans could not agree on Blaine, Grant, or Sherman, they chose \nGarfield as their \"dark horse\" candidate. On this day, November 2, \n1880, the fervent Disciples of Christ lay-minister was elected the \n20th president of the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis presidency was weak and short-lived. Because he stood against a \npatronage system (which effectively gave senators control of \npolitical appointments in their states) he angered many would-be \noffice holders. One of them shot him in a Washington railroad \nstation. Garfield teetered between life and death for three and a \nhalf months before dying on September 19, 1881.\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Garfield, James Arthur.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "title": "LUTHER'S 95 THESES START WITH BIBLE TRANSLATION",
    "words": "Why Luther's 95 Theses Start with a \nCritique of a Bible Translation \u0014\n                                                                    \n31 Oct 2017, Mark Ward\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first of Luther's famous 95 Theseswhose 500th anniversary we \ncelebrate todayis a critique of an erroneously translated phrase in \nJerome's translation of Matthew 4:17. In English we know this as, \nRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luther wrote in \nThesis 1,\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, Poenitentiam agite, he \nwilled the entire life of believers to be one of repentance. (See \nLuther's Works, 31:25)\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther does not come out and say that Jerome errednot on October 31, \n1517. But by at least May 30, 1518, writing to mentor Johann von \nStaupitz, he feels that the Roman church was indeed misled by the \nLatin term, because the expression poenitentiam ag[ite] suggests more \nan action than a change in disposition. It makes Jesus sound like \nhe's saying, Do penance. And, Luther says, in no way does this do \njustice to the Greek. (Luther's Works, 48:6768) What Jesus really \nsaid was, Repent. And as Luther says in the second of the 95 \ntheses, he meant inner repentance producing various outward \nmortifications of the flesh. (31:25)\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther's nailing of the 95 theses on the church door is symbolic (so \nsymbolic that it probably didn't happen; ah well)it is the moment \nwe've collectively chosen to anoint as the beginning of the \nReformation precisely because it symbolizes so many Reformation \nvalues: the power of the written word (and the printing of it, as our \nReformation timeline shows); the importance of individual conscience; \nthe possibility that one voice can successfully protest against \ncorrupt institutions; and eventhough the point is subtlethe \nimportance of Bible translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause if poenitentiam agite is a bad translation, how do we make \nsure such mistranslations don't happen again? How can we give God's \nwords reliably to people who don't speak Hebrew and Greek? Luther and \nthe Reformation saw with new clarity that the Bible demands to be \ntranslated into the language of the people.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new defense for Bible translation\u0014\n\u0014\nThis doctrine needed defense in Luther's time, and in view of today's \nnew threats it needs new defenses. Because the Bible is written in \n(basically) two different languages, it demands to be translated.\u0014\n\u0014\nCould God possibly have intended for his words to be available only \nto those relatively few people in history who understand both \nbiblical Hebrew and Koine Greek (and a smattering of Aramaic)? \nNoJesus told his disciples to teach all nations and to be his \nwitnesses to the end of the earth. I would argue that both \ntestaments are a necessary portion of that teaching and witness: the \nHebrew Bible is part of God's authoritative revelation. Jesus treated \nit that way, as did Paul and the early Christians. Where the apostles \nwent, so did both testaments (as the latter developed, of course).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd where the Old Testament went in the early church, it went in \nGreek translation, namely the Septuagint. The Christian religion, \nfollowing a major precedent set by the Jews and accepted by Christ's \nfollowers, has always properly been one in which translation was \nwelcome and needed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs many have pointed out, this is not true of Islam: the Qur'an is \nwritten in one language, seventh-century Arabic. And though Islamic \ntheologians have not been united on this point, the general feeling \nto this day, says Reza Aslan, is that non-Arabic versions of the \nQuran areinterpretations of the Quran[, not translations]. Unless \nthe original Arabic verses are embedded on the page, it cannot \ntechnically be called a Quran.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have not had similar qualms. Leather covers the world over \nbear HOLY BIBLE, or SVET BIBLIJE, or SANTA BIBLIA (when I was young I \nsaw in this in bookstores not realizing it was Spanish and thought it \nwas a Christmas-themed study edition: the Santa Bible!?). Although \nthere is an ultimate difference between the Greek and Hebrew \noriginals and their various translationsa translation is God's Word \nonly insofar as it reflects those originalsa faithful preacher can \neasily go a few months never needing to mention this fact. When I \npreach, I self-consciously stand behind the pulpit, hold up an \nEnglish Bible, and tell my church people, Thus saith the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Reformation reason to have multiple Bible translations\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, Bible translations such as the Vulgate can produce \nerrorsor (more likely) misunderstandings. Most Christians are, to \nsome degree, at the mercy of translators to do their job well. There \nhas to be room for a Luther to come along and not only point out the \noffending phrase but offer an alternative, as the German Reformer did \nby translating the Bible into his own heart language. Luther couldn't \nunseat the Latin Vulgate's error by himself. All he could do was \noffer that alternative.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all the acrimony created today by the existence of alternative \nEnglish Bible translations, I'm deeply glad they exist. They are a \ngood fruit of the Reformation. When all we have is one translation, \nmisunderstandings are less likely to be caught. The mere existence of \nalternatives ought to give Christians confidence that they don't have \nto be tripped up by a mistranslated phrase. They have resources to \nhelp them avoid another poenitentiam agite. If one translation is \nslightly misleading (or, rarely, outright wrong), another will \ncomplement it or correct it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we do have, thanks in large part to Luther and his Reformation, \nis accessaccess to the truth of God's words through multiple good \ntranslations in our own languages. Luther's own assessment of his \nhistorical role points to that word. He wrote,\u0014\n\u0014\nI opposed indulgences and all the papists, but never with force. I \nsimply taught, preached, and wrote God's Word; otherwise I did \nnothing. And while I slept, or drank Wittenberg beer with my \nfriends, the Word so greatly weakened the papacy that no prince or \nemperor ever inflicted such losses upon it. I did nothing; the Word \ndid everything. (Luther's Works, 51:77).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMark L. Ward, Jr. received his PhD from Bob Jones University in 2012; \nhe now serves the church as a Logos Pro. His most recent book \nisAuthorized: The Use and Misuse of the King James Bible(forthcoming, \nLexham Press).\u0014",

    "title": "LIFE EXPECTANCY DROPPING DRAMATICALLY IN U.S.",
    "words": "Alcohol and Suicide Are Causing Life Expectancy in America to Drop \nDramatically\u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. life expectancy has decreased for the second year in a row, and \nan editorial in the BMJ points to three contributing factors: drugs, \nalcohol and suicides, particularly among middle-age white Americans \nand those living in rural communities. The authors of the paper paint \na bleak picture of the problems facing much of the United States \ntoday, but the authors say that policies that bolster the \nmiddle-class can help reverse the trend.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recent drop in life expectancy is alarming, the editorial states, \nbecause life expectancy has risen for much of the past century in \ndeveloped countries, including in the U.S. Compared to gains made by \nother developed countries, however, the United States began to lose \nground in the 1980s. Americans life expectancy plateaued in 2012, \nand now is headed in the opposite direction.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomething is amiss in the health of Americans, and the country, on a \npopulation level, is sick and dying earlier, says the editorials \nlead author, Steven Woolf, director of the Center on Society and \nHealth at Virginia Commonwealth University. Quite simply, it means \nthat babies born today are likely to live a shorter life than those \nborn a year or two ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs to why U.S. life expectancy is declining, Woolf says that many \npeople point toward the current opioid epidemic. Thats certainly a \nbig factor, but its also a larger problem thats been going on for \ndecades, he says. We know there are deeper systemic causes, that \npaint a picture of hopelessness and despair and struggling with \ndifficult living conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2013, Woolf and his co-author Laudan Aron, a senior fellow at the \nUrban Institute, published a study that found that Americans have \npoorer health in many areasincluding birth outcomes, injuries, \nhomicides, adolescent pregnancies, HIV/AIDS rates, obesity, diabetes \nand heart diseasewhen compared to other high-income countries. They \nalso cite lifestyle factors such as high-calorie diets, drug abuse, \ngun ownership, living in cities designed for cars instead of \npedestrians and lack of universal health care as likely contributors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while the rate of fatal drug overdoses increased by 137% from \n2000 to 2014, Woolf and Aron say, death rates from alcohol abuse and \nsuicides have also gone up. Between 1999 and 2014, the suicide rate \nrose by 24%, with the sharpest increases among white Americans ages \n25 to 59, people with limited education, women and people in rural \ncounties.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not entirely clear why white Americans who live in rural areas \nare dying at higher rates from these factors, Woolf and Aron say. But \nexperts have suggested that economic hardships, the collapse of local \nindustries, and the loss of security held by previous generations \nhave hit white Americans harder in recent years. Black Americans, on \nthe other hand, have contended with longstanding structural \ndisadvantages, discrimination, and higher all cause mortality, the \nauthors write, and may be more resilient as a result.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. is rich, but its wealth is not inclusive, the editorial \nstates. Its social contract is weaker than in other countriesthose \nin need have less access to social services, healthcare, or the \nprevention and treatment of mental illness and addiction. The \nAmerican dream is increasingly out of reach, as social mobility \ndeclines and fewer children face a better future than their parents.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe silver lining in this dark data, says Woolf, is that change is \npossibleand that the same things that are good for Americas economy \ncan also be good for the nations health outcomes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe solutions to dealing with this problem are not very different \nfrom the priorities we should have to strengthen the middle-class \noverall, he says. What people in the health field would recommend \nis improvements in education, employment, and economic opportunities \nfor the low-income and middle-class segments of our populationand \nthose same investments are going to improve economic prosperity and \nsocial mobility for much of America; thats the win-win here.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn theory, policymakers should be rushing to implement improvements \nin these areas.

Thats certainly a \nbig factor, but its also a larger problem thats been going on for \ndecades, he says. We know there are deeper systemic causes, that \npaint a picture of hopelessness and despair and struggling with \ndifficult living conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2013, Woolf and his co-author Laudan Aron, a senior fellow at the \nUrban Institute, published a study that found that Americans have \npoorer health in many areasincluding birth outcomes, injuries, \nhomicides, adolescent pregnancies, HIV/AIDS rates, obesity, diabetes \nand heart diseasewhen compared to other high-income countries. They \nalso cite lifestyle factors such as high-calorie diets, drug abuse, \ngun ownership, living in cities designed for cars instead of \npedestrians and lack of universal health care as likely contributors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while the rate of fatal drug overdoses increased by 137% from \n2000 to 2014, Woolf and Aron say, death rates from alcohol abuse and \nsuicides have also gone up. Between 1999 and 2014, the suicide rate \nrose by 24%, with the sharpest increases among white Americans ages \n25 to 59, people with limited education, women and people in rural \ncounties.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not entirely clear why white Americans who live in rural areas \nare dying at higher rates from these factors, Woolf and Aron say. But \nexperts have suggested that economic hardships, the collapse of local \nindustries, and the loss of security held by previous generations \nhave hit white Americans harder in recent years. Black Americans, on \nthe other hand, have contended with longstanding structural \ndisadvantages, discrimination, and higher all cause mortality, the \nauthors write, and may be more resilient as a result.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. is rich, but its wealth is not inclusive, the editorial \nstates. Its social contract is weaker than in other countriesthose \nin need have less access to social services, healthcare, or the \nprevention and treatment of mental illness and addiction. The \nAmerican dream is increasingly out of reach, as social mobility \ndeclines and fewer children face a better future than their parents.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe silver lining in this dark data, says Woolf, is that change is \npossibleand that the same things that are good for Americas economy \ncan also be good for the nations health outcomes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe solutions to dealing with this problem are not very different \nfrom the priorities we should have to strengthen the middle-class \noverall, he says. What people in the health field would recommend \nis improvements in education, employment, and economic opportunities \nfor the low-income and middle-class segments of our populationand \nthose same investments are going to improve economic prosperity and \nsocial mobility for much of America; thats the win-win here.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn theory, policymakers should be rushing to implement improvements \nin these areas. But the pro-business policy agenda favored by \nelected officials rarely prioritizes these needs, Woolf and Aron \nwrite in their editorial. Current policies in Washington are in many \nways neglecting the middle classand in some cases, not just \nneglecting them but pulling the rug out from under then entirely, \nWoolf says.

    "title": "LEW WALLACE, AUTHOR OF BEN HUR",
    "words": "Lew Wallace, Author of Ben Hur\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn February l5, l905, Lewis Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, died. Lew \nleft behind him a lifetime of political and military accomplishments. \nThe world, however, remembers him chiefly as the author of the novel \nBen Hur, which he subtitled, \"a tale of the Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLew Wallace was born in 1827, the son of an Indiana governor. As a \nyoung man he served in the United States' war with Mexico. After the \nwar, he studied law, set up a law practice, and served in the Indiana \nState Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he immediately re-enlisted and rose to \nthe rank of Major General. In 1864, he fought--and lost--the Battle \nof Monocacy, but he held his position long enough to allow union \ndefenders to reach Washington, D.C., preventing its capture by \nConfederate general Jubal Early. After the war, Lew served on the \ncourt martial that tried Lincoln's assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nLew was inspired to write novels after reading Prescott's Conquest of \nMexico. His first novel, The Fair God, was about those events. His \nsecond novel, Ben Hur, was conceived after sitting on a train, \nlistening spellbound for two hours, while the agnostic Colonel Robert \nIngersoll, poured out \"a medley of argument, eloquence, wit, satire, \naudacity, irreverence, poetry, brilliant antitheses, and pungent \nexcoriation of believers in God, Christ, and Heaven, the like of \nwhich I had never heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, Lew had been indifferent to the claims of religion \n(although he loved the story of the wise men and had begun a tale \nabout them). \"... Yet here was I now moved as never before, and by \nwhat? The most outright denials of all human knowledge of God, \nChrist, Heaven... Was the Colonel right? What had I on which to \nanswer yes or no? He had made me ashamed of my ignorance: and \nthen--here is the unexpected of the affair--as I walked on in the \ncool darkness, I was aroused for the first time in my life to the \nimportance of religion... I thought of the manuscript in my desk. Its \nclosing scene was the child Christ in the cave by Bethlehem: why not \ngo on with the story down to the crucifixion? That would make a book, \nand compel me to study everything of pertinency; after which, \npossibly, I would be possessed of opinions of real value. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It only remains to say that I did as resolved, with results--first, \nthe book Ben Hur, and second, a conviction amounting to absolute \nbelief in God and the Divinity of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile governor of New Mexico, Lew wrote his dramatic story. Though \nnever a member of a church, he became the best selling religious \nauthor of his day. Ben Hur sold 300,000 copies within ten years, and \nwas translated into dozens of languages, including Arabic and \nChinese. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Ben Hur was published in 1880, Wallace began a \nfour-year term as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, where he cultivated very \ngood relations with the Sultan. The last years of his life Wallace \nspent as a public lecturer. Today his statue stands in the Capitol \nbuilding at Washington, representing the State of Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story. \u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n1907.\u0014\nGeneral Lew Wallace Study and Museum. http://www.ben-hur.com/\u0014\nMorsberger, Robert E. and Morsberger, Katherine M.

    "words": "Let Your Daughters Grow Up To Be Horse Girls \u0014\nBy: Blogger Lauren Sprieser \u0014\nMay 17, 2018 \u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters grow up to be horse girls.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet them learn early the joy of dirt under their fingernails and the \nresponsibility of cleaning tack or sweeping aisles. Let them learn \nthat if they dont do the chores, or if they dont keep their grades \nup, they cant go ride. Let them struggle it out with lesson horses \nthat arent very skilled, only to then earn their way to either a \nhorse that is kind and fun to ride, or a horse that is just a big \nenough monster to keep them humble, and to maim them just a little, \nbut not permanently damage them. Whichever one they start with, make \nsure its followed by the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters set goals and reach them. Let them set \ngoals and fail miserably.\u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters go to horse shows. Let them learn to deal \nwith nerves, with crowds, with going from hearing their coach in \ntheir ear every step to being totally alone. Let them learn to plan \nahead, or let them forget their breeches or hairnet or test, and \ndont save them, so they learn to take some ownership and not do it \nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet them set goals and reach them. Let them set goals and fail \nmiserably. Let them learn that, if they work incredibly hard, \npractice like hell, ride the best quality horse they can and take \nimpeccable care of him, theyre sometimes going to get beat by \nsomeone with 10 times the money and one tenth the drive.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet your daughters grow up in the barn. Let them learn that horses \ndont care about your schedule or your plans. Let them learn that \nbuckets need filling and stalls need cleaning, even when its \nraining, even when its frozen, even when they have a different idea \nfor how the day should go. Teach them to drive trucks and trailers \nand ATVs. Teach them to change tires and wrap legs and give shots. \nAnd let them leave a spur mark, or a bit rub, or a bandage bow, and \nlet them deal with the shame of causing pain to an animal they love.\u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters make mistakes. Let them enter the show \none level too high and get their butts kicked. Let them ride the \nhorse thats beyond them and hit the dirt. Let them be rude to the \npony once, because the pony will make it clear that that will only \nhappen once. Ditto talking back to the clinician, or getting angry at \nthe show and lashing out in front of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet your daughters be working students. Let them learn that no one is \never so good a rider that they cant clean stalls. Let them learn \nthat well pumps break exclusively at 3 a.m. on hot days. Let them \nlearn that even when clients are literally THE WORST, they still have \nto be nice to them. Let them be a working student for someone whos a \njerk to learn how to deal with a crappy boss, and then let them be \ninspired be a great boss, and then let them remember both when \ntheyre the boss. Let them learn their own unimportance. And then let \nthem learn that if they make themselves invaluable, if they prove \ntheir worth, they will be given opportunities, just never when they \nexpect it.\u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters own horses. Let them spend a little money \non something underwhelming and have it blow everyones expectations \nout of the water. Let them spend a lot of money on something \nextravagant and learn that big dreams require big risks. Let them \nlearn that colic surgery and lameness and founder dont care how much \nthe horse cost or whether it has potential or not. Let them learn the \njoy of handwalking and icing. Let them watch other riders succeed \nwhen theyre stuck with a young horse temper tantrum or an infected \nabscess.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd let them learn that the greatest kindness we can do for our \nhorses is to know when to let it end, whether its declaring victory \nafter a tough ride, or letting a horse go on to the great beyond.\u0014\n\u0014\nParents, let your daughters grow up to be horse girls, because they \nwill learn quickly and repeatedly that life isnt fair, that hard \nwork is often trumped by Lady Luck, and that every defeat, no matter \nhow terrible, is temporary. Let them dream big and kick on. Let them \nlearn confidence, grace and grit. Let them build big muscles and \nstrong backs, and learn that a little blood and a little sweat are \ngood things, because they show you youre living.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet them grow up with horses and with good horse people, because it \nwill teach them to be humble, and to be resilient, and to be brave.\u0014\n\u0014\nSprieserSporthorse.com\u0014\nLauren Sprieser on Facebook\u0014",

    "words": "Lessons in Grief\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief teaches us many things. The first and most important lesson of \ngrief is: You Are Not Immune from Loss... But Youre Not Alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter many family tragedies over three decades I decided to write a \nbook \"Lost But Not Forgotten.\" It is about how God and those he \ninspired helped us endure and transform those losses. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me take you back to the beginning of our story. We lost our 16 \nyear old daughter Shantel in late June of 1987. It was now October in \nthe mountains of Marion, Virginia. As the seasons changed from summer \nto fall, the numbness from losing our daughter began to wear off and \nthe pain of having to move on without her began to set in. We watched \nothers go on with their lives. But ours was frozen in time...for me \nit was the moment the recovery divers removed her lifeless body from \nthat mountain lake. For Patsi it was a short time later when I had to \ntell her: They found her...shes dead. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis loss disturbed us in every way you can possibly imagine: \nspirituality, physically, emotionally...but we had to go on. We had 4 \nother children. We struggled to understand Why?....Why her?...Why \nus?...Why now? \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth of us were sinking deep into disturbing sadness and despair. We \nfelt so alone and isolated from others...so stripped and vulnerable. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut that fall God began to speak to us quietly...dimly... through our \noverwhelming grief.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I stood in front of the Vietnam Memorial my question Why Us was \nanswered, Why Not You? You are not immune from suffering. Look at \nall those who are dying senseless, tragic deaths every day. \u0014\n\u0014\nLater as we heard a couple from our church describe the loss of their \nson, God seemed to be saying You are not immune, but you are also \nnot alone. Many others have walked the road you must now travel. You \ncan learn from them. \u0014\n\u0014\n So I went to our pastor, Fred Austin, and asked him to start a \nsupport group for us. He responded quickly and a few weeks later we \nwere face to face with a room full of people who had lost their \nchildren. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe learned that the disturbing thoughts and feelings we were having \nwere not at all unusual. Others had experienced those same thoughts \nand feelings. Our sense of isolation gradually subsided. We learned \nmany other lessons of grief from these parents. Over the months and \nyears that followed we gradually reconciled our loss. We learned that \nthe word reconcile means to do the work of grief and reconstruct \nour life around our new reality; a reality without our loved one. \u0014\n\u0014\nYears later when Cool Spring Baptist suffered the loss of Pastor Doug \nGrotes daughter Kristen, we joined with another couple to give back \nto others what had been given to us. Over the past 15 years many \npeople have been helped by the Cool Spring Grief Support Ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\n Why do we keep offering this group after all this time? \u0014\n\u0014\nI recently came upon a saying that sums up the value of grief \nsupport. If you dont heal what hurt you, you will bleed on others \nwho didnt cut you. \u0014\n\u0014\nGrief is a pay me now or pay me later experience. We learned early on \nin our loss that most marriages dont survive the loss of a child. \nGrief is much more difficult than we imagine and lasts much longer \nthan we expect. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we do the work that grief requires of us, we will emerge with a \ndeeper relationship with God and become much more sensitive to the \nsuffering of those around us. God never wastes anything. Every \ntear... every sleepless night... every heartache can be used to do \nHis Kingdom work. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said that we are blessed when we are poor in spirit and when we \nmourn. Paul wrote that Gods strength was perfected in his weakness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, will we allow our grief to soften us and make us more sensitive \nto the suffering that is all around us? Or will we box up our pain \nand put it away in the basement of our lives where it will resurface \nagain and again in destructive ways? We have a choice. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJerry Deans jerry.deans@comcast.net (804) 402-2031\u0014",

    "title": "LUTHER'S ANTI-SEMITISM",
    "words": "Most people are surprised to hear of Martin Luthers hatred of the \nJewish people. Heres what he wrote in his book, \"Of the Jews and \ntheir Lies\" (1543). What then shall we Christians do with this \ndamned rejected race of Jews, since they live among us and we know \nabout their lying and blaspheming and curses? We cannot tolerate them \nif we do not wish to share in their lies, curses and blasphemy. We \nmust set their synagogues on fire, and whatever does not burn up \nshould be covered or spread over with dirt so that no one may ever be \nable to see a cinder or stone of it . . . in order that God may see \nthat we are Christians. Their homes should likewise be broken down \nand destroyed . . . They should be deprived of their prayer books and \nTalmuds, in which idolatry, lies, cursings, and blasphemy are taught \n. . . their Rabbis must be forbidden to teach on pain of death. Let \nus drive them out of the country for all  time, for . . . Gods rage \nis so great against them that they only become worse through mild  \nmercy and not much better with severe mercy. Therefore, away with \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese words are contrary to what Luther had written 20 years earlier \nin his book, \"That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew.\" In that work, he \ncalled for sympathy, love and concern for Jewish people. His goal was \nto win them to faith in Jesus and join his Reformation. However, the \nJewish community responded by saying, now that youve rid yourselves \nof all the traditions of the Church, why not abandon the One that \ntheyre all based on, Jesus. This infuriated Luther and caused him to \nturn on the Jewish people, proving that his previously professed \nconcern for Jewish people was merely manipulation. True love would be \nunconditional.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------\u0014\n\u0014\nYet rabbinic teaching was madness and blindness that blasphemed \nChrist, Mary, and the Holy Trinity. Luther could not have any \nfellowship or patience with obstinate [Jewish] blasphemers and those \nwho defame this dear Savior. Blasphemy was a civil crime. To allow \nit to continue, Luther feared, meant Christians would share in the \nguilt for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, Luther now proposed seven measures of sharp mercy that German \nprinces could take against Jews: (1) burn their schools and \nsynagogues; (2) transfer Jews to community settlements; (3) \nconfiscate all Jewish literature, which was blasphemous; (4) prohibit \nrabbis to teach, on pain of death; (5) deny Jews safe-conduct, so as \nto prevent the spread of Judaism; (6) appropriate their wealth and \nuse it to support converts and to prevent the lewd practice of usury; \n(7) assign Jews to manual labor as a form of penance.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther advised clergy, their congregations, and all government \nofficials to help carry out these measures. Since most Jews had been \nexpelled from Germany before 1536, Luthers counsel was implemented \nby few officials. Yet a harsh anti-Jewish measure in 1543 mentioned \nLuthers On the Jews and Their Lies.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Luthers friends and his foes criticized him for proposing these \nmeasures. His best friends begged him to stop his anti-Jewish raving, \nbut Luther continued his attacks in other treatises. He repeated as \ntrue the worst anti-Semitic charges from medieval literature. Jews \nkilled Christian babies; they murdered Christ over and over again by \nstabbing Eucharistic hosts; they poisoned wells.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther now thought what he had accused Catholics of thinking in 1523: \nJews were dogs. We are at fault for not slaying them, he fumed \nshortly before his death.\u0014\n-----------------\u0014",

    "words": "Love Triangle\u0014\n\u0014\nThough his proposal was rejected, Whitefield still felt called to \nmarriage. When he mentioned this to fellow\u0014\nevangelist Howell Harris, Harris discerned an amazingly providential \nsolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarris had fallen in love with one Elizabeth James, a Welsh widow in \nher mid-thirties. Though her affection\u0014\nfor him was equally strong, he, like Whitefield, wanted no creature \nbetween my soul and God. He had\u0014\nlabored to break off the relationship but failed time after time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarris arranged a meeting between Whitefield and Elizabeth James. \nWhitefield was impressed with her\u0014\ndevotion to Christ, so both Harris and Whitefield wrote her, \nsuggesting an exchange of suitors.\u0014\nShe was furious, writing Harris, If you were my own father you had \nno right of disposing me against my\u0014\nwill. Still, she didnt close the door to Whitefield, and as they \ncorresponded over the next months,\u0014\nWhitefield became convinced the match was right. James objected \nmuch, Harris reported, because of\u0014\nher regards to me & that she could not help it still.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, four days later, she agreed to marry Whitefield. At the wedding \na few weeks later, Harris gave away\u0014\nthe bride.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield had vowed that he would not preach one sermon less in a \nmarried than in a single state.\u0014\nDuring the week-long honeymoon in Elizabeths home, he preached twice \na day. From then on, she usually remained in London during his \ntravels. Once he was gone for two years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the obligations of marriage couldnt help but constrain \nWhitefields ministry. Within two months of his\u0014\nwedding, he wrote, O for that blessed time when we shall neither \nmarry nor be given in marriage, but be\u0014\nas the angels of God. Years later he warned a young man, Marry when \nor whom you will, expect trouble\u0014\nin the flesh. After Elizabeths death, though, he said, I feel the \nloss of my right hand daily.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Jamess letters show it took her ten years to get over \nHarris. She suffered four miscarriages, and\u0014\nher only child with Whitefield, a son, died when 4 months old. A man \nwho lived with the couple during\u0014\ntheir last years put it well: He did not intentionally make his wife \nunhappy. He always preserved great\u0014\ndecency and decorum in his conduct towards her.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1993 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "words": "Lott Carey Died in Munitions Explosion\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the former slave, Lott Carey, announced that he was going to \nAfrica as a missionary, his employers at a Virginia tobacco warehouse \noffered him a $200 a year annual increase if he would stay on his \njob. In the 1820s that was good money. But Lott turned it down; he \nwanted to go where his color would not hamper his service, and was \neager to preach the Gospel in Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nLott had been born a slave around 1780 on the estate of William A. \nChristian, a day's ride from Richmond, Virginia. Though his parents \nwere illiterate, Lott's father was a respected member of the Baptist \nChurch. When Lott was twenty-four, he was hired out as a laborer in \nthe Shockhoe tobacco warehouse in Richmond. He was profane and \ndrunken.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in 1807, Lott converted to Christianity and joined the First \nBaptist Church of Richmond. Hearing a sermon on the 3rd chapter of \nthe gospel of John, Lott became eager to learn to read the story of \nNicodemus, which is found in that passage. He learned to read and was \nlicensed to preach.\u0014\n\u0014\nLott was an excellent worker; his efficiency, faithfulness and \nliteracy earned him a promotion to shipping clerk in the tobacco \nwarehouse. The merchants often tipped him and allowed him to collect \nand sell waste tobacco. With the money he saved in this way, he \npurchased his freedom and that of his two young children (his wife \nhad died). Lott continued to work in the tobacco warehouse but also \npreached to the slaves around Richmond. He bought a house and \neducated his children.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1813, about the time Lott bought his freedom, William Crane came \nto Richmond from New Jersey. Lott and William organized a society to \ncollect funds for mission work in Africa. The society chose Lott \nCarey and Collin Teague (another free black) as their missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1822 Lott moved to Monrovia, capital of Liberia, a colony \nestablished for free blacks who wanted to leave America. There he \nestablished Providence Baptist Church--the first church in Liberia. \nHe preached several times a week and gave religious instruction to \nnative children, using his own money to maintain a charity school. He \nalso established a school at Big Town in the Cape Mount region \ndespite Muslim protests.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Lott lost his head in 1823, becoming leader of a resistance \nmovement against the colonial agent Jehudi Ashmun. The freed blacks \nwere dissatisfied with the distribution of land and Lott sided with \nthem. The U.S. sent an armed vessel to deal with the situation in the \nsummer of 1824. After investigation, Jehudi Ashmun was kept on as the \ncolonial agent; the Colonization Society forbade Lott to preach any \nlonger. However, he carried on other mission and medical work.\u0014\n\u0014\nLott and Ashmun were soon reconciled, and Lott became vice agent for \nthe colony. In an apology for his conduct, he said that he had \n\"inflicted in his character a wound that could not be healed in this \nworld, and betrayed the great confidence reposed in him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs vice agent, Lott was responsible for freed Africans arriving from \nthe States as well as slaves recaptured from Trade Town, where the \nslave trade still flourished. Lott and Ashmun established a school \nfor newly-freed Africans.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1828 Jehudi Ashmun returned to America, leaving Liberia's \nmanagement in Lott's hands. Ashmun urged Lott to become the permanent \nagent for the colony. But before Lott could do so, he was mortally \nwounded in a munitions explosion, while preparing to undertake an \nexpedition. He died on this day, November 10, 1828.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Glimpses #114. Christian History Institute, 1999.\u0014\nCassell, C. Abayomi.

    "words": "Lew Wallace, Author of Ben Hur\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February l5, l905, Lewis Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, \ndied. Lew left behind him a lifetime of political and military \naccomplishments. The world, however, remembers him chiefly as the \nauthor of the novel Ben Hur, which he subtitled, \"a tale of the \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLew Wallace was born in 1827, the son of an Indiana governor. As a \nyoung man he served in the United States' war with Mexico. After the \nwar, he studied law, set up a law practice, and served in the Indiana \nState Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he immediately re-enlisted and rose to \nthe rank of Major General. In 1864, he fought--and lost--the Battle \nof Monocacy, but he held his position long enough to allow union \ndefenders to reach Washington, D.C., preventing its capture by \nConfederate general Jubal Early. After the war, Lew served on the \ncourt martial that tried Lincoln's assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nLew was inspired to write novels after reading Prescott's Conquest of \nMexico. His first novel, The Fair God, was about those events. His \nsecond novel, Ben Hur, was conceived after sitting on a train, \nlistening spellbound for two hours, while the agnostic Colonel Robert \nIngersoll, poured out \"a medley of argument, eloquence, wit, satire, \naudacity, irreverence, poetry, brilliant antitheses, and pungent \nexcoriation of believers in God, Christ, and Heaven, the like of \nwhich I had never heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, Lew had been indifferent to the claims of religion \n(although he loved the story of the wise men and had begun a tale \nabout them). \"... Yet here was I now moved as never before, and by \nwhat? The most outright denials of all human knowledge of God, \nChrist, Heaven... Was the Colonel right? What had I on which to \nanswer yes or no? He had made me ashamed of my ignorance: and \nthen--here is the unexpected of the affair--as I walked on in the \ncool darkness, I was aroused for the first time in my life to the \nimportance of religion... I thought of the manuscript in my desk. Its \nclosing scene was the child Christ in the cave by Bethlehem: why not \ngo on with the story down to the crucifixion? That would make a book, \nand compel me to study everything of pertinency; after which, \npossibly, I would be possessed of opinions of real value.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It only remains to say that I did as resolved, with results--first, \nthe book Ben Hur, and second, a conviction amounting to absolute \nbelief in God and the Divinity of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile governor of New Mexico, Lew wrote his dramatic story. Though \nnever a member of a church, he became the best selling religious \nauthor of his day. Ben Hur sold 300,000 copies within ten years, and \nwas translated into dozens of languages, including Arabic and Chinese.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Ben Hur was published in 1880, Wallace began a \nfour-year term as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, where he cultivated very \ngood relations with the Sultan. The last years of his life Wallace \nspent as a public lecturer. Today his statue stands in the Capitol \nbuilding at Washington, representing the State of Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n1907.\u0014\nGeneral Lew Wallace Study and Museum. http://www.ben-hur.com/\u0014\nMorsberger, Robert E. and Morsberger, Katherine M.

    "words": "Let There Be Peace Between Argentina and Chile\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHow seldom in history have councils of peace prevailed. How seldom \nhas faith intervened in history to bring pacific solutions to \nnations. In the early 1900s that rarity occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nArgentina and Chile were rattling sabers. At stake was the boundary \nin the Andes between the two nations. The dispute was over whether \nthe line should be drawn at the watershed or at the highest point of \nthe range. War threatened in 1902.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people of the Andes are by and large Roman Catholics. Remembering \na November 1st, 1900 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII which called for \nconsecration of the entire world to Christ the Redeemer, Christians \nurged their respective governments to settle matters amicably. The \ngovernments of Argentina and Chile listened. They agreed to submit \nthe matter for arbitration. Arbitrating the Northern end of the line \nwas the United States ambassador. Arbitrating the Southern end was \nKing Edward VII of England. War was averted when both sides accepted \nthe results in 1903.\u0014\n\u0014\nHappy as was this outcome, it is not the end of the story. Monsignor \nMarcolino del Carmel Benavente, the Bishop of San Juan, suggested the \nerection of a statue to remind the people of Christ's words, \"And I, \nif I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\" The \nstatue would remind all that they should be consecrated to mutual \nunderstanding. Thus was born the concept of the Christ of the Andes.\u0014\n\u0014\nTourists traveling the Pan American highway can see the result: a 26 \nfoot tall bronze Christ holding out his right hand in blessing over \nthe disputant nations. His left hand clings to a cross. Under his \nfeet is the Western hemisphere. Located 13,000 feet up in Uspallata \nPass, Mount Aconcagua forms its backdrop, lofting 13,000 feet higher. \nThis is the highest readily accessible point on the boundary between \nthe two nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nSculptor Mateo Alonso modeled the work. Seora Angela de Oliveira \nCzar de Costa raised the financing. In a symbolic gesture, old \ncannons were melted down to make the casting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statue was dedicated on this day, March 13, 1904. One of the \nplaques at its base reminds us \"He is our peace who hath made us \none.\" Another Spanish language plaque, dating from 1937, reads: \n\"Sooner shall these mountains crumble into dust than Argentines and \nChileans break the peace sworn at the feet of Christ the Redeemer.\" \nMore than a memorial of a single reconciliation, the statue \nrepresents a vow of eternal peace between Chile and Argentina. Its \nChrist speaks peace to an entire world. Such monuments are rare in \nthis tumultuous globe, where ploughshares are more often beaten into \nswords than swords into ploughshares.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBonsall, Elizabeth Hubbard.

With an instinct for the essential, \nJosephus seizes upon the one thing that separated this Jesus from all \nother bearers of that name: from the time of this Jesus down to \nJosephus day, some people hailed him as the Messiah. So important \nwas it to use Christ as a distinguishing name for Jesus that, by \nthe time of Paul in the midfifties of the 1st century A.D., Christ \nwas well on its way to becoming Jesus second name. It is not \nsurprising, therefore, that when the pagan historians Tacitus and \n(probably) Suetonius write of Jesus in the early 2d century they use \nnot the name Jesus but rather the title Christ as though it were \nhis proper name.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeier, J.

    "words": "Saturday, July 31  \u0014\nLas Casas Fought to Protect Indians from Spanish Colonists    \nChristian History\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN THE INDIANS of central America learned of the death of Bartolom \nde las Casas on this day, 31 July 1566, they mourned and lit fires in \nhis name. Las Casas had been a true friend to them. They called him \nFather to the Indians. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom their arrival in the New World, the Spanish had treated the \nnative population with great cruelty. Las Casas initially \nparticipated in raids on the Indians. He had migrated to Santo \nDomingo in 1502, and settled on a plantation (encomienda) there, \nenjoying the fruits of conscripted labor. His attitude shifted \ngradually, due in part to Dominican friars, arriving in 1510, who \ndenounced the cruelty of the Spaniards. That same year, Las Casas \nbecame the first Spaniard ordained in the New World. In 1511, Father \nMontesinos, another Dominican, asked the colonists how they could \ncall themselves Christians while perpetrating their daily \nbarbarities. Montesinoss audience screamed threats at him. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite becoming a priest, Las Casas remained a plantation owner. He \nwas a chaplain to the Spaniards who conquered Cuba in 1513. But the \nfollowing year, while reading the Bible, he became convinced the \nSpanish had been wrong to seize native lands and treat the \ninhabitants with such barbarity. He freed his slaves and preached \nthat all slave-owners should do the same. When his counsel was \nrebuffed, he sailed to Spain with Montesinos and another friend to \nlay his case before the king. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe reminded the king that the pope had granted Spain its New World \npossessions with the stipulation they evangelize the Indians. \nCardinal Cisneros, acting as regent, appointed Las Casas Protector of \nthe Indians and sent a commission of three Hieronymite friars \n(members of an Augustinian religious order) to assume the government \nof the New World with Las Casas as their advisor. The plantation \nowners and governors resisted the commission so fiercely that it \naccomplished little. Relations between Las Casas and the \ncommissioners deteriorated. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor fifty years, Las Casas worked in behalf of the Indians. He \ninvolved himself in a number of social (and socialist) schemes for \ntheir well being, which, for the most part, came to little. He \nattempted to evangelize Guatemala, preaching the Gospel to his \nhearers as equals, insisting that conversion must be voluntary and \nbased on a knowledge and understanding of the faith. This went \nagainst the methods of the Franciscans who held mass baptisms of \nuninstructed people. \u0014\n\u0014\nReturning to Spain, Las Casas succeeded in having the New Laws of \n1542 promulgated. These were fairer to the Indians, but were largely \ndisregarded by the Spaniards, who knew the king was too far away to \nenforce them. Altogether, Las Casas returned to Spain five times to \nlobby for the Indians. His last voyage was in 1546, after he was \nappointed bishop of the impoverished Chiapas region of Mexico. \nBecause he refused absolution to slave owners, even those who were \ndying, unless they freed their slaves and restored their property, \nLas Casas faced furious opposition from the Spaniards. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Indians rose up in revolt against Spains cruelty. \nSeizing the opportunity, enemies of Las Casas blamed his teaching. \nThe Spanish Court ordered him home to answer accusations. He proved \nit was Spanish cruelty that led to the revolt, and the king believed \nhim. Nonetheless, he was not allowed to return to his see. He died in \nSpain in 1566. A few days before his death, he wrote a last letter \nagainst the injustice done the Indians: It has brought great infamy \non the name of Jesus Christ and of the Christian religion, entirely \nhindering the spread of the faith and irreparably injuring the souls \nand bodies of those innocent peoples.\u0014",

Jonathan Barker, who leads \nGrace Lutheran Church, announced that God was leading him to fast \nover the climate change policy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 4:26 pm this afternoon, I took my last bite of stir fry \nvegetables and rice and started what I hope will be my last multi-day \nfast for climate justice, he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nA picture of Barker wearing a Green New Deal hat as he ate his last \nmeal before the fast accompanied the post. While he initially wanted \nto avoid the fast, Barker says that the Lord continued convicting him.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Jonah, I feel like I was running in the exact opposite way God \nwanted as I put off this fast, he explained. But this morning, like \nJeremiah, when I woke up, God put a fire in my bones I could no \nlonger ignore.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo this afternoon, as I made lunch, I told Rae what God was calling \nme to do, and she encouraged me to follow my heart, the pastor \ncontinued.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to The Christian Post, Barkers church is affiliated with \nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, a liberal denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his Facebook post, Barker described the importance of the climate \nbill, calling it a once-in-a-species moment to avoid catastrophic \nwarming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe path to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is to pass this \nbig climate bill in the United States and then use that as leverage \nat COP 26 in Glasgow this fall to convince other countries to take \nstrong climate action as well  they have been waiting for us to \nact, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Barker hoped that the bill would pass as early as Monday, the \nproposed legislation failed to pass the Senate after Republican \nSenators voted against it. Senate Democrats, however, will attempt to \npass a bill funding government operations after the fiscal year ends \non Thursday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is unclear as to whether Barker broke the fast.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Facebook post from Saturday, Barker stated that he would \nclosely evaluate how he is feeling each week and determine whether he \nwill continue fasting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, if I get to 6 percent body fat, I will immediately stop \nfasting, he added.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would appreciate your prayers for miraculous strength for this \nfast and quick action in passing this climate bill, Barker concluded.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not the first time Barker has fasted over climate change. \nAccording to Kenosha News, in 2019, the Lutheran pastor embarked on a \n12-day fast in support of the Green New Deal.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus would support the Green New Deal, Barker said at the time. \nAt the heart of Jesus teaching, and his ministry, is the command to \nlove our neighbor as yourself. At the heart of the Green New Deal, \nand in each of its proposals, is loving your neighbor.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer.\u0014",

    "words": "American Lutherans Prospered Under Muhlenbergs Bold Leadership\u0014\n \u0014\nWHEN Henry Melchior Muhlenberg arrived in Pennsylvania in the \neighteenth century, its Lutheran immigrants were without leadership. \nSo sad, so degraded is the condition of our poor Lutheran people, \nthat you could hardly bewail it enough with tears of blood, he \nwrote. His congregation of about fifty families received him eagerly, \nand he held his first service on a barn floor. \u0014\n\u0014\nTrained among Pietists, Muhlenberg believed religion must be of the \nheart as well as of the mind and was filled with a burning desire to \nsave souls. His congregation grew so quickly the barn was too small \nand the people had to build a church and schoolhouse. As pastor and \nschool teacher, Muhlenberg traveled constantly to care for scattered \nLutherans in Philadelphia, New Hanover, and Trappe. His diary \ndescribed dangerous floods and deep snows. His people were so poor \nthey often did not pay him and he was forced to borrow money for \nclothes. Enemies tried to ruin his reputation by having a woman of \nquestionable character accuse him of sexual advances. Under \nquestioning, she confessed the plot. Despite these difficulties, he \npersisted in his labors. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen New Jersey Lutherans pleaded for guidance, he visited them, \nestablished schools, and even opened a part-time seminary there. In \n1745 he married Anna Maria Weiser. Together they had eleven children, \nsome of whom became notable leaders in the early days of the United \nStates. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1748, just six years after arriving in the American colonies, \nMuhlenberg organized Americas first Lutheran synod. For this \nachievement, he became known as the Patriarch of the Lutheran Church \nin America. He refused to allow himself to be distracted by political \nevents, saying when the expansion of the church came at a time when \nPhiladelphians expected France and Spain to attack their city: We \nsaid that we had been sent to preach to our people repentance toward \nGod and faith in the Lord Jesus, and hence we could not mix in \npolitical affairs... However, Muhlenbergs friendship with other \ndenominations was warm, and he held services for Presbyterians, \nReformed, Episcopalians, and Catholics. His last years were marred by \nbroken health. \u0014\n\u0014\nHaving worn himself out in service, on this day, 7 October 1787 Henry \nMelchior Muhlenberg died quietly in The Trappe, Pennsylvania, where \nhe had retired at the beginning of the Revolutionary War. He was laid \nto rest three days later near the Augustus church he had built \nforty-five years earlier when he first came to America. Many mourned \nhis passing. \u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Legends About Luther\u0014\n\u0014\nMARTIN LUTHER became a legend in his own time. Soon after 1517, as \nthe 95 Theses made him famous, stories and pictures began to paint \nhim larger than life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne early woodcut portrayed Luther as a young monk holding an open \nBible, while rays of light stream from a halo surrounding his head.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Diet of Worms in 1521, a popular pamphlet retold the story \nof Luthers appearance before Emperor Charles Vwith characters and \nscenes from the Passion of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Luthers followers were eager to make him a saint, his \nopponents were just as eager to discredit him. One of his earliest \nbiographers, the Catholic critic John Cochlaeus, suggested that \nLuther seemed peculiar to his monastic brothers because he once \nsuffered a fit during mass. When Luther heard the Gospel lesson (Mark \n9:1429) about the boy with the deaf and dumb spirit cast out by \nJesus, he allegedly fell to the floor crying, It is not me, not me! \nThis legend has continued to fuel suspicion that Luther suffered from \na mental disorder; psychoanalyst Erik Erikson made it the subject of \nan entire chapter in his popular book Young Man Luther (1958).\u0014\n\u0014\nMost misconceptions about Luther, however, arose harmlessly and only \ngradually. Like all myths, they contain a kernel of truth. Here are \nfive often told experiences from Luthers life that need some \nclarification.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Thunderstorm Conversion\u0014\n\u0014\nA Damascus-road experience?\u0014\nAfter Luther finished his Master of Arts degree at the University of \nErfurt, he embarked on the study of law. Then, in the summer of 1505, \nafter a visit to his parents home, Luther returned to Erfurt. \nFrightened by a thunderstorm near Stotternheim, he cried out: Help \nme, St. Anna! l will become a monk.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis sudden decision made on the road in a flash of lightning \nreminded contemporaries of the conversion of St. Paul on the road to \nDamascus. The comparison remained popular well into the nineteenth \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than likely, Luther was indeed frightened by a storm near \nStotternheim. By his own account he did vow to St. Anna, the popular \npatron saint of miners, that he would become a monk.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere the storm and Luthers vow, however, akin to Pauls conversion? \nNot necessarily. Luther was certainly not converted in the sense that \na formerly indifferent young man suddenly became serious about \nreligion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurthermore, Luther regretted having made the vow. He not only \nadopted the monastic life but also, unlike Paul with Christianity, \nleft it again.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the experience did have marks of a conversion. When Luther \nentered the monastery, he went from living in the world to living in \nthe cloistera change that for centuries had been described as \nconversion. Like a new convert, he took his new life seriously. If \never a monk could have reached heaven through monkery, he asserted, \nthen it was I.Tower Experience\u0014\n\u0014\nInstant discovery?\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to older biographies, Luther discovered the gospel all at \nonce while reading Pauls Epistle to the Romans in the tower of the \nAugustinian cloister. That notion was based on direct and indirect \nsources supplied by the reformer himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the direct source, a flashback written the year before his death, \nLuther described how a new understanding of Gods righteousness \nfinally came to him after he had meditated day and night on Romans \n1:1718.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe indirect source is Luthers Table Talk, a compilation (by \nstudents and associates) of Luthers observations at meals during his \nlater years. In the Table Talk, Luther located his discovery both in \nthe tower and in the cl. of the monastery.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome scholars, especially those favoring a psychoanalytical \ninterpretation, read cl. as cloaca, toilet, and reconstructed a \nscene that connected Luthers discovery with both physical and \nemotional release.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent research, however, has generally abandoned the image of \nLuthers theological discovery as a sudden, momentary experience. All \nthe sources are flashbacks. It is likely that the discovery came as \nthe culmination of a long, painstaking attempt to understand Pauls \nsaying that the righteousness of God was revealed in the gospel \n(Romans 1:17). At the end of his flashback, Luther emphasized how \nhard he had worked at understanding Scripture, not how quickly he had \narrived at that understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther scholars still are not united on an exact date for Luthers \ndiscovery. But most agree that between 1515 and 1518, as he \ndiligently studied and lectured on the Bible in Wittenberg, Luther \narrived at a new, positive understanding of righteousness as a gift \nof God received in faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Posting 95 Theses\u0014\n\u0014\nDid he nail them to the Castle Church door?\u0014\nCountless Protestant bulletin covers for Reformation Sunday have \npictured Luther as a rebellious monk nailing the 95 Theses to the \ndoor of the Castle Church in Wittenberg on October 31, 1517. Luther \nhimself never reported having engaged in such an act of protest.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe depiction of his posting the theses stems from his younger \ncolleague, Philipp Melanchthon, who was not in Wittenberg in 1517, \nand who did not record the incident until after Luthers death. \nNevertheless, the story became a standard part of Luther lore and \nLuther biographies until recently.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe posting of the theses was called into question by Catholic \nhistorian Erwin Iserloh in 1961. He pointed out that the debate to \nwhich the theses were an invitation never took place in Wittenberg. \nFurther, in order to provoke discussion of papal indulgences, Luther \nsent the theses to his superiors in the church and to other scholars \naround Germany. According to Iserloh, the theses were not nailed; \nthey were mailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis challenge by a Catholic historian at first elicited protests \nfrom Protestant scholars. They rightly pointed out that in other ways \nLuther did attack abuses in the indulgence trade. Attempts were made \nto prove that Luther had indeed nailed the theses to the church door, \neven if they were meant only to announce a debate. Gradually, \nhowever, Iserlohs view has gained wider acceptance and softened the \npicture of how the Reformation began.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Here I Stand!\u0014\n\u0014\nDid he really say that?\u0014\nIn April 1521, Luther appeared before Emperor Charles V to defend \nwhat he had taught and written. At the end of his speech, the story \ngoes, he spoke the famous words, Here I stand; I can do no other. \nGod help me.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest printed version of Luthers address added these words, \nwhich were not recorded on the spot. Its possible they are genuine, \nbut for almost a half century now, most scholars have believed they \nwere probably not spoken by Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second misunderstanding arises when the words Here I stand are \nquoted as evidence of Luthers modern stand against the medieval \npowers of church and empire. Luthers speech was not a defiant, \nsolitary protest, but a calm, reasoned account of why he had written \nthe books piled on the table before him and why he could not recant \ntheir content.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther asserted that his conscience was captive to the Word of God \nand that he could not go against conscience. This was not, however, a \nmodern plea for the supremacy of the individual conscience or for \nreligious freedom. Though already excommunicated by Rome, Luther saw \nhimself as a sworn teacher of Scripture who must advocate the right \nof all Christians to hear and live by the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Hurling An Inkwell at the Devil\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did the spot get on the wall?\u0014\nWhatever he might say at Worms, Luther had been guaranteed safe \nconduct back to Wittenberg. Because, however, Charles V declared \nLuther an outlaw, his prince, the Elector Frederick, had Luther \nkidnapped and placed in hiding at the Wartburg Castle.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater stories of Luthers ten-month stay at the Wartburg frequently \ntold of his battle with the Devil. The Devil constantly disturbed his \nworkas a fly buzzing around his head, or as a large, black dog in \nLuthers bed, or by making a racket to keep Luther awake. The most \nfamous story told how Luther once threw an inkwell at the Devil. \nGuides showed enthralled visitors to the Wartburg the spot behind the \nstove where the inkwell had hit the wall.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first evidence of a story involving an inkwell dates to the end \nof the sixteenth century. In that version, a former Wittenberg \nstudent claimed to have heard that while Luther was at the Wartburg, \nthe Devil, dressed as a monk, threw an inkwell at the reformer.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1650 the first book to refer to an inkspot on the wall appeared, \nand thereafter the story told how Luther threw the inkwell at the \nDevil. Gradually, an inkspot appeared on the walls of other buildings \nwhere Luther had lived, and the story became a widely-known legend.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough definitely a fabrication, this legend points to an important \ntruth about Luther. He was a deeply devout man of his age who \nbelieved strongly in the existence of the Devil. The Christian life \nwas a constant battle against the Devil, who was behind every evil \nact and disaster. Christians needed to pray every day, coached Luther \nin his Catechism, that God would forgive their sins and strengthen \ntheir faith so they could survive this struggle. The reformer spoke \nfrom experience; even though he trusted that God would finally defeat \nthe Devil, he was also subject to attacks of doubt and spiritual \ndespair. If Luther did once launch an inkwell at his most dreaded \nadversary, he would not have been acting out of character.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Scott A.

    "words": "LADY JANE GREY FACED AN EXECUTIONER'S AXE AT SEVENTEEN\u0014\n \u0014\nLady Jane Grey had the misfortune to be born with royal ties. She was \nthe granddaughter of Henry VIIIs sister Mary, making her the kings \ngrandneice and a first cousin once removed of his son King Edward VI. \nOn the strength of that tie, Janes parents and in-laws tried to make \nher queen of England, supplanting King Henrys daughters (Edwards \nhalf-sisters) Mary and Elizabeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJanes father, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, sided with the English \nchurch reformers, as did John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. \nScheming for power, Northumberland arranged to marry his son \nGuildford to Jane.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Edwards health declined, Northumberland and Suffolk felt uneasy \nat the prospect of a Roman Catholic successorMary. They seem to have \nbeen motivated less with concern for the Reformation than for their \nown power and influence. They manipulated Edwards religious \nsympathies to have him appoint Jane as his successor. Edward was \nwilling: he liked Jane, with whom he had played as a child, and knew \nshe was staunchly Protestant.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen her ambitious family announced to Jane that she was to be queen, \nshe wept uncontrollably, rejecting the idea. However, her parents and \nin-laws insisted. Later she would reproach her father that he, whose \nresponsibility it was to seek to prolong her life, had helped bring \nit to an untimely end.\u0014\n\u0014\nJane was proclaimed queen on July 10, 1553. Northumberland rode off \nto capture Mary but failed. The common people of England so detested \nhim that they rallied behind the Catholic heir.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so, just nine days after ascending the throne, Jane became a \nprisoner in the Tower of London. She wrote Mary a repentant letter, \nbut pointed out that she had been forced into her action, which was \nnot of her own seeking. Mary was lenient.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Janes father soon participated in another rebellion against \nMary. It sealed his daughters doom. She was condemned to death. \nMarys chaplain, John Feckenham, persuaded the queen to delay Janes \nexecution so that he would have a chance to convert her to \nCatholicism. But while Jane appreciated Feckenhams kindness toward \nher, she clung to her religious views. She had been well-tutored, \ncould read and write several languages fluently, and appreciated the \npositions of the reformers, some of whom she had met and corresponded \nwith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 12, 1554, Jane and her husband were executed. \nGuildford was beheaded publicly but, fearing to produce an angry mob, \nthe authorities beheaded pretty, seventeen-year-old Jane inside the \nTower.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeckenham accompanied her to the place of execution. There Jane \nthanked him for his kindness, insisted once more that she had been \ninnocent of any desire for the throne, recited Psalm 51 in English, \nand forgave her executioner, asking him not to strike the blow until \nher neck was on the block. After a blindfold was wrapped around her \neyes, she groped for the block, crying out, What shall I do? Where \nis it? Someone guided her to the spot. Her last words were, Lord, \ninto thy hands I commend my spirit. Then the executioner brought \ndown the axe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Lew Wallace, Author of Ben Hur\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   May 3, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February l5, l905, Lewis Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, \ndied. Lew left behind him a lifetime of political and military \naccomplishments. The world, however, remembers him chiefly as the \nauthor of the novel Ben Hur, which he subtitled, \"a tale of the \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLew Wallace was born in 1827, the son of an Indiana governor. As a \nyoung man he served in the United States' war with Mexico. After the \nwar, he studied law, set up a law practice, and served in the Indiana \nState Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he immediately re-enlisted and rose to \nthe rank of Major General. In 1864, he fought--and lost--the Battle \nof Monocacy, but he held his position long enough to allow union \ndefenders to reach Washington, D.C., preventing its capture by \nConfederate general Jubal Early. After the war, Lew served on the \ncourt martial that tried Lincoln's assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nLew was inspired to write novels after reading Prescott's Conquest of \nMexico. His first novel, The Fair God, was about those events. His \nsecond novel, Ben Hur, was conceived after sitting on a train, \nlistening spellbound for two hours, while the agnostic Colonel Robert \nIngersoll, poured out \"a medley of argument, eloquence, wit, satire, \naudacity, irreverence, poetry, brilliant antitheses, and pungent \nexcoriation of believers in God, Christ, and Heaven, the like of \nwhich I had never heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, Lew had been indifferent to the claims of religion \n(although he loved the story of the wise men and had begun a tale \nabout them). \"... Yet here was I now moved as never before, and by \nwhat? The most outright denials of all human knowledge of God, \nChrist, Heaven... Was the Colonel right? What had I on which to \nanswer yes or no? He had made me ashamed of my ignorance: and \nthen--here is the unexpected of the affair--as I walked on in the \ncool darkness, I was aroused for the first time in my life to the \nimportance of religion... I thought of the manuscript in my desk. Its \nclosing scene was the child Christ in the cave by Bethlehem: why not \ngo on with the story down to the crucifixion? That would make a book, \nand compel me to study everything of pertinency; after which, \npossibly, I would be possessed of opinions of real value.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It only remains to say that I did as resolved, with results--first, \nthe book Ben Hur, and second, a conviction amounting to absolute \nbelief in God and the Divinity of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile governor of New Mexico, Lew wrote his dramatic story. Though \nnever a member of a church, he became the best selling religious \nauthor of his day. Ben Hur sold 300,000 copies within ten years, and \nwas translated into dozens of languages, including Arabic and Chinese.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Ben Hur was published in 1880, Wallace began a \nfour-year term as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, where he cultivated very \ngood relations with the Sultan. The last years of his life Wallace \nspent as a public lecturer. Today his statue stands in the Capitol \nbuilding at Washington, representing the State of Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n1907.\u0014\nGeneral Lew Wallace Study and Museum. http://www.ben-hur.com/\u0014\nMorsberger, Robert E. and Morsberger, Katherine M.

The hospital let us leave early since we were \nintended home birthers, had zero complications, and we had an in-home \npediatrician scheduled to come see us. I remember we sat you down on \nour bed and we both just stared taking the smallness (which felt \nlike grandness) of you in. Is this where we should set you down? No. \nI scooped you up and placed you on my chest and there you stayedon \nmine or your dads chestfor two months.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe decided to create a nest for the three of us. We settled on our \nden and moved every soft blanket and pillow into that room. There we \nstayed for 8 weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the day time, wed open the windows and let the sun kiss your \nsoft skin. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the night time, wed cuddle close; the three of us drifting in \nand out of sleep whenever, however we chose.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour pediatrician would come in, walk over to you in her socks, \nspread you out on a blanket in our living room and smile: Everything \nis well! Then wed scoop you up again.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou had a witching hour from 7-8pm where you enjoyed using that \nmighty voice of yours. Your dad and I would pour a glass of wine for \neach other and take shifts of who walked around the house with you. \u0014\n\u0014\nShhh shhh\u0014\nYoure safe.\u0014\nMamas here. Daddys here. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne night, our midwife called to check on you and me and I said, \nHes lethargic; I was scared to death. But she said, Is he \nlethargic or is he content? You were so content. And I vowed from \nthat moment on to always try to think the GOOD thought first and to \nalways give things time before coming to a conclusion.\u0014\nWhen my milk came in, your daddy would feed me while I fed you. We \nbreastfed every time you wanted to and it was easy and joyful and a \nlot. You grew so fast. We danced every afternoon in the sun together. \nYou napped on daddys chest every day.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour newborn phase was dreamy and protected within our nest. Not a \nsecond was rushed or hurried or interrupted. Everything smelled of \nmilk and newborn and daddys delicious food coming from the kitchen.\u0014\nI didnt feel sleep deprived at all, and I was always excited to meet \nyou at midnight, 2am, 4am, 6am and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou were finally here with us but it also felt you had been with us \nall along.  with Stephen T Robertson.\u0014",

    "words": "Let There Be Peace Between Argentina and Chile\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nHow seldom in history have councils of peace prevailed. How seldom \nhas faith intervened in history to bring pacific solutions to \nnations. In the early 1900s that rarity occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nArgentina and Chile were rattling sabers. At stake was the boundary \nin the Andes between the two nations. The dispute was over whether \nthe line should be drawn at the watershed or at the highest point of \nthe range. War threatened in 1902.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people of the Andes are by and large Roman Catholics. Remembering \na November 1st, 1900 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII which called for \nconsecration of the entire world to Christ the Redeemer, Christians \nurged their respective governments to settle matters amicably. The \ngovernments of Argentina and Chile listened. They agreed to submit \nthe matter for arbitration. Arbitrating the Northern end of the line \nwas the United States ambassador. Arbitrating the Southern end was \nKing Edward VII of England. War was averted when both sides accepted \nthe results in 1903.\u0014\n\u0014\nHappy as was this outcome, it is not the end of the story. Monsignor \nMarcolino del Carmel Benavente, the Bishop of San Juan, suggested the \nerection of a statue to remind the people of Christ's words, \"And I, \nif I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\" The \nstatue would remind all that they should be consecrated to mutual \nunderstanding. Thus was born the concept of the Christ of the Andes.\u0014\n\u0014\nTourists traveling the Pan American highway can see the result: a 26 \nfoot tall bronze Christ holding out his right hand in blessing over \nthe disputant nations. His left hand clings to a cross. Under his \nfeet is the Western hemisphere. Located 13,000 feet up in Uspallata \nPass, Mount Aconcagua forms its backdrop, lofting 13,000 feet higher. \nThis is the highest readily accessible point on the boundary between \nthe two nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nSculptor Mateo Alonso modeled the work. Seora Angela de Oliveira \nCzar de Costa raised the financing. In a symbolic gesture, old \ncannons were melted down to make the casting.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statue was dedicated on this day, March 13, 1904. One of the \nplaques at its base reminds us \"He is our peace who hath made us \none.\" Another Spanish language plaque, dating from 1937, reads: \n\"Sooner shall these mountains crumble into dust than Argentines and \nChileans break the peace sworn at the feet of Christ the Redeemer.\" \nMore than a memorial of a single reconciliation, the statue \nrepresents a vow of eternal peace between Chile and Argentina. Its \nChrist speaks peace to an entire world. Such monuments are rare in \nthis tumultuous globe, where ploughshares are more often beaten into \nswords than swords into ploughshares.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBonsall, Elizabeth Hubbard.

    "words": "The Last Execution of an Anabaptist in Zurich\u0014\n23 Mar 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nFelix_Manz_drowning1Six executions in all took place in Zurich \nbetween 1527 and 1532. Manz was the first victim. He was bound, \ncarried to a boat, and thrown into the river Limmat near the lake, \nJan. 5, 1527. He praised God that he was about to die for the truth, \nand prayed with a loud voice, Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my \nspirit!  Bullinger describes his heroic death. Grebel had escaped \nthe same fate by previous death in 1526.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last executions took place March 23, 1532, when Heinrich Karpfis \nand Hans Herzog were drowned. The foreigners were punished by exile, \nand met death in Roman Catholic countries. Blaurock was scourged, \nexpelled, and burnt, 1529, at Clausen in the Tyrol. Haetzer, who fell \ninto carnal sins, was beheaded for adultery and bigamy at Constance, \nFeb. 24, 1529.  John Zwick, a Zwinglian, says that a nobler and more \nmanful death was never seen in Constance.  Thomas Blaurer bears a \nsimilar testimony.\u0014\n\u0014\nHuebmaier, who had fled from Waldshut to Zurich, December, 1525, was \ntried before the magistracy, recanted, and was sent out of the \ncountry to recant his recantation. He labored successfully in \nMoravia, and was burnt at the stake in Vienna, March 10, 1528. Three \ndays afterwards his faithful wife, whom he had married in Waldshut, \nwas drowned in the Danube.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther Swiss cantons took the same measures against the Anabaptists as \nZurich. In Zug, Lorenz Fuerst was drowned, Aug. 17, 1529. In \nAppenzell, Uliman and others were beheaded, and some women drowned. \nAt Basle, Oecolampadius held several disputations with the \nAnabaptists, but without effect; whereupon the Council banished them, \nwith the threat that they should be drowned if they returned (Nov. \n13, 1530). The Council of Berne adopted the same course.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Germany and in Austria the Anabaptists fared still worse. The Diet \nof Speier, in April, 1529, decreed that every Anabaptist and \nrebaptized person of either sex be put to death by sword, or fire, or \notherwise. The decree was severely carried out, except in Strassburg \nand the domain of Philip of Hesse, where the heretics were treated \nmore leniently.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most blood was shed in Roman Catholic countries. In Goerz the \nhouse in which the Anabaptists were assembled for worship was set on \nfire. In Tyrol and Goerz, says Cornelius, the number of executions \nin the year 1531 reached already one thousand; in Ensisheim, six \nhundred. At Linz seventy-three were killed in six weeks. Duke William \nof Bavaria, surpassing all others, issued the fearful decree to \nbehead those who recanted, to burn those who refused to recant. \nThroughout the greater part of Upper Germany the persecution raged \nlike a wild chase. The blood of these poor people flowed like water \nso that they cried to the Lord for help. But hundreds of them of all \nages and both sexes suffered the pangs of torture without a murmur, \ndespised to buy their lives by recantation, and went to the place of \nexecution joyfully and singing psalms.*\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nBorn in Bakersfield, California, in 1896, at the end of the \"wild \nwest\" era, he was only six when his father, who was a Kern County \ndeputy sheriff, was killed by bandits. He graduated from Manual Arts \nHigh School in 1915 and married his wife Grace Mackay Smith the \nfollowing year.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wanted to be a singer but was having a difficult time of it. He \nworked hard trying to further his musical career but couldn't make a \nliving at it. Occasionally he would pick up a few dollars singing at \nweddings and funerals. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile the bills kept[illinig p. Rents were high in the city, and \nhe was forced to move to a shack in the country, smack in the middle \nof a vineyard. Even thought the rent was only $12.50 a month, he fell \nmonths behind. He was forced to spend long hours pickingi grade to \ntry to pay the back rent. Often grapes were the only thing he had to \neat.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter months of this hand-to-mouth existence, he was so discouraged \nthat he told his wife he was going to give up singing. He wouldl take \na job as an automobile salesman.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was at this point that a few words of praise changed his life. It \ncame from an enexpected source, a man he didn't even know, Rupert \nHughes, then a famous writer. Hughes happened to heaa the young man \nsing and told him he had the makings of a fine voice. What he \nrequired was study in New York.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was all the boy needed, He borrowed money, went East, and \neventually became famous. His name was Lawrence Tibbett, one of the \ngreat voices of the Metropolitan Opera, \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter training with, among others, Metropolitan Opera bass (and later \nfilm actor) Basil Ruysdael, he joined the Met, adding another \"t\" to \nhis name in his initial contract. He was also a highly-regarded \nrecitalist and appeared successfully on radio. His recordings for \nVictor sold in the millions. In 1936, along with violinist Jascha \nHeifetz, he founded the American Guild of Musical Artists, serving \nfor 17 years as its active president.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, beginning in around 1940, the stress of taking on too \nmany heavy roles too early brought on a vocal crisis which only \nworsened in the next decade. This vocal crisis also triggered a \ndrinking problem (some have said vice versa) which also got \nprogressively worse with time. Perhaps wisely, Tibbett left the Met \nat the end of the 1949-50 season.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 1950s saw him appearing on stage in both musical and dramatic \nroles, most notably succeeding former Met colleague Ezio Pinza in the \nBroadway musical hit \"Fanny,\" as well as hosting \"Golden Voices\" on \nNBC radio. But heavy drinking, which also brought on a \nwell-publicized traffic arrest, left his once good looks bloated and \npuffy. An increasingly unhappy life ended in early 1960 when he \ntripped on a Persian runner in his home, badly gashing his head on \nthe corner of his TV set and driving bone fragments into his brain. \nHe died on July 17 at the age of 64. Tibbett's unhappy end is best \nforgotten. His contributions to the world of music will live forever.\u0014\n\u0014\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Jerome Kleinsasser\u0014",

    "title": "LEAVING CHURCH WITHOUT FIGHT-THE SECULAR IS HERE TO STAY",
    "words": "APRIL 11, 2022    AUTHOR: RODNEY KENNEDY, WORD&WAY\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaving Church Without a Fight\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy so many people have deserted their churches puzzles, befuddles, \nand distresses me. I try not to feel personally responsible, but I \ncant help myself. Is it our fault we preachers who fall so short of \nmeeting the expectations? Are the sermons driving people from the \nbuilding? Will Campbell once mused, Who in the hell listens to a \npulpit sermon anymore? I dont know, but I have theories about why \npeople are leaving.\u0014\n\u0014\nLifeway Research suggests people got out of the habit, they quit \nafter high school, they dont like the institutional church, they \nwere hurt by the church, their needs were not met by the church, they \nleft when the pastor left, or they moved and never found another \nchurch. I am not doubting that these are reasons, but I think they \nare surface reasons that fail to address the underlying systemic \nchanges taking place in how people think about God and the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivision is certainly causing people to abandon Christian churches. \nLast year, Barna found that the share of practicing Christians has \ndropped nearly in half since 2000. Gallup recently reported that U.S. \nchurch membership fell below 50% for the first time in eight decades. \nAmericans continue leaving church, most arent coming back.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne theory is that people have simply changed their membership. They \nhave moved from being part of a local church and joined the local \npub. I have traveled around the USA doing workshops, and after a \nworkshop, somewhere between 9:45 and 10:30 I was always hungry. I \nwould go to an Outback or a Texas Roadhouse or a Chinese restaurant. \nI would sit at the bar because I was alone and didnt want to sit out \nwith all the couples and families. Whether I was in North Platte, \nNebraska, Appleton, Wisconsin, or Staten Island, the people at the \nbar always knew each other. It took me a number of times to realize \nthat the bar at the Outback had become church for people. People \nhavent really left church, they have simply changed the definition \nof church and found more comfortable places to hang out. They get the \nwarm fuzzy feelings of church without all the hassle, and they get to \ndrink.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother theory that I cherish revolves around expectations. People \nhave certain expectations of a church. They think that a church is \nanother social organization where they can have friends, food, and \nfellowship. Theres nothing wrong with that and people can certainly \nmake friends, eat good food, and have fellowship, but that is not the \nchurch. People expect the church to make them feel good, not hurt \ntheir feelings, and pay attention to them. Theres nothing wrong with \nthese desires, but that is not the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople expect the church to give them strength, moral support, and to \npay attention to their needs. And theres nothing wrong with that, \nbut that is not the church. People expect the church to affirm that \nwhat they already believe is pretty much what everyone else believes, \nand there we have a problem, because the church doesnt exist to \nconfirm human assumptions. People expect the church to give them a \nin with God and help them squeeze through the tight spots in life, \nand theres nothing wrong with those feelings. But all that is not \nthe church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church is the alternative politics of a new age, started by \nJesus, that gives us a new way of relating to everyone and \neverything. It is the community of resurrection that defies the \ncommunity of fear and death. The church has to always be ready to \nextend hospitality to the stranger.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch is not the good feeling place  its the place where people \nwork through conflict under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and \nforgive one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch is not the place where we always get what we want, but we do \nget what we need.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch is not the place where we get affirmation that all our beliefs \nare right, but where our beliefs, assumptions, ideas, and opinions \nare challenged.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch is not the place where all our expectations are met, but where \nwe are reminded that we are not our own and we have been bought with \na price and we belong to Jesus Christ, and we are to be the suffering \nloving sacrificing servants to a need-flooded world.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch is not a theatre where you get to assess whether you like the \npreacher, but a body that sits before the word of God to instruct us \nto do the things that we do not want to do  that, as John Howard \nYoder wrote, make us faithful Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople are leaving institutions called church, but they are more \noften social institutions that lack the courage to be church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only other theory that has crossed my mind is that for some \npeople church is just too hard. For example, Gods salvation is so \nfleshly, so material, so bodily, that Paul insists that the church is \nthe body of Christ. Thus, we worship God in one anothers presence. \nOf course, being a physical, fleshly body, means that leaving church \nis a surgery, a surgery with no anesthesia, that is a tearing apart, \na ripping away, one member of the body. Nothing is more scandalous \nthan such an act. It is not only murder, it is suicide. Perhaps we \nhave lost what it means to be a body in our secular society. Perhaps \npeople attempt to slip away as if there is no pain from the \ndisembodying of a member of the body.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe it really is about the lack of time. After all, time is a \ntyrant in our midst. We never have enough time we say all the time. \nSomebody is always asking you to do something you dont have time to \ndo. The novelist Susan Ketchin once wrote, All the churches Ive \nbeen a member of want too much of me. They want too much of what \nseems to be entirely superficial and superficially exhausting. The \nmoment I go to church, it seems the first thing they say is, Will \nyou give a poetry reading next Wednesday night? Will you coach the \nsoccer team? And you think, I just wanted to have a religious \nexperience. Carl Jung says that wonderful thing: Organized religion \nis an excuse for not having a religious experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people want to have a deeply moving religious experience removed \nfrom all the bother of ordinary, material, physical, human work, and \ndetail. I understand it, but what they are asking for is a form of \nGnosticism  an experience of being spiritual without being \nreligious. Now, plenty of churches have gladly embraced the spirit of \nthe old Gnostics and they are giving people all the spiritual \nexperience that can handle  feel good, have fun, shout, dance, sing \nsongs, whoop it up, and come back when you can.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all these reasons that can sound like excuses in the full light \nof day, there is one overriding epistemic consideration. Charles \nTaylor, in A Secular Age, gives us the most accurate picture of why \npeople are leaving the church. Taylors work provides a magisterial \nnarrative of many of the epistemic and philosophical reasons that our \nculture is on the cusp of establishing an uncontested hegemony of the \nsecular  a world in which all that the church stands for is \ndismissed as weakness, immaturity, lack of courage, being out of \ntouch with the self-evident truths of our material age. Taylor \nconvinced me that a lot of church people are leaving church without a \nfight. They are simply caught up in the currents of a secular age and \nhave been swept away without a whimper of protest.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor says that we have become a secular age and he defines that as \nan age in which belief in God is no longer the default setting, but \nonly one of multiple options  and often not seen as the best option. \nThe secular covers everything like fog on a coffin in a cedar-lined \ncemetery in a Louisiana bayou. We all inhabit this secular age where \nthe devoted are tempted to desert and the agnostic is haunted by the \npossibility of God. The churchs hope is that the haunting presence \nof God, the shadowy figure slipping through the trees like Jesus in \nFlannery OConnors gothic novel, First Blood, still leads the lost \nones to say, I dont believe in God, but I miss him.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we should be more attentive to the beauty of creation. One of \nthe reasons Christianity may be true is because it is beautiful. The \nChristian religion didnt last so long merely because everyone \nbelieved it, English writer Julian Barnes said. It lasted because \nit makes for a helluva novel. Just as Tolkien insisted, the gospel \nis true because it is the most fantastic fantasy, the greatest fairy \ntale ever told. Much of the art and music we enjoy we owe to the \nexistence of Christianity. As philosopher James K. A. Smith put it, \nWithout the madness of the Gospel, Mozart would have never composed \na requiem.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no going back. The secular is here to stay on the throne of \nthis world. Commitment and fervor cannot undo the shift in epistemic \ndecisions about God that characterize our age. Theres no undoing the \nsecular, theres just the task of learning how not to give in to its \npressures by simply leaving the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nOurs is a secular age not because of any lack of religious \nparticipation or because people are leaving church, but because \nmeaning has changed and everything is contested. There is a \npossibility here for a radical church to join the contest and engage \nin the war of metaphors, the struggle over symbols, and the chance \nfor a religious renewal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church may be on the ropes, but we are not finished. As Pauls \nsecond letter to the Corinthians tells us, This priceless treasure \nwe hold, so to speak, in a common earthenware jarto show that the \nsplendid power of it belongs to God and not to us. We are handicapped \non all sides, but we are never frustrated; we are puzzled, but never \nin despair. We are persecuted, but we never have to stand it alone: \nwe may be knocked down but we are never knocked out!\u0014\n\u0014\nWe step into the storm of secularism to sing, to scream, to fight.\u0014",

    "words": "LIBERIUSS MOMENT OF WEAKNESS TROUBLED THE CHURCH\u0014\n \u0014\nAnathema to thee, Liberius! wrote Hilary of Poitiers (died c. 367). \nLiberius, Bishop of Rome (i.e. pope), had complied with a softened \nArian formula and had joined in condemning Athanasius, the chief \nspokesman of orthodox Christianity. This sent shock waves through the \nchurch. Besides Hilary, other leaders of the period mentioned this \nlapse by Liberius. Among them were Athanasius (died 373), bishop of \nAlexandria; Bible translator and theologian Jerome (c. 347420); and \nSozomen (died c. 450), a church historian of the following century. \u0014\n\u0014\nLiberius had become bishop of Rome on this day, 22 May 352. Debates \nover the nature of Christ troubled the era. The Arians considered \nChrist less than fully God. Emperor Constantius (317361) embraced \ntheir views and persecuted Orthodox leaders. When Liberius stood \nagainst Arianism, the emperor threatened him. The Roman people \nsupported their bishop. Fearing trouble, the emperors allies \nsurrounded the city with troops under cover of darkness. They seized \nthe bishop in the middle of the night, spiriting him out of the \nsleeping city.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe emperor banished Liberius to Thrace (a region in the southern \nBalkans). Liberius refused money from the emperor, the empress, and a \nhigh officialmoney that would have eased his travel and exile. To \nthe emperors messengers he replied, Go and tell him who sent me \nthis gold to give it to his flatterers and players, who are always in \nwant because of their insatiable cupidity, ever desiring riches and \nnever satisfied. As for us, Christ, Who is in all things like unto \nthe Father, supports us, and gives us all things needful. His \nmessages to the other two were similar in tone. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, the emperors Roman allies consecrated archdeacon Felix as \nbishop in Liberiuss stead. By this, Felix and his supporters \nperjured themselves, because they had sworn to stand by Liberius. \nFelixs consecration took place in a secular building because the \nmood of Rome made it dangerous to hold the ceremony in a basilica. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years later, Constantius visited Rome. Leading women petitioned \nfor their bishop back. Constantius agreed. But Liberius first had to \ncondemn Athanasius and accept an Arian creed. The once-staunch bishop \nyielded to bodily threats. Athanasius wrote, Moreover Liberius, \nhaving been banished, after two years gave way, and under fear of \nthreatened death subscribed. But even this proves only [the Arians] \nviolence, and his hatred of heresy; for he supported me as long as he \nhad free choice.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless his temporary weakness troubled the church. This \napostasy of Liberius sufficed, through the whole of the middle ages, \nfor a proof that Popes could fall into heresy as well as other \npeople, wrote Janus (a nineteenth-century opponent of papal \ninfallibility). Back in Rome, Liberius returned to orthodoxy. And \nalthough Constantius ordered Felix and Liberius to share power, Roman \nmobs would have none of it. One God, One Christ, One Bishop, they \nchanted. They drove Felix and his followers from the city with \nbloodshed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrouble continued after Liberiuss death (366). A majority of the \npeople and clergy of Rome chose Damasus, a sixty-year-old deacon, to \nbe their next bishop. Three bishops, including the Bishop of Ostia, \nconsecrated him in the traditional way. He was completely legitimate. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Damasus had been a follower of the antipope Felix. His \nelection did not sit well with a Roman minority. They chose Ursinus \nin Liberiuss place and battled Damasuss followers. This led to \nfatalities. After the bloodiest of the battles, a three-day affair, \none-hundred-and-thirty-seven followers of Ursinus lay dead on a \nbasilica floor. Damasus, the victor, proved sound in his opposition \nto Arianism.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "LONELINESS IS ON THE RISE IN THE U.S.",
    "words": "One in Three Older Americans Is Lonely. \u0014\nBy JAMIE DUCHARME  September 24, 2018\u0014\n \u0014\nLoneliness is on the rise in the U.S., and no one is immune. Research \npublished earlier this year found that people 18 to 22 years old were \nmore likely than any other U.S. population to be lonely. But new data \nsuggests that older adults are also lonely in high numbers.\u0014\nMore than a third of adults over 45 are lonely, according to a new \nreport from the AARP Foundation. While that percentage (35%) remains \nunchanged from a 2010 version of the survey, the over-45 population \nhas increased substantially during those eight years  meaning about \n5 million more adults, almost 48 million in total, can now be \nconsidered lonely.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the new research, more than 3,000 adults answered questions on the \nUCLA Loneliness Scale, a 20-item survey designed to measure social \nconnection and loneliness. They also answered questions about their \nhealth, lifestyles, socioeconomic profiles, social networks and more.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report found that people who were physically isolated and who had \nsmall social networks were most likely to be lonely. Meanwhile, those \nwho reported large and diverse social groups; frequent contact with \nfriends, neighbors and family members; involvement in community and \nreligious groups; marriage; and regular sexual activity were less \nlikely to be lonely.\u0014\n\u0014\nGood mental and physical health were also associated with lower \nlevels of loneliness  which isnt surprising, since loneliness and \nsocial isolation are linked to a range of health issues, including \nsubstance use and heart problems. Adults with higher levels of \neducation and income, two factors consistently linked to better \nhealth, were also less likely to be lonely, the report found.\u0014\nConsistent with past research, the report also found that loneliness \nlevels decreased with age. Forty-six percent of adults ages 45 to 49 \nwere classified as lonely, compared to just 24% of those older than \n70. This trend could reflect the well-established dip in happiness \nthat tends to occur around middle-age, followed by better quality of \nlife in the later years, the report says. Its also possible that, \nbecause loneliness is associated with a number of health problems, \npeople who report high levels of loneliness are less likely to live \ninto older age.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey points to the importance of maintaining meaningful \nrelationships  and suggests that when it comes to social contacts, \nmore is better. Those who qualified as lonely tended to have fewer \npeople with whom they said they could discuss matters of personal \nimportance or turn to for support. And there seems to be something \nspecial about seeing people in person: Despite the fact that older \nadults use of social media increased substantially between 2010 and \n2018, the habit didnt seem to make a dent in loneliness rates, the \nreport says. In fact, frequently interacting with acquaintances on \nsocial media seemed to modestly increase a persons likelihood of \nbeing lonely.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey also suggests that loneliness isnt caused by one single \nevent, which means that even individuals who have suffered setbacks \nlike the death of a spouse can improve their social health. They may \nbe able to do so by taking cues from individuals who were not \nconsidered chronically lonely; these people often dealt with fleeting \nfeelings of loneliness by talking to or going out with a loved one, \nthe report found.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, contacting loved ones is easier for people who already \nhave robust social networks in place. But the finding still suggests \nthat reaching out to others is a healthy habit worth emulating.\u0014",

    "title": "LONLINESS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY",
    "words": "Loneliness Is a Public Health Emergency. \u0014\nBY TARA LAW     JUNE 1, 2022  TIME\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the pandemic first began, many experts feared that even people \nwho managed to avoid the virus would suffer from unprecedented levels \nof loneliness. What would happen when millions of people were told to \nstay at home and distance themselves from friends and loved ones?\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years of research later, experts have found that the pandemic did \nmake Americans slightly more lonelybut loneliness levels were \nalready dire enough to pose a threat to mental and physical health. \nHeres what you need to know about loneliness and how to address it \nin your own life.\u0014\nWho got lonelier during the pandemic?\u0014\n\u0014\nAcross the U.S. and European populations, the differences in \nloneliness before and after the pandemic are small. One meta-analysis \npublished this year by the American Psychological Association \nanalyzed 34 studies conducted before and during the pandemic that \nwere focused on loneliness, an emotional state distinct from anxiety \nor depression that signals when social needs arent being met. \nResearchers found about a 5% increase in loneliness during the \npandemic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe increases are so tiny, and they actually dont mean anything \nclinically at all, says Pamela Qualter, a professor at the \nUniversity of Manchester in the U.K. who studies loneliness (but who \nwas not involved in the research). Given that we were all at home \nfor big lengths of time, I think it showed how people are really \nresilient. They worked out ways to manage that loneliness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even if the pandemic-era increases are small, loneliness is still \na major issue. One Harvard survey conducted during the pandemic found \nthat 36% of Americanswhich includes 61% of young adults ages \n18-25feel lonely frequently or almost all the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther research during the pandemic found significant increases in \nloneliness among groups already at higher risk for it, including \nlow-income people and those with mental health conditions. Young \npeople, who tend to be lonelier than those in middle age, also became \nmore lonely.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are likely multiple reasons why young people seem to suffer \nfrom a lack of social connection, says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, \nprofessor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University \nand a longtime loneliness researcher (who was not involved in the \nstudy). Older people may have developed better coping skills over \ntheir lifetimes to deal with stressful periods, she says. Young \npeople may also feel pressure to have expanding social circlesa hard \nbar to clear during a pandemicand some may struggle if they feel \nlike their relationships fall short. That could be part of the reason \nsocial media may make people more lonely, she says. If you see \neverybody else looking much more social than you are, you may be less \nsatisfied with your own social circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn emerging public-health priority\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no real silver lining to the pandemic, but many mental-health \nprofessionals point to one upside: more people are feeling \ncomfortable talking about mental health and the role that loneliness \ncan play in mental-health disorders. The topic has come to the fore \nof both conversation and research.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers who study loneliness say that it hasnt always received \nthe kind of attention it deserves as a major threat to health. \nPrimary care doctors and even therapists dont regularly screen their \npatients for signs of loneliness. However, that was starting to \nchange even before the pandemic, especially in richer parts of the \nworld. For instance, the U.K. appointed its first Minister of \nLoneliness in 2018.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the pandemic accelerated these efforts. Japan followed the U.K.s \nlead by also appointing its own inaugural Minister of Loneliness in \n2021; the European Commissions Joint Research Center launched new \nresearch efforts during the pandemic into studying loneliness in the \nE.U.; and public health leaders, including U.S. Surgeon General Dr. \nVivek Murthy, have repeatedly raised loneliness as a public-health \nissue during the pandemic.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost consequentially, the World Health Organization (WHO) also \nfinally started paying attention to loneliness during the pandemic. \nWHO is considering creating a high-level commission to address social \nconnection, isolation, and loneliness, says Christopher Mikton, a \ntechnical officer in WHOs department of social determinants of \nhealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal is to persuade lawmakers in countries around the world to \nexpand data gathering on loneliness and fund research to enable \nscientists to understand it better and find ways to address itand \nalso to hasten the uptake and development of solutions, such as \ncognitive behavioral therapy and peer support.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite a growing body of evidence of the importance of loneliness, \nwe havent done very much, and weve now decided to really step up \nour activities in this area, says Mikton. This isnt the kind of \nsoft issue that can be brushed aside. The health impact is serious.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow loneliness affects health\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly a third of Americans reported feeling lonely at least some of \nthe time, according to an Ipsos survey released in Feb. 2021. But \njust because loneliness is common doesnt mean its not dangerous. \nWhen loneliness persists, affecting someone for weeks or even years, \nit poses a serious threat to peoples mental and physical health. I \nthink most people recognize that it impacts our emotional well-being, \nand maybe even our mental health, but very few people recognize the \nprofound effects that it has on our neurobiology, which influences \nour long-term health, says Holt-Lunstad.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearch has found loneliness can significantly increase the risk of \nearly death. In part, thats because its linked to a striking number \nof disorders, including cognitive disorders like Alzheimers and \nother types of dementia, and mental health disorders like depression, \nanxiety, and schizophrenia. Loneliness has also been linked to \ncardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and other \nchronic illnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat can help with loneliness?\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no one-size-fits-all solution, says Michelle Lim, the \nscientific chair of Ending Loneliness Together, a network of \nAustralian organizations, who also researches loneliness at Swinburne \nUniversity. Instead, its important to find solutions that suit \nindividuals. For instance, she says, while some people might think it \nmakes sense to join a social group, that might not appeal to someone \nwho is introverted or dealing with social anxiety.\u0014\nThe key to beating loneliness, she says, is not just increasing the \nnumber of people a person sees, but making more fulfilling social \nconnections, including by seeking out relationships with others who \nare really your people, says Lim. She often encourages her young \npatients to set a goal of improving just one relationshipwhether \nits their sibling, parent, or only friend from school. Its about \nbuilding the bond between you and that person, says Lim. Reducing \nloneliness is not just having people around you, but [having] a \nmeaningful relationship with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts also important to remember that loneliness is part of being \nhuman, a biological drivethat motivates us to reconnect socially, \nand not something to be ashamed about, says Holt-Lunstad. In the \nshort term, she suggests getting busy to distract yourself and enrich \nyour lifelike getting out in nature, taking up a creative hobby, or \nmeditating. She also emphasizes nurturing existing relationships, \nincluding with people you might overlook. In a study she conducted \nduring the pandemic, Holt-Lunstad found that people became less \nlonely after doing small acts of kindness for their neighbor, such as \nwalking their dog or taking out their trash.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor someone who might be feeling lonely, they dont need to wait for \nsomeone else to contact them or do nice things for them they can \ntake the initiative, says Holt-Lunstad. One of the ways that we can \nhelp ourselves is to help others.\u0014",

    "title": "LIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK - MENTAL ILLNESS",
    "words": "Light When All Is Dark\u0014\nOur theology makes all the difference in fighting depression.\u0014\nKathryn Greene-McCreight | posted 3/04/2009 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLord Jesus Christ, you are for me medicine when I am sick;\u0014\nyou are my strength when I need help;\u0014\nyou are life itself when I fear death;\u0014\nyou are the way when I long for heaven;\u0014\nyou are light when all is dark;\u0014\nyou are my food when I need nourishment.\u0014\nAmbrose of Milan (340-397)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his Problem of Pain, C. S. Lewis says that suffering is uniquely \ndifficult for the Christian, for the one who believes in a good God. \nIf there were no good God to factor into the equation, suffering \nwould still be painful, but ultimately meaningless, because random. \nFor the Christian, who believes in the crucified and risen Messiah, \nsuffering is always meaningful. It is meaningful because of the one \nin whose suffering we participate, Jesus. This is neither to say, of \ncourse, that suffering will be pleasant, nor that it should be \nsought. Rather, in the personal suffering of the Christian, one finds \na correlate in Christ's suffering, which gathers up our tears and \ncalms our sorrows and points us toward his resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of a major mental illness, we are often unable to sense \nthe presence of God at all. Sometimes all we can feel is the complete \nabsence of God, utter abandonment by God, the sheer ridiculousness of \nthe very notion of a loving and merciful God. This cuts to the very \nheart of the Christian and challenges everything we believe about the \nworld and ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have a chronic mental illness, a brain disorder that used to be \ncalled manic depression, but now is less offensively called bipolar \ndisorder. I have sought help from psychiatrists, social workers, and \nmental health professionals; one is a Christian, but most of my \nhelpers are not. I have been in active therapy with a succession of \ntherapists over many years, and have been prescribed many psychiatric \nmedications, most of which brought quite unpleasant side effects, and \nonly a few of which relieved my symptoms. I have been hospitalized \nduring the worst times and given electroconvulsive therapy \ntreatments. All of this has helped, I must say, despite my \ndisinclination toward medicine and hospitals. They have helped me to \nrebuild some of \"myself,\" so that I can continue to be the kind of \nmother, priest, and writer I believe God wants me to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring these bouts of illness, I would often ask myself: How could I, \nas a faithful Christian, be undergoing such torture of the soul? And \nhow could I say that such torture has nothing to do with God? This \nis, of course, the assumption of the psychiatric guild in general, \nwhere faith in God is often viewed at best as a crutch, and at worst \nas a symptom of disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow could I, as a Christian, indeed as a theologian of the church, \nunderstand anything in my life as though it were separate from God? \nThis is clearly impossible. And yet how could I confess my faith in \nthat God who was \"an ever-present help in trouble\" (Ps. 46:1) when I \nfelt entirely abandoned by that God? And if this torture did have \nsomething to do with God, was it punishment, wrath, or chastisement? \nWas I, to use a phrase of Jonathan Edwards's, simply a \"sinner in the \nhands of an angry God\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nI started my journey into the world of mental illness with a \npostpartum depression after the birth of our second child. News \noutlets are rife with stories of women who destroy their own children \nsoon after giving birth. It is absolutely tragic. Usually every \ninstinct in the mother pushes toward preserving the life of the \ninfant. Most mothers would give their own lives to protect their \nbabies. But in postpartum depression, reality is so bent that that \ninstinct is blocked. Women who would otherwise be loving mothers have \ntheir confidence shaken by painful thoughts and feelings.\u0014\n\u0014\nDepression is not just sadness or sorrow. Depression is not just \nnegative thinking. Depression is not just being \"down.\" It's walking \nbarefoot on broken glass; the weight of one's body grinds the glass \nin further with every movement. So, the weight of my very existence \ngrinds the shards of grief deeper into my soul. When I am depressed, \nevery thought, every breath, every conscious moment hurts. And often \nthe opposite is the case when I am hypomanic: I am scintillating both \nto myself, and, in my imagination, to the whole world. But mania is \nmore than speeding mentally, more than euphoria, more than creative \ngenius at work. Sometimes, when it tips into full-blown psychosis, it \ncan be terrifying. The sick individual cannot simply shrug it off or \npull out of it: there is no pulling oneself \"up by the bootstraps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet the Christian faith has a word of real hope, especially for \nthose who suffer mentally. Hope is found in the risen Christ. \nSuffering is not eliminated by his resurrection, but transformed by \nit. Christ's resurrection kills even the power of death, and promises \nthat God will wipe away every tear on that final day. But we still \nhave tears in the present. We still die. In God's future, however, \ndeath itself will die. The tree from which Adam and Eve took the \nfruit of their sin and death becomes the cross that gives us life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hope of the Resurrection is not just optimism, but keeps the \nChristian facing ever toward the future, not merely dwelling in the \npresent. But the Christian hope is not only for the individual \nChristian, nor for the church itself, but for all of Creation, bound \nin decay by that first sin: \"Cursed is the ground because of you  It \nwill produce thorns and thistles for you \" (Gen. 3:17-18). This \ncurse of the very ground and its increase will be turned around at \nthe Resurrection. All Creation will be redeemed from pain and woe. In \nmy bouts with mental illness, this understanding of Christian hope \ngives comfort and encouragement, even if no relief from symptoms. \nSorrowing and sighing will be no more. Tears will be wiped away. Even \nfractious brains will be restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nBring us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate \nof heaven, to enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where \nthere shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light; no \nnoise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor hopes, but one \nequal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in \nthe habitations of your glory and dominion, world without end.

    "words": "LADY JANE GREY FACED AN EXECUTIONER'S AXE AT SEVENTEEN\u0014\n \u0014\nLADY JANE GREY had the misfortune to be born with royal ties. She was \nthe granddaughter of Henry VIIIs sister Mary, making her the kings \ngrandniece and a first cousin once removed of his son King Edward VI. \nOn the strength of that tie, Janes parents and in-laws tried to make \nher queen of England, supplanting King Henrys daughters (Edwards \nhalf-sisters) Mary and Elizabeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJanes father, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, sided with the English \nchurch reformers, as did John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. \nScheming for power, Northumberland arranged to marry his son \nGuildford to Jane.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Edwards health declined, Northumberland and Suffolk felt uneasy \nat the prospect of a Roman Catholic successorMary. They seem to have \nbeen motivated less with concern for the Reformation than for their \nown power and influence. They manipulated Edwards religious \nsympathies to have him appoint Jane as his successor. Edward was \nwilling: he liked Jane, with whom he had played as a child, and knew \nshe was staunchly Protestant.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen her ambitious family announced to Jane that she was to be queen, \nshe wept uncontrollably, rejecting the idea. However, her parents and \nin-laws insisted. Later she would reproach her father that he, whose \nresponsibility it was to seek to prolong her life, had helped bring \nit to an untimely end.\u0014\n\u0014\nJane was proclaimed queen on July 10, 1553. Northumberland rode off \nto capture Mary but failed. The common people of England so detested \nhim that they rallied behind the Catholic heir.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so, just nine days after ascending the throne, Jane became a \nprisoner in the Tower of London. She wrote Mary a repentant letter, \nbut pointed out that she had been forced into her action, which was \nnot of her own seeking. Mary was lenient.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Janes father soon participated in another rebellion against \nMary. It sealed his daughters doom. She was condemned to death. \nMarys chaplain, John Feckenham, persuaded the queen to delay Janes \nexecution so that he would have a chance to convert her to \nCatholicism. But while Jane appreciated Feckenhams kindness toward \nher, she clung to her religious views. She had been well-tutored, \ncould read and write several languages fluently, and appreciated the \npositions of the reformers, some of whom she had met and corresponded \nwith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 12, 1554, Jane and her husband were executed. \nGuildford was beheaded publicly but, fearing to produce an angry mob, \nthe authorities beheaded pretty, seventeen-year-old Jane inside the \nTower.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeckenham accompanied her to the place of execution. There Jane \nthanked him for his kindness, insisted once more that she had been \ninnocent of any desire for the throne, recited Psalm 51 in English, \nand forgave her executioner, asking him not to strike the blow until \nher neck was on the block. After a blindfold was wrapped around her \neyes, she groped for the block, crying out, What shall I do? Where \nis it? Someone guided her to the spot. Her last words were, Lord, \ninto thy hands I commend my spirit. Then the executioner brought \ndown the axe.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "LINCOLN NEVER SAID IT",
    "words": "\"If I could use my pen as you can, I would write something that would \nmake this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is,\" \nHarriet Beecher Stowe's sister wrote her. Harriet vowed to write \nsomething. The result was Uncle Tom's Cabin. An international \nbestseller, it was adored by abolitionists but vilified by the South. \nIt so enflamed popular opinion that when she met Abraham Lincoln \nduring the war between the states he said, \"So this is the little \nlady who made this big war!\" (See below: this did not happen. It \nbecame a popular oral tradition.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was born in Litchfield, Connecticut on June 14, 1811, the \nsixth child of Lyman Beecher, an ardent Calvinist and Puritan. \"Wisht \nit had been a boy,\" remarked Lyman. Although he doted on his \ndaughters, he desired sons who could become preachers and \nsoul-winners. The fifth Beecher child had also been named Harriet, \nbut had died of whooping cough a few weeks after birth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the start of the Civil War, Harrut Beecher Stowe traveled to \nthe capital, Washington, D.C., where she met President Abraham \nLincoln on November 25, 1862. Stowe's daughter, Hattie, reported, \"It \nwas a very droll time that we had at the White house I assure you ... \nI will only say now that it was all very funny  and we were ready to \nexplode with laughter all the while.\" What Lincoln said is a minor \nmystery. Her son later reported that Lincoln greeted her by saying, \n\"so you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this \ngreat war\", but this story has been found to be apocryphal. Her own \naccounts are vague, including the letter reporting the meeting to her \nhusband: \"I had a real funny interview with the President.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n--Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet was always in financial difficulty. Neither she nor Calvin, \nher husband, understood money management. After her literary success, \nthey built an expensive house which turned into a money pit. Bad \ninvestments gobbled up thousands more dollars. The Stowes also \nsuffered in other ways. Calvin was a hypochondriac. A rapid \nsuccession of children left Harriet weak. One son predeceased the \nparents. Another became an alcoholic and disappeared from sight. \nHarriet also was loudly berated for her defense of Lady Byron. Her \nlast ten years she lived in a never-never world, no longer fixed to \nreality.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life she was \nsuffering from Alzheimer's disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in Hartford, Connecticut, \n17 days after her 85th birthday. She is buried in the historic \ncemetery at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, along with \nher husband and their son Henry Ellis.\u0014",

    "title": "LUTHER FOUND THE REST OF THE STORY--FORGIVENESS",
    "words": "Is there a way out? Is there some truth that will make us free? These \nquestions haunted an Augustinian monk named Martin Luther. After a \nclose call with a lightning bolt in the year 1505, he entered a \nmonastery and took the vows. For a dozen years or so, he tried to \nwork out his salvation with fear and trembling. He did whatever he \ncould to be a righteous person.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem was that, no matter how hard he tried, Luther was never \ngood enough. He was never free from himself. One biographer tells us \nthat Luther confessed his sins almost daily, sometimes for as long as \nsix hours in a single sitting. He believed every sin to be forgiven \nmust be confessed, and every sin to be confessed must first be \nremembered. So he spent hours trying to remember the truth about his \nlife, recalling every wayward thought and dirty deed, both real and \nanticipated. As a memory device, he repeated the list of seven deadly \nsins, one at a time, and tried to recall every occasion when he had \nfelt an inclination to commit each sin. He recited the Ten \nCommandments, line by line, and then probed his own heart to remember \nevery time he broke, or thought about breaking, God's Law. Those \nassigned to listen to Brother Luther's sins often grew weary. \"Look \nhere,\" someone once said to him, \"if you expect Christ to forgive \nyou, come in here with something to forgive - murder, blasphemy, \nadultery - instead of all these peccadilloes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther knew better. He was a prisoner of sin. To think otherwise was, \nand is, an illusion. His whole life was saturated with sin, even in \nthe relative protection of the monastery. On every page of his Bible, \nhe found something that judged his life and condemned his soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as you know, something happened. Martin Luther discovered there \nwere other things in his Bible. In 1515, he began to lecture some \nstudents on the book of Romans. Like every good teacher, he learned \nsomething when he taught. When he flipped to the third chapter of \nRomans, he knew it said, \"All have sinned and fall short of the glory \nof God.\" He knew it was there; that was his burden. But then he \nstumbled over the next verse, where it says, \"All are now justified \nby his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ \nJesus\" (Romans 3:23-24).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next year, Luther began to lecture on the book of Galatians. When \nhe got to the second chapter, he knew what it was going to say. He \nread, \"A person is not justified by the works of the law,\" and he \ngroaned, because that was the burden of truth. For years, Martin \nLuther tried to keep God's Law and it was killing him. Then he read, \n\"And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be \njustified by faith in Christ\" (Galatians 2:16). That was it! That was \nthe way out of every illusion, falsehood, and sin: through faith in \nthe Christ who sets us free.\u0014",

I picked up one of those \"Dividers\" that they keep by \u0014\nthe cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't \u0014\nget mixed. After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up \u0014\nthe \"Divider\" looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan \u0014\nit.

When I inquired as to what she \u0014\nwas doing, she said she was shopping on the Internet and they kept \u0014\nasking for a credit card number, so she was using the ATM \"thingy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n FOUR - I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her \u0014\ncar.\u0014\n \"Do you need some help?\" I asked.\u0014\n She replied, \"I knew I should have replaced the battery to this \nremote\u0014\ndoor unlocker. Now I can't get into my car. Do you think they \n(pointing\u0014\nto a distant convenience store) would have a battery to fit this?\"\u0014\n \"Hmmm, I dunno.

It's a long walk.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFIVE - Several years ago, we had an Intern who was none too swift. \nOne \u0014\nday she was typing and turned to a secretary and said, \"I'm almost \nout \u0014\nof typing paper. \"What do I do?\"\u0014\n \"Just use copier machine paper,\" the secretary told her.\u0014\n With that, the intern took her last remaining blank piece of paper, \u0014\nput it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five \"blank\" copies.\u0014\n\u0014\nSIX - I was in a car dealership a while ago, when a large motor home \u0014\nwas towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire need \u0014\nof repair and the whole thing generally looked like an extra in \u0014\nTwister.\" I asked the manager what had happened.\u0014\n He told me that the driver had set the \"cruise control\" and then \u0014\nwent in the back to make a sandwich.\u0014\n\u0014\nSEVEN - My neighbor works in the operations department in the central \u0014\noffice of a large bank.

Phillips, Good News\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all the greeting card and sermonic rhetoric, I do not think that \nmuch rejoicing happens around Christmastime, least of all about the \ncoming of the Lord. There is, I notice, a lot of holiday frolicking, \nbut that is not the same as rejoicing. In any case, maybe outbursts \nof either frolicking or rejoicing are premature, if John the Baptist \nhas credibility. He identifies repentance as the message and the \nsentiment of Advent.\u0014\nWilliam Stringfellow, A Keeper of the Word\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is no use saying that we are born 2,000 years too late to give \nroom to Christ . Christ is always with us, always asking for room in \nour hearts . And giving shelter or food to anyone who asks for it, \nor needs it, is giving it to Christ.\u0014\nDorothy Day: Selected Writings\u0014\n\u0014\nHuman nature is like a stable inhabited by the ox of passion and the \nass of prejudiceanimals which take up a lot of room and which I \nsuppose most of us are feeding on the quiet. And it is there between \nthem, pushing them out, that Christ must be born, and in their very \nmanger he must be laidand they will be the first to fall on their \nknees before him. Sometimes Christians seem far nearer to those \nanimals than to Christ in his simple poverty, self-abandoned to God.\u0014\nEvelyn Underhill, Light of Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nProbably few of us have the faith or the nerve to tamper with \nhallowed Christmas traditions on a large scale, or with our other \nholiday celebrations. But a small experiment might prove interesting. \nWhat if, instead of doing something, we were to be something special? \nBe a womb. Be a dwelling for God. Be surprised.\u0014\nLoretta Ross-Gotta, Letters from the Holy Ground\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are better givers than getters, not because we are generous people \nbut because we are proud, arrogant people. The Christmas storythe \none according to Luke, not Dickensis not about how blessed it is to \nbe givers but about how essential it is to see ourselves as receivers.\u0014\nWilliam Willimon, The Christian Century\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must speak in practical terms. Either Christ's coming has meaning \nfor us now, or else it means nothing at all.\u0014\nChristoph Friedrich Blumhardt, Action Waiting\u0014\nFrom Watch for the Night: Readings for Advent and Christmas (Plough, \n2001), with permission\u0014",

I fear not death, for that grim foe \nbetrays himself at last, thrusting me forever into life: life with \nyou, unsoiled and free.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I do fear.

    "words": "Louis XIV, writes Anthony Levi in his dazzling new biography, \"was \ninvested from infancy to old age with privilege and power \nunprecedented in medieval or early modern Europe.\" Hailed as le Roi \nsoleil, or the Sun King, Louis epitomized the grandeur and might of \nan entire nation and left a legacy as celebrated and studied as any \nmonarch could wish. The flourishing of art and architecture during \nhis reign, including the majestic palace at Versailles, continues to \nfascinate millions, while the Sun King's wars permanently shaped the \nlandscape of Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAnthony Levi, emeritus professor at the University of St. Andrews, \nScotland and author of Cardinal Richelieu and the Making of France, \ndraws on both the literature of the period and a treasure trove of \nletters and documents to provide a rare and remarkable look at the \nentire life of Louis XIV. At the heart of this intricate and \nprovocative portrait lies Louis' own internal struggle to reconcile a \npartial belief in his own divinity with the death and destruction so \nmany of his decisions would bring.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA stunning revelation\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon the death of Louis XIII in 1643, four-year-old Louis XIV became \nmonarch. Levi describes this famous event with vivid and detailed \nprose. Yet he also offers one stunning new revelation; Levi argues \nthat Cardinal Mazarin, not Louis XIII, was the boy's biological \nfather. Subsequent events certainly support this theory, as Louis' \nmother appointed Mazarin her principal minister immediately after her \nhusband's death. \"It had not been clear to the unperceptive court \nquite how obviously Mazarin had prepared as well as entitled himself \nto Richelieu's succession,\" Levi writes. Until Louis XIV reached his \nmajority, Mazarin was France's de facto ruler.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the fact that his mother was the Habsburg Anne of Austria, \nand his aunt Elizabeth, eldest daughter of France's Henri IV, had \nmarried Philip IV of Spain, Louis XIV inherited the leadership of the \nBourbons in their bitter struggle against the Austro-Spanish \nHabsburgs for control of Europe. Throughout his reign, Louis fought \nmultiple wars and was engaged in almost constant conflict with a \nnumber of his relatives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA revealing portrait\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat sort of man was the Sun King? Levi reveals an individual of \nincredible physical fortitude and keen political skills. His appetite \nfor both food and female companionship was tremendous. The price of \nabsolute power took its toll, however, as Louis struggled to endure \n\"the failures, guilt, agonies of conscience and the consequences of \nerroneous choices, which are the ordinary destiny he shared with \nother mortals.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEngagingly written and filled with insight into the life and times of \nFrance's most remarkable monarch, Louis XIV is a triumph of the \nbiographer's art. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Anthony Levi is emeritus professor of the \nUniversity of St. Andrews, Scotland. He is the author or editor of \nnumerous books, reviews and articles, including Cardinal Richelieu \nand the Making of France and Renaissance and Reformation: The \nIntellectual Genesis.

Segal, a \nprofessor of Jewish studies at Barnard College, spent 10 years on \nthis project, but the erudition he displays is undoubtedly the result \nof a lifetime of scholarship. In every culture, people ask the same \nfundamental questions about their existence, including \"what happens \nafter we die?\" Although Segal maintains that answers to that question \nlie \"beyond confirmation or disconfirmation in the scientific sense,\" \nhe offers a comprehensive overview of how the afterlife is understood \nin the three main Western religions. He thoroughly examines early \ninfluences from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Canaan, Iran and Greece, then \nanalyzes Jewish views as expressed in the first and second temple \nperiods, the book of Daniel, the Dead Sea scrolls and writings from \nand about New Testament times, the early rabbis, mysticism and \nfundamentalism. For Christianity, systematic attention is given to \nPaul, the Gospels, the pseudepigraphic literature and the Church \nFathers. Segal also scans Muslim beliefs as they appear in the Qur'an \nand the writings of Shi'a mystics and modern fundamentalists. The \nintroductory and concluding chapters provide the essence of the \npresentation, enlivened by quotations from Shakespeare. Impatient \nreaders may begin with these two chapters as a guide to determining \nwhich other sections of the book warrant further scrutiny. Careful \nreaders, however, will take the trouble and the time to pore over \nthis impressive contribution to our understanding of human belief and \nbehavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc.

But Lucrezia Borgia was neither a \none-dimensional villainess nor the hapless victim of power politics. \nAccording to Sarah Bradford, bestselling author of Americas Queen \nand Elizabeth, she was actually a shrewd, determined woman who used \nher beauty and intelligence to secure a key role in the political \nstruggles of her day.\u0014\n\u0014\nForging her own destiny\u0014\n\u0014\nLucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy is \nBradfords riveting new portrait of one of historys most fascinating \nand misunderstood women. Drawn from a trove of contemporary documents \nand firsthand accounts, she deftly separates the truththat in a \nworld where the dice were heavily loaded in favour of men, Lucrezia \noperated within the circumstances of her time to forge her own \ndestinyfrom the myths.\u0014\n\u0014\nLucrezia was the illegitimate daughter of Rodrigo Cardinal Borgia and \nhis scheming mistress, Vannozza Cattanei. Rodrigo fathered eight, \npossibly nine, children altogether, but Vannozza was his principal \nmistress and mother of the three children he loved the most. Lucrezia \nwas twelve when her father became Pope Alexander VI, one of the most \nnotorious Renaissance popes. Though admired for his executive \nabilities, Alexander was also known for his most obscene behaviour, \ninsincerity, shamelessness, lying, faithlessness, impiety, insatiable \navarice, immoderate ambition, [and] cruelty\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1493, Lucrezia married Giovanni Sforza, a union arranged by her \nfather. She was thirteen, and had never met her husband-to-be. Ever \nthe obedient daughter, she subsequently divorced Sforza at the \ncommand of her father and brother. She then married a second husband \nwho met death at the hands of her brothers henchmen. At this point, \nshe was just twenty. It was then, Bradford writes, that she took \nher fate into her own hands and was actively involved in the \npromotion of her third marriage to Alfonso dEste, Duke of Ferrara \nThis was accomplished despite the fact that Alfonso was violently \nopposed to marrying her.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefeated by childbirth\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Duchess of Ferrara, Lucrezia took an active role in every aspect \nof her public and private life. With a powerful intelligence, the \nequal of any man, she won over her hostile in-laws, and dominated an \nopulent court distinguished by a glittering circle of poets and \nintellectuals. Through war and plague, she dispensed justice and \nadministered the defense of Ferrara. To the modern observer, she can \nbe seen as the ultimate survivor: escaping the violence of the papal \ncourt of the Borgias, as well as the inbred violence of the d'Este \nfamily. Ultimately, she was defeated only by childbirth, the curse of \nthe era for many women.\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford argues that in her maturity, Lucrezia was an enlightened \nruler, kind and decisive, passionate in love, and utterly indifferent \nto sexual morality. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the author: Sarah Bradford is the author of Americas Queen, \nDisraeli, George VI, Princess Grace, and Elizabeth. She has published \ntwo previous accounts of the Borgia family, including a biography of \nCesare Borgia. Married to the Viscount Bangor, she makes her home in \nLondon.\u0014",

    "words": "LDS 'Insider' Suspended\u0014\nAuthor stands by critical book.\u0014\nby John W. Kennedy\u0014\n\u0014\nGrant H. Palmer had expected to be punished by the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints for writing the 2002 book An Insider's \nView of Mormon Origins. But the delayed timing caught him off guard. \nLast December, Keith Adams, the leader at Grant's church in Sandy, \nUtah, disfellowshiped him. The sanction means Palmer may no longer \nspeak publicly or take sacraments during the suspension of \nunspecified length.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They felt [the book] had done some damage to people's faith by \ncausing them to doubt Mormon foundational claims,\" Palmer said. He is \nretired after 34 years as a college-level lds educator.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Insider's View argues that LDS founder Joseph Smith didn't \nmiraculously translate the Book of Mormon from golden plates. It also \nexamines \"Smith's largely rewritten, materialistic, idealized, and \ncontroversial accounts of the church's founding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPalmer joins an increasing number of Mormons and ex-Mormons publicly \nquestioning the validity of the origins of the church, including \nSimon Southerton (CT, October 2004, p. 20) and Thomas W. Murphy (CT, \nMarch 2003, p. 24).\u0014\n\u0014\nLDS spokeswoman Kim Farah declined to comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nPalmer, a fourth-generation Mormon, still wants to be a part of the \nchurch. But he isn't ready to toe the line. \"I don't know how I can \nrepent if the book is true.\"\u0014\nCopyright  2005 Christianity Today.

    "title": "LOST SCRIPTURES, BY BART EHRMAN",
    "words": "While most people think that the twenty-seven books of the New \nTestament are the only sacred writings of the early Christians, this \nis not at all the case. A companion volume to Bart Ehrman's Lost \nChristianities, this book offers an anthology of up-to-date and \nreadable translations of many non-canonical writings from the first \ncenturies after Christ--texts that have been for the most part lost \nor neglected for almost two millennia. Here is an array of remarkably \nvaried writings from early Christian groups whose visions of Jesus \ndiffer dramatically from our contemporary understanding. Readers will \nfind Gospels supposedly authored by the apostle Philip, James the \nbrother of Jesus, Mary Magdalen, and others. There are Acts \noriginally ascribed to John and to Thecla, Paul's female companion; \nthere are Epistles allegedly written by Paul to the Roman philosopher \nSeneca. And there is an apocalypse by Simon Peter that offers a \nguided tour of the afterlife, both the glorious ecstasies of the \nsaints and the horrendous torments of the damned, and an Epistle by \nTitus, a companion of Paul, which argues page after page against \nsexual love, even within marriage, on the grounds that physical \nintimacy leads to damnation. In all, the anthology includes fifteen \nGospels, five non-canonical Acts of the Apostles, thirteen Epistles, \na number of Apocalypes and Secret Books, and several Canon lists. \nEhrman has included a general introduction, plus brief introductions \nto each piece. This important anthology gives readers a vivid picture \nof the range of beliefs that battled each other in the first \ncenturies of the Christian era.\u0014",

    "title": "LINCOLN -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "\u0014\nTo study Lincoln, writes Richard Carwardine, involves peering \nthrough a veil of myth and iconography. More than simply a \nvictorious wartime leader and brilliant politician, Abraham Lincoln \nhas been firmly secured in our minds as the savior of the Union, the \ngreat martyr to freedom. Yet no honorific, no matter how flattering, \nexplains Lincolns dazzling success in achieving and wielding \npolitical power. How did this ungainly frontier lawyer rise to the \npresidency of the United States? How did he manage both a tumultuous \ncabinet and a series of troublesome generals during some of the Civil \nWars bloodiest fighting? Why have the American people continued to \nembrace his words and ideals more than a century after his shocking \ndeath?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power, Oxford Universitys Richard \nCarwardine strikes at the very heart of such questions, offering a \nmeticulously detailed and wonderfully well-written political \nbiography of this most enigmatic and inspiring man. Already the \nrecipient of the prestigious Lincoln Prizemarking the first time a \nBritish scholar has received the awardCarwardines Lincoln brings \nthe astonishing career of our most remarkable President to bold and \nvivid life.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnderstanding Lincolns success\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the genesis of his political ideas and his rise during the \ntumultuous 1850s to his legendary debates with Stephen A. Douglas, \nelection to the presidency, and evolving responses to the challenge \nof secession and Civil War, Carwardine explores each turning point in \nLincolns legendary career.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the books most fascinating chapters concerns Lincolns \ncontroversial use of emergency executive powerswhat Carwardine calls \nhis strong-arm use of the law and militaryincluding arbitrary \narrests, suspension of habeus corpus, and conscription. Despite such \nactions, Carwardine argues, Lincolns main challengeand ultimate \nsuccesslay not in coercing an unwilling population, but rather in \nsustaining and nurturing Northern patriotism. [W]hat is remarkable, \nhe argues, is just how little it depended on executive coercion, \nrepression, and the long arm of the War Department.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn extraordinary achievement\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, there are scores of fascinating asides, including one \nparticularly riveting discussion of Lincolns love for William \nShakespeare, particularly Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth, each work \nnotable for its brooding insights into the nature of political power. \nThe experience of these Shakespearean heads of state, Carwardine \nargues, spoke to the condition of a man whose restless desire for \nthe highest office in the Union had delivered a fearful, \nbone-wearying duty.\u0014\n\u0014\nA masterful example of first-rate scholarship wedded to gifted prose \nand penetrating analysis, Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power is, in \nthe words of noted historian Mark A. Noll, an extraordinary \nachievement. \u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Richard Carwardine is Rhodes Professor of American \nHistory at Oxford University and is the first British scholar to be \nawarded the Lincoln Prize, the largest award in America for \n19th-century American history. Hs previous work includes Evangelicals \nand Politics in Antebellum America.\u0014",

    "title": "LESSONS FROM A LARGER-THAN-LIFE PRESIDENT",
    "words": "Lessons from a Larger-than-Life President\u0014\nBy KARL ROVE \u0014\n\u0014\nTheodore Roosevelt is one of the most remarkable figures in America's \nstory. Adventurous, brave, opinionated, a larger-than-life \npersonality, he was a man of action, energy and motion. T.R. loved \nwhat he called \"the literature of history\"--and wanted to be a key \nactor in America's great drama.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoosevelt was not perfect by any means--but he was an extraordinary \nman by any reasonable measure. He was among our most consequential \nPresidents, changing America in deep and lasting ways. A century \nafter he served as President, he still has many things to teach us. \nAmong them:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. It is every American's responsibility to be active in our civic \nlife. \"The first duty of an American citizen, then,\" Roosevelt said, \n\"is that he shall work in politics.\" T.R. took the title of citizen \nseriously. He believed freedom could not be preserved without \nAmericans \"striving and suffering for it\" by defending the nation and \nparticipating in the practical work of democracy.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Politics should be animated by large, important ideas. For a man \nwho said \"I like big things,\" politics was about precisely that. T.R. \nwas not interested so much in management or budgeting matters; he \nwanted to grapple with big issues like America's role in the world, \nsocial justice and fairness in competition. Whether it was waging war \nor waging peace--T.R. was the first American to win the Nobel Peace \nPrize--he shaped the future of the nation and the course of human \nevents. In doing so, he helped invent the modern American presidency.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. The United States, while not flawless, is a profound force for \ngood in the world. Theodore Roosevelt led a reluctant nation, largely \nindifferent to world affairs, onto the global stage. On his watch, \nAmerica became a great world power. \"There comes a time in the life \nof a nation, as in the life of an individual, when it must face great \nresponsibilities, whether it will or no,\" he said in 1898. \"We have \nnow reached that time. We cannot avoid facing the fact that we occupy \na new place among the people of the world ... Our flag is a proud \nflag, and it stands for liberty and civilization. Where it has once \nfloated, there must be no return to tyranny.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Leadership matters. Confident in his own powers of judgment and \npersuasion, Roosevelt believed in \"immediate and rigorous executive \naction\" in times of crisis. And whether they agreed with him or not, \nAmericans knew where this human dynamo stood on the great issues of \nhis time. Driven by a fervent belief in the Declaration of \nIndependence, he drew strength from his faith that all Americans \n\"stand on the same footing,\" as human beings worthy of respect. And \nlike all great leaders, he inspired those he led, turning his \nconvictions into theirs.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. A spirited clash of ideas is not only inevitable in politics, but \nhelpful. T.R. didn't just love ideas, he loved to debate them as long \nas it was fair and straight. The \"healthy combativeness\" of politics \nclarified differences and choices. The rough-and-tumble of the \npolitical arena didn't bother him. \"If a man has a very decided \ncharacter, has a strongly accentuated career,\" Roosevelt said, \"it is \nnormally the case of course that he makes ardent friends and bitter \nenemies.\" T.R. had both. So did F.D.R. So did Lincoln. So did Reagan. \nSo do all consequential leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. There can be great joy in politics. At the age of 28 and on the \nverge of losing the New York City mayor's race, he still wrote a \nfriend, \"I have had first class fun ...\" He relished the thrust and \nparry of politics, its give and take, the highs and lows. And he knew \npolitics was a noble profession. \"Aggressive fighting for the right \nis the noblest sport the world affords,\" he famously said. No man \nloved being President more than T.R.--or missed being President as \nmuch.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Character matters. Roosevelt was a man of extraordinary self-will. \nEncouraged by his father, he turned himself from a sickly child to a \npowerful, hardy young man. He overcame common human fears and became \na man of great courage. He chose \"the strenuous life\" over comfort \nand ease. He was a loyal friend and faithful husband--and reveled in \nthe company of his children. He encountered heartbreaking losses-- \nthe sudden passing of his beloved first wife and his mother on the \nsame day in the same house and, later, the death in combat of his son \nQuentin--yet his life was characterized by passion and zest and a \ndrive to achieve great things.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoosevelt's fellow citizens loved him, in large measure because they \nknew how deeply he loved his country. At the start of \"a new century \nbig with the fate of many nations,\" he said America was the \"young \ngiant of the West.\" He strived with all his considerable power to \nconserve, strengthen, direct and ennoble it. He did all that and \nmore, which is why Theodore Roosevelt holds a special place in the \nAmerican imagination. \u0014\n\u0014\nKarl Rove, a history buff, is assistant to the President, deputy \nchief of staff and senior adviser\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2006 Time Inc.

However...... the \ndust from the attacks had barely settled when the \"politically \ncorrect! \" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our \npatriotism was offending others.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone \nwho is seeking a better life by coming to America. Our population is \nalmost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there \nare a few things that those who have recently come to our country, \nand apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of \nAmerica being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our \nsovereignty and our national identity. As Americans.....we have our \nown culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. \nThis culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, \nand victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, \nGerman, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to \nbecome part of our society, learn the language!\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In God We Trust\" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, \nright wing, political slogan.. We adopted this motto because \nChristian men and women.......on Christian principles............. \nfounded this nation..... and this is clearly documented. It is \ncertainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If \nGod offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the \nworld as your new home.........because God is part of our culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then \nyou should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. \nWe are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we \nreally don't care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR \nCOUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every \ncitizen the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every \nopportunity to do so! But once you are done complaining....... \nwhining...... and griping....... about our flag...... our \npledge...... our national motto.......or our way of life...I highly \nencourage you to take advantage of one other Great American \nFreedom......\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE RIGHT TO LEAVE.\u0014",

It's John Hagee time!\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe it's time for Weblog to shift from its regular \"Pat Robertson \ndoesn't represent evangelicalism\" programming to \"John Hagee doesn't \nrepresent evangelicalism.\" He's the latest Christian media darling, \ngetting truckloads of press clippings from reporters eager to profile \na Christian leader who sounds gleeful over war in the Middle East and \nties current events to apocalyptic premillennialism. The latest and \nprobably most prominent and detailed profile yet is on today's Wall \nStreet Journal front page. Andrew Higgins describes the scene at last \nweek's Christians United for Israel rally in D.C.:\u0014\n\u0014\n    Standing on a stage bedecked with a huge Israeli flag, Mr. Hagee \ndrew rapturous applause and shouts of \"amen\" as he hailed Israel for \ndoing God's work in a \"war of good versus evil.\" Calls for Israel to \nshow restraint violate \"God's foreign-policy statement\" toward Jews, \nhe said, citing a verse from the Old Testament that promises to \n\"bless those who bless you\" and curse \"the one who curses you.\"  \n\"Leave Israel alone. Let them do the job,\" Mr. Hagee told his \nsupporters.\u0014\n\u0014\nYeah, there's a number of people in the evangelical movement who \nbelieve that Israel should only be criticized when it's being too \nsoft on its neighbors. Let's accurately describe them as Zionist \nChristians rather than as evangelical Christians. As a subset, \nHagee's views are no more representative of all evangelicals than \nthey are of all Texans. Just how big is this group? One indication \ncomes from Hagee himself. His San Antonio church claims 19,000 \nmembers (it has a weekly attendance of about 8,000), and yet he says \nthat getting 3,500 Zionists to attend his rally in D.C. is a \"miracle \nof God.\"\u0014",

    "title": "LUTHER RICE AND HIS INFLUENCE IN MISSIONS",
    "words": "This Month in Our History\u0014\nSeptember 2006\u0014\n\u0014\nThis month in our history, on September 25, 1836, 170 years ago, one \nof the greatest figures in American Baptist history died where he \nfell in Edgefield, South Carolina.  At age 53, Luther Rice had \nliterally exhausted his life in pursuit of his high calling.  He did \nnot belong to South Carolina any more than he belonged to Virginia or \nto his native Massachusetts or to any other of the Eastern Seaboard \nstates.  He belonged to all Baptists.  Luther Rice, more than any \nother single individual, rallied the scattered Baptist people into a \ndenominational consciousness, a dedication to missions, and a \ndetermination to develop an educated clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther Rice was not always a Baptist.  While still a teenager, he \njoined a Congregationalist church.  As a college student, he fell \ninto the good company of some earnest students who participated in \nthe now famous Haystack Prayer Meeting.  The prospect of foreign \nmissions captured their imagination.  In 1810 Rice and five others, \nincluding Adoniram Judson, requested appointment as missionaries.  \nThey went as Congregationalists; and along the way, Adoniram and Ann \nJudson read the Scriptures and accepted the Baptist position on \nbaptism of believers by immersion.  Rice arrived in India separately \nand with his own similar decision regarding baptism.  He returned to \nthe United States where his relationship with the Congregationalists \nwas severed.  He determined to impress the Baptists with the ancient \ncalling for missions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe journeyed from Boston to Savannah.  He visited scattered \nmissionary societies, most of them composed of females.  He also \nhelped in the organization of missionary societies.  Somewhere \nbetween Richmond and Petersburg, Luther Rice hit upon the idea of \ncalling for a general missionary society which would be a sending \nagency.  In May 1814, the General Convention was formed.  It had a \nname as long and impressive as fifty-dollar bill; but it became \npopularly known by a name as unimpressive as a one-dollar bill:  the \nTriennial Convention.  The nickname came because the Convention would \nmeet only once every three years. \u0014\n\u0014\nRice was instrumental in the creation of a Baptist school in the \nDistrict of Columbia and hence the name of Columbian College.  If you \ncannot find it in a directory of colleges and universities, it is \nbecause the school which the Baptists founded evolved into the \npresent-day George Washington University.  Rice also realized the \nneed for communication and education for the average Baptists in the \npew and, therefore, he started the publication of the first weekly \nnewspaper published by Baptists.  It was called The Columbian Star.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe traveled widely in support of these three endeavors:  the \nmissionary effort, the college and the newspaper.  He would travel in \na sulky drawn by his horse Columbus and stay in the homes of the \nBaptists.  In many a home, the lady of the house would take pity upon \nthe traveling minister and make him new clothes or darn his socks or \nwash his clothing. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlong the way, he preached and lifted offerings for missions.  While \nin Virginia on one of his trips, he went to Monticello to see Mr. \nJefferson.  He even happened to be present for the founding meeting \nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia at Second Baptist \nChurch of Richmond in June 1823.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe best modern biography of Rice was written by the late Evelyn \nWingo Thompson.  It is entitled Luther Rice: Believer in Tomorrow.  \nEvelyn Thompson pictured the closing scenes of a life devoted to \nGods service.  He had been traveling in lower South Carolina when an \nillness came over him, with severe pains in his side.  He made his \nway to a friends house where the family nursed him through the final \nhours.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery evening during his sickness he insisted that [the doctor] \nshould have family worship in his room; and whether the doctor or \nothers prayed, he usually asked that they would pray if it be the \nwill of God he might recover.  This request was always made with \nevident and calm submission to the will of God.  He always gave them \na few lines of a favorite hymn to sing and on his last Sunday \nrequested that they sing the hymn beginning, Another six days work \nis done, Another Sabbath is begun, though his favorite was When I \ncan read my title clear.  He also remarked, It is a matter of \nentire indifference to me where I should die, whenever the Lord \nchooses to call me, I am ready to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaturday, the twenty-fifth of September, dawned a golden autumn day, \nbecoming hot in midday, the air still.  It was the day of Rices most \nadventurous journey.  There had been many ridings into the unknown, \nmany lost trails, many twilight arrivals.  Countless times he had sat \naround the ever-changing family circles, lifted his voice and sung, \nWhen I can read my title clear.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe expired quietly, [the doctor] believing he did not feel death as \nother men generally do.  He died in another mans home, far from any \nmember of his family, close friends, or the beloved College.  A sad \nand pathetic picture?  Not for one who watched for the morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe legacy of Luther Rice is all about us:  the General Association \nand its Kingdom Advance; the missions zeal which now characterizes \nso many Baptists in America; the religious newspaper which so many \nBaptists read with anticipation; the Baptist schools, colleges and \nseminaries which dot the religious landscape of the United States.  \nLuther Rice is the one figure which unites the Baptists of the North \nand the South.  And, like the Scripture, He being dead yet speaketh.\u0014\n\t\u0014",

How could a guy get caught so\u0014\noften?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen his car had slowed to 10 miles an hour, Jack pulled over, but \nonly\u0014\npartially. Let the cop worry about the potential traffic hazard. Maybe\u0014\nsome other car will tweak his backside with a mirror. The cop was\u0014\nstepping out of his car, the big pad in hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob? Bob from Church? Jack sunk farther into his trench coat. This was\u0014\nworse than the coming ticket. A cop catching a guy from his own \nchurch!\u0014\nA guy who happened to be a little eager to get home after a long day \nat\u0014\nthe office! A guy he was about to play golf with tomorrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nJumping out of the car, he approached a man he saw every Sunday, a man\u0014\nhe'd never seen in uniform.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hi, Bob. Fancy meeting you like this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hello, Jack.\" No smile.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Guess you caught me red-handed in a rush to see my wife and kids.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" Bob seemed uncertain. Good. \"I've seen some long\u0014\ndays at the office lately. I'm afraid I bent the rules a bit-just this\u0014\nonce.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJack toed at a pebble on the pavement. \"Diane said something about\u0014\nroast beef and potatoes tonight. Know what I mean?\" \"I know what you\u0014\nmean. I also know that you have a reputation in our precinct.\" Ouch.\u0014\nThis was not going in the right direction. Time to change tactics!\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What'd you clock me at?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Seventy. Would you sit back in your car please?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Now wait a minute here, Bob. I checked as soon as saw you. I was\u0014\nbarely nudging 65.\" The lie seemed to come easier with every ticket.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Please, Jack, in the car.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFlustered, Jack hunched himself through the still-open door. Slamming\u0014\nit shut, he stared at the dashboard. He was in no rush to open the\u0014\nwindow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe minutes ticked by. Bob scribbled away on the pad.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy hadn't he asked for a driver's license?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the reason, it would be a month of Sundays before Jack ever \nsat\u0014\nnear this cop again. A tap on the door jerked his head to the left.\u0014\nThere was Bob, a folded paper in hand Jack rolled down the window a \nmere\u0014\ntwo inches, just enough room for Bob to pass him the slip.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Thanks.\" Jack could not quite keep the sneer out of his voice.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob returned to his police car without a word. Jack watched his \nretreat\u0014\nin the mirror. Jack unfolded the sheet of paper. How much was this one\u0014\ngoing to cost?\u0014\n\u0014\nWait a minute. What was this? Some kind of joke?\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly not a ticket! Jack began to read: \"Dear Jack, Once upon a\u0014\ntime I had a daughter. She was six when killed by a car. You guessed\u0014\nit-a speeding driver. A fine and three months in jail, and the man was\u0014\nfree. Free to hug his daughters, all three of them! I only had one,\u0014\nand I'm going to have to wait until Heaven before I can ever hug her\u0014\nagain.\u0014\n\u0014\nA thousand times I've tried to forgive that man. A thousand times I\u0014\nthought I had. Maybe I did, but I need to do it again. Even now. Pray\u0014\nfor me. And be careful, Jack, my son is all I have left.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bob\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJack turned around in time to see Bob's car pull away and head down \nthe\u0014\nroad. Jack watched until it disappeared. A full 15 minutes later, he\u0014\ntoo, pulled away and drove slowly home, praying for forgiveness and\u0014\nhugging a surprised wife and kids when he arrived.\u0014\n\u0014\nLife is precious.

    "words": "From Publishers Weekly\u0014\n\u0014\n A widely acclaimed preacher, Taylor draws on her homiletical skills \nin this finely crafted memoir with a simple plot:. An Episcopal \npriest exhausts her inner resources, first in an urban church and \nthen in a small country parish; she changes jobs, struggles and finds \nrenewal. Such a synopsis, however, does not do justice to Taylor's \nliterary style in this rich evocation of her lifelong love affair \nwith God. \"When I think of my first cathedral,\" she writes, \"I am \nback in a field behind my parents' house in Kansas, with every stalk \nof prairie grass lit up from within.\" Drawn to the church, she \ncompulsively overworks: \"I had such a strong instinct for rescue that \nmy breasts fairly leaked when I came across those in need of \nrescuing.\" Though she has found new employment, she realizes she is \nstill a priest: \"I miss being a lightning rod, conducting all that \nheat and light not only from heaven to earth but also from person to \nperson.\" Current and former clergy will relate to her comical and \nsometimes touching descriptions of parish life, while memoir buffs \nwill savor her journey as she identifies her core beliefs, sets \nboundaries and learns to relish her \"blessed swath\" of the world. \n(May) \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. All rights reserved. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\n\u0014\nEpiscopal priest Taylor, a respected and beloved preacher, ended a \n20-year career when, after much reflection, she left the church. She \nhad expected to spend the rest of her life writing sermons and \nleading worship. Instead, she now teaches full time at a college in \nGeorgia. With its three indicatively titled sections--\"Finding,\" \n\"Losing,\" \"Keeping\"--Leaving Church aims to explain her compulsion to \nleave the familiar behind. When she was first ordained and for years \nthereafter, she felt certain about the fundamentals of her own faith \nand what it meant to be Christian. But she slowly realized that she \nwas conflicted, internally and with the church, in large part because \nof church-inclusiveness controversies, including gay and lesbian \nissues. She laments that while ostensibly protecting the integrity of \nscripture and church doctrine, people can trample the rights of \nothers. She discovered that change isn't easy. Sometimes, even \ngetting dressed in the morning seems an insurmountable challenge. \nUltimately, Taylor's is a luminous portrait of faith not lost but \nquestioned, refound, and regained. June Sawyers\u0014\nCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved \u0014\n\u0014\n\"By now I expected to be a seasoned parish minister, wearing black \nclergy shirts grown gray from frequent washing. I expected to love \nthe children who hung on my legs after Sunday morning services until \nthey grew up and had children of their own. I even expected to be \nburied wearing the same red vestments in which I was ordained. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday those vestments are hanging in the sacristy of an Anglican \nchurch in Kenya, my church pension is frozen, and I am as likely to \nspend Sunday mornings with friendly Quakers, Presbyterians, or \nCongregationalists as I am with the Episcopalians who remain my \nclosest kin. Sometimes I even keep the Sabbath with a cup of steaming \nAssam tea on my front porch, watching towhees vie for the highest \nperch in the poplar tree while God watches me. These days I earn my \nliving teaching school, not leading worship, and while I still dream \nof opening a small restaurant in Clarkesville or volunteering at an \neye clinic in Nepal, there is no guarantee that I will not run off \nwith the circus before I am through. This is not the life I planned, \nor the life I recommend to others. But it is the life that has turned \nout to be mine, and the central revelation in it for me -- that the \ncall to serve God is first and last the call to be fully human -- \nseems important enough to witness to on paper. This book is my \nattempt to do that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter nine years serving on the staff of a big urban church in \nAtlanta, Barbara Brown Taylor arrives in rural Clarkesville, Georgia \n(population 1,500), following her dream to become the pastor of her \nown small congregation. The adjustment from city life to country \ndweller is something of a shock -- Taylor is one of the only \nprofessional women in the community -- but small-town life offers \nmany of its own unique joys. Taylor has five successful years that \nsee significant growth in the church she serves, but ultimately she \nfinds herself experiencing \"compassion fatigue\" and wonders what \nexactly God has called her to do. She realizes that in order to keep \nher faith she may have to leave. \u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor describes a rich spiritual journey in which God has given her \nmore questions than answers. As she becomes part of the flock instead \nof the shepherd, she describes her poignant and sincere struggle to \nregain her footing in the world without her defining collar. Taylor's \nrealization that this may in fact be God's surprising path for her \nleads her to a refreshing search to find Him in new places. Leaving \nChurch will remind even the most skeptical among us that life is \nabout both disappointment and hope -- and ultimately, renewal.\u0014",

The first funeral was for Naomi Rose \nEbersol, age 7. After the service, the long funeral procession, \ncomposed of about 300 Amish buggies, clip-clopped their way to the \ncemetery. Along the way, they passed directly in front of Roberts' \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You think about them,\" one Amish woman said, speaking of the slain \ngirls. \"You cry about them, you pray for them, and then you have to \nlet go of things you can't explain.\" When asked if the community \nresidents were angry, she said: \"Oh no, no, definitely not. People \ndon't feel that around here. We just don't.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYou wonder why the Amish seek to be so isolated from the world around \nthem. You wonder if it's biblical.  As Christians, aren't we supposed \nto be in the world but not of it? After all, how can you encourage \nredemption for people you shun? Do the Amish forsake that counsel in \norder to remain pure in their own eyes, to be unstained, or certainly \nuninfluenced, by the sinful world around them?\u0014\n\u0014\nI'll leave the answers to those far wiser than I. But I know one \nthing. The world that surrounds the Amish--the world from which they \nseek seclusion--could learn a valuable, a deep and abiding lesson \nfrom them. There is tremendous power in forgiveness, and it \naccomplishes far more than what we often think of as justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, obviously, we wish this terrible event had never occurred. \nBut if the world will take notice, maybe the redemption found in \nforgiveness will be the final word.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nRandy Hyde is pastor of Pulaski Heights Baptist Church in Little \nRock, Ark.\u0014",

Along the way, they passed directly in front of Roberts' \nhome.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"You think about them,\" one Amish woman said, speaking of the slain \ngirls. \"You cry about them, you pray for them, and then you have to \nlet go of things you can't explain.\" When asked if the community \nresidents were angry, she said: \"Oh no, no, definitely not. People \ndon't feel that around here. We just don't.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n You wonder why the Amish seek to be so isolated from the world \naround them. You wonder if it's biblical.  As Christians, aren't we \nsupposed to be in the world but not of it? After all, how can you \nencourage redemption for people you shun? Do the Amish forsake that \ncounsel in order to remain pure in their own eyes, to be unstained, \nor certainly uninfluenced, by the sinful world around them?\u0014\n\u0014\nI'll leave the answers to those far wiser than I. But I know one \nthing. The world that surrounds the Amish--the world from which they \nseek seclusion--could learn a valuable, a deep and abiding lesson \nfrom them. There is tremendous power in forgiveness, and it \naccomplishes far more than what we often think of as justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, obviously, we wish this terrible event had never occurred. \nBut if the world will take notice, maybe the redemption found in \nforgiveness will be the final word.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nRandy Hyde is pastor of Pulaski Heights Baptist Church in Little \nRock, Ark.\u0014",

    "title": "LOST BOYS OF SUDAN",
    "words": "God Grew Tired of Us\u0014\nA movie review by Camerin Courtney \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen civil war broke out in Sudan in the 1980s, some 25,000 boys ages \nthree to thirteen fled the atrocities in their homeland on foot. They \nwalked over 1,000 miles across barren desert to find refuge in \nEthiopia and Kenya. Those who didn't die from starvation, wild animal \nattacks, and bombing raids eventually found shelter in a UN refugee \ncamp in Kakuna, Kenya. Taking inspiration from Peter Pan's band of \norphan boys who protected and provided for each other, a journalist \nof that day dubbed these children the Lost Boys.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, the U.S. has resettled nearly 4,000 of these young \nmen. God Grew Tired of Us follows three of the Lost BoysJohn Bul \nDau, Daniel Abol Pach, and Panther Blor, chosen for relocation by the \nInternational Rescue Committeeto their new homes in Syracuse and \nPittsburgh. This sounds like leaving hell for heaven, until you \nrealize these men have never seen electricity, flushing toilets, or \nrunning water. And they're anguished to leave behind the friends who \nhave been closer than family for 15 years. Still, with wide-eyed and \nwary hope, they come.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first hints of what a different world they're entering occur on \nthe airplane ride. The boys are fascinated by the overhead reading \nlights, the announcements from the captain that seem to come from \nnowhere, the oddly packaged food. They eat pats of butter and mustard \npackets as if they're part of the main course, wobble their way onto \nescalators in the airports, and marvel at Hasidic Jews and punk \nrockers in New York. The orientation to their new apartment includes \nthe instruction that here we don't throw our trash out the window, as \nwell as demonstrations on how to use a shower, refrigerator, toilet, \nand lamp. They boys watch with rapt attention and we watch them with \nawe and amusement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rest of God Grew Tired of Us is a checking back in with these \nthree men at regular intervals over the next four years. The film \nnever introduces us to anyone in the U.S. who is helping them make \nthe transition, so it's hard to know how much the men are being shown \nthe ropesor how much they've just been left on their own to figure \nthings out.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe watch them get jobs and discover television, marvel at shopping \nmalls and wonder about Santa, miss their brothers back in Kenya and \nlook for their missing family members. All the while they grapple \nwith the ongoing grief of all they've endured, as well as a sort of \nsurvivor's guilt for being some of the chosen ones to get a fresh \nstart when they know all too well the hunger and purposelessness \ntheir brothers are suffering back in the refugee camp. As John, the \nmost pensive of the trio, says, \"If I get a good place, why not \nthem?\" The question weighs heavy, as does the sense of responsibility \nto make something good of this opportunityfor themselves and \nespecially for their friends and family back home.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod Grew Tired of Us doesn't shy away from the complexities these \nthree lives represent, including the countless ripple effects of \nworld conflict and the messy realities of resettlementhow it's a way \nforward but not always an easy \"solution.\" One of the strengths of \nthis documentarybesides the obvious and important \nawareness-raisingis its ability to help us see our culture from a \nfresh perspective. It's fascinating (and at times shaming) to watch \nthe men's gratitude for factory jobs most of us would consider menial \nat best, as well as their languishing loneliness as they learn that \ntalking to strangers in America draws suspicion instead of \nfellowship. That said, the film isn't heavy-handed or manipulative. \nThe men simply observe and process the huge change in their lives, \ngrappling with the grand canyon between what has been and what now is.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese men's life stories are told mostly in their own words. At times \nit feels like we're sitting in on their individual counseling \nsessions. Their words are well chosen and edited, keeping the film \nmoving and providing just enough levity when tough realities loom \nlarge. We also visit the men's first home in the refugee camp, and \ntravel along to their first grocery store visit, their job sites, and \neven to a Lost Boys reunion in Michigan. Throughout these four \ndocumented years we watch these three men change and grow, expanding \nour paradigm in the process. This is the kind of movie every American \nshould see, and also the kind of movie that makes you feel richer for \nseeing it.\u0014",

    "words": "It is apparent that Luther viewed the Anabaptists as the heirs of the \nZwickau Prophets, Thomas Mntzer, and the spiritualist leaders of the \npeasants revoltgone underground, perhaps, but poised to \nresurfaceand all the more deadly because of their indirection and \ndeception in preaching pacifism.15 Shortly afterward, Luther and \nMelanchthon had their views on Anabaptism put to the practical test. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1529 in Gotha, a Lutheran territory, 10 Anabaptists had been \ncaptured. They all recanted, but upon release, relapsed into their \ndissent. Six were recaptured and executed. Some leaders at Gotha were \ndisturbed at the severity of the punishment, and wrote to Wittenberg \nfor guidance. Melanchthon expressed his view that not only rebels, \nbut blasphemers should be executed.16 Blasphemy, according to \nMelanchthon, included any public teaching of a heretical doctrine, \nincluding the rejection of infant baptism. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuther did not go on record as opposing Melanchthons definitions. \nBut in a separate letter to the leadership at Gotha, he noted that \nthe Anabaptists were not only blasphemers, but seditious. Thus, they \nshould be executed.17 Luther had a different emphasis and approach on \nthe topic from that of Melanchthon. Luther required, in addition to \nheresy, some element of sedition before civil force was brought to \nbear. Later, Luther seemed at times to tacitly support Melanchthons \nbroader approach to punishing open heresy.18 But whenever Luther \nhimself addressed the question of punishing the Anabaptists, he \nnearly always raised the charges of their sedition and desire to \ndestroy the civil order.19 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe difference between the two Reformers on this question seems to be \nmore than merely a question of style. While Luther did define \nsedition with a certain liberal breadthincluding communal living and \nrejection of the magisterial role for Christianshe never seemed to \nfully embrace Melanchthons broad willingness to execute unrepentant \nheretics. Toward the end of his life he distinguished again between \nthe heretic and the seditious heretic. The former could be \nbanished, but only the latter could be executed. \u0014\n\u0014\nNicholas Miller is an attorney and director of the Institute on \nReligious Freedom, Berrien Springs, Michigan. \u0014\nLiberty Magazine, July-August. 2007\u0014",

    "words": "Lifestyles Of The Pets Of The Rich \nAnd Famous\u0014\n\u0014\nLiz Moyer, 08.29.07, FORBES.COM \u0014\n\u0014\nEverybody knows it's not a dog's life to be rich, but no one knows \nthis better than a rich person's dog.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeona Helmsley, dubbed the \"Queen of Mean\" for personifying the 1980s \nstereotype of greed and excess, made her pet Maltese \"Trouble\" her \nbiggest heir, leaving a $12 million trust fund for the pet in a will \nthat disinherits two grandchildren and doesn't even mention \ngreat-grandchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelmsley, who died last week, put contingencies on the inheritances \nof the two grandchildren who will actually get some money: They have \nto visit their father's grave site once a year. No such demands are \nmade of Trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd her chauffeur got $100,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nSound wacky? It may be, but it isn't rare. Inheritances for pets are \nnot uncommon among the wealthy, according to Russ Alan Prince, of \nPrince & Associates, who tracks the habits of the rich. That's \nespecially true of people who tend to alienate all other humans in \ntheir lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For some wealthy people, the only true love they get is from their \npets,\" Prince says. \"They're estranged from their children, they are \nat war with their business partners, but their pets are always there \nfor them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would not be a stretch to put Helmsley in that camp, if tabloid \ntales of her terrorizing employees and executives of her husband's \nreal estate empire are to be believed. She is perhaps most infamous \nfor telling a housekeeper that \"only the little people pay taxes,\" a \ncomment that came out during her trial for tax evasion in the late \n1980s.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrouble once appeared in ads for Helmsley hotels and no doubt led a \npampered life. The dog is to be buried alongside Helmsley and her \nhusband, Harry Helmsley, in their $1.4 million mausoleum in suburban \nNew York.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Prince, rich people who love to lavish money on their \npets (a category he calls \"pet-focused\") spend $328,000 on their pets \nannually. His survey, released this year, included 304 affluent \nfamilies who describe themselves as pet lovers, 46% of whom say their \nlove is singularly focused on their own pets and the rest who are \nanimal lovers in general. The survey group was 58% female with a mean \nage of 56 and a mean net worth of $46.7 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biggest spending area is in \"life enrichment\" services.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis includes everything from deep-muscle massage (pet masseuses can \nmake up to $2,000 an hour, Prince says) and psychic readings to life \ncoaching and \"cosmic sensitivity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne-third of pet-focused owners paid for special diets for their \npets, not for medical purposes, mind you, but because it was seen as \nbeing good for the animals. This includes meals prepared by famous \nchefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than a fourth of pet-focused owners surveyed said they spend \n$25,000 or more on wardrobes for their pets. Yes, 25 thousand.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven better, 16% of pet-focused owners recently surveyed by Prince & \nAssociates spend $25,000 or more on a birthday party for a pet.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral pets regularly fly around on private aircraft, alone (except \nfor flight crew).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut pet inheritances really raise the bar. More than a quarter of \nso-called pet-focused owners surveyed had established trusts for \ntheir pets in their wills before their deaths. This makes it harder \nfor surviving family members to fight the will, Prince says, and \nensures the owner will have at least some say in what happens to the \npet after the owner's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventy-eight percent of pet-focused owners leave money to pets in \ntheir wills, to the tune of $526,000, according to Prince. Mostly, \nthe money is to ensure a quality of life for the pet.\u0014\n\u0014\nPet trusts are increasingly popular, so much so that 39 states now \nhave statutes outlining them, says Frances Carlisle, a New York \nestate lawyer who specializes in pet trusts. In most cases, the \ntrusts left behind are small, in the $30,000 range, and meant to \nensure that the pet left behind has adequate care and won't be dumped \non the street or sent to a shelter.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause pets are pets, money cannot be left to them directly in a \nwill, so trusts are the next best thing to leaving money to a \ndesignated guardian, Carlisle says. The stigma of the kooky old rich \nlady, present company excluded, is gone. \"This sort of thing used to \nbe laughed at,\" Carlisle says. \"But a lot of animals really do end up \non the street.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the arrangements are punitive, however, and directed at \ngetting revenge on family members.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrince says he knows of an ostrich that stands to inherit $4 million, \nall because the owner's children once threatened to cut the ostrich \nup into food. Somewhere out there a parrot stands between his owner \nand the owner's children, who stand to lose tens of millions of \ninheritance money if they fail to follow specific instructions about \nthe parrot's safekeeping and well-being after the owner's death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"True pet lovers can be off-the-wall already, and what you're doing \nhere is adding money to it,\" Prince says. So true.\u0014",

    "words": "Testimony to the Failure of Fundamentalism, December 31, 2001\u0014\nLeaving The Fold: Testimonies Of Former Fundamentalists\u0014\nBy Kevin R. Henke (Lexington, KY) \u0014\n\u0014\nThis review is from: Leaving the Fold: Testimonies of Former \nFundamentalists (Hardcover)\u0014\nI contributed a chapter to this book. Some have accused me and the \nother authors of this book of not having sincere conversions or not \nwanting to be \"accountable\" to a \"creator.\" Because no one, including \nthese \"know-it-all\" accusers, can know the minds of the authors of \nthis book, I will only speak for myself. My conversion and \ndeconversion testimonies in this book are entirely SINCERE. I wanted \nsalvation. I committed my life to Christ and I encouraged others to \ndo so. However, after I read the Bible, and especially the false \nprophecies in Revelation and the countless contradictions in the \nGospels, I realized that the claims of Christianity were false. Also, \nI could no longer swallow the irrational and far-fetched excuses that \nfill the \"Christian apologetics\" literature. As discussed in my \nessay, the arguments used by fundamentalists are no different than \nthe feeble and subjective attempts by Mormons to defend their \n\"scriptures.\" The excuse-making of the \"apologeticists\" clearly \nviolates the Principle of Parsimony (that is, \"Ockham's Razor\": a \nprinciple that now goes far beyond the embryonic thoughts of William \nof Ockham).\u0014\n\u0014\nI finally had the courage to stop lying to myself and admit that the \nclaims of the Bible are wrong. Fundamentalism FAILED us. The authors \nof Babinski's book discovered alternatives, which they found to be \nmore realistic, fulfilling and moral than Christian fundamentalism. \nAt the same time, it's just so easy for fundamentalists to blame the \nvictims of fundamentalism rather than be adults and responsibly admit \nthat there are SERIOUS problems with fundamentalism and its \ninterpretations of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy moral life has not changed since I left Christianity, so there's \nno evidence that I left because of any \"love for the world.\" Indeed, \na person would have to be insane to turn down a REAL offer for \neternal paradise. I would like nothing better than to have eternal \nlife, but conclusive evidence (some of which is presented in this \nbook) says it's an illusion. Therefore, I prefer to be an honest \nagnostic with a clear conscience than a frustrated and self-deceived \nBible fundamentalist.\u0014",

But it was a conversation with the infamous Attila the Hun \nand the Vandal general that probably did his cause the most good.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo more \"first among equals\"\u0014\nBy the time history is aware of Leo, he was a proud nobleman of Roman \nor Tucsan heritage. (As pope he forbade the elevation to bishop of \nany former slaves, as \"such baseness\" would pollute the Holy \nservice.) He was an influential deacon deeply involved in civil and \necclesiastical affairs, and he opposed heresy. Leo convinced Pope \nCelestus I to hear his brief against the Nestorians, and he helped to \nstiffen Pope Sixtus I's resolve against Pelagians.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis succession to the papacy came \"as a matter of course.\" In his \nelevation address, he sounded a major theme of his reign: the primacy \nof the \"Chair of Peter\" above all other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The firmness given by Christ the rock to him who himself was made \nthe rock passes to his heirs,\" he argued, \"and wherever their \nfirmness appears, the power of the Shepherd is manifest.\" Leo \nabandoned the traditional doctrine that the bishop of Rome was \"first \namong equals\" and declared that he spoke as Peter: \"Believe that it \nis he himself, whom in our office we represent, who is speaking.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthority of Peter\u0014\nAs pope, Leo continued to fight heresy and, at the same time, to \nextend his authority. In 443 he disciplined Hilary of Arles, who was \noutside imperial borders, for practicing too much independence, and \nin 445 he gained imperial recognition of his rights inside the \nempire: \"As the primacy of the apostolic see is based on the title of \nthe blessed Peter,  no illicit steps may be taken against this see \nto usurp its authority.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next few years, he talked Emperor Valentinian III into \nenforcing civil penalties against the Manichaeans. Similarly, the \nbishop of Spain began stamping out the Priscillians at Leo's request. \nHis most important case began as an appeal by a monk accused of \nteaching that Christ had only a divine naturethe Monophysite heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo repudiated the monk, Eutyches, in a long letter (the \"Tome of \nLeo\") and appealed to Emperor Marcianan old friend who had just \nassumed officeto call a church council. More than 500 bishops \ngathered at Chalcedon, a suburb of Constantinople, in 453. They \ncondemned Eutyches and denounced the Monophysities.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Canon 28 did not please Leo: it gave the bishop of Constantinople \nthe title of \"patriarch\" and made his office second only to the \nbishop of Rome. With the emperor residing in Constantinople and most \nChristians living in the East, Leo reasoned it was only natural that \nthe influence of the bishop of Constantinople would grow. Leo simply \nrefused to recognize the canon.\u0014\n\u0014\nFacing down the conquerors\u0014\nDuring these years, the empire in the West was crumbling, and \n\"barbarian\" armies were taking advantage of Rome's weakness. In 452, \nwhen the Huns threatened Rome, Leo went out to meet their leader, \nAttila, \"the Scourge of God,\" and convinced him to withdraw to beyond \nthe Danube.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen three years later, the Vandal general Gaiseric marched on Rome, \nRoman soldiers panicked, murdered the emperor, and fled the city. Leo \nmet with Gaiseric and begged for mercy, noting that the city had \nfallen without a struggle and that only civilians remained. He asked \nthat the Vandal not slaughter the people nor burn their homes. \nGaiseric listened silently, then spurred his horse away, calling over \nhis shoulder, \"Fourteen days looting.\" Two weeks later the Romans \nheld a solemn service of thanksgiving for the city having been spared.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeo's leadership in these political crises helped begin the long \nprocess by which the bishop of Rome became the most powerful Western \nfigure in the Middle Ages. This, along with his vigorous pursuit of \ndoctrinal purity and administrative savvy, have led to his being \ncalled, with only two other popes, \"the Great.\"\u0014",

    "title": "LET THE PAGANS HAVE THE HOLIDAY",
    "words": "Let the Pagans Have the Holiday\u0014\nFirst, let's take back Easter.\u0014\nRodney Clapp | posted 12/11/2007\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article was originally published in the December 13, 1993 issue \nof Christianity Today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is time to recognize that a new tradition has been added to \nChristmas. As surely as trees and lights and reindeer, December now \nbrings Christian complaints about the secularization of the holiday. \nT-shirts and posters and preachers declare, \"Jesus Is the Reason for \nthe Season,\" but their protests are drowned in the commercial deluge.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas is ruled not from Jerusalem or Rome or Wheaton or any other \nreligious center, but from Madison Avenue and Wall Street. In a \nrevealing symbolic act, President George [H.W.] Bush two years ago \ninaugurated the season not, mind you, in a church, but in a shopping \nmall. There he bought some socks and reminded Americans their true \nChristmas responsibility is not veneration but consumption.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo some, Christmas also seems less Christian because many of the \nnation's institutions are less and less willing to prop up the \nchurch. So some disgruntled believersmisguidedly, by my estimatedo \nbattle with various courthouses that no longer allow crches on their \nlawns.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes outsiders glimpse our own dilemma more acutely than we can. \nLast Christmas, Rabbi Lawrence Hoffman wrote an article in Cross \nCurrents entitled, \"Being a Jew at Christmas Time.\" In it he \nobserved, \"There is nothing wrong with sleigh bells, Bing Crosby, and \nChristmas pudding, but I should hope Christians would want more than \njust that, and as Christmas becomes more and more secularized, I am \nnot sure they get it.\" He went on: \"In the end, the problem of \nChristmas is not mine any more than Christmas itself is. The real \nChristmas challenge belongs to Christians: how to take Christmas out \nof the secularized public domain and move it back into the religious \nsphere once again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rabbi is right on both counts. For Christians, Christmas \ndefinitely loses somethingin fact, loses its coreas it gets more \nand more secular. But the solution is not to worry over courthouse \ncrches: The real Christmas challenge belongs to Christians. The \nchurch and not city hall is charged with witnessing to the gospel and \nremembering to the world the birth of Jesus Christ.\u0014\nSeasonal humbug\u0014\n\u0014\nHere I want to suggest that Christians may best reclaim Christmas, \nindirectly, by first reclaiming Easter. Ours is an ironic faith, one \nthat trains its adherents to see strength in weakness. The irony at \nhand could be that a secularizing culture has shown us something \nimportant by devaluing Christmas. In a way, Christians have valued \nChristmas too much and in the wrong way. I defer again to Hoffman, \nwho writes,\u0014\n\u0014\n    Historians tell us that Christmas was not always the cultural \nfulcrum that balances Christian life. There was a time when \nChristians knew that the paschal mystery of death and resurrection \nwas the center of Christian faith. It was Easter that really \nmattered, not Christmas. Only in the consumer-conscious nineteenth \ncentury did Christmas overtake Easter, becoming the centerpiece of \npopular piety. Madison Avenue marketed the change, and then colluded \nwith the entertainment industry to boost Christmas to its current \ncalendrical prominence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible, of course, knows nothing of the designated holidays we \ncall Easter or Christmas. But each holiday celebrates particular \nevents, and there can be no doubt which set of events receives the \nmost scriptural emphasis.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is well known that all four Gospels build toward and focus on the \nevents leading up to and including what we commemorate at Easter. \nOne-quarter to one-half the chapters in each of the four Gospels deal \nwith Easter events. Clearly, the gospel traditions see these as the \ncrucial episodes, the events that identify and ratify Jesus as God's \nMessiah, In fact, two of the four Gospels (Mark and John) have no \nbirth, or Christmas, narratives. This means certain of the earliest \nChristian communities knew no Christmas (at least, not from their \nbasic texts). To put it another way, we could be Christians without \nthe stories of Christmas, but not without the stories of Easter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rest of the New Testament does not deviate from this pattern. The \nearliest recorded Christian sermon (in Acts 2) proclaims the Easter \nmessage of the world's Savior crucified and then raised by Israel's \nGod. And what can we say of Paul, who nowhere speaks of Jesus' birth, \nbut everywhere heralds \"Jesus Christ and him crucified\" (1 Cor. 2:2) \nand warns that \"if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is \nin vain and your faith is in vain\" (15:14)?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo this day, Christian worship is marked by Easter more than by \nChristmas. Consider the sacraments (or ordinances, if you prefer). \nBaptism is baptism into Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. As \nPaul writes, \"We have been buried with him by baptism into death, so \nthat, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the \nFather, so we too might walk in newness of life\" (Rom. 6:4, NRSV). \nCelebrating the Eucharist, or Communion, includes rich themes drawing \nboth from Christ's passion and his resurrection. And of course, we \ngather to worship on the day of the Lord's rising, so that Christians \nfor centuries have thought of each Sunday as a \"little Easter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe recovery of Easter as our pivotal holy day may best be served by \na recovery of the Christian calendar, complete with the cycle of \nseasons that recall the gospel from Advent to Christmas to Epiphany \nto Lent to Easter and Pentecost. The calendar, like the gospel \nnarrative, builds toward and pivots around the focal events of \nChrist's passion and Easter. Recognizing the liturgical year is a \nlarge step toward seeing Easter as the main Christian holiday.\u0014\nChristmas re-envisioned\u0014\n\u0014\nIn calling Christians to return to the Christian calendar and return \nEaster to its rightful prominence, I am not implying that the events \nof Christmas are trivial or untrue. The nativity stories help us to \nremember key and glorious truths, such as the Incarnation. But surely \nEaster, and not the Christmas on which we modern Western Christians \nfocus most of our attention, is the \"fulcrum that balances Christian \nlife.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas celebrated without the events of Easter overshadowing is \ntoo easily sentimentalized and secularized. A baby in a manger, \nangels hovering overhead, cattle lowing nearbysurely this idyllic \nworld needs no redemption. A dechristianized Christmas is the \nultimate Pelagian holiday; for at what other time of the year can we \nseem so certain that, merely with good feelings and good will, \nhumanity can save itself? Annually, in fact, newspaper editorials and \ntelevision commentators say exactly that, pleading that all the world \nneeds is to spread Christmas cheer through the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut EasterEaster is on the other side of a cross with nails, of \nconfrontation and beatings and death, and then, only then, \nresurrection and new life. Christmas we can too easily teach to our \nkids (and ourselves) without blinking, free of strain or discomfort \n(provided we gloss, as we usually do, such details as Herod's \nslaughter of the innocents). Easter is harder, for it requires facing \ndeath, the shortcomings of the disciples, the bloody lengths God must \ngo to in order to rescue a confused, hateful world from itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this is to say we have worried about Christmas too much. \nChristians in an indifferent and even hostile society need to learn \ncultural jujitsuto sometimes let the culture push at points where it \nwants to, and there collapse of its own momentum. This is especially \nimportant in our cultural situation, where resistance is so easily \nitself turned into a marketable commodity. T-shirts and bumper \nstickers proclaiming \"Jesus Is the Reason for the Season\" make the \nmessage itself into a consumer item.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo let the pagans have Christmas as their most significant holiday. \nEaster is the central Christian holiday. And when we are known for \nour Easter, then we will have our Christmas back.\u0014\n\u0014\nRodney Clapp is an editor with Brazos Press, an imprint of Baker Book \nHouse.

    "words": "What God offers Gods people is a reason to live life abundantly and \nwith\u0014\njoy. Yet, how often do we take the joy and delight of human life, \nespecially\u0014\nthe Christian life, and then turn the good news into a set of rules\u0014\nand regulations? For example, Johns Gospel (chapter nine) tells the\u0014\nsuperb story of the man who was born blind.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years I have come to the conclusion that this story is a \nsterling\u0014\nexample of how religious types regularly miss the joy that Gods\u0014\nmiracles might create among us. In the story, Jesus heals a man blind \nfrom\u0014\nbirth. Not one character in the story praises God or rejoices in the \nblind\u0014\nmans good fortune of regaining sight. In an account that should \nproduce\u0014\nthanksgiving and praise to God, the story mainly relates how the \nneighbors,\u0014\nthe parents, and the religious authorities each demand an explanation\u0014\nabout how the miracle took place or who performed the amazing\u0014\nwork. No one stops to marvelthey only criticize and probe the \nmiracles\u0014\ncause. How often does this describe our attitude toward God working in\u0014\nus and among us?\u0014",

    "title": "LOSING YOUR RELIGION",
    "words": "Several years ago, I noticed something peculiar happening to me, as \nwell as many of my friends and colleagues in the church. It wasn't \nthat we were getting older - or slower - or, in my case, grayer on \ntop. No, something more subtle was happening. \u0014\n\u0014\nI NOTICED WORDS WALKING OUT ON ME. Good, strong words that caressed, \nnurtured, and supported me nearly all my life; the same words that \nhad shaped a vision and given form to my hopes had slowly slipped \naway. And I let them go. Words like: holiness, righteousness, \nevangelism, charismatic, even the word gospel - one by one a steady \nstream of life-shaping and life-giving words walked out the screen \ndoor of my house of faith. After a while I learned to live without \nthem, and so did most of my friends and colleagues; better, we \nthought, than to be misunderstood as a religious nut.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe estrangement didn't occur overnight; broken faith never does. \nSlowly, these perfectly good, strong Biblical words just walked right \nout the door and I let them go. I, the disenchanted lover, let these \nonce beloved words stroll away. I barely said goodbye when I heard \nthe screen door slam behind them. How did I know that I had lost \nthem? I knew it when I found myself wincing with embarrassment each \ntime I said one of them in public. The strange thing is I noticed \nthese faithful words being sent out of other Christian homes. The \nwords that once seduced us with holy vigor into the community of \nfaith, but that are now banished from our lips, are welcomed as \nrefugees into the glad embrace of those who turn words to wood, and \nthen use them as weapons against others. It hurts the most when I \nhear these beloved banished words rolling smoothly off the tongues of \nChristians who have stripped them from their contexts and use them \nfor personal gain. And we who let the words of life go into the arms \nof their exploiters are tongue-tied and unable to say a word of \npersonal faith because we have lost the words that sing us home.\u0014\n\u0014\nWE WHISPER \"EVANGELISM\" AS IF IT WERE THE PRACTICE OF SOME STRANGE, \nANCIENT CULT, NOT THE JOYFUL PROCLAMATION OF THE GOOD NEWS. We've \nforgotten that evangelists were simply those who went about telling \nstories of glad tidings of God's all embracing love. Holiness sounds \nto our ears hopelessly arcane. We don't even know how to say \"Jesus\" \nwithout worrying that someone will think we belong to Jerry Falwell's \nclub. So, sadly, the old words hang from the walls of faith like \nbearded-elders to kindle a nostalgic feeling of the way things used \nto be.\u0014\n\u0014\nI suspect the loss of Biblical language signals something deeper than \nthe loss of poetry. Of course, poets without words are a sorry lot, \nand isn't that what the tellers of Good News are - poets? I suspect \nthat the old words left me because my faith was faltering and being \nreplaced by a culturally accommodating civil religion. Regardless of \nthe cause, I am in recovery and have been for years. I want to \nrecover the words that gave us life and formed us in a lively, \nrisk-taking faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Roy Howard, Presbyterian minister, St. Mark Presbyterian Church, \nRockville, MD  2002\u0014",

    "title": "LIVING AND DYING IN BIBLICAL TEXTS",
    "words": "The sense of order that permeates Genesis 1 returns to prominence in \nGods dealings with Noah. The reminder of Gods order cannot be \nforgotten, despite the corruption of humanity.23 The reversal of \ncreation reflected in the language of Genesis 7 is carefully balanced \nby the rhythmic instructions for preparing the ark.24 Chaos and order \nare in conflict here. The violence of humanity brings about chaos, \nwhile the violence of God creates the way for a new sense of order. \nGods pain and anger are unleashed against the world in a torrent, \nbut creation is maintained in a tiny box that moves along the face \nof the waters (7:18) just as Gods creative spirit did (1:2). Gods \nresponse to human violence is to clear the earth for a new start, a \nsecond try at creation that will begin from this microcosm of Genesis \n1 that God and Noah have carefully constructed in a box. God \nremembers Noah (8:1).25 But the tension between destruction and \nre-creation is not fully overcome. Most troubling is the awareness \nwithin the text, and in our own experience, that the flood utterly \nfails in its purpose. Evil persists. It cannot be drowned. Violence \ncannot defeat itself. How does God not know this?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the post-Deluvian world, death and violence are immediately given \ntheir proper place. Noah slaughters animals to please God with \nsacrifice in 8:20, and God recognizes the inherent sinfulness of \nhumans and repents from a destructive response in 8:21. God expands \nthe diets of his creatures to include meat, which will require \nkilling, in 9:3, and places limits on the eating of blood and the \nkilling of human beings in 9:5-6. Even the latter prohibition is \nstated in vengeful terms. Is God acknowledging here that the \npunishment of Cain was too light? If Cain had received death as \npunishment, would that have halted the increase of violence in the \nworld?26 Danger and untimely death will certainly be part of this new \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisharmony and rivalry quickly reenter the human community in another \nstrange story in 9:20-29. This story is filled with disconcerting \nelements. A son, Canaan, is cursed for the crime of his father, Ham. \nUnless we are to understand that Ham raped the sleeping Noah, which \nis a possible euphemistic understanding of saw the nakedness, there \nis no apparent, serious wrongdoing. The reader is surely intended to \nunderstand that the figures in this story represent groups of \npeopleSemite, Hamite, Canaanite. The world of Genesis quickly \ndivides itself into territories and people groups, among which there \nare great ethnic animosities. This is the first time one human curses \nanother (9:25) and the first time slavery is mentioned (9:27) in the \nBible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lines of division are spelled out in the genealogy of Genesis 10. \nThe most troubling aspect of this story and the genealogical result \nis the racial ordering of society.27 Modupe Oduyoye correctly \nidentified this as an ideological story. It explains and justifies \nthe subjection of the descendants of Ham by their white neighbors.28 \nSuch ideology presents tremendous difficulties for the modern reader, \nparticularly when it justifies violence. To what extent should the \nreader be drawn into the story? When the story allows or even \npromotes racism, may a faithful reader assume her or his own autonomy \nover against the text?\u0014\n\u0014\n                                ...Mark McEntire from \"Dangerous \nWorlds\" Smith & Helwys\u0014",

    "words": "Such a vision of prayer is inspiring and empowering. It can bolster \nour faith and raise our flagging spirits. And yet, I confess, it \ndoesnt entirely sit well with me. When I unpack the teaching, I \nconfront some unsettling questions.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it mean, for instance, that if we dont pray hard enough, the \nprayer wont be answered? If a loved one dies of cancer, are we \npartly to blame for the paucity of our prayer? Do these teachings \ninsinuate that if only we had prayed harder, God would have granted \nthe requested healing and our loved one would have lived?\u0014\n\u0014\nTheologically, these teachings suggest some odd notions about God. \nAre Gods love, mercy, and healing conditional on our relentless \neffort? Does God withhold the answer to prayer until we have \nsuccessfully reached or exceeded some litmus test of persistence? Is \nGod somehow measuring our prayer until it reaches a magic point of \nsufficiency  like the Wizard of Oz demanding that Dorothy and her \ncompanions pass some grueling tests before their wishes are granted?\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of which would be a fairly stunted theology of grace.

    "title": "LEAVING RELIGION, FOLLOWING JESUS",
    "words": "That was one heck of a sermon, preacher. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo went the word of encouragement passed on to my good friend at the \nconclusion of an especially inspiring Sunday morning sermon. The \nyoung man paying the compliment was a diesel mechanic named Terry. \nTerry came to church every Sunday with grease still under his \nfingernails, tattoos peeking out from beneath his cut-off sleeves, \nand his best tattered jeans hugging his hips. Of course this did not \nmean Terry failed to recognize a good sermon when he heard one, even \nif his praise was a bit unorthodox. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeaming from ear to ear, pumping the pastors hand, the young man was \nhappy to attend this little church to hear good sermons and pursue \nhis newfound relationship with Christ. It had not always been so. \nTerrys story is one of glorious conversion, like something youd \nhear at a Billy Graham crusade. Drug abuse, alcoholism, failed \nrelationships: he had suffered from and caused more than his fair \nshare of disaster. Then, by Gods grace, it all turned around. Terry \ncame running to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy friend, his pastor, was instrumental in the transformation. He \nserved as a spiritual guide to Terry, helping him sort out his past \nbaggage, pointing him forward, and allowing the rough edges to \nremain. After all, God looks at a persons heart, not the grease \nunder his fingernails. If only people could do the same. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne Wednesday evening, Terry was running late for the churchs weekly \nBible study. He came straight from work. No shower, no shave, no \nchange of clothes. He came like that old hymn we often sing: Just as \nI Am. A self-appointed delegation met Terry in the parking lot on \nthis particular night. The group told Terry that should he wish to \ncontinue to be a part of the church, it was time he learned to dress \nright, cover those devilish tattoos, and clean up his language. \u0014\n\u0014\nTerrys reaction was expected. He was crushed. Bible in hand, he \nreturned to his truck, drove away, and never came back. The chances \nof him giving church another shot are slim to none. Who could blame \nhim?\u0014\n\u0014\nMy friend discovered the wrongdoing against Terry after the fact, \nwhen Terrys usual seat in worship was inexplicably vacant. To his \ncredit, my friend no longer pastors that church.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestion: Why wont some people go to church? \u0014\n\u0014\nAnswer: Because they have been to church. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus intentionally broke the rules and customs of the religious \nestablishment of his day, not for the sake of rebellion, but to \nreveal how preposterous it was to hold to meaningless rules. Strict \nlegalism that misses the point of Gods grace and freedom in Christ \nis more than preposterous. It is grotesquely sinful.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom: Leaving Religion, Following Jesus\u0014\nby Ronnie McBrayer\u0014",

    "words": "Convicted Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy once gave a lecture \non a college campus in Missouri. Throughout the evening, Liddy -- who \nhad just been released from prison -- harangued his audience with the \nidea that only force, brute strength, and an iron will could earn the \nrespect of friends and foes in this \"real world which is, in fact, a \nvery tough neighborhood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the question-and-answer period, one of the college professors \nrose to speak. Rather timidly, he objected: \"In our country, most \npeople... after all... do base their ethics on... the teachings of \nJesus... and this doesn't sound much like the teachings of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLiddy is said to have glared for a moment before taking in a deep \nbreath and bellowing: \"Yeah -- and look what happened to Jesus. They \ncrucified him.\" To him, the case was closed. The audience responded \nto his putdown with laughter and thunderous applause.\u0014\n\u0014\nG. Gordon Liddy was absolutely right. Jesus stood before the \nterrible, destructive power of Rome in courageous, virtuous silence. \nAnd that power rose up and crushed him. To the likes of G. Gordon \nLiddy -- and Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas, and Herod -- that should have \nbeen the end of the story. But it wasn't the end. There was another \npower at work in the life -- and the death -- of Jesus of Nazareth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat creative, life-giving power began its work in the cool silence \nof the tomb. That power worked much more rapidly on that occasion \nthan it habitually does in our world. A mere three days later, life \ncoursed through Jesus' veins again, and he rose up and walked. Ever \nsince that day, the power of life has continued to contend with the \npower of death.\u0014",

    "title": "LITTLE KNOW FACTS ABOUT FRANCIS OF ASSISI",
    "words": "Francis of \nAssisi: Did You Know? \u0014\n\u0014\nLittle-known or remarkable facts about Francis of Assisi \u0014\nMark Galli is managing editor of Christian History. | posted 4/01/1994\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis was originally named Giovanni, or John, after John the \nBaptist. His father was in France on business when his son was born, \nand upon his return he renamed him Francescothe little Frenchman.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he was young, Francis tried to become a knight, and he fought in \na battle against Assisis rival city, Perugia. (Francis was captured \nand imprisoned for a year.) Later he set out to join another army, \nbut he received a dream that instructed him to return home and seek a \ndifferent calling.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis severely disciplined himself against temptations of the \nflesh. In winter, he would sometimes hurl himself into a ditch full \nof ice and remain there until every vestige of sinful temptation had \ndeparted. To avoid lust, he avoided talking with women. When he was \nrequired to speak with one, he fixed his gaze on the ground or sky.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis observed literally Jesus command to take no thought for the \nmorrow. He would not allow the cook of his Order even to soak \nvegetables overnight for cooking the next day.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his preaching, Francis spoke bluntly about sin and the need to \nrepent. He denounced evil whenever he found it, wrote one early \nbiographer, and made no effort to palliate it; from him a life of \nsin met with outspoken rebuke, not support. He spoke with equal \ncandor to great and small.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis may have been the first person to create a living nativity \nscene. On Christmas Eve 1223, in order to set before our bodily eyes \nhow he [Jesus] lay in a manger, Francis and companions worshiped in \na cave, surrounded by the traditional oxen, sheep, and donkeys.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Francis was known for his infectious joy, he abhorred \nlaughing and idle words. His companion Brother Leo wrote, Not only \ndid he wish that he should not laugh, but that he should not even \nafford to others the slightest occasion for laughing.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven though Francis preached against the sins of the church \nhierarchy, he had deep respect for clergy. Those who sin against \nthem, he once said, commit a greater sin than [if they sinned] \nagainst all other people of this world.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranciss ministry to lepers and his severe lifestyle led to his \npremature death. For example, he often slept sitting up, usually \noutdoors on the ground; he customarily fasted the forty days of Lent, \nas well as many other times. At the end, he was blind, diseased, and \nemaciated. He probably died from tuberculoid leprosyin his \nmid-forties.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince Communion so powerfully demonstrated Christs sacrificial love, \nFrancis implored his friars to show all possible reverence for it. As \nfor his own experience, one early biographer wrote, The presence of \nthe Immaculate Lamb used to take him out of himself, so that he was \noften lost in ecstasy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis was the first person in history to receive the stigmata, \nChrist-like wounds, in his feet, hands, and side.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrancis instructed his friars to avoid learning and scholarship \nbecause such activities tempt one to substitute knowledge about God \nfor knowing God. Within fifty years of his death, however, his order \nhad within it some of the worlds most learned men, including \ntheologian Bonaventure and philosopher-scientist Roger Bacon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Franciscan Order, counting all its branches, is the largest \nreligious order in the Roman Catholic Church today.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was often reported that wild animalsrabbits, birds, even a \nwolfbecame tame before Francis. He especially cared for animals that \nwere associated with Christ. If he saw a lamb being led off to \nslaughter, he would try to rescue it by pleading or trading for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nLord, Make Me an Instrument of Thy Peace, sometimes called The \nPrayer of Saint Francis, was not written by Francisthough it does \nembody his spirit. It was probably composed at a Catholic congress in \nChicago, in 1925.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Francis revered all creatures, he was not a vegetarian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Francis died, the head of his order feared people would steal \nhis body. So he buried Franciss coffin beneath the main altar in the \nBasilica of Saint Francisunder a slab of granite, gravel, ten welded \nbands of iron, a 190-pound grill, and finally a 200-pound rock. The \nplan worked: the coffin wasnt discovered until last century.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1994 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

    "title": "LUTHER POSTWED 95 THESES ON CHURCH DOOR",
    "words": "October 31, 1517 \u0014\nLuther Posted 95 Theses\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the little town of Wittenberg, Germany,on this day, October 31, \n1517, a priest nailed a challenge to debate on the church door. No \none may have noticed then, but within the week, copies of his theses \nwould be discussed throughout the surrounding regions; and within a \ndecade, Europe itself was shaken by his simple act. Later generations \nwould mark martin Luther's nailing of the 95 theses on the church \ndoor as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, but what did \nLuther think he was doing at the time? To answer this question, we \nneed to understand a little about Luther's own spiritual journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man in Germany at the beginning of the sixteenth century, \nLuther was studying law at the university. One day he was caught in a \nstorm and was almost killed by lightening. He cried out to St. Anne \nand promised God he would become a monk. In 1505, Luther entered the \nAugustinian monastery, and in 1507 became a priest. His monastic \nleaders sent him to Rome in 1510, but Luther was disenchanted with \nthe ritualism and dead faith he found in the papal city. There was \nnothing in Rome to mend his despairing spirit or settle his restless \nsoul. He seemed so cut off from God, and nowhere could he find a cure \nfor his malady.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was bright, and his superiors soon had him teaching \ntheology in the university. In 1515, he began teaching Paul's epistle \nto the Romans. Slowly, Paul's words in Romans began to break through \nthe gloom of Luther's soul. Luther wrote\u0014\n\u0014\nMy situation was that, although an impeccable monk, I stood before \nGod as a sinner troubled in conscience, and I had no confidence that \nmy merit would assuage him. Night and day I pondered until I saw the \nconnection between the justice of God and the statement 'the just \nshall live by faith.' Then I grasped that the justice of God is that \nrighteousness by which through grace and sheer mercy God justifies us \nthrough faith. Thereupon I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone \nthrough open doors into paradise. The whole of Scripture took on a \nnew meaning...This passage of Paul became to me a gate to heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe more Luther's eyes were opened by his study of Romans, the more \nhe saw the corruption of the church in his day. The glorious truth of \njustification by faith alone had become buried under a mound of \ngreed, corruption, and false teaching. Most galling was the practice \nof indulgences -- the certificates the church provided, for a fee, \nsupposedly to shorten one's stay in Purgatory. The pope was \nencouraging the sale of indulgences. He planned to use the money to \nhelp pay for the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Tetzel was one of the indulgence sellers in Luther's vicinity. \nHe used little advertising jingles to encourage people to buy his \nwares: \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from \npurgatory springs.\" Once Luther realized the sufficiency of Christ's \nsacrifice alone for our sins, he found such practices revolting. The \nmore he studied the Scriptures, the more he saw the need of showing \nthe church how it had strayed from the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on this day, October 31, 1517, he posted a list of 95 \npropositions on the church door in Wittenberg. In his day, this was \nthe means of inviting scholars to debate important issues. No one \ntook up Luther's challenge to debate at that time, but once news of \nhis proposals became known, many began to discuss the issue Luther \nraised that salvation was by faith in Christ's work alone. Luther \napparently at first expected the pope to agree with his position, \nsince it was based on Scripture; but in 1520, the Pope issued a \ndecree condemning Luther's views. Luther publicly burned the papal \ndecree. With that act, he also burned his bridges behind him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBainton, Roland. Here I Stand.

    "words": "Lincoln's Thanksgiving Proclamation\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1863, in the midst of a terrible civil war which had already taken \nhundreds of thousands of lives, President Lincoln issued a \nthanksgiving message. Drafted by Secretary Seward, the document \nbecame the model for many similar presidential messages over the \ncentury and a half that followed; for this was the original \nobservance of Thanksgiving Day on the last Thursday of November.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis year, as in most years, bad news has dominated the airwaves. Not \nleast was the suffering (and sometimes shameful behavior) that \naccompanied the hurricane season's great storms. Rather than dwell on \nthe negative, however, we need to pause once again to follow the \nexample of Lincoln and his cabinet, remembering the blessings which \nGod has heaped upon us.\u0014\n\u0014\n          By the President of the United States of America. A \nProclamation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the \nblessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, \nwhich are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the \nsource from which they come, others have been added, which are of so \nextraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften \neven the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful \nprovidence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled \nmagnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States \nto invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved \nwith all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been \nrespected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in \nthe theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly \ncontracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful \ndiversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful \nindustry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the \nshuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our \nsettlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the \nprecious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. \u0014\n\u0014\nPopulation has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has \nbeen made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the \ncountry, rejoicing in the consiousness of augmented strength and \nvigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large \nincrease of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any \nmortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious \ngifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for \nour sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit \nand proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully \nacknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American \nPeople. \u0014\n\u0014\nI do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United \nStates, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in \nforeign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November \nnext, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father \nwho dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while \noffering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular \ndeliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for \nour national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender \ncare all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers \nin the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, \nand fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal \nthe wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be \nconsistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, \nharmony, tranquillity and Union.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal \nof the United States to be affixed.\u0014\n\u0014\nDone at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the \nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of \nthe Independence of the Unites States the Eighty-eighth.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the President: Abraham Lincoln\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam H.

In the sequence \nof the use of these three words in 32:5 we see the increase in the \nseriousness of the type of sin from one word for sin to another. \nFirst the psalmist acknowledged the lowest level of sin: the failure \nto please God even when we try. Then the psalmist admitted that the \npsalmist had moved to the second level of sin: breaking the rules \nthat God had established to be helpful to Gods people. Finally, the \npsalmist confessed the most serious sin of all: attempted violent \ninsurrection against God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs is typical in Israelite Individual Hymns of Praise, Psalm 32 tries \nto teach to all who will hear the wisdom of acknowledging ones sins \nto the Lord.

    "words": "December 9, 1621 \u0014\nLayman Robert Cushman's Famous Sermon\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pilgrims at Plymouth colony were afraid. An Indian had just \nreported a white sail off Cape Cod. Was this a French raider from \nCanada? Miles Standish armed the men and they prepared to meet any \nassault. Great was their relief when the ship turned out to be the \nFortune, an English vessel bringing more colonists. While many of the \nnewcomers were not Pilgrims, one of the men who disembarked from the \nboat had been a leader in Leyden, the Dutch city where the Puritans \npreviously lived in exile. This was the deacon, Robert Cushman.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert had come to straighten out affairs in the colony. The men who \nhad put up the money to finance the settlement were angry that the \nship Mayflower had been kept so long by the Pilgrims--and then sent \nhome empty. The colonists might well have loaded it with timber at \nleast! The company wanted a return on their investments. And they \nwanted some amended articles signed, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Plymouth, settlers were sick of the company policy of \nshare-and-share-alike. Some demanded that the land be parceled as in \nprivate chunks. Robert warned them strongly against this kind of \ntalk, and said their backers were in no mood to be trifled with. If \nthe colonists hoped for future supplies, they must agree to company \nterms.\u0014\n\u0014\nOddly enough for such a religious group, there was no ordained \nminister among their number. Robert Cushman, a deacon, was the \nnearest thing. To settle the jealousies and animosities among the \nsettlers, he preached a sermon on this day, December 9, 1621. This \nwas the first recorded sermon on American soil and the first printed \nthere. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was titled, \"A Sermon Preached at Plimmoth in New England, \nDecember 9, 1621 in an Assemblie of his Majesties faithful Subjects, \nthere inhabiting. Wherein is shewed the danger of selfe love, and the \nsweetnesse of true Friendship. Together with a Preface, shewing the \nstate of the Country, and Condition of the Savages.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert quoted Paul's words to the quarreling Corinthians as an \nexample for the disgruntled settlers. Let no man seek his own, but \nevery man another's wealth (1 Corinthians 10:24). \"The occasion of \nthese words of the Apostle Paul, was because of the abuses which were \nin the Church of Corinth. Which abuses arose chiefly through swelling \npride, self-love and conceitedness..\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"...it is lawful sometimes for men to gather wealth, and grow rich, \neven as there was a time for Joseph to store up corn, but a godly and \nsincere Christian will see when this time is, and will not hoard up \nwhen he seeth others of his brethren and associates to want, but then \nis a time, if he have anything to fetch out and disperse it..\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"...you must seek still the wealth of one another..\" he reminded them \nand pointed out that it was in their self interest to do so, for, \n\"Even as we deal with others, ourselves and others shall be dealt \nwithal.. for it is the merciful that shall obtain mercy..\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe settlers listened to Robert. Not only did they sign the despised \narticles, but they filled the Fortune with wood and furs. Robert \nsailed for England. Unfortunately, the ship was seized by French \nprivateers, who stripped it of everything of value. Robert was freed, \nbut the colony would not pay for itself for a while yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nCushman, Robert. \"The Sin and Danger of Self Love.\" Mayflower Web \nPages. http://members.aol.com/calebj/sermon.html\u0014\nHeinsohn, Robert Jennings. \"Robert Cushman, the Man who would have \nsigned the Compact but couldn't.\" \nhttp://www.sail1620.org/history/articles/ cushman.html. \u0014\nWillison, George F.

And so, in an act of \nsisterly love and selfless courage, Anaiah pushed her little sister \nto safety and took the full impact herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe had just one thought, she said Wednesday; her little sister was \ntoo young to be hit like this, and if she got hit she wouldnt hardly \nbe alive. She would be probably gone forever. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet that brave big sister, who lost a leg and nearly her life that \nday, does not believe that she is a hero. I feel like one, but I \nreally didnt deserve to be one, Anaiah told Ann Curry on TODAY.

Because of Anaiahs \nquick action, Camry was safe. But Anaiah herself was near death as \nher mother raced to her side.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I got to her, she wasnt breathing, Taylor said. She didnt \nhave a pulse or anything, so I was screaming, calling for help and \nasking anybody just to call the ambulance.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin moments, the school bus arrived and the driver began \nperforming CPR on the stricken girl. I instructed her mom to hold \nher head while I gave mouth-to-mouth, chest compressions, driver \nLoretta Berryman told NBC News in a prerecorded segment. As she took \na breath, my first thing was, Thank God. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnaiah spent the next three weeks in the hospital, and still faces a \nlong and arduous recovery. She suffered a broken neck and a damaged \nspleen; she lost a kidney and broke both of her legs so badly that \nthe left one could not be saved. She was wearing a cervical collar as \nshe appeared on TODAY with her mother and sister.\u0014\n\u0014\nA heros homecoming \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Anaiah lay in the hospital, word of her courageous act spread. And \nwhen she finally came home, it was to a heros welcome: Neighbors \nlined the streets to cheer her. Smiling shyly, 5-year-old Camry \nsummed up the feelings of all of those admirers in a few simple \nwords: I think she saved my life, she told Curry.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days since the accident, that support has been unflagging, \nTaylor said, and it has included efforts to help the unemployed \nmother meet the ever-mounting medical bills for her daughters \ntreatment. Our community has been wonderful. Theyve been very \nsupportive since day one of the accident, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven now, as Anaiah begins the long road to rehabilitation from an \narray of injuries that will forever change her life, she has no \nsecond thoughts about risking her own life to save the life of her \nbeloved sibling. Shes like my friend, Anaiah said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that, said her mother, shows that for all of the terrible \ninjuries she suffered, the most important part of Anaiah came through \nthe accident unscathed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnaiah has a really, really big heart, Andrea Taylor said. She \nwould have done it for someone else. But for her sister, she loved \nher so much she just couldnt imagine life without her.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd for that, I will forever be grateful to her.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2011 MSNBC Interactive\u0014",

There, he said, \npointing: that light brown scar marks the \\tornado's path. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter studying it in silence, he snapped a few photographs with a \ncellphone that had in its memory another photograph, sent to him just \nhours earlier, of a one-story brick house that had been all but \ndestroyed by that same tornado. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis house. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis name is Corey Soper, and he is 33. He lives just outside \nTuscaloosa, but works as a welder on a pipeline in Nevada, because \nthat is where the work is. Now, after a heart-pounding day of \nworrying from a distance for the safety of his wife and two young \nchildren, he was coming home to a broken house, clutching a blue \nluggage ticket that represented the only clothes he had left. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet he considered himself lucky, so very lucky. His family is \nsafe, he said, his voice tight. And now we can build new memories. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor days now, those not in the path of the dozens of tornadoes that \nspun mayhem and death across several states on Wednesday have mostly \nexperienced it through aerial photographs and film footage that tend \nto blend into one dispassionate tableau of destruction: stripped \nfoundations, upside-down cars, bits of wood and brick that once were \nhomes.

    "words": "June 14, 390 \u0014\n\u0014\nLutherans Honor Gregory Nyssa\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn front of Gregory's eyes were remains from forty brave men who had \ndied rather than betray Jesus. Throughout Cappadocia (a region now in \ncentral Turkey), the story was well known. But to see their actual \nbones... It transformed the story into reality for him: the forty's \ndefiance of their emperor's order to pour out a drink offering \n(libation) to a heathen god, their whipping, imprisonment and finally \ntheir death, exposed naked all night on ice. Gregory considered \nhimself a Christian. Suddenly he saw that God had the right to demand \nhis whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt once he determined to live his life completely for Christ. But \nwhat did the Lord want of him? To become a priest? Gregory thought \nabout it, but decided it wasn't for him. He became a professional \norator (more or less a lawyer) like his father, married and settled \ndown, but served the church as an active layman. Gregory's brother, \nknown to us as Basil the Great, liked to put people in slots of his \nown choosing. He needed bishops who would support him against the \nArian heresy (which denied the full divinity of Christ). He urged \nGregory to reconsider. Eventually Gregory listened and became a \npriest. This did not alter his marriage. In that time and place, \npriests married.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon Basil made Gregory the bishop of Nyssa, a small town near \nCaesarea. (That is why we refer to Gregory as Gregory of Nyssa.) But \nhis appointment was a disaster. He was not made for administration. \nNaive, he did not get along with the church and its Arians. His \nopponents accused him of mismanagement and embezzling church funds. \nThe last accusation was false but caused him difficulties anyhow.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was arrested but escaped. In his absence, a local council deposed \nhim. For two years he wandered the region until a change in politics \nchanged his status. A new emperor came to the throne and issued an \nedict or proclamation of tolerance concerning the religious conflict. \nGregory returned to Nyssa where he was warmly welcomed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasil died soon afterward and Gregory took on a more important role \nin the defense of orthodox belief. He was a leader in two councils \nand defended the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe also wrote many books. Passages from these are considered quite \nbeautiful. His book on Moses urged people to a deeper spiritual life. \nHe taught that it is not so much our sins that keep us out of heaven \nas our unwillingness to accept God's freely offered forgiveness. For \nexample, when the Israelites came out of Egypt, they grumbled, \nworshipped an idol, and engaged in a sexual orgy. In spite of all \nthis, God led them toward the Promised Land. What kept them out was \ntheir refusal to believe the report of Joshua and Caleb. Instead, \nthey accepted the report of the ten frightened spies. In the same \nway, we must believe Christ if we are to enter Heaven, he taught.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lutheran Church commemorates Gregory of Nyssa on this day, June \n14.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S.

    "words": "\"*For almost 100 years following Jesus' death, not a single Roman \ndocument exists which mentions Jesus or Paul.* \u0014\n\u0014\n*The terms \"Christianity\" and \"Christians\" were essentially unheard \nof in Rome for almost a century following the life of Jesus.* \u0014\n\u0014\n*Prior to the development of the proto-orthodox Christian doctrine \n(in the second or third century), the majority of those who believed \nthat Jesus was Divine held views that would be considered heretical \ntoday.*\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the first centuries after Christ, there was no \"official\" New \nTestament. Instead, early Christians read and fervently followed a \nwide variety of Scripturesmany more than we have today.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRelying on these writings, Christians held beliefs that today would \nbe considered bizarre. Some believed that there were two, 12, or as \nmany as 30 gods. Some thought that a malicious deity, rather than the \ntrue God, created the world. Some maintained that Christ's death and \nresurrection had nothing to do with salvation while others insisted \nthat Christ never really died at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did these \"other\" Scriptures say? Do they exist today? How could \nsuch outlandish ideas ever be considered Christian? If such beliefs \nwere once common, why do they no longer exist? These are just a few \nof the many provocative questions that arise from Lost \nChristianities: Christian Scriptures and the Battles over \nAuthentication (From The Teaching Company).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis course focuses on the remarkable fact that many of the struggles \nof early Christians were not against pagans or other nonbelievers but \nagainst other Christians. Professor Ehrman will introduce you to \nthese groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Ebionites were Jewish Christians who followed Jewish laws but \naccepted Jesus as the Messiah without believing he was divine. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Marcionites rejected Judaism completely to the extent that they \nbelieved that the God of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus were \ntwo separate Gods. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the Gnostics believed that there was one true God but that there \nwere also many other deities. In addition, they thought salvation \ncame not from Christ's death and resurrection but from secret \nknowledge, or gnosis, of who one really was, where one came from, and \nhow one could return to the heavenly home. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fascinating heart of this course is its exploration of the \nScriptures that were read and considered authoritative by these \nChristian sects. Many now are either known or believed to be \n\"pseudepigrapha\"forgeries written in the names of famous apostles. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever their origins, these documents can be viewed as lost \nversions of the New Testament. They provide a fascinating opportunity \nto study little known and sometimes controversial Scriptures that \nmight have become part of the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gnostic Gospel of Truth is one of the most powerful and moving \nexpositions of the joy of salvation to survive from Christian \nantiquity. Ironically, its views are diametrically opposed to those \nthat dominate Christian belief today. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Infancy Gospels, such as the Proto-Gospel of James and the \nInfancy Gospel of Thomas, describe events leading up to Jesus' birth \nand during his young childhood. Scholars are unsure whether they were \nmeant to be taken seriously or merely served as entertaining fictions \nabout a period of Christ's life for which other Scriptures provide \nlittle or no information. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, unlike the book of Acts that is \nin the New Testament, focus on the lives and exploits of individual \napostles. They provide legendary, imaginative, and entertaining \naccounts of the activities of Jesus' closest followers.\u0014",

He lived with his parents until he was 30 \nand was the ultimate outsider from baseballs raucous atmosphere in \nthe 20s and 30s. \u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Eigs 2005 Gehrig biography, Luckiest Man, quotes Mike \nGazella, a Yankee infielder: He was just hopeless. When a woman \nwould ask him for an autograph, he would be absolutely paralyzed with \nembarrassment. \u0014\n\u0014\nGehrig struggled with another complication to his attempts at a \nsocial life  his beloved, strong-willed mother, Christina, who \nbecame the gatekeeper for whatever romantic life he managed to \nachieve. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Fred Lieb, a longtime baseball writer who knew Gehrig as well as \nanyone, wrote in his book Baseball As I Have Known It: Even though \nhe was shy, he had known lots of girls, but whenever he started to \nget serious with one, Mom Gehrig filed her objections. He loved his \nmother dearly and could not think of marrying a girl unless he \nobtained his mothers okay. At least twice he brought prospective \nwives over to our house, asking us what we thought of them. Lous \ngirls were always attractive, with both brains and humor. Then one \ntime, he had been smitten with a girl and was thinking of proposing. \nOn learning this, Mom journeyed to the young ladys hometown, looked \naround, made some investigations, and filed an adverse report, which \nLou accepted. \u0014\n\u0014\nExactly where Ruth Martin fit into this may never be fully known. All \nthat survives of the relationship is a 1930 Christmas card signed by \nGehrig with an envelope addressed to Miss Ruth Martin. Her only son, \nJeffrey Quick, a retired pension and retirement plan consultant, said \nhis mother, whether out of deference for Gehrigs privacy, her own \nfeelings or some other reason, seldom spoke about the relationship. \nShe said they met through a mutual acquaintance, and she told a \nneighbor that Gehrig once gave her apple blossom flowers, viewed at \nthe time as a particularly romantic offering. \u0014\n\u0014\nWas Ruth one of the potential mates vetoed by Christina? Well never \nknow, but eventually they went their separate ways. At a party the \nnight before the third game of the 1932 World Series, Gehrig met a \nworldly, fashionable woman in Chicago named Eleanor Grace Twitchell. \nHer relationship with Gehrigs mother was chilly from the start, but \nGehrig told Lieb: Mom is the most wonderful woman in the world. She \nbroke up some of my earlier romances, and she isnt going to break up \nthis one.\u0014\n \u0014\nOn Sept. 29, 1933, after the relationship almost fell apart when \nmother and fiance argued over some drapes, Gehrig finally broke free \nand married in New Rochelle, N.Y.\u0014",

    "title": "LIVING IN UNITY",
    "words": "\u0014\nPsalm 133\u0014\n\u0014\n\"How very good and pleasant it is when the kindred live together in \nunity.\" Unity is a wonderful concept. It has an innate appeal that \ncalls virtually everyone to its side. Somehow, down deep, we all know \nthat unity is good. And in some fashion or other, most people seek \nunity. In families, at work, in communities, and even in our national \nlife, we seek and even desire unity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the question has to come about that which brings unity. What \nis it that unites? Is it an idea? Is it common experience? Is it a \ncharismatic leader? Is it a religious belief? All these things, in \none way or another, have united people in the past. And in these \ntimes, many are seeking that which might once again unite us as a \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet even as we read this psalm and breathe in our affirmation of the \nunity of the \"kindred,\" the hard truth is that unity does not come \neasily to human beings. Indeed, disunity seems more natural to us as \nwe splinter across the globe with different politics, religions, \nideologies, cultures, and races. Anyone who has tried to build \ncommunity on any level can attest to the countless lists of things \nthat can divide people. From petty ego obsessions to selfish temper \ntantrums and back again, the list of that which divides is longer \nthan anyone cares to admit. The truth is that people don't simply \ncome together for no reason at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it, then, that can build unity?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is, perhaps, a touch arrogant to approach such a heady topic in \nthe few words allotted here, but this much seems true. Unity is not \nconformity. Unity is best forged in the celebration of diversity \naround a central core principle. For us, our unity is in Jesus \nChrist. It is not in ideology or doctrine or styles of worship or \ncultural affect. No. Our unity is in the love we share in Christ. \nThis love is our unifying principle. It is deeper than our divisions, \nbroader than that which strives to divide us, and it is stronger than \nthe world which seeks to overcome us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a community of people can let go of their cherished personal \ndesires and preferences and reach for unity in love, things change. \nWhen people can embrace the Christian idea that self-giving love is \nredemptive, trust and community grow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many things that can build unity. But for us, it is Christ \nJesus. For us, unity grows from the love which accepts all people and \ncalls them to a higher purpose: the purpose of love. And at the end \nof the day, the psalm has it right. It is indeed pleasant when the \nsisters and brothers live together in unity. \u0014\n\u0014\nSchuyler Rhodes, Emphasis Magazine\u0014",

    "words": "Steve Jobs is a unique individual. Many seek to learn from him, but \nmost of us do not have the emotional or psychological makeup to be \nhim. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy most accounts, Jobs can be mean, abusive, driven and irrational  \ntypical words associated with genius (along with creative and \ninnovative). \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you have the patience to put up with someone with these \ncharacteristics, you will reap great rewards, but most of us would \nrather observe at a distance. \u0014\n\u0014\nI do think there are some things we can learn from Jobs.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Recognize when someone else has a good idea and run with it. \u0014\n\u0014\nJobs and Apple did not create the computer mouse, podcasting or the \ntouch screen, but they recognized their value and integrated these \ninnovations into their products. Just because we didn't create \nsomething doesn't mean we can't adopt it or adapt it for our \nsituation.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Hire good people. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he could be alternatively critical and complimentary, Jobs \nfound good people for his team and challenged them to be better. We \nmight not adopt the extreme measures that he used, but we can \nsurround ourselves with good folks, listen to them and encourage them \nto do good work.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Trust your gut feelings. \u0014\n\u0014\nJobs typically eschewed market research and focus groups and gave the \npublic what he thought they needed. And it worked  most of the time! \nApple has had great successes, but it has also experienced some \nflops. Sometimes we do need to go with our instincts, but we must be \nprepared to fail with grace when something does not work\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Don't be afraid to let go of a success to move on to something \nbetter. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe iPhone killed the iPod for all practical purposes. The iPod \nessentially became an \"app\" for the iPhone and the iPad. iPods are \nstill on the market, but they certainly don't sell like they once \ndid. \u0014\n\u0014\nJobs saw something better and moved on even if it meant wounding a \nprofitable product. Letting go of the familiar and reaching out to \nthe unknown is a real test of leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill there be another Steve Jobs? Probably not. But one certainly \nshook things up for the rest of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nIrcel Harrison is an associate with Pinnacle Leadership Associates\u0014",

    "title": "LET HIM PLAY",
    "words": "In a large stone cathedral in Europe there was a large, \nmagnificent pipe organ. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the sexton \nwas making one final check of the choir and organ loft high in the \nbalcony at the back of the church. He was startled to hear footsteps \nechoing up the stone stairway, as he thought the doors were all \nlocked and no one was around. He turned to see a man in slightly \ntattered traveling clothes coming toward him. \"Excuse me, sir,\" the \nstranger said. \"I have come from quite a distance to see the great \norgan in this cathedral. Would you mind opening the console so that I \nmight get a closer look at it?\" The custodian at first refused, but \nthe stranger seemed so eager and insistent that he finally gave in. \n\"May I sit on the bench?\" That request of the stranger was met with \nabsolute refusal by the cathedral custodian. \"What if the organist \ncame in and found you sitting there? I would probably lose my job!\" \nBut again the stranger was so persistent that the sexton gave in. \n\"But only for a moment,\" he added. \u0014\n\u0014\n           The custodian noticed that the stranger seemed to be very \nmuch at home on the organ bench, so he was not completely surprised \nwhen he was asked by the stranger to be allowed to play the organ. \n\"No! Definitely not!\" said the custodian. \"No one is allowed to play \nit except the cathedral organist.\" The man's face fell, and his deep \ndisappointment was obvious. He reminded the custodian how far he had \ncome and assured him that no damage would be done. Finally the sexton \nrelented and told the stranger he could play the instrument, but only \na few notes and then he would have to leave. Overjoyed, the stranger \npulled out some stops and began to play. Suddenly the cathedral was \nfilled with the most beautiful music the custodian had ever heard in \nall his years in that place. The music seemed to transport him \nheavenward. \u0014\n\u0014\n           In what seemed all too short a time, the dowdy stranger \nstopped playing and slid off the organ bench. And started down the \nstairway. \"Wait!\" cried the custodian. \"That was the most beautiful \nmusic I have ever heard in the cathedral. Who are you?\" The stranger \nturned for just a moment as he replied, \"Mendelssohn.\" The man was \nnone other than Felix Mendelssohn, one of the greatest organists and \ncomposers of the nineteenth century! \u0014\n\u0014\n          The cathedral sexton was alone now in that great stone \nedifice, the beautiful organ music still ringing in his ears. \"Just \nthink,\" he said softly, \"I almost kept the master from playing his \nmusic in my cathedral!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n          Each one of us has the opportunity to have a personal \nrelationship with the Master of the universe, Jesus Christ. Let's not \nkeep Him from \"playing His music\" and being Master of our lives! \u0014\n\u0014\n   --James S.

Lew left behind him a lifetime of political and military \naccomplishments. The world, however, remembers him chiefly as the \nauthor of the novel Ben Hur, which he subtitled, \"a tale of the \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLew Wallace was born in 1827, the son of an Indiana governor. As a \nyoung man he served in the United States' war with Mexico. After the \nwar, he studied law, set up a law practice, and served in the Indiana \nState Senate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Civil War broke out, he immediately re-enlisted and rose to \nthe rank of Major General. In 1864, he fought--and lost--the Battle \nof Monocacy, but he held his position long enough to allow union \ndefenders to reach Washington, D.C., preventing its capture by \nConfederate general Jubal Early. After the war, Lew served on the \ncourt martial that tried Lincoln's assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nLew was inspired to write novels after reading Prescott's Conquest of \nMexico. His first novel, The Fair God, was about those events. His \nsecond novel, Ben Hur, was conceived after sitting on a train, \nlistening spellbound for two hours, while the agnostic Colonel Robert \nIngersoll, poured out \"a medley of argument, eloquence, wit, satire, \naudacity, irreverence, poetry, brilliant antitheses, and pungent \nexcoriation of believers in God, Christ, and Heaven, the like of \nwhich I had never heard.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil then, Lew had been indifferent to the claims of religion \n(although he loved the story of the wise men and had begun a tale \nabout them). \"... Yet here was I now moved as never before, and by \nwhat? The most outright denials of all human knowledge of God, \nChrist, Heaven... Was the Colonel right? What had I on which to \nanswer yes or no? He had made me ashamed of my ignorance: and \nthen--here is the unexpected of the affair--as I walked on in the \ncool darkness, I was aroused for the first time in my life to the \nimportance of religion... I thought of the manuscript in my desk. Its \nclosing scene was the child Christ in the cave by Bethlehem: why not \ngo on with the story down to the crucifixion? That would make a book, \nand compel me to study everything of pertinency; after which, \npossibly, I would be possessed of opinions of real value. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It only remains to say that I did as resolved, with results--first, \nthe book Ben Hur, and second, a conviction amounting to absolute \nbelief in God and the Divinity of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile governor of New Mexico, Lew wrote his dramatic story. Though \nnever a member of a church, he became the best selling religious \nauthor of his day. Ben Hur sold 300,000 copies within ten years, and \nwas translated into dozens of languages, including Arabic and \nChinese. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after Ben Hur was published in 1880, Wallace began a \nfour-year term as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, where he cultivated very \ngood relations with the Sultan. The last years of his life Wallace \nspent as a public lecturer. Today his statue stands in the Capitol \nbuilding at Washington, representing the State of Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story. \u0014\nCambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes. \n1907.\u0014\nGeneral Lew Wallace Study and Museum. http://www.ben-hur.com/\u0014\nMorsberger, Robert E. and Morsberger, Katherine M.

    "title": "LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT HERESY IN EARLY CHURCH",
    "words": "Remarkable or little-known facts about heresy in the early church\u0014\n\u0014\nby TONY LANE\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three major creeds of the church are all misnamed. The Apostles \nCreed was not written by the apostles. What is called the Nicene \nCreed is not the creed that was produced at the Council of Nicea but \na later creed. The Athanasian Creed has nothing to do with Athanasius \nand many have argued that it is not even a creed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Nicene Creed, the key word used to describe Christs relation \nto Godhomoousion, meaning, of the same substancehad been \nconsidered heretical a century earlier. Some earlier orthodox \ntheologians argued that the term was not found in the Bible and that \nit blurred the distinctions between the Father and the Son.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the debate about Christs deity extended over centuries, the \ndebate about the Holy Spirits divine nature lasted only about twenty \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome the greatest of early theologians were confused about Christs \nnature. Clement of Alexandria, for example, masterfully refuted the \nGnostic heresy that said Christ did not have a real human body and \ntherefore did not eat and drink. Clement held that Jesus did indeed \neat and drink but not because he needed food and drink to stay \naliveJesus, Clement argued, only wished to keep his disciples from \nheretical beliefs about him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all defenders of orthodoxy stayed orthodox themselves. Tertullian \nand Novatian, for example, two major anti-Gnostic theologians of the \n200s, each fell out of favor with the church: Tertullian, because of \nhis conversion to the Montanist heresy; Novatian, because of his \nunforgiving stance against those who had denied Christ under \npersecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a time at Antioch, rival groups differed about the deity of the \nHoly Spirit. One group prayed, Glory be to the Father and to the Son \nand to the Holy Spirit, and the other one, Glory be to the Father \nwith the Son in the Holy Spirit. The bishop managed to avoid \noffending either party by developing laryngitis at this point in the \nliturgy!\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his 45-year reign as bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius, the \nchampion of Nicene orthodoxy, was exiled five times by five emperors, \nfor a total of 17 years. Though his views on Christs deity were to \nbecome the official teaching of the church, when he died, it was \nstill not clear his views would prevail.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyril of Alexandria, a fifth-century Greek bishop, held to the \ngenerally accepted belief that God is impassibleincapable of \nsuffering or emotion. He equally held to the deity of Christ, who \nunderwent his passion (i.e., his suffering) for us on the cross. \nThis commitment led him to affirm that the eternal Word suffered \nimpassibly.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeretics often provided a great service to the church. For example, \nMarcion rejected the Old Testament and the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, \nand John, thus forcing the church to define the New Testament canon. \nArius, in denying the deity of Christ, made the church articulate the \ndoctrine that became the most crucial to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(1996).

    "words": "The recorded words from Jesus about the Christian life are stark, but \nI find most interpretations of them to be troublingespecially those \nregarding his call to deny oneself. In Greek, to deny means to \nignore. The grammatical form of the verb refers to something a \nperson is doing to/for himself as an ongoing thing. Most scholars I \nhave studied interpret this to mean that we are to treat ourselves as \nthough we have never existed. I do not agree. Jesus calls on us to \nlove our neighbor as ourselves, not instead of ourselves. I \nunderstand that Jesus meant by denying ourselves we are to take \nselfish personal interests out of the place of first priority and \nlive with a broader soul focused on the will of God, the well-being \nof others, and the best interests of ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n           ---- Sherrill Stevens, A Study Companion of the Gospel of \nLuke, P. 34\u0014",

    "words": "Bell raises a lot of perceptive and fascinating questions about the \nBible's treatment of the afterlife. I don't think he deserves the \ncriticism he's received (for instance, that he's a heretical \nuniversalist); he doesn't take that position directly, although the \nquestions he raises about the nature of God, and what really is or \nisn't said about hell in the Bible, might leave you with that \nimpression.\u0014\n\u0014\nBasically, if you want to walk away with clear ANSWERS to the \nquestions he raises, this isn't necessarily the right book for you.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Bell does do is, through his questions pop some \nevangelical/fundamentalist \"bubbles\" that may need to be popped, or \nat least thoroughly discussed. For instance, the contention \n(supported primarily by 5-point Calvinists, but also assumed by many \nother Christians) that at the moment of death, the curtain drops and \nyour fate is sealed. That even if (when confronted with the majestic \nGod who created you, in judgment) you fell to your knees and said, \n\"I'm sorry I didn't believe in you and receive you earlier! I now \nunderstand the error of my ways. I believe in your now. Please \nforgive me, cover my sins with the blood of Christ!\" God would shake \nHis head and say, \"Nope. Too late. Your fate is sealed, you will be \ntormented in hell forever for not taking this position 10 minutes \nearlier.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBell points out that that doesn't sound like a loving father who \n\"desires for all men to be saved\" and he has a point. However, I \nrealized that 5-point Calvinists will make two valid points (which \nBell plays with but doesn't really address directly): 1) The words of \nChrist himself (in the parable of Lazarus and the rich man) seem to \nindicate that the decisions we make in this life, and the inclination \nto make those decisions (based on the \"ordainment\" of God, according \nto Calvinists) are effective for all of eternity; and 2) If God truly \ndoes ordain those whom He desires to be saved, to eternal life, and \nthose whom He desires not to be saved, to eternal death, then He \nwould certainly do so before the \"it is appointed unto man once to \ndie, and then the judgment\" deadline.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, I would point out to those who argue (on the basis of Heb. \n9:27*, \"It is appointed to men once to die, and after this the \njudgment\"), \"Once saved, always saved\" and \"Once you die in your \nsins, you are always lost,\" that even that proof text itself is not \nexplicit about the amount of time, space, or other events that \nelapses between those two things (once to die, and then -- when? -- \njudgment). Catholics would probably insert into this space, \"Hence, \nPurgatory\" which of course is the view that an intermediary state of \nbeing is needed to fully purge/cleanse our souls from sin before we \ncan be allowed into a sinless heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot being Catholic (and not seeing any direct evidence for Purgatory \nin Scripture), I naturally do not accept this contention, but \nsomething akin to Purgatory (and supported by the Old Testament \nmetaphor of the \"Outer Court of the Gentiles\" when it comes to the \nTemple, or to similar outer areas of the Tabernacle) might possibly \nexist in the fringes of the journey to Heaven. C. S. Lewis alluded to \nthis in his brilliant allegory, \"The Great Divorce,\" wherein a \nbusload of passengers are delivered on a day-trip from Hell to \nHeaven. They have great difficulty even stepping upon the grass, as \nthey are so incorporeal, and it is quite clear that they must become \n\"adjusted\" to the realities of heaven (their souls cleansed from all \nthat binds them to Hell) in order be able to traverse \"inward and \nupward\" toward the Center of God's universe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Divorce leaves us with the sense that all of the bus riders \nsave one judge this journey too difficult to make. They are too \ncomfortable in Hell, having gone there in the first place because \nthey are too uncomfortable being exposed to the holiness of God, with \nall of its demands. In other words, they are too used to being the \nCaptains of their own ship. The narrator alone leaves you with the \nimpression that he is going to miss the bus ride home to Hell, and \nmake the changes necessary to travel inward and upward. (I.e., \nrepentance after death.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on Bell's words in \"Love Wins,\" I think he would agree with \nLewis. Although I don't think he necessarily views Hell as a place of \npunishment (where God pours out his wrath on sin by torturing lost \nsouls in eternal torment), he certainly does contend that \"a hell of \nour own making\" exists. He affirms free will, the fact that God gave \nmen the ability to choose, and will never force them to do otherwise. \nHe agrees that if God freely gives man the ability to choose his \ngrace, there must be the possibility that some will not choose it, \nperhaps may never choose it.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, at the same time, as I mentioned earlier, he raises some \nintriguing questions. Evangelicals agree that God is omnipotent (as \nexpressed by Bell's phrase, \"God gets His way\"). And most of them \nagree with straightforward interpretation of the verse \"God desires \nthat none should perish.\" (Although I recognize that 5-point \nCalvinists might not acknowledge the straightforward interpretation \nof this verse. One friend said to me: \"That verses doesn't mean \n'everyone' ... just the elect.\" But, I'm sorry, that's not what it \nplainly says.) If God wants all people to be saved, and He ultimately \ngets His way, what does this portend for the future of all people?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, there is the intriguing passage in Isaiah 45:23 -- \"By myself I \nhave sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that \nshall not return: `To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall \nswear allegiance.'\" Which is reinforced quite heartily by Paul in \nRomans 14:11 and Philippians 2:9-11. If every knee will bow and every \ntongue will confess (swear allegiance to, according to Isaiah) the \nLordship of Christ ... then where are His detractors now?\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly three possibilities, as far as I can see: 1) Rob Bell is right, \nLove Wins in the end, and ultimately God gets his way. All repent and \nare covered by the grace of God in Christ Jesus. 2) Those who fail to \nrepent (the goats) are destroyed in the \"Second Death,\" the lake of \nfire reserved for the Devil and his angels (Revelation), and all \nothers (the sheep) worship God forever as He intended. Or 3) This \nverse doesn't really mean what it seems to mean ... either \"every\" \ndoesn't really mean \"every,\" or as my Calvinist friend might contend, \n\"bowing to the Lordship of Christ\" is forced upon unbelievers \nsomehow, which raises the question: is forced allegiance really \nallegiance?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've ordered those three possibilities in accordance with what I HOPE \nis true. But, scripturally speaking, I think the best argument really \nis for option #2. Scripture doesn't really seem to entertain the \npossibility that Satan and his demons will ultimately repent and \nserve God, although I don't see this as outside the realm of \npossibility for God's grace, certainly. (Remember, \"He who is \nforgiven much, loves much.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bottom line is, just as Scripture really isn't clear on these \nthings (what we need, after all, is to trust God today, and having \nclear answers to these questions doesn't necessarily lend itself to \nthat trust, does it?), I don't think we as fallible human beings can \nbe completely clear, either. Bell makes a good point that there is \nnot a hard-and-fast clear-cut interpretation of these matters. My \nCalvinist friends might cry \"Heresy!\" but such hand grenades haven't \nhelped the cause of Truth much when discussing such things, as far as \nI am aware. I certainly don't see that Rob Bell's conclusions (or at \nleast the questions he raises) are anti-biblical in any way (unless \nC.S. Lewis' are ... and, I don't see that either), so I'm certainly \nnot ready to throw the first stone. (And, might I add ... I've \nactually read the book! Many of his critics have not.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBottom line: Some things in Scripture are very clear. (Jesus is the \nSon of God, for instance!) Some things are less clear. (The exact \nnature of hell, for instance.) When debating the latter, a good dose \nof humility can go a long way. I believe Pastor Bell showed good \nhumility in the way he wrote this book, and am a bit embarrassed by \nthe lack of it in many of those who have responded to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are some things about the WAY Bell writes (his imprecise, \nsomewhat vague, poetical style, which I assume comes from the way he \npreaches) that annoyed the heck out of me. But once I survived this \nin the first half of the book, I felt like the second half made \nwading through the first half worth the wait. (Hence, the three \nstars.)\u0014\n\u0014\n*By the way, even hardcore Calvinists will agree that Scripture \npresents several different types of \"judgment,\" and it is not \nimmediately clear which type Heb. 9:27 is referring to. If \"judgment\" \nrefers to the Great White Throne Judgment, the final judgment at the \nend of days, depicted in Revelation, then certainly there is some \n\"space\" which must be inserted where the word \"then\" occurs in this \nverse.\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry Short\u0014",

    "title": "LOVE IS NEVER THE WRONG THING TO DO",
    "words": "Get gritty: Because love is never the wrong thing to do\u0014\n\u0014\nMay 20, 2019 by Sheena Jeffers \u0014\n\u0014\nMy heart is full of gratitude for the opportunity to speak at Mindful \nMornings and for every human heart beat that was present to hear my \nstory. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say; sometimes, \nits hard to know what story to tell; sometimes, its hard to find \nthe words. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was asked to speak about grit, I found myself in a blurry \nplace. My first impulsive thought went to my own personal grit: the \ngumption, the animalistic parts of me that push through to get a job \ndone or get over a hurt. The grit that stood by me when I opened my \nbusinesses, launched my community projects, performed on stages. The \ngrit that still stands by me when required to have tough \nconversations, taking the phone call I dont want to take, paying the \nobnoxious, unexpected bill. I am familiar with this grit. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut sailing 6,000+ nautical miles to 11 different countries delivered \nme to a new understanding of grit. Why? Because sailing was never my \ndream. Before I met my previous life partner, I had never sailed a \nday in my life. On our first date, he told me, I want to sail around \nthe world! I nodded and shrugged it off. But he was serious and I \nwas left with a decision to make: Should I stay or should I go now? \u0014\n\u0014\nI didnt realize it at the time, but the question was really: Can you \nmanifest grit grand enough and then give it to your partner? \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the months of sorting through my thoughts, feelings and fears, \nmany people, facts, doubts surfaced to tell me their opinions. And \nthere were many. \u0014\n\u0014\nYoure committing career suicide! \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did you even go to graduate school? \u0014\n\u0014\nYou dont know how to sail! That is just stupid, just dangerous! \u0014\n\u0014\nTheir words were influential to me, and like pulling a blanket over \nyour head after a long day of work, I tucked myself away. It was \ninside of that safety fort, alone, that I made my decision: I was \ngoing. I could do this. \u0014\n\u0014\nI went. I woke up every day prepared to be present and gritty to make \nthis sailing dream happen. Many people told me I put my life on hold. \nMany people worried about me losing myself in it all. I pressed on. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe achieved a lot. We changed as people. And then it ended. \u0014\n \u0014\nMy inclination toward romantic endings made it difficult for me to \npack my belongings, stuff them into a rental car and drive away from \nhim, from our boat, from the life we had shared. But I needed to do \nit for me, for him, for us. I wanted him to be happier, and he wanted \nthe same for me. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasnt until months later that I realized I now had a new \nunderstanding of grit. Now, I knew a grit that was selfless, potent, \npresent. As my dear friend said, I learned how to hold the line: a \nstate of being that remains steady and non-reactive; only consistent, \nalert, prepared, focused and backed with intense love. The kind of \ngrit that kept me standing tall on the sailboat during scary times. \nThe kind of grit that helped me massage my mothers feet that had \nlong fallen numb from chemo treatments\u0014\n\u0014\nI have three points about grit. \u0014\n\u0014\n1.My definition of grit is having passion and perseverance for a \nlong-term goal steeped in a growth mindset.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.You dont lose yourself by providing or loaning your grit to \nsomeone else. Grit isnt of a limited quantity; it grows more (for \nthem, for you) the more you use it.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.Guard your grit from the naysayers, manipulators, fear bringers, \nand abusers. Use and trust your discernment and then be all in!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? Because when has loving someone or something ever been a waste \nof time? When has love been the wrong thing to do? Love is never the \nwrong thing to do, even when the ending isnt what you expected. \u0014\n\u0014\nFind your grit and dont be afraid to give it to someone else. You \ndont lose you, you grow more into you.\u0014",

    "title": "LAST MAN TO RIDE MAN 'O WAR TALKS ABOUT HORSES",
    "words": "LAST MAN TO RIDE MAN 'O WAR TELLS HIS STORY\u0014\n           Of course it all started as a love story.   8/7/19  The \nPaulick Report\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil 1940, the Maddoxtown Colored School just north of Lexington, \nKy., served a small community of a few dozen families off Huffman \nMill Pike. As many as 100 people lived in the predominantly black \nneighborhood of Maddoxtown in the early 1900s, but over the decades, \nmany people moved into the city, and there were no longer enough \nchildren to support the school house. The building went up for \nauction, and Eugene Carter's father saw an opportunity to buy a good \nhouse for a good price. Carter won the auction and moved his family, \nincluding his 15-year-old son, Eugene. That year, the children of \nMaddoxtown began riding a bus to school for the first time.  \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery morning, Gene found himself sitting next to a pretty girl about \nhis age who was also his next-door neighbor. They were both too shy \nto speak to one another, so they smiled nervously back and forth as \nteenagers do. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter three weeks of this, Carter got up the nerve to ask Lillian \nHarbut (Lill as he called her) to go on a date. At first, he \nrecalls, she was stunned to hear him speak. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe said, 'I don't know, Gene. I see you at church all the time. I \nknow you. But you've got to ask my dad, and he's real strict. He's \ngot 13 kids, 10 boys and 3 girls. I don't think he wants another boy \nin the family,' he recalled.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter decided his best bet was to demonstrate his trustworthiness to \nher father, Will Harbut, so early on Saturday mornings he would make \nthe 1  mile walk to Faraway Farm, where he knew Harbut would be \ntending to the great red legend Man o' War. Carter had already found \nwork breaking yearlings at nearby Elsmeade Farm  a job he got \nthrough sheer persistence, hanging around each morning until an \nestablished rider was late getting to work.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the stallion barn at Faraway, Carter watched Harbut shine the \nhorse that could outrun the wind. He'd watch him speak to the \nvisitors who came from thousands of miles away to stare at Man o' \nWar, and he'd see that it was Harbut who would ultimately spell-bind \nthem with tales of the stallion's legacy, still in the making. Harbut \nwould be featured on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post alongside \nBig Red a few months after Carter and Lill began riding the bus \ntogether. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the things Carter noticed was that Will Harbut was always \ntalking, even when there were no other people around but the pair of \nthem. He talked to Red, but not in a way Carter had ever heard a \ngroom speak to a horse. Harbut spoke to Red as if the horse could \nunderstand English, and it seemed to Carter as though he certainly \nunderstood something. When Man o' War dropped manure in the stall, \nHarbut would tell him about the extra work this created and ask the \nhorse to move over so he could clean it up. The stallion would count \noff one, two, three steps sideways each time and wait for Harbut to \ncome in with a fork. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was talking to him like he was a person. I couldn't understand \nthat, Carter said. I rode horses on the racetrack every day, but I \ndidn't see people get horses to do things just by talking to them. \nAnd Man o' War was a stallion; he wasn't some ordinary horse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHarbut's relationship with Big Red was legendary, and Carter said it \nlives up to the storybook hype. The massive Thoroughbred, who Carter \nremembers weighing 1,250 pounds, was as gentle as an old pony in \nHarbut's hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey said he was chestnut, but when the sun shone on him, he looked \nlike he was gold. The light would come right back off of him. If you \nstood there looking at him, he almost took your breath away. You'd go \nto walk away and you'd have to turn around and look at him again. You \ncouldn't believe what you were seeing  a horse, looking like that, \nsaid Carter. Will Harbut, he was a gifted man to handle a horse. Man \no' War was an unruly horse. He was by Fair Play, and all of them, \nespecially the colts were high-strung, full of energy, even going to \nthe post in the race. That's what Man o' War was, until Will Harbut \ngot over to him, said Carter.\u0014\n \u0014\nOne day when no one was around, Harbut turned to Carter, who he knew \nhad galloped horses on the farm, and asked if he wanted to get on the \nmost famous Thoroughbred in the world. Carter leapt at the \nopportunity, and Harbut gave him a leg up, right there in the stall. \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nHe said, 'Gensie, how does it feel to be on the mostest horse in the \nworld?' Carter remembered. I said, 'Mr. Harbut to tell you the \ntruth, I don't have words to express what I'm feeling. Words have \nleft me. I'm just so thrilled. I've never been on a horse like Man o' \nWar.'\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, 'Gensie, you take this to your grave. Ain't but three \npeople been on this horse  the exercise boy, the jock that rides him \nin the race, and Gene Carter.' \u0014\n\u0014\nI said, 'I'll be darned.' I looked around and I said, 'Well where \nare the rest of the boys at who used to get on him?' and he said, \n'Oh, they're all dead.'\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter did a double take from up on the red horse, wondering whether \nthe stallion had helped put them in their graves. \u0014\nNo surprise then, that the boy Harbut liked enough to let him sit \natop Man o' War had earned his way into Harbut's trust. He gave Gene \nand Lill permission to begin dating and later, to get married. They \nwere together for more than five decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Carter's career as an exercise rider was taking off. He \nhadn't sat on a horse until he was in his teens, though he had \npracticed galloping by riding and breaking kitchen chairs at such an \nalarming rate he said his mother was relieved when he announced he \nwould quit school to ride full-time. Cy White, who conditioned horses \nfor the Ogden Phipps stable, had first given Carter a chance in the \nstirrups and was one in a line of trainers who would sing the praises \nof Carter as a natural horseman. At five foot three, Carter was the \nright size for the job. He had an excellent sense of balance and \nrarely fell off a horse. He had a stopwatch in his head, and he also \nhad a secret weapon, one he learned from Harbut: He talked to horses \nand he knew how to tell if they were listening. \u0014\n\u0014\nI wanted to prove to the other exercise boys there wasn't a horse I \nwouldn't get on, said Carter, who became known as The Test Pilot. \nI thought if Will Harbut can talk to a stallion and make him behave, \nmaybe I can talk to a young horse and make them behave. What I did, I \nmade up my own language. I'd talk backwards to them. All horses hear \nis 'Git up' and 'Whoa.' I'd say something they'd never heard before. \nI'd say, 'What for you actin like that? You better watch yourself \nbefore you be by yourself. Stand tall and be proud, horse.' And the \nears, they'd start flicking. They'd put their head down, I'd put my \ncross on, and go on to the track.  \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople asked him what his secret was and as long as he worked, Carter \nnever told them. He let it stay between him, the horse, and the wind \nwhipping by their ears.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter worked more than 15 years for Doug Davis of High Hope Farm, \nuntil his death (Carter was a pallbearer at Davis's funeral) and \nanother 25 years prepping sale horses and handling stallions for \nBruce Hundley at Saxony Farm. If Carter faced one disappointment \nduring his career, it's that he spent so much of it as an exercise \nrider rather than a jockey. In the 1950s and 1960s, the era of Isaac \nMurphy, Oliver Lewis and Jimmy Winkfield was over. African Americans \nhad been on the backs and by the sides of the nation's most famous \nhorses, but in the era of segregation most states wouldn't license \nthem as jockeys any longer. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey didn't want black people to have that much money in those days. \nKeep us poor, keep us working, he said. \u0014\nTrainer William Douglas had at one point vowed to get him licensed as \na jockey in the Northeast but suffered a heart attack the week before \nthe pair were due to travel. Carter did get one shot at race riding, \nthough  Davis came by the barn after training hours at Churchill \nDowns one day while Carter was cleaning his tack, still soaked to the \nskin and covered in mud from morning gallops, and informed him he \nwould be riding in the High Hope charity race that afternoon. If \nanything, Carter was initially annoyed by the extra chore  here, he \nknew he'd be facing a field of white jockeys who would not be happy \nto see him, and he'd be the least experienced of the group. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he got to the walk-up start, Carter sized up the situation. He \nwas aboard Royal Matter, a horse he knew well from morning works, and \nhe knew the horse had endless class. Davis told him to hang back and \nput in a closing effort, but Carter was certain the other riders \nwould box him in and never give him a chance to run. \u0014\n\u0014\nI said, when they drop that flag, I'm going to be long gone, Carter \nrecalled. I hollered like a panther. That horse jumped straight out \nin the air and went straight to the front.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was my highlight  Royal Matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, with Lill and his children in the audience  though not \npermitted in the stands  he won handily. \u0014\nCarter retired from Saxony Farm, where he had been grooming and \nshowing yearlings, in 2002. The next year, after 56 years of marriage \nand eight children, Lillian died of cancer. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the epilogue to his love story that brought him back to \nhorses: Carter could feel himself aging every day he sat in the quiet \nhouse alone. He had to get out. That's when he learned about an open \njob at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions, caring for \nretired racehorses on display to Park visitors. After managers there \nheard his resume, they told him he'd be a shoo-in for the job.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter still has his easy way about horses. He brings them out \nproudly, calmly, solemnly  Point Given, Funny Cide, Go For Gin, Da \nHoss  all are supple and easy in his hands as Hall of Champions \nworkers describe for crowds of tourists their many accomplishments. \nHe almost disappears next to a horse, strategically setting them up \nto the best angles for visitors to get pictures on their smartphones, \nthen staying out of their way unless he decides they need a \npeppermint for good behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe also remains a master at reading a horse. His favorite Hall of \nChampions resident to date was CH Gypsy Supreme, an American \nSaddlebred who was his assignment for many years. At 11:00 on the dot \neach morning, Gypsy whinnied for Carter to take him for his daily \nwalk around the Park. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy name is Gene. When he'd nicker, it sounds like he's saying, \n'Gene, Geeene!' Carter said. There's a spot up on the hill where \nthere was a big patch of white clover. He knew where that spot was. \nHe'd be pulling on the shank till we got to that spot. After we got \nto that spot, he'd drop his head.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 11:30 on the dot, Gypsy would raise his head and tell Carter he \nwas ready to go inside. Carter was by his side every day, including \nhis last day in 2010 when he succumbed to complications from \nlaminitis. As Carter walked away from the barn, wiping his eyes, \nGypsy's rider Emily Hess came running out of the barn, holding the \nlast halter the big chestnut had worn. She gave it to Carter in \nrecognition of his devoted friendship. The halter still hangs in \nCarter's house, where he sees it every day. Every two weeks, he takes \nout his tack soap and gives it a shine.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarter recently celebrated his 93rd birthday at the Park, and Hall of \nChampions manager Robert Willis says he's the hardest working member \nof the staff.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo not think in any way, shape or form that Gene works any \ndifferently than anybody else, said Willis. Forty hours a week from \nApril to November. I promise you, he's the hardest worker in the \nbarn. If I have a problem with a horse, he's the one I get. Gene's as \ngood as I've ever seen. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few birthdays ago, Carter didn't imagine he'd still be here, \ngrooming horses every day, leaning down to paint their feet, and \npicking stalls. But he says, by the grace of God, he rises each day \nwith no alarm clock. You don't need one when you're as excited as he \nis to spend another day in a barn.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople ask what my secret is. I don't have a secret, he said. I \nwake up, he wakes me up [Carter nods heavenward as he says this] and \nI put my foot on the floor and look up and thank him. Then I get out \nof the house and find something to do.\u0014",

    "words": "Instead of looking for a direct solution to a problem at hand, we \nshould look for paths that would cause an issue to change or evolve. \nMany times, its a dramatic change thats needed to force a shift in \nviewpoints.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne such example is what Antanas Mockus did in 1995 after becoming \nmayor of Bogota, Colombia  a city riddled with violence, police \ncorruption and lack of community engagement.\u0014\n\u0014\nMockus conducted an investigation in which he fired many corrupt cops \nbut offered to retrain and rehire them as mimes. \u0014\nHe placed 420 mimes around the city on busy street corners and had \nthem follow and mimic jaywalkers or point and laugh at those who ran \nred lights. The citys traffic fatality rate was cut in half.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo address community engagement, Mockus walked the streets in spandex \nand a cape calling himself super citizen and demonstrated how to \npick up trash or generally be a better neighbor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was brought to Mockus attention that most women were afraid to go \nout at night. So, he created a Night for Women, asking men to stay \nhome and care for children while women went out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe city had a water shortage, so he showered on live television, \nasking city residents to turn off the water while they soap. \u0014\nIn two months, water usage dropped 14%. After the end of his second \nterm, usage was 40% lower than the beginning of his leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people questioned and discredited his abilities because he had \nno prior political experience. Walking the streets in spandex didnt \nimprove his credibility, but he persisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nMockus used innovative, out-of-the-box problem-solving to create a \nsafer, friendlier city, which was eventually celebrated by the vast \nmajority of Bogota.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAddie Shelton, a high school Sophomore in Norman, Oklahoma\u0014",

    "title": "LYNCHING IN AMERICA - A REVIEW",
    "words": "Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror \ndocuments EJIs multi-year investigation into lynching in twelve \nSouthern states during the period between Reconstruction and World \nWar II. EJI researchers documented 4075 racial terror lynchings of \nAfrican Americans in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, \nTexas, and Virginia between 1877 and 1950  at least 800 more \nlynchings of black people in these states than previously reported in \nthe most comprehensive work done on lynching to date. Lynching in \nAmerica makes the case that lynching of African Americans was \nterrorism, a widely supported phenomenon used to enforce racial \nsubordination and segregation. Lynchings were violent and public \nevents that traumatized black people throughout the country and were \nlargely tolerated by state and federal officials. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not frontier justice carried out by a few marginalized \nvigilantes or extremists. Instead, many African Americans who were \nnever accused of any crime were tortured and murdered in front of \npicnicking spectators (including elected officials and prominent \ncitizens) for bumping into a white person, or wearing their military \nuniforms after World War I, or not using the appropriate title when \naddressing a white person. The report explores the ways in which \nlynching profoundly impacted race relations in this country and \nshaped the contemporary geographic, political, social, and economic \nconditions of African Americans. Most importantly, lynching \nreinforced a narrative of racial difference and a legacy of racial \ninequality that is readily apparent in our criminal justice system \ntoday. Mass incarceration, racially biased capital punishment, \nexcessive sentencing, disproportionate sentencing of racial \nminorities, and police abuse of people of color reveal problems in \nAmerican society that were shaped by the terror era.\u0014\n\u0014\n-----------------------------------\u0014\nON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN\u0014\nSherrillyn A. Ifill\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the \n21st Century is a ten year anniversary reissue by Sherrilyn A Ifill. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis powerful book uses the Maryland Eastern Shore lynchings in the \n1930s, and subsequent racial issues in the area, as a central point \nand example of what the legacy of lynching is and how we can begin to \nheal both ourselves and our country.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe horrific details of what transpired on the eastern shore is made \neven more horrifying when we realize that this took place in many, \nmany small towns as well as cities throughout the south and the rest \nof the country. While reading this, I spoke with a couple of old \nfriends whose families were many generations rural south. One thing \nstood out to me, they claimed to agree that it was horrible but also \nmade it sound like it was simply usually just a case of justice \nserved outside the legal system and that they were \"simply hangings,\" \nas if the people were walked to the gallows and then hung. It appears \nthat many don't think of it as terrorism or each event as something \nfar more than simply a hanging. These were events that brought out \nthe whites, entire families, as the victim was tortured, paraded, \nand, once lynched, displayed. It was done to send a message and \nmaintain a power imbalance through terror. It was terrorism.\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\nYou dont really know what lynching was until you read Drays \nghastly accounts of public butchery and official complicity.Time\u0014",

As he grew up, he knew elders and \ndeacons who owned slaves and abused them. He heard men using foul \nlanguage and saw them practice dishonesty during the week after \nspeaking piously in church on Sunday.  He listened to ministers use \nthe Bible to justify slavery. Although he saw genuine love for the \nLord Jesus in some people, including his mother and his wife, he was \nso disturbed by the bad teaching and poor example of church leaders \nthat he became bitter toward the things of God.\u0014",

A month later the flames had spread over \n3,000 acres of land, and no attempt had been made to put them out.  \nNothing was done because the National Park Service believes that some \nlow-intensity fires are essential to the maintenance of our forest \nlands. They've discovered that since the late 1800s, when fire \nsuppression policies were introduced, our national forest have begun \nto clutter up. Dead materials and thickets of young shade-tolerant \ntrees have accumulated to the point that any fire could become a \nraging holocaust. Consequently, the Park Service is attempting, \nthrough research and careful management, the controlled burning of \ncertain plots.  With the dead wood reduced, fires occurring from \nlightning will once again be allowed to play their natural role.  The \nforest undergrowth will then be cleared, the hard- shelled seed coats \nof fire-dependent species will be broken, and new seedbeds prepared.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The life of a Christian also needs periodic purging.  In the \nshadows of our victories are scrubby little loves and distractions \nthat can sap our life and strength.

That meant that their contact phone number would be \nuseless because the office would be closed.  They would have no place \nto stay.   On top of it all, Chris had been sick for several days and \nthey needed to get him some medicine.  As his mind was racing with \nall the problems and anxieties, Chris said, \"Here, Dad, read this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   He had been rummaging through his bag and pulled out a battered \nGideon New Testament.  As he handed it to his father, he pointed to \nthe section that said, \"Where to Find Help -- When Anxious or \nWorried.\"  As Mr. Coffey reread the familiar words of Jesus about the \nFather knowing what we need, Chris leaned over and said, \"It's great, \nDad. Jesus said He's take care of everything.\"  Then he pulled the \nblanket around his shoulders and went to sleep.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Mr. Coffey realized that he hadn't been merely assessing options; \nhe had been giving in to fear and anger, feeling that because he was \nserving God he had a right to avoid inconveniences like this. But \nChris, in childlike faith, had simply assumed that his heavenly \nFather had things under control, even when his earthly dad was \nconsumed with worry.\u0014\n\u0014\n   [Decision.  May 1994.

    "words": "There's a fairy tale about a woman who had two daughters.  One was \nkind and considerate, but the other was mean and disagreeable.  The \nmother, however, showed favoritism to the unpleasant daughter and \nneglected the obedient girl.\u0014\n   One day she sent the good daughter to the village well to draw \nwater.  While there, she met and poor elderly woman who asked for a \ndrink.  The girl spoke kind words to her and cheerfully gave her a \ndrink.  The old woman, who was really a fairy in disguise, was so \nblessed by the girl's sweet attitude that she rewarded her.\u0014\n    \"Every word you speak will turn into a jewel or a flower as it \nfalls from your mouth,\" she told the girl.  Arriving home, the young \nlady was berated for having taken so long at the well. When she \nstarted to explain what had happened, two pearls, three roses, and a \ndiamond came out of her mouth.\u0014\n   The mother was incredulous but could hardly deny the truth of her \ndaughter's story, given the number of gems and blossoms that kept \ndropping from her lips.  Immediately, she called the other daughter \nand told her to go draw water at the well, hoping that she might be \ngiven the same gift.  The sister hated chores and grumbled and griped \nall the way to the well.\u0014\n   The fairy was still there, but now she wore the disguise of a \nbeautiful wealthy woman.  Again she asked for a drink.  But this girl \nwas not at all like her sister.  She rudely and proudly refused to \ngive the lady a drink.  She got a reward, but it was that every time \nshe spoke toads and snakes came out of her mouth!\u0014\n   We like stories fo this type because justice is done.  It's only \nfair that the good are blessed and the wicked punished.  Real life, \nhowever, is seldom like that.  Our everyday existence is shadowed by \nunfairness--the unfairness of disease, broken relationships, \nfinancial reverses, unequal work loads.\u0014\n   [Hope Again by Charles Swindoll.

The boy said, \"Sure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   They started the game.  At first it seemed easy.  He jumped one \nafter another of the man's checkers.
