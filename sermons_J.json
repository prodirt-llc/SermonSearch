    "words": "And Joseph went up from Galilee to Bethlehem with Mary, his espoused \nwife, who was great with child.  And she brought forth a son and  \nwrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because \nthere was no room for them in the inn.  And the angel of the Lord \nspoke to the shepherds and said, \"I bring you tidings of great joy.  \nUnto you is born a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's a problem with the angel,\" said a Pharisee who happened to \nbe strolling by.  As he explained to Joseph, angels are widely \nregarded as religious symbols, and the stable was on public property \nwhere such symbols were not allowed to land or even hover.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And I have to tell you, this whole thing looks to me very much like a\u0014\nNativity scene,\" he said sadly.  \"That's a no-no, too.\"  Joseph had a \nbright idea.  \"What if I put a couple of reindeer over there near the \nox and ass?\" he said, eager to avoid sectarian strife.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That would definitely help,\" said the Pharisee, who knew as well as\u0014\nanyone that whenever a savior appeared, judges usually liked to be on \nthe safe side and surround it with deer or woodland creatures of some \nsort.\"Just to clinch it, throw in a candy cane and a couple of elves \nand snowmen, too,\" he said.  \"No court can resist that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMary asked, \"What does my son's birth have to do with snowmen?\"\u0014\n\"Snowpersons,\" cried a young woman, changing the subject before it \nveered dangerously toward religion.  Off to the side of the crowd, a \nPhilistine was painting the Nativity scene.  Mary complained that she \nand Joseph looked too tattered and worn in the picture.  \"Artistic \nlicense,\" he said.  \"I've got to show the plight of the haggard \nhomeless in a greedy, uncaring society in winter,\" he quipped.  \n\"We're not haggard or homeless.  The inn was just full,\" said Mary.  \n\"Whatever,\" said the painter.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo women began to argue fiercely.  One said she objected to Jesus'\u0014\nbirth \"because it privileged motherhood.\"  The other scoffed at virgin\u0014\nbirths, but said that if they encouraged more attention to diversity \nin\u0014\nfamily forms and the rights of single mothers, well, then, she was all\u0014\nfor them.  \"I'm not a single mother,\" Mary started to say, but she was\u0014\ncut off by a third woman who insisted that swaddling clothes are a \nform\u0014\nof child abuse, since they restrict the natural movement of babies.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the arrival of 10 child advocates, all trained to spot infant\u0014\nabuse and manger rash, Mary and Joseph were pushed to the edge of the \ncrowd, where arguments were breaking out over how many reindeer (or \nwhat mix of reindeer and seasonal sprites) had to be installed to\u0014\ncompensate for the infant's unfortunate religious character.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn older man bustled up, bowling over two merchants, who had been \nbusy debating whether an elf is the same as a fairy and whether the\u0014\nelf/fairy should be shaking hands with Jesus in the crib or merely\u0014\nstanding to the side, jumping around like a sports mascot.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'd hold off on the reindeer,\" the man said, explaining that the use\u0014\nof asses and oxen as picturesque backdrops for Nativity scenes \ncarries the subliminal message of human dominance.  He passed out two \nleaflets, one denouncing manger births as invasions of animal space, \nthe other arguing that stables are \"penned environments\" where \nanimals are incarcerated against their will.  He had no opinion about \nelves or candy canes.\u0014\n\u0014\nSigns declaring \"Free the Bethlehem 2\" began to appear, referring to\u0014\nthe obviously exploited ass and ox.  Someone said the halo on Jesus'\u0014\nhead was elitist.  Mary was exasperated.  \"And what about you, old\u0014\nmother?\" she said sharply to an elderly woman.  \"Are you here to \nattack the shepherds as prison guards for excluded species, maybe to \ncomplain that singing in Latin identifies us with our Roman \noppressors, or just to say that I should have skipped patriarchal \nreligiosity and joined some dumb new-age goddess religion?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"None of the above,\" said the woman, \"I just wanted to tell you that \nthe\u0014\nMagi are here.\"  Sure enough, the three wise men rode up.  The crowd\u0014\ngasped, \"They're all male!\"  And \"Not very multicultural!\"  \"Balthasar\u0014\nhere is black,\" said one of the Magi.  \"Yes, but how many of you are \ngay or disabled?\" someone shouted.  A committee was quickly formed to \nfind an impoverished lesbian wise-person among the halt and lame of \nBethlehem.\u0014\n\u0014\nA calm voice said, \"Be of good cheer, Mary, you have done well and \nyour son will change the world.\"  At last, a sane person, Mary \nthought. She turned to see a radiant and confident female face.  The \nwoman spoke again:  \"There is one thing, though.  Religious holidays \nare important, but can't we learn to celebrate them in ways that \nunite, not divide? For instance, instead of all this business about \n'Gloria in excelsis Deo,'why not just 'Season's Greetings'?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMary said, \"You mean my son has entered human history to deliver the \nmessage, 'Hello, it's winter'?\"  \"That's harsh, Mary,\" said the \nwoman.\"Remember, your son could make it big in midwinter festivals, \nif he doesn't push the religion thing too far.  Centuries from now, in\u0014\nnations yet unborn, people will give each other pricey gifts and have\u0014\nbig office parties on his birthday.  That's not chopped liver.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let me get back to you,\" Mary said.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS CALLS THE COMMON MAN",
    "words": "\u0014\nIn may 1855, an eighteen-year-old boy went to the deacons of the \u0014\nchurch in Boston. He had been raised in a Unitarian church, in \u0014\nalmost total ignorance of the gospel, but when he had moved to \u0014\nBoston to make his fortune, he began to attend a Bible-preaching \u0014\nchurch. Then, in April of 1855, his Sunday school teacher had come \u0014\ninto the store where he was working and simply and persuasively \u0014\nshared the Gospel and urged the young man to trust in the Lord \u0014\nJesus. He did, and now he was applying to join the church. One fact \u0014\nquickly became obvious. This young man was almost totally ignorant \u0014\nof biblical truth. One of the deacons asked him, \"Son, what has \u0014\nChrist done for us all--for you----which entitles him to our love? \u0014\nHis response was, \"I don't know. I think Christ has done a great \u0014\ndeal for us, but I don't think of anything in particular that I \u0014\nknow of.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHardly and impressive start. Years later his Sunday school teacher \u0014\nsaid of him: \"I can truly say that I have seen few persons whose \u0014\nminds were spiritually darker than was his when he  came into my \u0014\nSunday school class. I think the committee of the church seldom met \u0014\nan applicant for membership who seemed more unlikely ever to become \u0014\na Christian of clear and decided views of gospel truth, still less \u0014\nto fill any space of public or extended usefulness.\" Nothing \u0014\nhappened very quickly to change their minds. The deacons decided to \u0014\nput him on a year-long instruction program to teach him basic \u0014\nChristian truths. Perhaps they wanted to work on some of his other \u0014\nrough spots as well. Not only was he ignorant of spiritual truths, \u0014\nhe was only barely literate, and his spoken grammar was atrocious. \u0014\nThe year-long probation did not help very much. At his second \u0014\ninterview, there was only a minimal improvement in the quality of \u0014\nhis answers, but since it was obvious that he was a sincere and \u0014\ncommitted (if ignorant) Christian, they accepted him as a church \u0014\nmember. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next years, many people looked at that young man and were \u0014\nconvinced that God would never use a person like that. And in doing \u0014\nso they wrote off Dwight L. Moody. But God did not. By God's \u0014\ninfinite grace and persevering love, Moody was transformed into one \u0014\nof the most effective servants of God in church history, a man \u0014\nwhose impact is still with us today. \u0014\n\u0014\nGary Inrig, \"Hearts of Iron, Feet of Clay.\" \u0014\n________________________\u0014",

But that is about all. \u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Neusner, who recently wrote a book entitled \"A Rabbi Talks \u0014\nWith Jesus,\" imagines himself, as a Rabbi, meeting up with Jesus. \u0014\nHe says, \"Imagine walking on a dusty road on Galilee nearly 2,000 \u0014\nyears ago and meeting up with a small band of youngsters, led by a \u0014\nyoung man. The leader's presence catches your attention: he talks, \u0014\nthe others listen, respond, argue, obey--care what he says, follow \u0014\nhim. You don't know who the man is, but you know he makes a \u0014\ndifference to the people with him and to nearly everyone he meets. \u0014\nPeople respond, some with anger, some with admiration, a few with \u0014\ngenuine faith. But no one walks away uninterested in the man and \u0014\nthe things he says and does.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Neusner then says, \"I can see my self meeting this man, and, \u0014\nwith courtesy, arguing with him. It is my form of respect, the only \u0014\ncompliment I crave from others, the only serious tribute I pay to \u0014\nthe people I take seriously. I can see my self not only meeting and \u0014\narguing with Jesus, but challenging him on the bases of our shared \u0014\nTorah (The first five books of the Old Testament). I can also \u0014\nimagine myself saying, \"Friend, you go your way, I'll go mine, I \u0014\nwish you well--without me. Yours is not the Torah of Moses, and all \u0014\nI have from God, and all I ever need from God, is that one Torah \u0014\nfrom Moses.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNeusner concludes, \"We would meet, we would argue, we would part \u0014\nfriends--but we would part. he would have gone his way, to \u0014\nJerusalem and the place he believed God had prepared for him; I \u0014\nwould have gone my way, home to my wife and my children, my dog and \u0014\nmy garden. he would have gone his way to glory, I my way to my \u0014\nduties and my responsibilities\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI would say to Rabbi Neusner, You are correct. The Torah teaches \u0014\nthat we must sanctify life in the here and now of home and family, \u0014\ncommunity and society. But that same Torah, Rabbi, that you hold \u0014\ndear, told Abraham to sacrifice his own son and don't think that \u0014\nthat request was not real. It was a test of Abraham's faith. The \u0014\nthreat to that young boy's life was real! It was God who provided \u0014\nthe sacrifice, at the last moment, by an act of grace and \u0014\ncompassion, which spared his life. And that is the story foretold \u0014\nin the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The God of Jesus and the God of \u0014\nthat young boy Isaac are one in the same God but the difference is \u0014\nGod did not stop that second sacrifice! Why? Because it wasn't some \u0014\nyoung innocent boy being led to the slaughter; It was His young \u0014\nboy, Rabbi, who he himself sacrificed, so no young boys or girls \u0014\nwould ever again have to be sacrificed by this world of \u0014\ndisobedience and sin. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd here in lies the difference. Here is what the Greeks did not \u0014\nsee. Here is the what the disciples could not perceive. Here is \u0014\nwhat Pontius Pilate would not defend. The Cross. \"The cross is what \u0014\nseparates the Christ of Christianity from every other Jesus. In \u0014\nJudaism there is no precedent for a Messiah who dies, much less as \u0014\na criminal as Jesus did. In Islam, the story of Jesus' death is \u0014\nrejected as an affront to Allah himself. Hindus can accept only a \u0014\nJesus who passes into peaceful samadhi, a yogi who escapes the \u0014\ndegradation of death\" (Newsweek March 27, 2000). The figure of a \u0014\ncrucified Christ, says a leading Buddhist (Thich Nhat Hanh) \"is a \u0014\nvery painful image to me. It does not contain joy or peace, and \u0014\nthis does not do justice to Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Cross. There is not room in other religions for a Christ who \u0014\nexperiences the full burden of mortal existence. \"Sir, we would see \u0014\nJesus.\" Which Jesus do you see? Is there room in your view for a \u0014\ncrucified Christ? \u0014\n\u0014\nBrett Blair, www.sermonillustrations.com, April, 2000\u0014\n(Rabbi Neusner is Professor of Religion and theology at Bard's \u0014\nCollege).\u0014",

    "words": "Jesus Chose the \nCross\u0014\n\u0014\n   Tom Allen, a pastor and former Army Ranger, tells this story:\u0014\n\u0014\n      I finally saw \"Saving Private Ryan\" about two weeks ago.\u0014\n      I was extremely proud until the last minute of the movie.\u0014\n\u0014\n      As the movie began, I was proud watching the Rangers take\u0014\n      Omaha Beach. Then the story begins when they receive a\u0014\n      mission to go deep into enemy territory to save Private\u0014\n      Ryan. They hit skirmish after skirmish, and some of them\u0014\n      are killed along the way. They finally get to where\u0014\n      Private Ryan is holed up, and they say, \"Come with us.\u0014\n      We've come to save you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      He says, \"I'm not going. I have to stay here because\u0014\n      there's a big battle coming up, and if I leave my men\u0014\n      they're all going to die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      What do the Rangers say? \"We'll stay here and fight with\u0014\n      you.\" They all stay and fight, and it's gory and hard,\u0014\n      and almost everyone dies except Private Ryan. At the end,\u0014\n      one of the main characters--Tom Hanks--is sitting on the\u0014\n      ground. He's been shot and he's dying. The battle has\u0014\n      been won.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Private Ryan leans over to him, and Tom Hanks whispers\u0014\n      something to him. Everyone in the theater is crying\u0014\n      because Tom Hanks was shot; I was crying because of what\u0014\n      he said--it was so terrible. Private Ryan bent down and\u0014\n      Tom Hanks said, \"Earn this.\" The reason that made me\u0014\n      angry is no Ranger would ever say, \"Earn this.\" Why?\u0014\n      Because the Ranger motto for the past 200 years has not\u0014\n      been \"Earn this.\" The Ranger motto for the past 200 years\u0014\n      has been *Sua sponte,* \"I chose this.\" I volunteered\u0014\n      for this.\u0014\n\u0014\n      So, when Private Ryan bent down, if Tom Hanks was really\u0014\n      a Ranger he would have said, \"*Sua sponte,* I chose this.\u0014\n      This is free. You don't pay anything for this. I give up\u0014\n      my life for you. That's my job.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      And so when you look at the cross and see Jesus hanging\u0014\n      there, what you do not hear is \"Earn this.\" You never\u0014\n      hear Jesus say, \"Earn this.\" He doesn't say, \"I've given\u0014\n      everything for you. Now you need to gut it out for me.\"\u0014\n      What he says is \"*Sua sponte.*\" I volunteered for this.\u0014\n      You don't have to pay anything for it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Citation:\u0014\n   Tom Allen, pastor of Grace Church, Seattle\u0014",

    "words": "John Lennon and Jesus\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo new books on John Lennon claim the ex-Beatle experienced a \u0014\nbrief period as a born-again Christian during the 1970s. While \u0014\nliving the life of a virtual recluse in New York's Dakota \u0014\nBuilding, Lennon became an avid viewer and reader of American \u0014\nTV evangelists and, at some point during 1977, declared that he \u0014\nhad been saved.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Rosen in \"Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon\" \u0014\n(published by Soft Skull Press) cites Billy Graham as the main \u0014\ninfluence, whereas Geoffrey Giuliano in \"Lennon in America\" \u0014\n(published by Cooper Square Press) mentions both Graham and Pat \u0014\nRobertson. Both agree that the period, during which Lennon \u0014\npeppered his everyday conversation with \"Praise the Lord\" and \u0014\n\"Thank you, Jesus,\" was brief. Giuliano says it lasted for \"a \u0014\nmatter of months.\" Rosen suggests it was \"about two weeks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth writers have based their information on sources close to \u0014\nLennon and on the singer's personal diaries, which circulated \u0014\nshortly after his death and were then retrieved by his widow, \u0014\nYoko Ono. The existence of the diaries has been known for some \u0014\ntime, but so far no writer had divulged their contents. Because \u0014\nof legal problems, neither Rosen nor Giuliano has been able to \u0014\nquote directly from the diaries, but both have drawn on the \u0014\ninformation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One day [Lennon] had an epiphanyhe allowed himself to be \u0014\ntouched by the love of Jesus Christ, and it drove him to tears \u0014\nof joy and ecstasy,\" writes Rosen, a New York journalist \u0014\nbriefly employed by Ono. \"He drew a picture of a crucifix; he \u0014\nwas born again, and the experience was such a kick that he had \u0014\nto share it with Yoko.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGiuliano, who has written extensively about the Beatles, \u0014\npinpoints the conversion to a Palm Sunday and says that Lennon \u0014\nwas so moved by a series about Jesus broadcast on Robertson's \u0014\nCBN that he broke down in tears. In the following weeks, he \u0014\nattended church services and took his son, Sean, to a Christian \u0014\ntheater performance. He even called The 700 Club help line to \u0014\nrequest prayer for his health and troubled marriage. \"He prayed \u0014\nfor forgiveness when he stepped on insects or snapped at the \u0014\nmaid,\" Giuliano writes. \"He became convinced that Jesus was \u0014\npersonally protecting Sean.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOno, whose first husband, Anthony Cox,became an evangelical \u0014\nChristian in the 1970s, was displeased with Lennon's changed \u0014\noutlook. Giuliano claims Lennon began to challenge her interest \u0014\nin the occult and was disappointed she wouldn't join him in \u0014\nwatching Graham's telecasts.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The dramatic conversion worried Yoko,\" Giuliano writes. \"She \u0014\nfeared John's new faith would clash with her own ideas about \u0014\nspiritualism and threaten her iron hold over him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end Ono won. In his final years, the man best known for \u0014\nhis lines \"Imagine there's no heaven / It's easy if you try\" \u0014\nwas living a life dictated by astrologers, numerologists, \u0014\nclairvoyants, psychics, herbalists, and tarot-card readers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe one song that Lennon wrote during his born-again period has \u0014\nnever been released. \"You Saved My Soul,\" which recounts being \u0014\nprevented from attempting suicide while staying in a Tokyo \u0014\nhotel, is known only to Beatles bootleggers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Citation:\u0014\n   Steve Turner, \"The Ballad of John and Jesus,\" \u0014\n   Christianity Today (6-12-00), p.86\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN'S ACCOUNT OF THE FEEDING OF THE 5,000",
    "words": "\u0014\nJohn's account of the miraculous feeding is curious, when compared to\u0014\nthe synoptic gospels, for a number of reasons. John links the feeding \nto\u0014\nthe story of Jesus' walking on water, and to Peter's confession of\u0014\nfaith. Probably, John means thereby to make a strong point regarding \nthe\u0014\nidentity of Jesus as the exalted Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, we should take note that this feeding is set by John in the\u0014\ncontext of Passover. In John's gospel, Jesus cleanses the temple at\u0014\nPassover and uses the occasion to speak of his impending death (John \n2).\u0014\nLater, in John 13, Jesus will speak again of his death in the context \nof\u0014\na Passover meal with his disciples.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Luke's account of the miraculous feeding, as well as Mark's, \nthis\u0014\nmeal is not presented by John as a sign of Jesus' compassion for the\u0014\nhungry multitudes. Rather, this feeding is used by Jesus as an\u0014\nopportunity to perform a sign that will be considerably greater than \nthe\u0014\ncrowds expected. This is a typical Johnannine moment. In John's \ngospel,\u0014\nthey come to Jesus asking for \"water,\" and he offers \"living water.\"\u0014\nThey come hankering for bread, and his gives them \"bread from heaven.\"\u0014\nSo again, in today's passage from John, we are alerted that \"bread\"\u0014\nmeans considerably more than what we mean when we say, \"bread.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe come to Jesus with our bodily, carnal, immediate needs only to be\u0014\nsurprised that Jesus seems to be about more than the meeting of our\u0014\nneeds. Nothing so satisfies us as a good meal. After their miraculous\u0014\nmeal, the crowd immediately thinks of monarchy. Moses earlier gave\u0014\nbread, manna, in the wilderness of the exodus (Deut. 18:18). They hail\u0014\nJesus as the new king.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn offers us an exalted Christology. Jesus will not be controlled or\u0014\nutilized by the crowd for our purposes. He will not be jerked around \nin\u0014\nfulfillment of our wants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Willimon, Notes from a sermon entitled: \"What Are You Looking\u0014\nFor?\", July 27, 1997, John 6:1-21.\u0014",

Pharisees believed that touching an\u0014\nunclean person polluted the one who touched. But when Jesus touched a\u0014\nperson with leprosy, Jesus did not become soiled--the leprous became\u0014\nclean. When an immoral woman washed Jesus' feet, she went away \nforgiven\u0014\nand transformed. When he defied custom to enter a pagan's house, the\u0014\npagan's servant was healed. In word and in deed Jesus was proclaiming \na\u0014\nradically new gospel of grace: to get clean a person did not have to\u0014\njourney to Jerusalem, offer sacrifices, and undergo purification\u0014\nrituals. All a person had to do was follow Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, Jesus moved the emphasis from God's holiness (exclusive) to\u0014\nGod's mercy (inclusive). Instead of the message \"No undesirables\u0014\nallowed,\" he proclaimed, \"In God's kingdom there are no undesirables.\"\u0014\nBy going out of his way to meet with the Gentiles, eat with sinners, \nand\u0014\ntouch the sick, he extended the realm of God's mercy.

Fonda, 62, said that although she \nattends Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, she has not \njoined any congregation. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter being raised in an agnostic environment, she said, she began to \nfeel a need to be spiritual about 10 years ago. I began to pray, \nshe said. I felt the hand of God on my shoulder.\u0014\nFonda described media executive Ted Turner, from whom she has been \nseparated since January, as a fallen angel who once considered \nbecoming a missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe felt betrayed by God when his sister died horrifically from lupus \nwhen he was about 19, she said. And it turned him hostile. Fonda \nalso described the challenge of being both a celebrity and a person \nof faith.It's been difficult, because when you're famous and the \nword gets out that you're a Christian, every church is saying, 'Even \nJane Fonda.' People come up to me in airports and throw their arms \naround me.\u0014",

    "words": "Thomas Jefferson on Race, Revolution, and Morality History Revisited \nand Revised\u0014\n                                                                  By \nEdwin S. Gaustad\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither saint nor sinner, Jefferson like the rest of us is a \npuzzling and paradoxical mixture of the two.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Edwin S. Gaustad is Professor Emeritus, The University of \nCalifornia, Riverside. A graduate of Baylor University, 1947, and \nBrown University, Ph.D. in 1951, he is the author of a dozen books in \nAmerica's religious history, the latest of which is Sworn on the \nAltar of God: A Religious Biography of Thomas Jefferson published by \nEerdmans in 1996 for $15. He is the recipient of Baylor's \nDistinguished Alumnus Award.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe textbook Thomas Jefferson lingers in our minds: author of the \nDeclaration of Independence, third president of the United States, \nand a man of wide-ranging scientific and architectural interests. If \nthe textbook writer still had a few lines to spare, one might learn \nsomething of Jefferson's strong dedication to religious freedom: on \nhis tombstone he ranked his writing of the Virginia Statute for \nReligious Freedom with his composition of the Declaration of \nIndependence. And that's about all that the textbooks told us; we \nperhaps feel lucky to remember that much as we wander around the \nJefferson Memorial in Washington, D. C.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut historians have been busy of late, re-examining many facets of \nJefferson's life and suggesting that major re-evaluations are in \norder. Some have even gone so far as to argue that the Jefferson \nMemorial is a mistake and the profile on Mount Rushmore an \nembarrassment. Other historians strongly disagree, and so the books, \narticles, talk shows, and PBS specials pour forth. So, what is the \nfuss all about? Contention has been largely concentrated in three \nareas, each of which will be examined in turn.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. First, Jefferson and race, or more narrowly, Jefferson and \nslavery. That Jefferson was, along with his Virginia land-owning \nneighbors, a slaveholder has long been duly acknowledged. But \nespecially in the last two decades, far more attention has been given \nto this fact and to the inconsistencies or contradictions in the \nJeffersonian character suggested by this circumstance, along with \nseveral others that are closely related. For example, Jefferson \n(unlike Washington) did not free most of his slaves during his \nlifetime, nor in his will did he provide for any general \nemancipation. Moreover, while he condemned slavery as a brutal and \ninhumane institution, he did little, particularly in his later years, \nto threaten or overturn the system. And finally, in his Notes on the \nState of Virginia (published in 1787), Jefferson on the basis of \nlimited observation advanced the notion, as a suspicion only, that \nthe blacks...are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of \nbody and mind. This moved Jefferson beyond the status of just a \nslave-holder to that of a racist.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1977 John Chester Miller published The Wolf by the Ears:\u0014\nThomas Jefferson and Slavery, here he recounted with both fairness \nand thoroughness the racist assumptions of the Anglo-Saxon society of \nwhich Jefferson was all too much a part. Even other Enlightenment \nfigures (David Hume, for example) made presumably scientific \nobservations regarding the denizens of tropical climes as opposed to \nthose who lived in the temperate zones. And, as Miller notes, only by \nthinking of blacks as inherently inferior could Jefferson soften the \nhaunting guilt with which the institution of slavery filled him. \nSince 1977, several other historians have gone beyond Miller in \nfinding little if anything to redeem Jefferson from the stigma of \nslaveholder and racist. In the words of Paul Finkelman, while \nJefferson spoke as a liberty-loving man of the Enlightenment, he \nacted as a self-indulgent and negro-phobic Virginia planter.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Revisions regarding Jefferson and revolution concern not his \nactivity in the American Revolution but his attitude toward the \nrevolution that erupted in France in 1789. The major reviser here is \nConor Cruise O'Brien who in a recent book (The Long Affair:\u0014\nThomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, published in 1996) sees \nJefferson's dedication to liberty as being one without rational \nlimits or sensible discriminations. Jefferson, O'Brien writes, would \ncontinue to have faith in the French Revolution, no matter what \natrocities had been or would be committed. For this revolution had \nbecome, for Jefferson, not an historical movement to weigh and \nanalyze, but a mystical article of faith impervious to actual events.\u0014\n\u0014\n Because Jefferson's support of France did not waver in the early \n1790s, O'Brien is willing to see him as even the patron saint of \nterrorism in general. The author takes as his sacred text a portion \nof a letter that Jefferson wrote in 1793 to his sometime private \nsecretary, William Short, regarding the excesses of the French \nRevolution: My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of \nthe martyrs to this cause, but rather than it should have failed, I \nwould have seen half the earth desolated. O'Brien's entire book can \nbe understood as a thundering exposition of that text. And in his \nEpilogue he concluded that Jefferson embraced a wild liberty, \nabsolute, untrammeled, universal. Since any violence committed in \nthe name of liberty is justifiable, O'Brien asserts, We cannot even \nsay categorically that Jefferson would have condemned the bombing of \nthe Federal building in Oklahoma City and the destruction of its \noccupants. Here history may not be revisited, but it is certainly \nrevised.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Any attention to the subject of Jefferson and morality leads, \nsooner or later, to a consideration of the alleged affair between \nJefferson and Sally Hemings, his slave and house servant both in \nParis and back in Monticello. In 1802, a political operative named \nJames Callender produced a campaign document designed to advance the \nfortunes of John Adams's Federalist Party and dash the prospects of \nThomas Jefferson's Republican Party. The Sally Hemings story was \ntailored and designed to do the trick. And so, by means of tabloid \njournalism, Black Sally entered into the pages of American history, \nkept alive through the election of Jefferson to a second term as \npresident in 1804, but largely dropped from view thereafter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen in 1974, Fawn Brodie published Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate \nHistory, the centerpiece of which was a more sustained effort to \nelevate the Hemings affair to the level of historical truth. Brodie's \ntechnique drew much from the psychohistorical methods current at the \ntime. And though she adduced no new historical data regarding Black \nSally, she wrote well and her book proved to be enormously popular. \nSo popular, in fact, that a leading author and newspaper editor, \nVirginius Dabney, took up the implied challenge to the third \npresident's honor by writing in 1981 The Jefferson Scandals: A \nRebuttal. Dabney considered Brodie's central thesis to be unproved \nand unprovable, a position that he defended at some length. And \nthere, one might be tempted to say, the matter rests. But, in fact, \nthis titillating matter does not rest, as every new biography must \ndeal in some way with the alleged affair. Most recently, Annette \nGordon-Read has written Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An \nAmerican Controversy (1997), offering further proof, should any be \nneeded, that the story stays alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter much revisiting and revising, where do we stand on these three \nissues in Jefferson's life and thought? Let us revisit each item.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. On slavery and race, it must certainly be acknowledged that the \nconsciousness of historians in general has been markedly raised \n(though not very generally raised with respect to Jefferson and \nfeminism). One cannot and must not gloss over either his words or his \ndeeds with respect to African Americans and to slavery. Nor, on the \nother hand, should one forget that his words in his draft of the \nDeclaration of Independence condemning the slave trade were too \nstrong for the Continental Congress to accept. Thus, they were \ndeleted. Also, his draft of the Northwest Ordinance called for the \nexclusion of slavery in lands both north and south of the Ohio River. \nHis proscription on territory south of the Ohio was deleted. And as \npresident in his second term, Jefferson moved to abolish the slave \ntrade on January 1, 1808, the earliest date that the Constitution \nallowed. He thoughtor allowed himself to hope that abolition of the \nslave trade would gradually lead to the abolition of slavery itself, \na hope that tragically proved to be in vain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that in his later years, Jefferson pulled back from some \nof his more radical, abolition-sounding rhetoric with respect to \nslavery. And in 1820 he sadly wrote that We have the wolf by the \nears: and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is \nin one scale, and self-preservation in the other. The wonder is not \nthat slavery and racism had its defenders in late 18th or early 19th \ncentury America, and that Jefferson is among them. The more startling \nwonder is that at the end of the 20th century, racism still pervades \nthe American scene. Something about beams and motes comes to mind.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. On Jefferson's fanatical defense of the French Revolution, O'Brien \nappears to be engaging in that bit of revisionism largely alone. \nJefferson did feel strongly about liberty, a fact for which most \nAmericans are profoundly grateful. He did shock both Abigail and John \nAdams when he took Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts in 1786 more \ncalmly than they. He even justified the behavior of the rebels, \nnoting that no country preserves its liberties unless rulers are \nwarned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of \nresistance. To Abigail Adams he wrote in 1787 that The spirit of \nresistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, that I \nwish it always to be kept alive. It will often be exercised when \nwrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all. Then he added, \nI like a little rebellion now and then. It is like a storm in the \natmosphere.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThat kind of talk surely unsettled Conor Cruise O'Brien, and it may \nunsettle many others as well. In any political campaign where the \nsides arrayed against each other are law and order on the one hand \nversus freedom and reform on the other, one need not doubt where \nJefferson would stand. But to equate his love of liberty and of \npopular democracy with mindless acts of terrorism and destruction is \nitself a mindless act. Jefferson believed in human possibilities, in \ncivilization's steady advance, and in an empire of liberty. To him, \nthe obstacles to such a progression were kings, priests, and nobles: \nthat is, a state and a society where resistance was never possible, \nwhere freedom was always treasonable. A little rebellion now and \nthen could remind Americans of their roots in revolution, even as it \ncould remind them of democracy's ugly alternative.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Was Jefferson a moral man, or a hypocritical lecher and consummate \ndeceiver? First, let it be noted that Jefferson took moral matters \nvery seriously. His so-called Bible consisted chiefly in the \nethical teachings of Jesus; cutting away all miracle and metaphysical \nsubtlety, the pure diamonds of moral instruction and inspiration \nremained. Denominations disagreed and fought over dogmanot over \nmorality, Jefferson observed. And for him religion's moral dimension \nwas what mattered; all rational human beings, whatever denomination, \ncould unite on these essential precepts. God has implanted a sure \nmoral instinct into every human breast, Jefferson argued, even as He \nhas granted the ability to hear, taste, smell, and see. To encounter \nthe occasional moral midget or moral deviant no more disproved \nnature's prevailing gifts than encountering a blind man suggested \nthat God withheld the blessings of sight from humanity at large.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith respect more specifically to the alleged liaison with Sally \nHemings which resulted, according to the true believers, in five \nchildren born of this union, one need recall that Jefferson had a \nhorror of miscegenation. As he wrote to his neighbor Edward Coles in \n1814, The amalgamation of white with blacks produces a degradation \nto which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human \ncharacter, can innocently consent. If and when blacks were to be \nfreed, they needed to construct their own society somewhere else, \nperhaps in the Caribbean or in Africa. In addition to the moral \nquestion of an illicit relationship with a slave, one can add the \npolitical question of the ultimate fate of a nation where \nmiscegenation routinely prevailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ  What is the historical evidence for a sexual relationship between \nThomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings? Simply put,\u0014\nhistory cannot answer this question. One must answer it on other \ngrounds: the character of Thomas Jefferson (about which we know\u0014\na great deal), the character of Sally Hemings (about which we know \nvirtually nothing), the logical probabilities of the circumstances, \nand the political realities of the time. In this welter of \nuncertainties, I find the most helpful resolution to lie in the \ncharacter of Jefferson himself. A man of great discipline and \nself-restraint, he was not a member of the if it feels good, do it \nschool of thoughtless action. He calculated carefully the paths. \nahead, measuring his behavior almost as precisely as he measured the \nrooms of the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg. Furthermore, \nJefferson in this realm was, if anything, a prude. He advised married \nwomen against dancing because of the possible ambiguity of issue \nthat might result. He advised young men not to go to Paris until at \nleast thirty years of age, lest their morals be corrupted. This is \nthe man who supposedly had a thirty-eight-year relationship with his \nenslaved concubine? It boggles the mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, in all the revisiting and revising of Jeffersonian \nscholarship, it is certainly not the case that we are left right back \nwhere we started from. Far from it. Rather, we are left with a \nJefferson far more complex and nuanced, far more human and fallible, \nthan we would have ever suspected from the text book accounts. \nNeither saint nor sinner, Jeffersonlike the rest of usis a puzzling \nand paradoxical mixture of the two.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwin S.

    "title": "JAMES A. GARFIELD",
    "words": "James Garfield, the son of a poor farmer, was born in Cuyahoga \nCounty, Ohio, on 19th November, 1831. After a brief formal\u0014\n      education, Garfield worked as a helmsman on the Ohio Canal. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield returned to education and studied at Geauga Seminary \n(1849-51) and the Hiram Institute (1851-54). After graduating\u0014\n      from Williams College in 1858, Garfield became professor of \nancient languages and literature in Hiram College. At the age of 25,\u0014\n      Garfield became president of Hiram College. He also became \ninvolved in politics and joined the Free Soil Party. \u0014\n\u0014\n      A strong opponent of slavery, Garfield was one of the founders \nof the Republican Party and in 1859 was elected to the Ohio\u0014\n      legislature. On the outbreak of the American Civil War Garfield \njoined the Union Army and was commissioned as a lieutenant\u0014\n      colonel. He helped recruit the 42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry and \ncommanded a brigade at Shiloh (April, 1862). After fighting at\u0014\n      Chickamuga (September, 1863), Garfield was promoted to the rank \nof major general. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield left the army after he was elected to the 38th \nCongress and over the next few years became a prominent member of the\u0014\n      Radical Republicans. This group favoured the abolition of \nslavery and believed that freed slaves should have complete equality\u0014\n      with white citizens.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield opposed the policies of President Andrew Johnson and \nargued in Congress that Southern plantations should be taken\u0014\n      from their owners and divided among the former slaves. He also \nattacked Johnson when he attempted to veto the extension of\u0014\n      the Freeman's Bureau, the Civil Rights Bill and the \nReconstruction Acts. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In November, 1867, the Judiciary Committee voted 5-4 that \nAndrew Johnson be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.\u0014\n      The majority report contained a series of charges including \npardoning traitors, profiting from the illegal disposal of railroads \nin\u0014\n      Tennessee, defying Congress, denying the right to reconstruct \nthe South and attempts to prevent the ratification of the\u0014\n      Fourteenth Amendment. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield supported Johnson's impeachment but was unhappy that \nhis replacement would be Benjamin Wade. Garfield warned\u0014\n      that Wade was \"a man of violent passions, extreme opinions and \nnarrow views who was surrounded by the worst and most\u0014\n      violent elements in the Republican Party.\" Despite this \nobjections, Garfield voted for impeachment. However, the 35 to 19 \nvote,\u0014\n      was one short of the required two-thirds majority for \nconviction. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield remained a member of Congress for seventeen years. \nDuring this time her served as chairman of the Banking\u0014\n      Committee (1869-71) and in 1880 was asked to organize the \ncampaign of John Sherman, who was attempting to become the\u0014\n      Republican Party presidential candidate. During the campaign \nGarfield was so impressive that he became one of the candidates\u0014\n      and after 36 ballots defeated Ulysses S. Grant and James G. \nBlaine for the nomination. To preserve party unity, the\u0014\n      conservative Chester Arthur, became the vice-presidential \ncandidate. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The Democratic Party nominated Winfield S. Hancock, who like \nGarfield had been a senior officer during the American Civil\u0014\n      War. It was a close election and Garfield won by 4,449,053 \nvotes to 4,442,030. In his inaugural speech Garfield returned to the\u0014\n      issue that had first brought him into politics: \"The elevation \nof the Negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is \nthe\u0014\n      most important political change we have known since the \nadoption of the Constitution of 1787. It has liberated the master as\u0014\n      well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled \nboth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Garfield attempted to select a Cabinet that would retain the \nunity of the Republican Party. However, Roscoe Conking, the leader\u0014\n      of the Stalwart group, was unhappy with some of Garfield's \nchoices and refused to serve in his administration. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On 2nd July, 1881, Garfield was waiting for a train in \nWashington with Robert Lincoln, his Secretary of War, when Charles J.\u0014\n      Guiteau, shot him in the back. A supporter of Roscoe Conking, \nGuiteau, surrendered to the police with the words: \"I am a\u0014\n      Stalwart. Chester Arthur is now the president of the United \nStates. After a four month struggle James Garfield died on 19th\u0014\n      September, 1881 and Chester Arthur became president. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (1) James Garfield, letter to Burke A. Hinsdale (15th January, \n1861) \u0014\n\u0014\n      I do not now see any way this side a miracle of God which can \navoid a civil war with all its attendant horrors. Peaceable\u0014\n      dissolution is utterly impossible. Indeed, I cannot say as I \nwould wish it possible. To make the concessions demanded by the\u0014\n      South would be hypocritical and sinful. They would neither be \nobeyed nor respected. I am inclined to believe that the sin of\u0014\n      slavery is one of which it may be said that \"without the \nshedding of blood there is no remission. I believe the doom of \nslavery is\u0014\n      drawing near - let war come - and the slaves will get a vague \nnotion that it is waged for them. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (2) James Garfield met Abraham Lincoln for the first time in \n1861. He wrote a letter to Burke A. Hinsdale describing\u0014\n      his thoughts on the man (17th February, 1861) \u0014\n\u0014\n      On the whole I am greatly pleased with the man. He clearly \nshows his want of culture - and the marks of western life. But there\u0014\n      is no touch of affectation in him and he has a peculiar power \nof impressing you that he is frank, direct and thoroughly honest.\u0014\n      His remarkable good sense, simple and condensed style of \nexpression and evident marks of indomitable will, give me great\u0014\n      hopes for the country. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (3) James Garfield, like many officers in the Army of the \nPotomac, was highly critical of his commander, General\u0014\n      George McClellan (13th October, 1862) \u0014\n\u0014\n      All my former opinions of McClellan are confirmed. His late \ncampaign in Maryland has been most shameful. He has lain\u0014\n      perfectly idle 27 days since the last battle with a force \nalmost twice the number of the rebel army and has been constantly been\u0014\n      asking for reinforcements. All three (Edwin Stanton, Abraham \nLincoln, Henry Halleck) desire to get rid of McClellan and two or\u0014\n      three times have been at the point of removing him, but have \nlacked the courage. Stanton would have done it but was not\u0014\n      allowed - the President would have done it, but feared the \nBorder States and the army - Halleck would have done it, but claimed\u0014\n      the responsibility should not be placed on his shoulders. It is \nstill being agitated and I think it is to be done soon, but I believe\u0014\n      they are waiting for the elections to be over - lest it may \nstrengthen the Peace Democrats who will praise McClellan to the\u0014\n      skies. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (4) Henry Villard worked for the New York Tribune during the \nAmerican Civil War. In his memoirs he wrote about\u0014\n      James Garfield, a man he met for the first time in 1863.\u0014\n\u0014\n      General Garfield, not much over thirty years old, presented a \nfar more commanding and attractive appearance than General\u0014\n      Rosecrans. Very nearly, if not fully, six feet high, well \nformed, of erect carriage, with a big head of sandy hair, a \nstrong-featured,\u0014\n      broad and frank countenance, set in a full beard and lighted up \nby large blue eyes and a most pleasing smile, he looked like a\u0014\n      distinguished personage. his manners were very gentlemanly and \ncordial, and altogether he produced and sustained a most\u0014\n      agreeable impression.\u0014",

    "title": "JEFFERSON DAVIS",
    "words": "Jefferson Davis, the tenth son of Samuel Emory Davis, a plantation \nowner from Missouri, was born in 3rd June, 1808. At seven\u0014\n      he was sent to a boarding school in Kentucky and six years \nlater entered Transylvania College, Lexington. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In 1824 Davis entered the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point. After graduating in 1828 he served as a lieutenant in the\u0014\n      Wisconsin Territory and took part in the Black Hawk War. Davis \nresigned his commission in 1835 and became a planter to\u0014\n      Vicksburg. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis entered Congress in 1845 for Mississippi and served with \ndistinction in the Mexican War (1846-47). Davis, a member of the\u0014\n      Democratic Party, successfully won election to the Senate in \n1848. His father-in-law, Zachary Taylor, had been elected as\u0014\n      president. A member of the Whig Pary, Taylor supported the \nadmission of California as a free state. Davis disagreed and led the\u0014\n      pro-slavery faction in Congress. After the death of Taylor, \nDavis served as Secretary of War. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In 1860 the R candidate, Abraham Lincoln was elected president \nof the USA. Between election day in November and the\u0014\n      inauguration the following March, seven states seceded from the \nUnion: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,\u0014\n      Louisiana and Texas. Representatives from these seven states \nquickly established a new political organization, the Confederate\u0014\n      States of America. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On 8th February the Confederate States of America adopted a \nconstitution and within ten days had elected Davis as its\u0014\n      president and Alexander Stephens, as vice-president. \nMontgomery, Alabama, became its capital and the Stars and Bars was\u0014\n      adopted as its flag. Davis was also authorized to raise 100,000 \ntroops. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis took the view that after a state seceded, federal forts \nbecame the property of the state. On 12th April, 1861, General Pierre \nT.\u0014\n      Beauregard demanded that Major Robert Anderson surrender Fort \nSumter in Charleston harbour. Anderson replied that he would be\u0014\n      willing to leave the fort in two days when his supplies were \nexhausted. Beauregard rejected this offer and ordered his Confederate\u0014\n      troops to open fire. After 34 hours of bombardment the fort was \nseverely damaged and Anderson was forced to surrender. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On hearing the news, Abraham Lincoln called a special session \nof Congress and proclaimed a blockade of Gulf of Mexico ports.\u0014\n      This strategy was based on the Anaconda Plan developed by \nGeneral Winfield Scott, the commanding general of the Union Army. It\u0014\n      involved the army occupying the line of the Mississippi and \nblockading Confederate ports. Scott believed if this was done\u0014\n      successfully the South would negotiate a peace deal. However, \nat the start of the war, the US Navy had only a small number of\u0014\n      ships and was in no position to guard all 3,000 miles of \nSouthern coast. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Major General Irvin McDowell was given command of the Union \nArmy and in July, 1861, Lincoln sent him to take Richmond, the\u0014\n      new base the Confederate government. On 21st July McDowell \nengaged the Confederate Army at Bull Run. The Confederate troops\u0014\n      led by Joseph E. Johnson, Thomas Stonewall Jackson, James Jeb \nStuart, Jubal Early, E. Kirby Smith, Braxton Bragg and Pierre T.\u0014\n      Beauregard, easily defeated the inexperienced Union Army. The \nSouth had won the first great battle of the war and the Northern\u0014\n      casualties totaled 1,492 with another 1,216 missing. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In January 1862 the Union Army began to push the Confederates \nsouthward. The Confederate Army now regrouped and Albert S.\u0014\n      Johnson and Pierre T. Beauregard reunited their armies near the \nTennessee-Mississippi line. With 55,000 men they now\u0014\n      outnumbered the forces led by Ulysses S. Grant. On 6th April \nthe Confederate Army attacked Grant's army at Shiloh. Taken by\u0014\n      surprise, Grant's army suffered heavy losses until the arrival \nof General Don Carlos Buell and reinforcements. \u0014\n\u0014\n      During the fighting Albert S. Johnson was killed and the new \ncommander, Pierre T. Beauregard, decided to retreat to Corinth,\u0014\n      Mississippi. Shiloh was the greatest battle so far of the Civil \nWar. The Union Army suffered 13,000 casualties and the Confederates\u0014\n      lost 10,000. However, the Union Army, with the arrival of \nGeneral Henry Halleck and his troops, were now the stronger and had \nlittle\u0014\n      difficulty driving Beauregard out of Corinth. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The difference in manpower between the two sides now becoming \nmore noticeable. Whereas the Union consisted of 23 states and\u0014\n      22,000,000 people, the Confederacy had only 9,000,000 people \n(including 3,500,000 slaves). Davis now announced that the South\u0014\n      could not win the war without conscription. In April the \nConfederate Congress passed the Conscription Act which drafted white \nmen\u0014\n      between eighteen and thirty-five for three years' service. \u0014\n\u0014\n      By the summer of 1862 the main Union Army under George \nMcClellan was ready to march on Richmond. McClellan and his\u0014\n      115,000 men encountered the Confederate Army at Williamsburg on \n4th May. McClellan moved his troops into the Shenandoah\u0014\n      Valley and along with John C. Fremont, Irvin McDowell and \nNathaniel Banks surrounded Thomas Stonewall Jackson and his 17,000\u0014\n      man army. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Thomas Stonewall Jackson was under orders from President \nJefferson Davis to try and delay the attack on Richmond. Jackson\u0014\n      attacked John C. Fremont at Cross Keys before turning on Irvin \nMcDowell at Port Republic. Jackson then rushed his troops east to\u0014\n      join up with Joseph E. Johnson and the Confederate forces \nfighting George McClellan in the suburbs the city. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In May, 1862, General Joseph E. Johnson with some 41,800 men \ncounter-attacked McClellan's slightly larger army at Fair Oaks.\u0014\n      The Union Army lost 5,031 men and the Confederate Army 6,134. \nJohnson was badly wounded during the battle and General\u0014\n      Robert E. Lee now took command of the Confederate forces. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Four months later George McClellan faced Robert E. Lee and \nThomas Stonewall Jackson again at Antietam. On 17th September,\u0014\n      McClellan and Major General Ambrose Burnside attacked with over \n75,300 troops against 37,330 Confederate soldiers. Lee held out\u0014\n      until Ambrose Hill and reinforcements arrived. It was the most \ncostly day of the war with the Union Army having 2,108 killed, 9,549\u0014\n      wounded and 753 missing. The Confederates, who were now have \nserious difficulty replacing losses, had 2,700 killed, 9,024\u0014\n      wounded and 2,000 missing. Abraham Lincoln now postponed \nattempts to capture Richmond and ordered McClellan back to\u0014\n      Washington with the words: \"My dear McClellan: If you don't \nwant to use the Army I should like to borrow it for a while.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      Although far from an overwhelming victory, Lincoln realized the \nsignificance of Antietam and on 22nd September, 1862, he felt\u0014\n      strong enough to issue his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln \ntold the nation that from the 1st January, 1863, all slaves in states\u0014\n      or parts of states, still in rebellion, would be freed. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Throughout the autumn of 1862 the Confederate Army continued to \nmake progress in Kentucky. However, in September, General E.\u0014\n      Kirby Smith was halted by Union troops led by General Don \nCarlos Buell. in Covington. The following month General Braxton Bragg\u0014\n      installed a Confederate government in Frankfort, Kentucky. \nHowever, this was short-lived and Bragg came under attack at \nPerryville\u0014\n      (Chaplin Hills). During the battle Don Carlos Buell lost 4,211 \nmen (845 killed, 2,851 wounded, and 515 missing) whereas Braxton\u0014\n      Bragg lost 3,396 (510 killed, 2635 wounded and 251 missing). \nAfter the battle Bragg was forced to retreat back to Tennessee. \u0014\n\u0014\n      During the summer of 1863 Robert E. Lee decided to take the war \nto the north. The Confederate Army reached Gettysburg,\u0014\n      Pennsylvania on 1st July. The town was quickly taken but the \nUnion Army, led by Major General George Meade, arrived in force\u0014\n      soon afterwards and for the next two days the town was the \nscene of bitter fighting. Attacks led by James Jeb Stuart, George\u0014\n      Pickett and James Longstreet proved costly and by the 5th July, \nLee decided to retreat south. Both sides suffered heavy losses\u0014\n      with Lee losing 28,063 men and Meade 23,049. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In March, 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was named lieutenant general \nand the commander of the Union Army. He joined the Army of the\u0014\n      Potomac where he worked with George Meade and Philip Sheridan. \nThey crossed the Rapidan and entered the Wilderness. When\u0014\n      Lee heard the news he sent in his troops, hoping that the \nUnion's superior artillery and cavalry would be offset by the heavy\u0014\n      underbrush of the Wilderness. Fighting began on the 5th May and \ntwo days later smoldering paper cartridges set fire to dry leaves\u0014\n      and around 200 wounded men were either suffocated or burned to \ndeath. Of the 88,892 men that Grant took into the Wilderness,\u0014\n      14,283 were casualties and 3,383 were reported missing. Robert \nE. Lee lost 7,750 men during the fighting. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis decided to build up the Army of Tennessee, now under the \ncontrol of Joseph E. Johnson. His army was reinforced and by the\u0014\n      spring Johnson had 62,000 men. When Ulysses S. Grant heard the \nnews he gave instructions to William Sherman \"to move against\u0014\n      Johnson's army, to break it up, and to get into the interior of \nthe enemy's country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you\u0014\n      can against their war resources\". \u0014\n\u0014\n      On 7th May, 1864, Sherman and his 100,000 men advanced towards \nJohnson's army that was attempting to defend the route to\u0014\n      Atlanta, the South's important manufacturing and communications \ncentre. Joseph E. Johnson and his army retreated and after\u0014\n      some brief skirmishes the two sides fought at Resaca (14th \nMay), Adairsvile (17th May), New Hope Church (25th May), Kennesaw\u0014\n      Mountain (27th June) and Marietta (2nd July). \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis was unhappy about Johnson's withdrawal policy and on 17th \nJuly replaced him with the more aggressive John Hood. He\u0014\n      immediately went on the attack and hit George H. Thomas and his \nmen at Peachtree Creek. Hood was badly beaten and lost 2,500\u0014\n      men. Two days later he took on William Sherman just outside \nAtlanta and lost another 8,000 men. By 31st August, Confederate\u0014\n      forces began to evacuate Atlanta and by early September the \ncity came under the control of the Union Army.\u0014\n\u0014\n      In August 1864 the Union Army made another attempt to take \ncontrol of the Shenandoah Valley. Philip Sheridan and 40,000\u0014\n      soldiers entered the valley and soon encountered troops led by \nJubal Early who had just returned from Washington. After a series of\u0014\n      minor defeats Sheridan eventually gained the upper hand. His \nmen now burnt and destroyed anything of value in the area and after\u0014\n      defeating Early in another large-scale battle on 19th October, \nthe Union Army, for the first time, held the Shenandoah Valley.\u0014\n\u0014\n      John Hood continued to adopt an aggressive policy in Tennessee \nand despite heavy losses surrounded George H. Thomas at\u0014\n      Nashville. On 15th December, 1864, Thomas broke out of \nNashville and hammered Hood's army. Thomas captured 4,462 soldiers\u0014\n      and those still left alive fled into Mississippi and Alabama. \nThe Confederate Army in Tennessee had now been completely\u0014\n      destroyed. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On 15th January, 1865, Fort Fisher, North Carolina, the last \nport under the control of the Confederate Army, fell to a combined \neffort\u0014\n      of the Union Army and the US Navy on 15th January. William \nSherman, removed all resistance in the Shenandoah Valley and then\u0014\n      marched to Southern Carolina. On 17th February, Columbia, the \ncapital of South Carolina, was taken. Columbia was virtually burnt\u0014\n      to the ground and some people claimed the damage was done by \nSherman's men and others said it was carried out by the\u0014\n      retreating Confederate Army. \u0014\n\u0014\n      In March William Sherman joined Ulysses S. Grant and the main \narmy at Petersburg. On 1st April Sherman attacked at Five Forks.\u0014\n      The Confederates, led by Major General George Pickett, were \noverwhelmed and lost 5,200 men. On hearing the news, Robert E.\u0014\n      Lee decided to abandon Richmond and join Joseph E. Johnson in \nan attempt to halt Sherman's army in South Carolina. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis, his family and government officials, were forced to flee \nfrom Richmond. The Union Army took control of Richmond and on 4th\u0014\n      April Abraham Lincoln entered the city. Protected by ten \nseamen, he walked the streets and when one black man fell to his knees\u0014\n      in front of him, Lincoln told him: \"Don't kneel to me. You must \nkneel to God only and thank him for your freedom.\" Lincoln travelled\u0014\n      to the Confederate Executive Mansion and sat for a while in the \nformer leader's chair before heading back to Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\n      Robert E. Lee was only able to muster an army of 8,000 men. He \nprobed the Union Army at Appomattox but faced by 110,000 men\u0014\n      he decided the cause was hopeless. He contacted Ulysses S. \nGrant and after agreeing terms on 9th April, surrendered his army at\u0014\n      Appomattox Court House. Grant issued a brief statement: \"The \nwar is over; the rebels are our countrymen again and the best sign\u0014\n      of rejoicing after the victory will be to abstain from all \ndemonstrations in the field.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n      When his government collapsed in May, 1865, Davis was arrested \nand imprisoned for two years in Fortress Monroe. Although\u0014\n      indicted for treason, he was not brought to trial and was \nreleased in 1867. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Davis returned to Mississippi where he wrote The Rise and Fall \nof the Confederate Government (1881). Jefferson Davis died in\u0014\n      New Orleans on 6th December, 1889. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (1) Jefferson Davis, inaugural address (18th February, 1861) \u0014\n\u0014\n      The right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the States, and \nwhich has been affirmed and reaffirmed in the bills of rights of the\u0014\n      states subsequently admitted into the Union of 1789, undeniably \nrecognizes in the people the power to resume the authority\u0014\n      delegated for the purposes of government. Thus the sovereign \nstates here represented proceeded to form the Confederacy; and it is\u0014\n      by the abuse of language that their act has been denominated \nrevolution. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (2) Jefferson Davis, war message (29th April, 1861)\u0014\n\u0014\n      The climate and soil of the Northern states soon proved \nunpropitious to the continuance of slave labor, while the reverse \nbeing the\u0014\n      case in the South, made unrestricted free intercourse between \nthe two sections unfriendly. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The Northern states consulted their own interests by selling \ntheir slaves to the South and prohibiting slavery between their \nlimits.\u0014\n      The South were willing purchasers of property suitable to their \nwants, and paid the price of the acquisition without harboring a\u0014\n      suspicion that their quiet possession was to be distributed by \nthose who were not only in want of constitutional authority but, by\u0014\n      good faith as vendors, from disquieting a title emanating from \nthemselves. \u0014\n\u0014\n      As soon, however, as the Northern states that prohibited \nAfrican slavery within their limits had reached a number sufficient \nto give\u0014\n      their representation a controlling vote in the Congress, a \npersistent and organized system of hostile measures against the \nrights of\u0014\n      the owners of slaves in the Southern states were inaugurated \nand gradually extended. A series of measures was devised and\u0014\n      prosecuted for the purpose of rendering insecure the tenure of \nproperty in slaves. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Fanatical organizations, supplied with money by voluntary \nsubscriptions, were assiduously engaged in exciting among the slaves a\u0014\n      spirit of discontent and revolt. Means were furnished for their \nescape from their owners and agents secretly employed to entice\u0014\n      them to abscond. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (3) Mary Boykin Chesnut, Richmond, Virginia, diary entry (27th \nJune, 1861)\u0014\n\u0014\n      In Mrs. Davis' drawing room last night, the president took a \nseat by me on the sofa where I sat. He talked for nearly an hour. He\u0014\n      laughed at our faith in our own powers. We are like the \nBritish. We think every Southerner equal to three Yankees at least. \nWe will\u0014\n      have to be equivalent to a dozen now. He said only fools \ndoubted the courage of the Yankees or their willingness to fight what \nthey\u0014\n      saw fit. And now that we have stung their pride, we have roused \nthem till they will fight like devils. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (4) Jefferson Davis, speech (4th April, 1865)\u0014\n\u0014\n      To the people of the Confederate States of America: The general \nin chief of our army has found it necessary to make such\u0014\n      movements of the troops as to uncover the capital and thus \ninvolve the withdrawal of the government from the city of Richmond. \nFor\u0014\n      many months the largest and finest army of the Confederacy, \nunder the command of a leader whose presence inspires equal\u0014\n      confidence in the troops and the people, has been greatly \ntrammeled by the necessity of keeping constant watch over the\u0014\n      approaches to the capital, and has thus been forced to forego \nmore than one opportunity for promising enterprises. Let us not then\u0014\n      despond, my countrymen, but, relying on the never failing \nmercies and protecting care of our God, let us meet the foe with fresh\u0014\n      defiance, with unconquered and unconquerable hearts.\u0014",

    "words": "James Ewell Brown (Jeb) Stuart was born in Patrick County, Virginia, \non 6th February, 1933. After graduating 13th\u0014\n      in a class of 46 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point \nin 1854, he joined the Mountain Rifles Cavalry. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Stuart was seriously wounded while fighting on the frontier \nagainst Native Americans. In 1859 he accompanied Robert\u0014\n      E. Lee and the company of U.S. Marines that captured John Brown \nat Harper's Ferry. in October, 1859. \u0014\n\u0014\n      On the outbreak of the American Civil War Stuart resigned from \nthe US Army and joined the Confederate Army.\u0014\n      Commissioned as lieutenant colonel he took part the the first \nbattle at Bull Run (June, 1861) against the Union Army\u0014\n      led by Irvin McDowell. The Confederate troops led by Joseph E. \nJohnson, Thomas Stonewall Jackson, Jubal Early\u0014\n      and Pierre T. Beauregard easily defeated the inexperienced \nUnion troops. \u0014\n\u0014\n      He also led his men at Fredericksburg (November/December, \n1862), Chancellorsville (May 1863) and Gettysburg\u0014\n      (June/July, 1863), where for the first time he faced an \norganized Union Army cavalry. During these battles Stuart\u0014\n      developed a reputation as a good gather of information on the \nenemy and Robert E. Lee called him the \"eyes of the\u0014\n      army\". \u0014\n\u0014\n      Stuart took part in the Wilderness Campaign (May, 1864) but \nsoon afterwards was mortally wounded at Yellow Tavern\u0014\n      near Richmond. James Ewell Brown (Jeb) Stuart died on 12th May, \n1864. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (1) John Singleton Mosby, Memoirs of Colonel John S. Mosby \n(1887) \u0014\n\u0014\n      We were incorporated into the First Virginia Cavalry, which \nStuart had just organized, now on outpost to watch\u0014\n      Patterson. I had never seen Stuart before, and the distance \nbetween us was so great that I never expected to rise to\u0014\n      even an acquaintance with him. Stuart was a graduate of West \nPoint and as a lieutenant in Colonel Sumner's\u0014\n      regiment, the First Cavalry, had won distinction and had been \nwounded in an Indian fight. At the beginning of the war\u0014\n      he was just twenty-eight years old. His appearance - which \nincluded a reddish beard and a ruddy complexion -\u0014\n      indicated a strong physique and great energy.\u0014\n\u0014\n      In his work on the outposts Stuart soon showed that he \npossessed the qualities of a great leader of cavalry. He never\u0014\n      had an equal in such service. He discarded the old maxims and \nsoon discovered that in the conditions of modern war\u0014\n      the chief functions of cavalry are to learn the designs and to \nwatch and report the movements of the enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (2) General Oliver Howard wrote about James Stuart in his \nautobiography published in 1907. \u0014\n\u0014\n      J. E. B. Stuart was cut out for a cavalry leader. In perfect \nhealth, but thirty-two years of age, full of vigor and\u0014\n      enter[rise, with the usual ideas imbibed in Virginia concerning \nState Supremacy, Christian in thought and temperate\u0014\n      by habit, no man could ride faster, endure more hardships, make \na livelier charge, or be more hearty and cheerful\u0014\n      while so engaged. A touch of vanity, which invited the smiles \nand applause of the fair maidens of Virginia, but added\u0014\n      to the zest and ardor of Stuart's parades and achievements. He \ncommanded Lee's cavalry corps - a well-organized\u0014\n      body, of which he was justly proud. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (3) John Haskell, a fellow Confederate Army officer, commenting \non Jeb Stuart after the war. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Stuart was a remarkable mixture of a green, boyish, undeveloped \nman, with a shrewd man of business and a strong\u0014\n      leader. To hear him talk no one would think that he could ever \nbe anything more than a dashing leader of a small\u0014\n      command, with no dignity, and much boastful vanity. But with \nall he was a shrewd, gallant commander.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      (4) Philip Katcher, The American Civil War (1992) \u0014\n\u0014\n      In many ways he was more lucky than able, leading such efforts \nas his 'ride around McClellan' in June 1862 against\u0014\n      poorly trained and organized Union cavalry. All this created \nthe myth of the 'bold cavalier'. Therefore, when finally a\u0014\n      trained and organized Union cavalry struck unprepared cavalry \nunder Stuart at Brandy Station, Virginia, in 1863, he\u0014\n      was taken aback by the outcry of criticism he received.\u0014",

    "title": "JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU WERE REAL",
    "words": "In Max Lucado's book,\"And the Angels Were Silent,\" he tells the story \nof a man name John Blanchard. Just before being shipped out for duty \nin World War II, Blanchard picked up a book off the shelf of a \nFlorida library. Flipping through the book, he found himself \nintrigued, not with the book, but with the notes penciled in the \nmargins. The writing reflected a warm heart and quick mind. In the \nfront of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss \nHollis Maynell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith time and effort, Blanchard located Miss Maynell's address in New \nYork City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her \nto correspond with him as he served his country in Europe. She \naccepted and agreed to the arrangement. For the next 13 months, the \ntwo wrote to each other across the ocean. A romance budded. Blanchard \nrequested a photograph, but Maynell refused and said if he really \ncared for her, looks didn't matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day came for him to return from Europe. He and Miss Maynell \nagreed to meet at 7:00 P.M. at the Grand Central Station in New York. \n\"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll wear on my \nlapel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 7:00, he reached the station and started looking for the woman who \nhad touched him so deeply. As he scanned the area, a beautiful \nblonde-haired, blue-eyed-woman in a green suit approached. Blanchard \nstarted toward her, but then noticed she wore no rose. Moving past \nhim, she leaned close and asked, \"Going my way, sailor?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was all he could do not to follow her. But then, across the lobby, \nhe saw Bonis Maynen. She was a woman of at least 40 years. She had \ngray hair and a matronly figure. Blanchard stared back at the girl in \nthe green suit, his heart breaking to go after her. But he knew he \ncouldn't leave Miss Maynell alone in the station. After all, her \nletters had helped him get through the war. Though it wouldn't be \nlove, he felt grateful for her friendship. He stepped to her and \nstuck out his hand.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard,\" he said. \"You must be Miss Hollis \nMaynell. May I take you to dinner?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman smiled shyly, then said, \"I don't know what this is about, \nSon, but a blonde lady in a green suit begged me to wear this rose on \nmy coat. She said if a Mr. Blanchard introduced himself and asked me \nout to dinner, I should tell him that she is waiting for him in the \nbig restaurant across the street. She said this was some kind of a \ntest!\"1\u0014\n\u0014\nSome kind of a test, indeed. Miss Maynell wanted to see if John \nBlanchard 's actions coincided with the words she had read in his \nletters. She wanted to test his character by his deeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian gospel calls for all of us -individually and as a \nchurch -to measure our lives by the test of our fruit. And that is a \nworthy test for CBF and its partner schools as well. May Jesus look \nat all that we do and all that CBF does and say of us, \"They have \nproduced good fruit.\" Indeed, may Jesus say, \"They done good.\"\u0014\n1.

    "title": "JOHN HUSS (AD1369-1414)",
    "words": "Sketches of Church History\u0014\n                   Chapter 23: JOHN HUSS (AD 1369-1414) \u0014\n\u0014\n                   It would seem that after a time Wyclif's opinions \nalmost died out in England. But meanwhile\u0014\n                   they, or opinions very like them, were eagerly \ntaken up in Bohemia. If we look at the map of\u0014\n                   Europe, we might think that no country was less \nlikely than Bohemia to have anything to do with\u0014\n                   England; for it lies in the midst of other \ncountries, far away from all seas, and with no harbours\u0014\n                   to which English ships could make their way. And \nbesides this, the people are of a different race\u0014\n                   from any that have ever settled in this country, \nor have helped to make the English nation, and\u0014\n                   their language has no likeness to ours. But it so \nhappened that Richard II of England married\u0014\n                   the Princess Anne, granddaughter of the blind king \nwho fell at Cressy, and daughter of the\u0014\n                   emperor Charles IV, who usually lived in Bohemia. \nAnd when Queen Anne of England died,\u0014\n                   and the Bohemian ladies and servants of her court \nwent back to their own country, they took with\u0014\n                   them some of Wyclif's writings, which were readily \nwelcomed there; for some of the Bohemian\u0014\n                   clergy had already begun a reform in the Church, \nand Wyclif's name was well known on account\u0014\n                   of his writings of another kind. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Among those who thus became acquainted with \nWyclif's opinions was a young man named\u0014\n                   John Huss. He had been an admirer of Wyclif's \nphilosophical works; but when he first met with\u0014\n                   his reforming books, he was so little taken with \nthem that he wished they were thrown into the\u0014\n                   Moldau, the river which runs through Prague, the \nchief city of Bohemia. But Huss soon came to\u0014\n                   think differently, and heartily took up almost all \nWyclif's doctrines. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Huss made many enemies among the clergy by \nattacking their faults from the pulpit of a chapel\u0014\n                   called Bethlehem, where he was preacher. He was, \nhowever, still so far in favour with the\u0014\n                   archbishop of Prague, that he was employed by him, \ntogether with some others, to inquire into\u0014\n                   a pretended miracle, which drew crowds of pilgrims \nto seek for cures at a place called Wilsnack,\u0014\n                   in the north of Germany. But he afterwards fell \nout of favour with the archbishop who had\u0014\n                   appointed him to this work, and he was still less \nliked by later archbishops. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   From time to time some doctrines which were said \nto be Wyclif's were condemned at Prague.\u0014\n                   Huss usually declared that Wyclif had been wrongly \nunderstood, and that his real meaning was\u0014\n                   true and innocent. But at length a decree was \npassed that all Wyclif's books should be burnt (AD\u0014\n                   1410), and thereupon a grand bonfire was made in \nthe courtyard of the archbishop's palace,\u0014\n                   while all the church bells of the city were tolled \nas at a funeral. But as some copies of the books\u0014\n                   escaped the flames, it was easy to make new copies \nfrom these. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Huss was excommunicated, but he still went on \nteaching. In 1412, Pope John XXIII proclaimed\u0014\n                   a crusade against Ladislaus, King of Naples, with \nwhom he had quarrelled, and ordered that it\u0014\n                   should be preached, and that money should be \ncollected for it all through Latin Christendom.\u0014\n                   Huss and his chief friend, whose name was Jerome, \nset themselves against this with all their\u0014\n                   might. They declared it to be unchristian that a \ncrusade should be proclaimed against a\u0014\n                   Christian prince, and that the favours of the \nChurch should be held out as a reward for paying\u0014\n                   money or for shedding of blood. One day, as a \npreacher was inviting people to buy his\u0014\n                   indulgences (as they were called) for the \nforgiveness of sins, he was interrupted by three young\u0014\n                   men, who told him that what he said was untrue, \nand that Master Huss had taught them better.\u0014\n                   The three were seized, and were condemned to die; \nand, although it would seem that a\u0014\n                   promise was afterwards given that their lives \nshould be spared, the sentence of death was\u0014\n                   carried into effect. The people were greatly \nprovoked by this, and when the executioner, after\u0014\n                   having cut off the heads of the three, proclaimed \n(as was usual), \"Whosoever shall do the like,\u0014\n                   let him look for the like!\" a cry burst forth from \nthe multitude around, \"We are ready to do and to\u0014\n                   suffer the like.\" Women dipped their handkerchiefs \nin the blood of the victims, and treasured it\u0014\n                   up as a precious relic. Some of the crowd even \nlicked the blood. The bodies were carried off by\u0014\n                   the people, and were buried in Bethlehem chapel; \nand Huss and others spoke of the three as\u0014\n                   martyrs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   By this affair his enemies were greatly provoked. \nFresh orders were sent from Rome for the\u0014\n                   destruction of Wyclif's books, and for uttering \nall the heaviest sentences of the Church against\u0014\n                   Huss himself. He therefore left Prague for a time, \nand lived chiefly in the castles of Bohemian\u0014\n                   noblemen who were friendly to him, writing busily \nas well as preaching against what he\u0014\n                   supposed to be the errors of the Roman Church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                  \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                 \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                      \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                           \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                      \u0014\n                                Sort by:  Alphabetical order  Best \nresults first\u0014",

Truett\u0014\n                      Sunday mornings in hopes they would distract \nhis nemesis just before he stepped to\u0014\n                      his pulpit. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Fifty years after Dr. Truett had gone on to \nglory, his name, his heart, his broad\u0014\n                      churchmanship, his reconciling spirit gave its \nname to an institution that bears his\u0014\n                      name,\" Gregory said, referring to the George W. \nTruett Theological Seminary at\u0014\n                      Baylor. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Look at the aftermath of the other man,\" \nGregory continued. \"His church is all but\u0014\n                      gone. It meets in what is little more than a \ndoublewide trailer. His school barely\u0014\n                      exists. His name is mentioned only as a foil to \nthat against which he stood and\u0014\n                      continued to prosper after he was gone.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Carved into the geography and biography of \nthis part of North Texas is that the\u0014\n                      mainstream is the broad stream of the Kingdom \nof God,\" Gregory said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Gregory quoted John Chrysostom, who said, \n\"Perseverance is the queen of virtues.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"I think the tone that has been sounded today \nis one of perseverance and seeing the\u0014\n                      course through,\" Gregory said.\u0014",

    "words": "Jesus Wept\u0014\n                      God's love, mercy, passion, grief, and anger \nare chiseled down to\u0014\n                      two words.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Mark Buchanan | posted 3/6/01\u0014\n                      \u0014\n                      Recently I saw a portrait of Jesus in the \nGarden of\u0014\n                      Gethsemane. Gethsemane was the place where Jesus\u0014\n                      prayed in deep anguish, his sweat like drops of \nblood falling\u0014\n                      to the ground. The writer of Hebrews, in all \nlikelihood referring\u0014\n                      to this moment of reckoning and wrestling, says \nthat Jesus\u0014\n                      \"offered up prayers and petitions with loud \ncries and tears to\u0014\n                      the one who could save him from death\" (Heb. \n5:7). In fact,\u0014\n                      Hebrews implies that for Jesus, crying and \nweeping were as\u0014\n                      habitual as prayingthat this was Jesus' \noft-struck posture\u0014\n                      \"during his days on earth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That painting I saw gives not the slightest \nhint that any of this\u0014\n                      is so. Behind Jesus, in the backdrop, is an \nidyllic (and\u0014\n                      lakeshore!) Jerusalem. Jesus' face, in angled \nprofile, is coolly\u0014\n                      serene, aloof almost. His eyes have a far away, \ndreamy look.\u0014\n                      His body, perched on a rock, is held with prim \nstraightness.\u0014\n                      His hands rest on his lap like the front and \nback covers of a\u0014\n                      stiff-spined book laid open, face down.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The artist has managed somehow to make those \nhands look\u0014\n                      both boneless and rigid, soft as dough and \nbrittle as\u0014\n                      porcelain. Could these hands cut dovetails and \nmortise joints,\u0014\n                      wield the saw and plane and hammer, touch \nlepers' sores and\u0014\n                      blind men's eyes, braid and lash a whip, spread \nwide to grasp\u0014\n                      nails? No, not these hands. These hands are \ngood for petite\u0014\n                      point or finger-wagging but not much else. \nBehind Jesus'\u0014\n                      head, encircling his sleek, smoothly combed \nhair, is a\u0014\n                      piercing-white light.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus is perhaps contemplating. Or he is \nposing, in a stilted\u0014\n                      way, for a portrait, maybe this one. Or he is \ndaydreaming. But\u0014\n                      one thing the portrait could never make you \nbelieve is that\u0014\n                      Jesus is weeping, or even capable of such a \nthing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Jesus wept. Maybe that frightens us, or \nthreatens us, or\u0014\n                      embarrasses us. Before I preach, I try to work \nthrough my\u0014\n                      deeper emotions in solitude, in my study. If \nthere is weeping\u0014\n                      to do, I do it there. That way, I reason, my \npreaching can be\u0014\n                      masterful, controlled, persuasive but not \nmanipulative, and not\u0014\n                      ambushed or sabotaged by stray or unruly \nemotions. I am\u0014\n                      critical of the bad art and bad theology in \nthat portrait of\u0014\n                      Jesus, but I carry it anyhow, a version of it, \nlike an icon inside\u0014\n                      me: the serene and savvy man, facing danger, \ncrisis, loss\u0014\n                      without even flinching. If my emotional range \nand display is an\u0014\n                      indication of the Jesus I follow, Jesus doesn't \nweep. He's too\u0014\n                      cool and too tough for that.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Jesus wept. That one line, John 11:35, is \nthe shortest\u0014\n                      verse in the Bible. Jesus weeps at the tomb of \nLazarus, his\u0014\n                      friend, the one he loves. And, in truth, never \nhas so much\u0014\n                      theology been so cleanly distilled as here. \nNever have such\u0014\n                      riches been rendered with such economy. The \nfullness of the\u0014\n                      Incarnation, Christ's coming among usto be \nwith us, to be\u0014\n                      one with usis gathered up and pressed into a \nsingle subject\u0014\n                      and verb.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The starkness of it contains a cosmic \npageantry; the\u0014\n                      sparseness of it holds a theological galaxy. \nHere is love,\u0014\n                      mercy, passion, compassion, grief, and anger \nover our\u0014\n                      condition, our frailty, our vulnerability, \nchiseled down to two\u0014\n                      words: Jesus wept.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Skewed priorities\u0014\n                      Jesus wept in a world whose economic priorities \nhad become\u0014\n                      terribly skewed. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      John 11 begins with a description of Lazarus, \nthe man who is\u0014\n                      sick and whom Jesus loves, and his two sisters, \nMartha and\u0014\n                      Mary. \"This Mary,\" John says, \"was the same one \nwho\u0014\n                      poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet \nwith her hair\"\u0014\n                      (v. 2), described fully in the next chapter. At \na dinner that the\u0014\n                      resurrected Lazarus and his sisters give in \nJesus' honor, Mary\u0014\n                      \"took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive \nperfume; she\u0014\n                      poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet \nwith her hair. And\u0014\n                      the house was filled with the fragrance of the \nperfume\" (12:3).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The story continues: \"But one of his disciples, \nJudas Iscariot,\u0014\n                      who was later to betray him, objected, 'Why \nwasn't this\u0014\n                      perfume sold and the money given to the poor?'\" \nJesus tells\u0014\n                      Judas to leave Mary alone. \"It was intended \nthat she should\u0014\n                      save this perfume for the day of my burial,\" \nJesus says. \"You\u0014\n                      will always have the poor among you, but you \nwill not always\u0014\n                      have me\" (12:4, 7-8).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      John tells us bluntly that Judas doesn't really \ncare for the\u0014\n                      poor. He's a thief, and as the treasurer for \nthe disciples he\u0014\n                      pilfers the money bag. Later, we learn that \nJudas betrays\u0014\n                      Jesus for money.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is the world Jesus weeps in. It's a world \nwhere those who\u0014\n                      protest loudest about the poor, complain most \nbitterly that not\u0014\n                      enough is being done for the outcast and the \nunderprivileged,\u0014\n                      often care nothing for them. They are often \nwealthy, and have\u0014\n                      cut a few corners, pilfered a few money bags, \nto get that way.\u0014\n                      It is a world in which such people are usually \nthe first to point\u0014\n                      out the extravagance and wastefulness of \nothers: if only the\u0014\n                      government, if only the church, if only those \nrich people who\u0014\n                      live over there, would do something, the poor \nwould be helped.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is a world swollen with indignation, but \nnearly empty of\u0014\n                      compassion. Jesus wept.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And he weeps in a world where others love to \nquote only half\u0014\n                      of his rebuttal to Judas: \"You will always have \nthe poor among\u0014\n                      you.\" There you have itJesus said it, who are \nwe to argue?\u0014\n                      Let's just get on with life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness\u0014\n                      and trust that the \"trickle-down effect\" and \nsome \"invisible\u0014\n                      hand\" will help the poor. We're off the hook.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus, though, had a second clause: \"But you \nwill not always\u0014\n                      have me.\" The extravagance Jesus commends is not\u0014\n                      extravagance for its own sake or for our own \nsake. It is not\u0014\n                      self-indulgence. It is, rather, extravagance \nthat is\u0014\n                      Christ-exalting. It is something poured out for \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is centered on his death. Jesus says that \nthe perfume has\u0014\n                      been saved for the day of his burial. Mary \ndidn't know, but\u0014\n                      Jesus knew, the meaning of his death. It was a \ndeath for us.\u0014\n                      It was a death in which the only real hope, the \nonly lasting\u0014\n                      hope, was secured and offered, free to all, \nneeded by all, rich\u0014\n                      and poor alike. How terrible to give the poor \nbread but not the\u0014\n                      bread of life. How terrible to relieve only \ntheir poverty of means\u0014\n                      and not their poverty of spirit. How terrible \nto give them hope\u0014\n                      for this world but none for the next.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The poor will always be among us. That is not \nan excuse to\u0014\n                      forget the poor and instead pamper ourselves. \nBut it's not an\u0014\n                      excuse, either, to keep from pouring ourselves \nand our gifts\u0014\n                      out in remembrance and exaltation of the \nCrucified One. If he\u0014\n                      is lifted up, he will draw all people unto him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We live in a world in which we use the poor to \nexcuse our\u0014\n                      own lack of costly and lavish devotion to \nJesus: I can't serve a\u0014\n                      god who would let little children suffer in \nSudan  I'm not\u0014\n                      going to any church where they'll spend $30,000 \non a sound\u0014\n                      system while slum-dwellers in So Paulo don't \neven have\u0014\n                      electricity or running water  And then we get \nin our\u0014\n                      expensive cars and drive to our homes with more \nroom than\u0014\n                      we can use, and to buffet restaurants with more \nfood than we\u0014\n                      can eat.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We use the fact that the poor will always be \nwith usthat the\u0014\n                      problem of poverty is too vast, too complex, \ntoo deep-rooted\u0014\n                      to solveto excuse our own apathy, inaction, and\u0014\n                      self-indulgence. Well, I don't feel the least \nbit guilty buying\u0014\n                      this sport-utility vehicle because even if I \ngave the money to\u0014\n                      the poor, it's just a drop in the ocean. \nThey'll always be with\u0014\n                      us. And anyway, if there were some natural \ndisaster, I would\u0014\n                      be able to help people with this truck \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meeting my needs\u0014\n                      Jesus wept in a world where health and\u0014\n                      self-protectionsalving and saving one's own \nsweet\u0014\n                      fleshmattered more than God's glory. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mary and Martha want Jesus to come quick to \nBethany:\u0014\n                      Lazarus, the one \"he loves,\" is sick (John \n11:3). The\u0014\n                      disciples, on the other hand, are reluctant to \ngo there: \"Rabbi,\u0014\n                      a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, \nand yet you are\u0014\n                      going back there?\" (8) When Jesus does finally \ngo to Bethany\u0014\n                      and finds Lazarus already dead and buried four \ndays, Martha\u0014\n                      issues a stern rebuke to him: \"If you had been \nhere, my\u0014\n                      brother would not have died\" (21), and even \ngentle Mary\u0014\n                      echoes this (v. 32).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Come, Jesus. Don't go, Jesus. If you'd have \ncome sooner,\u0014\n                      Jesus. These voices that beckon and warn and \nscold have\u0014\n                      one thing in common: Each is concerned with \nwhat's best for\u0014\n                      me. For Mary and Martha, Jesus is useful the \nway a doctor or\u0014\n                      lawyer or janitor or bank teller is: He should \nbe there when\u0014\n                      you need him in the way that you need him. For \nthe disciples,\u0014\n                      Jesus is useful the way a good press agent is: \nHe should\u0014\n                      keep you out of trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The one thing nobody seems even remotely to \nconsider is\u0014\n                      this: Maybe the comings and goings of Jesus \nhave nothing to\u0014\n                      do with the well-being of Lazarus, his sisters, \nor the disciples.\u0014\n                      \"This sickness,\" Jesus says of Lazarus, \"is for \nGod's glory,\u0014\n                      so that God's son might be glorified through \nit\" (4). \"Did I not\u0014\n                      tell you,\" Jesus says to Martha, \"that if you \nbelieved you\u0014\n                      would see the glory of God?\" (40)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus weeps in a world where God's glory is the \nleast, the\u0014\n                      last, the most unlikely of our concernswhere \nthe thought\u0014\n                      that God might be glorified in sickness, in \nsuffering, in\u0014\n                      persecution, in dying, is absurd and offensive; \nwhere we\u0014\n                      expect that our interests and needs should \ndictate his\u0014\n                      schedule and itineraryand shame on him if he's \nlate, and\u0014\n                      shame on him if he takes us into danger.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's a world whose popular theology is \nexpressed in the\u0014\n                      comment that some who had come to mourn Lazarus \nmade:\u0014\n                      \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind \nman have\u0014\n                      kept this man from dying?\" (v. 37). According \nto this theology,\u0014\n                      what's-best-for-me is the highest court for \njudging God's\u0014\n                      actions. Indeed, God's glory can only be \naccounted for on the\u0014\n                      basis of what's-best-for-me. His glory does not \nexist in its\u0014\n                      own right, as its own end. Either he serves me \nand mine, or\u0014\n                      what good is he?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      An Inhospitable Place\u0014\n                      Jesus wept in a world where political \njeopardyterrorism and\u0014\n                      tyranny, random violence and systematic\u0014\n                      brutalityintimidated his disciples from doing \nkingdom work. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Again, the disciples don't want Jesus to go to \nBethany\u0014\n                      because of the danger to him and to them. (The \none\u0014\n                      exception is Thomas. When he sees that Jesus \ncan't be\u0014\n                      talked out of going, he says to the rest of the \ndisciples in\u0014\n                      verse 16, \"Let us also go, that we may die with \nhim.\" So\u0014\n                      much for Doubting Thomas.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus says in response, \"Are there not twelve \nhours of\u0014\n                      daylight? A man who walks by day will not \nstumble, for he\u0014\n                      sees by this world's light. It is when he walks \nby night that he\u0014\n                      stumbles, for he has no light.\" This echoes \nwhat Jesus had\u0014\n                      earlier told them: \"As long as it is day, we \nmust do the work\u0014\n                      of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no \none can work.\u0014\n                      While I am in the world, I am the light of the \nworld\" (John 9:4).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus redefines day and night, recasts light \nand darkness.\u0014\n                      Night, darkthat is whenever and wherever Jesus \nis absent.\u0014\n                      Day, lightthat is wherever and whenever he is \npresent. He is\u0014\n                      the light of the world, and in him, with him, \nwe are sent to the\u0014\n                      dark places to let our light shine. The places \nand situations\u0014\n                      that, according to our definition, appear to be \nplaces of night\u0014\n                      and darknesswhere they kill Christians or \nreject outright\u0014\n                      Christ's righteousnessare the very places we \nneed to go\u0014\n                      \"while it is still day.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus takes our excuses for not going to such \nplacesLord,\u0014\n                      they hate you there; Lord, they're burning \nchurches in that\u0014\n                      country; Lord, they kill pastors in that part \nof the world; Lord,\u0014\n                      they are so debauched and depraved in that \ncityand turns\u0014\n                      those excuses on their heads: that's all the \nmore reason to\u0014\n                      go, he says. Go, while there is still some \ndaylight. Go, before\u0014\n                      night falls. Go.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This world is a dangerous and inhospitable \nplace for Jesus\u0014\n                      and those who follow him. It's always been that \nway. The\u0014\n                      temptation before us more and more is to stock \nthe larder,\u0014\n                      draw the shades, latch the windows, bolt the \ndoor, pull up the\u0014\n                      bedsheets. Keep safe, and let the world go to \nhell.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Confronting death\u0014\n                      Jesus wept in a world where death was an enemy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Twice John tells us that Jesus, at the tomb, \nwas \"deeply\u0014\n                      moved\" (33, 38). Once, John tells us, Jesus was \n\"troubled.\"\u0014\n                      Jesus wept in response to the sight of Mary \nweeping and the\u0014\n                      \"Jews who had come along with her also weeping\" \n(33). The\u0014\n                      original language that describes Jesus being \ndeeply moved\u0014\n                      and troubled in spirit uses punchy, pungent \nwords. The\u0014\n                      language mixes grief with anger with \nfrustration with turmoil.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is heart-rending, gut-wrenching emotion. \nWhen my\u0014\n                      middle daughter was 2 and my son 4, three older \nboys took a\u0014\n                      toy away from them in the park one day. My son \nran away,\u0014\n                      crying. But my daughter, a feisty child, cried \nin another way:\u0014\n                      she, all two feet and 20 pounds of her, stood \nthose boys\u0014\n                      down. She cried, but it was the crying of \nfierce defiance, the\u0014\n                      crying of anger at so gross an injustice.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The boys, all three of them, at first laughed. \nBut then they\u0014\n                      grew afraid. They surrendered the toy and beat \na quick\u0014\n                      retreat. That's the emotion described here.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus is about to stand death down. He weeps, \neven knowing\u0014\n                      full well that he is about to call Lazarus \nforth from the grave,\u0014\n                      present him alive. But the sight and sound of \nthese mourners\u0014\n                      stirs his blood, wrenches his gut. Death is a \ngross injustice.\u0014\n                      Death is low-down enemy, a playground bully.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It should not have this kind of power, be able \nto plunder us\u0014\n                      this way and then taunt us. That is simply not \nright. It is not\u0014\n                      right that death should be able to convince us \nthat there is\u0014\n                      something in creation that can separate us from \nthe love of\u0014\n                      God that is in Christthat can take even those \nwho believe\u0014\n                      Jesus is the resurrection and the life and \nthrottle the hope\u0014\n                      that is in them, make even the faithful think \nthat his timing is\u0014\n                      tragically off.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A robin died while I was writing this. It hit, \nwith a loud thump\u0014\n                      and crack, the window beside the desk where I \nsit. It startled\u0014\n                      me. I looked up and saw a smudge of feathers \npressed onto\u0014\n                      the glass. I went outside and found the robin, \nlying twisted, its\u0014\n                      feathers splayed out, on the wood planks \nstacked beneath\u0014\n                      the window. A bright thick bead of blood, like \na berry in its\u0014\n                      mouth, tipped its beak. I picked it up. Its \nwarm body fluttered,\u0014\n                      twitched, then went limp. Its head bobbed loose \nfrom its\u0014\n                      body. The neck was cleanly broken.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I carried it across the lawn and fetched a \nshovel from behind\u0014\n                      the garden shed. It was a gray, cold day, \ndrizzling. I dug a\u0014\n                      hole in the wet earth of my garden and then \nlaid the bird at\u0014\n                      the bottom. I gave it a sharp hit with the \nshovel's edge to\u0014\n                      make sure it was dead. And I covered it with \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Walking back, a huge sadness swept down on me. \nThis is a\u0014\n                      world where robins die, and sparrows, and \npeople: the ones\u0014\n                      we love, the ones Jesus loves. All of them. \nThey fall to the\u0014\n                      ground, they are enfolded into the earth. And \nmost times,\u0014\n                      Jesus doesn't come to raise them up, not in our \nlifetime, not\u0014\n                      so that we see.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If you had have been here, my brother would not \nhave died.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And where is Jesusthis one \"who was to come \ninto the\u0014\n                      world\"? What does Jesus think? What does Jesus \nfeel about\u0014\n                      a world like this?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus wept.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014\n                      March 5, 2001, Vol. 45, No. 4, Page 60\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES MADISON, FATHER OF THE CONSTITUTION",
    "words": "Mar 15, 2001\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Tomorrow marks the 250th birthday of James Madison, \nFather of the Constitution and America's fourth\u0014\n                 President. Orange County's Montpelier will begin a \nyear-long tribute to the lasting legacy of the underrated\u0014\n                  and overshadowed Madison - underrated by U.S. \nhistorians, overshadowed by Washington and Jefferson.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Madison's core contributions to American politics \n(and society) include Republicanism and the Constitution.\u0014\n                  At the 1787 Constitutional Convention he urged a \nshift from a loose confederation of states to strong central\u0014\n                  government with an effective system of checks and \nbalances. Joining principally Alexander Hamilton,\u0014\n                  Madison formed a prolific PR machine, publishing \nThe Federalist essays in the nation's newspapers,\u0014\n                  highlighting the strengths of the proposed \ngovernment blueprint and turning the tide of public resistance\u0014\n                  toward the document into support for ratification.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  In the Old Dominion, Madison served as a \nlocal-government official, a member of the House of Delegates,\u0014\n                  and a member of the Continental Congress. On the \nnational level he was an influential leader of the U.S.\u0014\n                  House of Representatives and later was appointed \nJefferson's Secretary of State, succeeding Jefferson as\u0014\n                  President (1809-1817) and as rector of UVa \n(1826-1836).\u0014\n\u0014\n                  And although not possessing the oratorical skills \nand physical stature of Washington and Jefferson, Madison's \nintelligence and\u0014\n                  political astuteness (and his mastery of the \nwritten word) rarely were matched. According to one historian, \nMadison read avidly,\u0014\n                  holing himself up in his library to peruse classic \nworks and study other government models. Said Jefferson of the fourth \nPresident: \"I\u0014\n                  can say conscientiously that I do not know in the \nworld a man of purer integrity, more dispassionate, disinterested, \nand devoted to\u0014\n                  genuine Republicanism; nor could I in the whole \nscope of America and Europe point out an abler head.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Little though Americans may know it, his wisdom has \nallowed the Republic to flourish. So perhaps the celebration will \nplace Madison\u0014\n                  in the limelight, along with Virginia's most famous \nand foremost crafters of this land of liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  As the man from Montpelier once noted, \"The Union \nof so many States is in the eyes of a world, a wonder; the harmonious\u0014\n                  establishment of a government over them all, a \nmiracle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Thanks to Madison and his wisdom, that wondrous \nmiracle continues today.\u0014",

It was only part of the toll\u0014\n               exacted by the 10-year reign of the man known as\u0014\n               the Butcher of the Balkans. Throughout Milosevics\u0014\n               Yugoslavia, there were countless lives and families\u0014\n               destroyed, villages burned, homes violated.\u0014\n                                                                    \u0014\n                         LAST WEEKEND SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC finally got a\u0014\n                         taste of his own medicine. Once more, as \nhappened so often\u0014\n                         during his regime, heavily armed men in blue \njeans, with\u0014\n                         balaclavas over their faces, piled out of an \narmored Chevrolet\u0014\n                         van, then broke into a Yugoslav home. But \nthis time it was his\u0014\n                         own home. The secret police, at long last, \nwerent doing\u0014\n                         Milosevics biddingthey were trying to \narrest him. That\u0014\n                         proved harder than anyone expected. By early \nSunday, after a\u0014\n                         daylong standoff, thousands of police \nsurrounded Milosevics\u0014\n                         villa in Belgrade. Yugoslav authorities who \nwere wary of\u0014\n                         provoking a bloody battle with the tiny knot \nof Milosevic\u0014\n                         supportersand fearing he might commit \nsuicidetried to\u0014\n                         persuade him to give up. Just before dawn \nSunday, after a\u0014\n                         26-hour marathon, they finally succeeded. \nThe former\u0014\n                         strongman was taken away in an armored \nMercedes jeep to\u0014\n                         Belgrades Central Prison, where a special \nfloor had been\u0014\n                         prepared for him and other officials of his \nregime. \u0014\n\u0014\n     March 30  Slobodan\u0014\n     Milosevic tells NBC News\u0014\n     Michelle Neubert before the\u0014\n     police raid that he is innocent\u0014\n     of all charges.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 But even in the final minutes, it \nwasnt easy. Just before\u0014\n                         his arrest, Milosevic pulled out a pistol he \nhad under his coat,\u0014\n                         threatening to shoot the policemen trying to \narrest him, said\u0014\n                         Deputy Serbian Prime Minister Zarko Korac. \nThen he said he\u0014\n                         would turn the gun on himself and members of \nhis family, said\u0014\n                         Korac, who described him as quite mentally \ndisturbed by his\u0014\n                         humiliation. Milosevic finally agreed to go \npeacefully, though\u0014\n                         he later denounced the charges against him \nas ludicrous. But\u0014\n                         his agitated daughter, Marija, began firing \nan automatic\u0014\n                         weapon until she was persuaded to drop the \ngun by police\u0014\n                         who stormed the building. No one was \nseriously hurt.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                         A FULL-BLOWN CRISIS\u0014\n                                By then, what began as the detention \nof a hated\u0014\n                         ex-dictator had spiraled into a full-blown \ncrisis among his\u0014\n                         successors. The standoff over Milosevics \narrest exposed\u0014\n                         deep-seated divisions between Yugoslavias \npopular president,\u0014\n                         Vojislav Kostunica, and the powerful prime \nminister of the Serb\u0014\n                         Republic, Zoran Djindjic. Kostunica had \nopposed the arrest\u0014\n                         until the eleventh hour despite the danger \nof a cutoff in U.S.\u0014\n                         aid. His bias was clear. Kostunica was \nelected in a landslide\u0014\n                         last fall as a middle-of-the-road candidate, \nleading to\u0014\n                         Milosevics ouster. The soft-spoken \nconstitutional lawyer had\u0014\n                         strongly anti-Western views, appealing both \nto the Serbs\u0014\n                         strong nationalismthe same ethnic pride \nthat Milosevic once\u0014\n                         exploitedand their desire to put the \nhorrific Milosevic era\u0014\n                         behind them. Kostunica especially feared \nlooking like a lackey\u0014\n                         of the NATO allies who want to send \nMilosevic to The Hague.\u0014\n                         Djindjic, on the other hand, is an avowed \nliberal who fears a\u0014\n                         cutoff of Western fundsand who harbors \npresidential\u0014\n                         ambitions himself.\u0014",

According to the\u0014\n                      Gospels, it was in the area\u0014\n                      of Bethany and Bethphage\u0014\n                      that Jesus would have\u0014\n                      stayed each evening of the\u0014\n                      Passover holidayon the\u0014\n                      far slope of the Mount of\u0014\n                      Olives, where his followers\u0014\n                      Mary and Martha lived and\u0014\n                      where he raised their\u0014\n                      brother Lazarus from the\u0014\n                      dead. During the festival it\u0014\n                      was a tradition and a\u0014\n                      necessity for pilgrims to\u0014\n                      spend the night on the\u0014\n                      outlying hills. Each morning\u0014\n                      Jesus would have set out\u0014\n                      again, over the top of the mount and then down \nits western slope to the great holy city below. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today verses from the Koran waft from a dozen \nopen windows in the town of Bethany. Islam regards\u0014\n                      Jesus as a great prophet, and Bethany's mostly \nMuslim residents are proud of its 2,000-year-old\u0014\n                      tradition. Just a few yards down a steep road \nfrom the tomb believed to have been Lazarus' is al Ozir\u0014\n                      Mosque, named for him in Arabic; a few yards up \nis a Greek Orthodox church honoring Mary and\u0014\n                      Martha. Jesus, on his way to Jerusalem, would \nhave walked up this hill, a local woman explains,\u0014\n                      and turned right at the top toward Bethphage. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Next would have come a hike along the hill's \ncrest, which would have led him to a place now\u0014\n                      occupied by a hotel called the Seven Arches. \nThe view here is stunning. Directly below is an ancient\u0014\n                      necropolisan immense graveyard dating back \nlong before Jesus that could cause anyone, not just\u0014\n                      a religious rebel with a price on his head, to \nconsider his mortality. The ground falls off sharply,\u0014\n                      dotted with stands of pine and, yes, silvery \ngreen olive trees. Jesusor his donkeywould have\u0014\n                      picked his way from here down into the Kidron \nValley. On the other side, then as now, a great tan\u0014\n                      wallthe grandiose platform for a place of \nworshipwould have reared up before him. He would have\u0014\n                      passed through what was known as the Beautiful \nGate and entered Jerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Across from the Seven Arches, five or six \ncolored hens pick for corn, and a herd of sheep grazes\u0014\n                      among scarlet anemones. Hiba Gaith, an \n11-year-old Palestinian girl who lives nearby, is singing a\u0014\n                      song she and her friends learned at school. She \nwears jeans, and her long ponytail is done up with\u0014\n                      a brown butterfly clip. \"The sound of the \nstone/ The blood of usurpers/ The hearts are bleeding in\u0014\n                      fury/ They carry stones in their small hands/ \nAnd challenge the aggressors,\" she sings. \"The martyr\u0014\n                      Mohammed/ Seen by millions/ Taking refuge in \nthe bosom of his father/ Dying by damned bullets/\u0014\n                      His blood is splashing in the sky.\" The song, \nby Egyptian pop artist Walid Tawfiq, is about\u0014\n                      Mohammed al-Durra, the 12-year-old whom the \nworld witnessed dying in his father's arms in cross\u0014\n                      fire last October during the early stages of \nthe latest Israeli-Palestinian conflagration. The tune, says\u0014\n                      Hiba, \"is implanted in my heart.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seven-year-old Mahmoud Zomored zooms by on his \nred-and-black tricycle. He pauses to peer down\u0014\n                      at the city below. What does he see there? \"I \nsee war.\" Why? \"The Arabs throw stones at Jews,\u0014\n                      and Jews kill Arabs.\" Does he throw stones? \n\"No. I do not want to die.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is impossible today to hear the word \nJerusalem without thinking about the violence that is again\u0014\n                      bedeviling the Holy Land. The Palestinians do \nmore than throw stones; and the Israelis are entitled\u0014\n                      to their own odes to lost children. Like \n10-month-old Shalhevet Pass, the daughter of Jewish settlers\u0014\n                      in the mostly Palestinian city of Hebron, who \ndied last month when a sniper put a bullet, apparently\u0014\n                      intentionally, through her head. Last week, \none-year-old Ariel Yered was critically wounded in a\u0014\n                      Palestinian mortar attack on the Atzmona \nsettlement in the Gaza Strip. Almost 400 Palestinians\u0014\n                      and 65 Israelis have died since last fall, when \npeace negotiations imploded over the question of\u0014\n                      Jerusalem's status. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The current agony is not atypical of the \nlocale's holy, bloody history. Over the centuries, each of the\u0014\n                      West's great faiths has coveted the city; each \nalternately has controlled it, and each has\u0014\n                      constructed around it a separate sacred \nhistory. As the myths have collided, the result has been a\u0014\n                      play of extremes: physical splendor alternating \nwith utter destruction; moments of pious exultation\u0014\n                      oscillating with the grossest carnage. Or \nsometimes carnage and exultation at once. \"Men rode in\u0014\n                      blood up to their knees and bridle reins,\" \nwrote an 11th century Crusader fresh from a massacre of\u0014\n                      Muslims on the Temple Mount. He added, \"Indeed, \nit was a just and splendid judgment of God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The years from A.D. 1 to A.D. 33 happened to be \na high point for the holy city. It was, says Eric\u0014\n                      Meyers, professor of Judaic studies at Duke \nUniversity, \"a great, great metropolitan area\" and home\u0014\n                      to the lavishly restored Jewish Temple, a \nworld-renowned wonder. It was prosperous and\u0014\n                      cosmopolitan. And it was also, unknowingly, the \ncradle for something else, a way of believing, of\u0014\n                      seeing, that would change the West and the rest \nof history. It is worth revisiting Jerusalem during\u0014\n                      this period not so much in celebration as in \ncuriosityto know the metropolis that shaped Jesus'\u0014\n                      last ministry and so wove itself into his great \nstory, and to note, cautiously, the ways in which its\u0014\n                      vexations foreshadow those of Jerusalem today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is the Gospel of Luke that describes Jesus' \nchildhood visit to Jerusalem. Though he had been\u0014\n                      there beforeLuke says his family was visiting \n\"as usual\" for Passoverthe 12-year-old from\u0014\n                      Nazareth, 60 miles to the north, must still \nhave been agog walking south down the grand new\u0014\n                      Roman street toward the Temple's lower \nentrance. A stretch of that road is visible today, just below\u0014\n                      the Western Wall, majestically wide but piled \nhigh on one side with huge blocks of stone that rained\u0014\n                      from above during one of the city's many \ndestructions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is a debate regarding exactly how \ncitified the young Jesus would have been. Excavations of\u0014\n                      the city of Sepphoris, near Nazareth, reveal a \nbustling town, suggesting that he may have been less\u0014\n                      of a country lad than previous scholarship \nposited. But his native Galilee certainly had nothing to\u0014\n                      compare with this. Jerusalem was one of the \nbiggest cities between Alexandria and Damascus, with\u0014\n                      a permanent population of some 80,000. During \nPassover, Succoth and Shavuoth, the great festivals\u0014\n                      during which Jews were obligated to make \nsacrifices at the Temple, between 100,000 and 250,000\u0014\n                      visitors (historians differ) would stream down \nthe long city thoroughfare. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The pilgrims would have shared the road with ox \nteams hauling huge slabs of limestone. Jerusalem,\u0014\n                      like today's Chicago, New York City or London, \nwas a huge, ongoing building project. The sounds of\u0014\n                      construction would have mixed with the bleats \nand bellows of sacrificial animals for sale in\u0014\n                      streetside shops. The view to Jesus' left would \nhave been taken up by a wall up to 150 ft. higha\u0014\n                      wall not of the Temple itself but of a \ngargantuan platform atop which it perched. To his right would\u0014\n                      have been Jerusalem's Upper City, its Gold \nCoast, where the families of the priests who tended the\u0014\n                      sacrificial altars lived according to Jewish \nlaw but in Roman splendor. Asked to imagine the boy's\u0014\n                      main impression, Roni Reich, director of Temple \nMount excavations for the Israeli Antiquities\u0014\n                      Authority, says, \"Big!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The city was in a renaissance. Its initial \nsplendor had been snuffed out by Babylonia in 586 B.C.\u0014\n                      Within 50 years, Jews had begun rebuilding, but \nfull glory awaited the rule, from 37 B.C. to 4 B.C.,\u0014\n                      of Herod the Great. Herod is one of ancient \nhistory's extraordinary figures. Ten times married, a\u0014\n                      serious drinker and a half-Jew who was \nhalf-trusted by his subjects, he played the superpower\u0014\n                      politics of his day consummately. In 63 B.C., \nRome became Judea's ruler, succeeding Babylonia,\u0014\n                      Persia, Greece and the Jews themselves. Herod, \nwho hailed from the neighboring province of\u0014\n                      Idumea (which included part of today's West \nBank), won and maintained his position as the empire's\u0014\n                      proxy King of the Jews by allying himself \nsuccessively with Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and\u0014\n                      Emperor Augustus, a dance involving very tricky \npirouettes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Herod killed thousands of Jerusalemites in the \nstreets while taking power. But he was also a local\u0014\n                      who understood Judea's needs and its hard-won \nprivilege of being governed under Jewish law. A\u0014\n                      builder king, he ordered up huge forts, palaces \nand indeed whole cities throughout Judea, and he\u0014\n                      created an artificial harbor at Caesarea \nMaritima that lasted 600 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But it was in Jerusalem, says Meyers, that \nHerod \"undertook to make one of the major wonders of\u0014\n                      the ancient world.\" He rebuilt the existing \nmeandering streets on a paved grid and created a\u0014\n                      moat-ringed palace featuringin a \nmoisture-starved regionpicturesque water gardens. He added\u0014\n                      an amphitheater and a hippodrome. But the jewel \nin the crown, the spiritual, economic and social\u0014\n                      center of Judea and an icon to Jews throughout \nthe region, was the Temple. It was his bid to rival\u0014\n                      Solomon, biblical builder of the Jews' first \ngreat house of worship, which had been razed by the\u0014\n                      Babylonians some 570 years earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Physical remains of Herod's masterpiece are \nscarce. But they tend to support descriptions in the\u0014\n                      four surviving written sources from \napproximately the same period: the Gospels and the biblical book\u0014\n                      of Acts; the part of the Jewish Talmud called \nthe Mishnah; and the histories of Flavius Josephus, a\u0014\n                      Jewish priest and commander turned Roman \nmilitary aide who lived in the years A.D. 30 to A.D.\u0014\n                      100. For instance, a stone found later near the \nTemple's likely site was inscribed with the words to\u0014\n                      the place of trumpeting, which corroborate \nJosephus' description of the signal for the beginning of\u0014\n                      the Sabbath. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tradition forbade the Temple's enlargement \nbeyond Solomon's original dimensions. So Herod\u0014\n                      expressed his egomania by adding a 35-acre \nplatform \"the greatest ever heard of,\" writes\u0014\n                      Josephuson which the Temple could sit. The \nWestern Wall where Jews pray today is a small\u0014\n                      slice of the platform's 16-ft.-thick western \nside. Some of the stones are 30 ft. long and weigh up to\u0014\n                      50 tons. (\"Look, Teacher, what large stones and \nwhat large buildings!\" exclaims a disciple in the\u0014\n                      Gospel of Mark.) As Herod built out over the \nadjacent valleys, the outline of the mountain on which\u0014\n                      the compound sat gradually disappeared. The \ngreat stone featured in the Dome of the Rock, the\u0014\n                      Muslim shrine that now occupies Herod's immense \npedestal, may be the mountain's peak. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the time, the platform (Jews call it the \nTemple Mount) had up to seven entrances. Most experts\u0014\n                      believe the remains of an expansive, \ncarved-stone stairway on the south side of the mount,\u0014\n                      perpendicular to the Roman street, were once \nthe main entry for common pilgrims. At the foot of the\u0014\n                      stairs are the ruins of a series of baths, for \nritual purification, and small shops, some of which still\u0014\n                      have hitches for animals. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Temple worship revolved around sacrifice: a \nlamb for Passover, a bull for Yom Kippur, two\u0014\n                      doves\"the poor woman's sacrifice\"to celebrate \na child's birth. Before buying an animal, visitors\u0014\n                      changed their Roman denarii (the dollar of the \nday) for shekels, or Temple coins, that had no\u0014\n                      portraits on them and so did not violate the \nJewish prohibition of graven images. Herod appears to\u0014\n                      have allowed the money changers onto the Temple \nplatform, which may have spurred Jesus'\u0014\n                      scourging of them in \"my father's house.\" \nJoshua Schwartz, a professor of historical geography at\u0014\n                      Israel's Bar Ilan University, styles the \nstairway as a Judean version of London's Hyde Park Corner.\u0014\n                      There would be \"beggars and upper-class Jews \nand Gentiles from all over,\" he says. \"Scholars\u0014\n                      would be teaching, and would-be prophets would \nbe preaching. The steps were the experience in\u0014\n                      Jerusalem.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After the Temple itself, perhaps. Scholars have \nhypothesized that the southern steps led pilgrims\u0014\n                      into a tunnel under an administrative building \nand out again amid a series of courtyards. The\u0014\n                      outermost was open to curious Gentiles. The \nremaining enclosures were for Jews only, as indicated\u0014\n                      by another of the Temple's remaining relicsa \nsign, in Greek, warning that any non-Jew passing\u0014\n                      farther \"is answerable himself for his ensuing \ndeath.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Next came the Court of Women, followed by the \nCourt of Israelites, the Court of the Priests and,\u0014\n                      above all, the massive sacrificial altar. The \nTemple's innermost shrine, featuring the holy room that\u0014\n                      the Bible said had been occupied by the Ark of \nthe Covenant in Solomon's Temple, loomed 80 ft.\u0014\n                      high, a glistening tower. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The scene must have been spectacular. Whether \nthat spectacle is understood as deeply felt or\u0014\n                      empty depends on later interpretation. \"The \nplace was as vast as a small city. There were literally\u0014\n                      thousands of priests, attendants, temple \nsoldiers and minions,\" writes historian Paul Johnson.\u0014\n                      \"Dignity was quite lost amid the smoke of the \npyres, the bellows of terrified beasts, the sluices of\u0014\n                      blood, the abattoir stench, the unconcealed and \nunconcealable machinery of tribal religion inflated\u0014\n                      by modern wealth to an industrial scale.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bruce Chilton, a religion professor at Bard \nCollege whose book \"Rabbi Jesus\" was published in\u0014\n                      October, says recent scholarship finds a great \ndeal more meaning and joy in the proceedings.\u0014\n                      Pilgrimages were festive occasions, with \nfamilies or friends traveling together and camping overnight\u0014\n                      in the hills around the city and singing \ncheerful sacred songs outside the Temple. Although parts of\u0014\n                      the sacrifice would be immolated for the Lord \nor consumed by the priests, others would be cooked\u0014\n                      and shared by the pilgrims, who ate little meat \nthe rest of the year. \"Not only would they offer this\u0014\n                      very scarce protein to the deity,\" says \nChilton, \"but actually share a meal of meat with the Lord of\u0014\n                      Israel. The sense was one of wealth and \ncelebration.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hollow or hallowed, the Temple was a formidable \neconomic engine. Although only 2 million of the\u0014\n                      ancient world's 5 million Jews lived in the \nregion, all were expected to pay a yearly half-shekel\u0014\n                      Temple tax. Historians have not definitively \nestablished a shekel's worth, but certainly the total\u0014\n                      earnings were great. At the three pilgrimage \nholidays, the economy shifted into overdrive. Jewish law\u0014\n                      required that sacrificial animals and grain \nofferings be \"unblemished.\" Rather than risk spoilage\u0014\n                      along the way, most pilgrims raised the \nsacrificial goods at home, sold them and used the proceeds\u0014\n                      to buy fresh items in the holy city, supporting \nfarmers for miles around. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      An excavation under what is now the Jewish \nQuarter of Jerusalem's Old City reveals the way the\u0014\n                      town's lite lived. Two-story houses, built \naround stone-paved inner courts, had separate baths for\u0014\n                      regular and ritual cleansing. Floors boasted \nfine mosaics; on the walls were frescoes or trompe l'oeil\u0014\n                      stucco that mimicked masonry. Archaeologists \nhave uncovered finely crafted glass goblets and\u0014\n                      delicate perfume flasks. Experts are divided as \nto whether such prosperity was shared. Says Reich:\u0014\n                      \"There weren't any real poor people in \nJerusalem then. There were the rich and the less rich.\"\u0014\n                      Argues Fabian Udoh, professor of liberal \nstudies at Notre Dame University: \"The high priests, the\u0014\n                      aristocrats and the administrators would have \nbeen very, very rich, but there were also people who\u0014\n                      were very, very poor.\" The obvious economic \ntension in Jesus' preaching may reflect his experience\u0014\n                      either in Jerusalem or in Galilee. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those in the middle, the craftsmen (like Jesus) \nand small businessmen and jewelers and tax\u0014\n                      collectors, would have got their education at \nhome and at their local synagogue. (The wealthy would\u0014\n                      have hired tutors for their children, in the \nGreek style.) Women married in their early teens and\u0014\n                      would generally undergo seven or eight \npregnancies in hopes of having three or four surviving\u0014\n                      children. They often managed the household and \nexerted considerable influence in the synagogue.\u0014\n                      The family would have observed religious laws \nregarding food and ritual purity, although many\u0014\n                      aspects of Jewish law were not formalized until \nlater. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jerusalem was a monoculture, comparable to \nWashington or Redmond, Wash. (It remains so today,\u0014\n                      although it is now tourism rather than religion \nthat is the city's dominant business.) Unlike many\u0014\n                      company towns, however, the city in Jesus' time \nhad a cosmopolitan feel. Its material needs drew\u0014\n                      caravans from Samaria, Syria, Egypt, Nabatea, \nArabia and Persia. Two-thirds of its population were\u0014\n                      Jews (roughly the same percentage as today), \npracticing a religion that counted millions of\u0014\n                      adherents in the Roman Empire and a large group \nof \"God fearers,\" Gentiles who observed some\u0014\n                      key precepts without full conversion. At the \nsame time, the city was in its 15th generation of\u0014\n                      Greco-Roman influence (since the conquests of \nAlexander the Great in 332 B.C.). Parents gave\u0014\n                      their children Greek names; intellectuals were \nconversant in classical philosophy. Greek had\u0014\n                      become along with Hebrew and Aramaic one of the \narea's main languages, and one of the most\u0014\n                      commonly used versions of the Torah was in \nGreek. (Jesus presumably spoke all three languages.)\u0014\n                      The interaction of Jewish and classical thought \nwould lend the Christian Bible much of its strength. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This Greco-Roman \"modernism\" was conflicted, \nhowever. A building full of soldiers loomed over the\u0014\n                      Temple courtyards like a watchtower over a \nprison. As Jesus and the other pilgrims performed the\u0014\n                      most sacred rites of their faith, they would \nnever be beyond surveillance. After Herod's initial rise, the\u0014\n                      Roman yoke was relatively light, consisting \nmostly of tribute. But the Jews had been independent for\u0014\n                      a century before the imperial conquest, and \nmany hoped to return to that state. In recognition of\u0014\n                      this, above the Temple's northwestern corner \nstood the city's great Roman garrison, the Antonia,\u0014\n                      named after Herod's patron Mark Antony and \nhousing between 2,000 and 3,000 soldiers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Their presence in the city's very soul posed a \npainful conundrum. Beneath its prosperous surface,\u0014\n                      says Neil Asher Silberman, director of the \nEname Center for Public Archaeology in Brussels,\u0014\n                      Jerusalem was actually \"extremely turbulent.\" \nTo some, \"the beautiful Temple of Herod was a\u0014\n                      horrible betrayal of Israelite tradition. Herod \nobliterated the original Temple and replaced it with a\u0014\n                      Roman one.\" Even the most prosperous citizens \nmust have had some major identity issues. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This led, Silberman suggests, to \"movements of \ndesperation where people harked back to a purity of\u0014\n                      faith and looked for signs of messianic \nredemption.\" The city's dominant religious authorities,\u0014\n                      skewered in the Gospels, were the Sadducees, \nwho made up most of the Temple lite, and the\u0014\n                      Pharisees, respected for their ongoing \nexplorations of the correct interpretation of religious law. But\u0014\n                      the city also played host to groups like the \nZealots, a militant nationalist group, and the Essenes.\u0014\n                      The Essenes detested the Temple priests, lived \nin monastic communities and may have been\u0014\n                      authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the treasure \ntrove of texts uncovered in the Judean desert in 1947.\u0014\n                      Josephus assigns the Essenes a membership of \n4,000, only 2,000 fewer than his count of\u0014\n                      Pharisees. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And then there were radical free-lancers like \nJesus. Up until 20 years ago, it was left to Jewish\u0014\n                      analysts to present Jesus' various messagesof \ninner purity over legal adherence; of baptism; of\u0014\n                      messianism; of the expectation of God's kingdom \non earthas growing out of various 1st century\u0014\n                      Jewish beliefs. But lately, says Chilton, more \nChristian scholars have scuttled the idea that Jesus'\u0014\n                      Judaism was mere \"ethnic happenstance.\" He \nargues, \"If you were to take the elements of Jesus'\u0014\n                      position in isolation, each would [recall] the \npractice of a certain type of Judaism. He is distinctive in\u0014\n                      the way in which he brings the elements \ntogether and is able to mediate the spirit of God to his\u0014\n                      followers so that they can be part of the \nrevelation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In any case, Jesus' radical new synthesisand \nhis dramatic preaching of itwas dangerous,\u0014\n                      especially in an atmosphere that Schwartz says \nhad turned into \"a tinderbox.\" Herod had managed\u0014\n                      to keep a lid on anti-Roman sentiment for most \nof his reign. But starting with his fatal illness in 4\u0014\n                      B.C. and continuing over the careers of several \nless effective successors, a series of bloodily\u0014\n                      suppressed revolts erupted. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 4 B.C., angry Jews, protesting the execution \nof students who had tried to remove a Roman eagle\u0014\n                      from the Temple decorations, threw stones down \non their occupiers from the mount's porches and\u0014\n                      set off a citywide riot; eventually 2,000 \nrebels were crucified. In A.D. 26, the Roman governor\u0014\n                      provocatively ordered his troops to raise flags \nwith Caesar's face within a few hundred feet of the\u0014\n                      central shrine. A mob marched to his house in \nCaesarea. His soldiers drew their swords. The Jews,\u0014\n                      in an extraordinary act of passive resistance, \nlaid bare their necks and said they would rather die\u0014\n                      than see their religious laws flouted. The \ngovernor, a normally hot-tempered newcomer named\u0014\n                      Pontius Pilate, recalled the flags. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The situations now and then are not analogous. \nIsrael's current Jewish government, unlike the\u0014\n                      Roman Empire, is not alien to Jerusalem. The \nPalestinians are not as defenseless as the ancient\u0014\n                      Jews. And Israeli opposition leader (now Prime \nMinister) Ariel Sharon's unwelcome stroll last\u0014\n                      September around the two Islamic shrines that \nnow occupy the Temple platforma provocation that\u0014\n                      may have sparked the Holy Land's current strife \nwhen Muslims responded by throwing rocks down\u0014\n                      on Jews at prayer belowhas no precise 1st \ncentury cognate. Still, the intertwined dynamic of\u0014\n                      military occupation and religious clash is \nshockingly familiar. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two thousand years ago, the man in the middle \nof this potentially deadly tug-of-war was the high\u0014\n                      priest. The position, ritually paramount at the \nTemple, had been politically hobbled by Herod.\u0014\n                      Nonetheless, as head of the Sanhedrin, a Jewish \nreligious and civic body, and a key participant at\u0014\n                      city council meetings, the officeholder still \nhad great power and responsibility. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The actions of Caiaphas, high priest from A.D. \n18 to A.D. 36, are traditionally attributed to rage over\u0014\n                      Jesus' challenges to his class's power and his \npersonal standing. But historians have begun to\u0014\n                      argue for a more nuanced appreciation. Caiaphas \nknew better than anyone that the doomed Jewish\u0014\n                      revolts inevitably started at the Temple, \nfrequently during Passover, as keyed-up pilgrims celebrated\u0014\n                      Israel's liberation from an earlier oppressor. \nHe knew Pilate as a ruler, says Richard Horsley of the\u0014\n                      University of Massachusetts, Boston, who \"shot \nfirst and asked questions later.\" Personal pride\u0014\n                      notwithstanding, the high priest had reason to \nact against a Jew who had disrupted the Temple and\u0014\n                      may have been plotting another grand entrance \non the second day of the feast. To Caiaphas, says\u0014\n                      Lee Levine, professor of Jewish history at \nJerusalem's Hebrew University, \"Jesus and others like him\u0014\n                      were just a bad idea. Bad for the Temple, bad \nfor the Romans and bad for the Jews.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rome reserved crucifixion primarily for capital \ncrimes and discontinued the practice in the 4th\u0014\n                      century. Historians learned considerably more \nabout its specifics in 1968, when the remains of a\u0014\n                      man crucified in his mid 30s were discovered \nnorth of Jerusalem with a 7-in. iron nail still embedded\u0014\n                      in the heel. The state of the bones indicated \nthat the condemned man's arms were outstretched and\u0014\n                      that his feet had been placed sideways, with \nthe nail driven first through a small block of wood and\u0014\n                      then through both heels into the cross. Later \nthe wood block would prevent the feet from coming free\u0014\n                      as the wound ripped and enlarged. Contrary to \nmost representations, the knees were bent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The path of the Via Dolorosa, the Stations of \nthe Cross, through the Old City of Jerusalem is almost\u0014\n                      certainly inaccurate. It follows a 14th century \ngrid of the city rather than a 1st century plan, and\u0014\n                      probably reflects the desire of 14th century \nmerchants along the way to get pilgrims' business. But\u0014\n                      the hill of Golgotha (a.k.a. Calvary) and \nJesus' burial cave, both located by tradition in Jerusalem's\u0014\n                      Church of the Holy Sepulcher, are a different \nmatter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Jesus' day executions and burials took place \noutside the city. Today the church is tucked within\u0014\n                      the Old City's Christian Quarter, but at the \ntime, the area would have been safely outside town walls.\u0014\n                      The niche-style grave is consistent with 1st \ncentury custom. Written attestations to its\u0014\n                      authenticityand that of the Calvary rock a few \nyards awaydate back more than 1,800 years.\u0014\n                      Tellingly, early rulers who might have been \ntempted to \"adjust\" the site's location did not do so.\u0014\n                      Says Dan Bahat, for many years Jerusalem's \ndistrict archaeologist: \"There's nothing to prove that\u0014\n                      this is not the site of the Crucifixion.\" If \nthis sounds weak to a believer, coming from an\u0014\n                      archaeologist, it carries significant weight. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When the unnamed disciple remarked on the size \nof the Temple stones, Jesus replied that \"not one\u0014\n                      stone will be left upon another; all will be \nthrown down.\" He was right. After one last rebellion, in\u0014\n                      A.D. 135, the Romans leveled Jerusalem, leaving \nonly the bald platform behind. The city, of course,\u0014\n                      rose again and fell again, was conquered and \nreconquered . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yousef Abu Ghannam's family holds the key (and \nthe souvenir concession) for the Mosque of the\u0014\n                      Ascension on the Mount of Olives; it was a \nChristian shrine until Saladin took Jerusalem back from\u0014\n                      the Crusaders. Abu Ghannam reports sadly that \nbusiness is down. \"We used to get 700 to 800\u0014\n                      people a day,\" he says. \"Now we're lucky to get \n150. People are afraid.\" The few visitors who brave\u0014\n                      Jerusalem today encounter a metropolis again \nedgy and turbulent. In the sanctuary of the city's\u0014\n                      churches, mosques and synagogues, pilgrims can \nfind momentary tranquillity. But the streets bear\u0014\n                      new pocks from the bullets that flew here late \nlast year. Herod's ancient platform had been closed\u0014\n                      since last fall to all but Islamic worshippers \nto avoid further confrontation: Sharon's directive last\u0014\n                      week to reopen it to non-Muslims may make it a \nflashpoint again. Travel in the area is the riskiest in\u0014\n                      a decade, and a U.S. State Department warning \nagainst it remains in effect. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the Ascension Mosque there is at least one \noptimist, albeit with a long view.

    "words": "Jerusalem as \nJesus Saw it\u0014\n                                                         Time \nMagazine  4/9/01\u0014\n\u0014\n          By David Van Biema/Jerusalem \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This would have been his path. According to the \nGospels, it was in  \u0014\n                      the area of Bethany and Bethphage that Jesus \nwould have stayed \u0014\n                      each evening of the Passover holidayon the far \nslope of the Mount   \u0014\n                      of Olives, where his followers Mary and Martha \nlived and\u0014\n                      where he raised their brother Lazarus from the \ndead. During the        \u0014\n                      festival it was a tradition and a necessity for \npilgrims to spend the      \u0014\n                      night on the outlying hills. Each morning Jesus \nwould have set out\u0014\n                      again, over the top of the mount and then down \nits western slope to \u0014\n                     the great holy city below. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today verses from the Koran waft from a dozen \nopen windows in the town of Bethany. Islam regards Jesus as a great \nprophet, and Bethany's mostly Muslim residents are proud of its \n2,000-year-old tradition. Just a few yards down a steep road from the \ntomb believed to have been Lazarus' is al Ozir\u0014\nMosque, named for him in Arabic; a few yards up is a Greek Orthodox \nchurch honoring Mary and Martha. Jesus, on his way to Jerusalem, \nwould have walked up this hill, a local woman explains, and turned \nright at the top toward Bethphage. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Next would have come a hike along the hill's \ncrest, which would have led him to a place now occupied by a hotel \ncalled the Seven Arches. The view here is stunning. Directly below is \nan ancient necropolisan immense graveyard dating back long before \nJesus that could cause anyone, not just\u0014\na religious rebel with a price on his head, to consider his \nmortality. The ground falls off sharply, dotted with stands of pine \nand, yes, silvery green olive trees. Jesusor his donkeywould have \npicked his way from here down into the Kidron Valley. On the other \nside, then as now, a great tan wallthe grandiose platform for a \nplace of worshipwould have reared up before him. He would have \npassed through what was known as the Beautiful Gate and entered \nJerusalem. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Across from the Seven Arches, five or six \ncolored hens pick for corn, and a herd of sheep grazes among scarlet \nanemones. Hiba Gaith, an 11-year-old Palestinian girl who lives \nnearby, is singing a song she and her friends learned at school. She \nwears jeans, and her long ponytail is done up with a brown butterfly \nclip. \"The sound of the stone/ The blood of usurpers/ The hearts are \nbleeding in\u0014\nfury/ They carry stones in their small hands/ And challenge the \naggressors,\" she sings. \"The martyr Mohammed/ Seen by millions/ \nTaking refuge in the bosom of his father/ Dying by damned bullets/His \nblood is splashing in the sky.\" The song, by Egyptian pop artist \nWalid Tawfiq, is about Mohammed al-Durra, the 12-year-old whom the \nworld witnessed dying in his father's arms in cross\u0014\nfire last October during the early stages of the latest \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflagration. The tune, says Hiba, \"is implanted \nin my heart.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Seven-year-old Mahmoud Zomored zooms by on his \nred-and-black tricycle. He pauses to peer down at the city below. \nWhat does he see there? \"I see war.\" Why? \"The Arabs throw stones at \nJews, and Jews kill Arabs.\" Does he throw stones? \"No. I do not want \nto die.\" It is impossible today to hear the word Jerusalem without \nthinking about the violence that is again bedeviling the Holy Land. \nThe Palestinians do more than throw stones; and the Israelis are \nentitled\u0014\nto their own odes to lost children. Like 10-month-old Shalhevet Pass, \nthe daughter of Jewish settlers in the mostly Palestinian city of \nHebron, who died last month when a sniper put a bullet, apparently \nintentionally, through her head. Last week, one-year-old Ariel Yered \nwas critically wounded in a\u0014\nPalestinian mortar attack on the Atzmona settlement in the Gaza \nStrip. Almost 400 Palestinians and 65 Israelis have died since last \nfall, when peace negotiations imploded over the question of  \nJerusalem's status. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The current agony is not atypical of the \nlocale's holy, bloody history. Over the centuries, each of the West's \ngreat faiths has coveted the city; each alternately has controlled \nit, and each has constructed around it a separate sacred history. As \nthe myths have collided, the result has been a play of extremes: \nphysical splendor alternating with utter destruction; moments of \npious exultation oscillating with the grossest carnage. Or sometimes \ncarnage and exultation at once. \"Men rode in blood up to their knees \nand bridle reins,\" wrote an 11th century Crusader fresh from a \nmassacre of Muslims on the Temple Mount. He added, \"Indeed, it was a \njust and splendid judgment of God.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The years from A.D. 1 to A.D. 33 happened to be \na high point for the holy city. It was, says Eric Meyers, professor \nof Judaic studies at Duke University, \"a great, great metropolitan \narea\" and home to the lavishly restored Jewish Temple, a \nworld-renowned wonder. It was prosperous and             \ncosmopolitan. And it was also, unknowingly, the cradle for something \nelse, a way of believing, of seeing, that would change the West and \nthe rest of history. It is worth revisiting Jerusalem during this \nperiod not so much in celebration as in curiosityto know the \nmetropolis that shaped Jesus' last ministry and so wove itself into \nhis great story, and to note, cautiously, the ways in which its \nvexations foreshadow those of Jerusalem today. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is the Gospel of Luke that describes Jesus' \nchildhood visit to Jerusalem. Though he had been there beforeLuke \nsays his family was visiting \"as usual\" for Passoverthe 12-year-old \nfrom Nazareth, 60 miles to the north, must still have been agog \nwalking south down the grand new  Roman street toward the Temple's \nlower entrance. A stretch of that road is visible today, just below \nthe Western Wall, majestically wide but piled high on one side with \nhuge blocks of stone that rained from above during one of the city's \nmany destructions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is a debate regarding exactly how \ncitified the young Jesus would have been. Excavations of the city of \nSepphoris, near Nazareth, reveal a bustling town, suggesting that he \nmay have been less of a country lad than previous scholarship \nposited. But his native Galilee certainly had nothing to\u0014\ncompare with this. Jerusalem was one of the biggest cities between \nAlexandria and Damascus, with a permanent population of some 80,000. \nDuring Passover, Succoth and Shavuoth, the great festivals during \nwhich Jews were obligated to make sacrifices at the Temple, between \n100,000 and 250,000 visitors (historians differ) would stream down \nthe long city thoroughfare.  The pilgrims would have shared the road \nwith ox teams hauling huge slabs of limestone. Jerusalem,\u0014\nlike today's Chicago, New York City or London, was a huge, ongoing \nbuilding project. The sounds of construction would have mixed with \nthe bleats and bellows of sacrificial animals for sale in streetside \nshops. The view to Jesus' left would have been taken up by a wall up \nto 150 ft. higha wall not of the Temple itself but of a gargantuan \nplatform atop which it perched. To his right would\u0014\nhave been Jerusalem's Upper City, its Gold Coast, where the families \nof the priests who tended the sacrificial altars lived according to \nJewish law but in Roman splendor. Asked to imagine the boy's main \nimpression, Roni Reich, director of Temple Mount excavations for the \nIsraeli Antiquities Authority, says, \"Big!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The city was in a renaissance. Its initial \nsplendor had been snuffed out by Babylonia in 586 B.C. Within 50 \nyears, Jews had begun rebuilding, but full glory awaited the rule, \nfrom 37 B.C. to 4 B.C., of Herod the Great. Herod is one of ancient \nhistory's extraordinary figures. Ten times married, a serious drinker \nand a half-Jew who was half-trusted by his subjects, he played the \nsuperpower\u0014\npolitics of his day consummately. In 63 B.C., Rome became Judea's \nruler, succeeding Babylonia, Persia, Greece and the Jews themselves. \nHerod, who hailed from the neighboring province of Idumea (which \nincluded part of today's West Bank), won and maintained his position \nas the empire's proxy King of the Jews by allying himself \nsuccessively with Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and\u0014\nEmperor Augustus, a dance involving very tricky pirouettes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Herod killed thousands of Jerusalemites in the \nstreets while taking power. But he was also a local who understood \nJudea's needs and its hard-won privilege of being governed under \nJewish law. A builder king, he ordered up huge forts, palaces and \nindeed whole cities throughout Judea, and he created an artificial \nharbor at Caesarea Maritima that lasted 600 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But it was in Jerusalem, says Meyers, that \nHerod \"undertook to make one of the major wonders of the ancient \nworld.\" He rebuilt the existing meandering streets on a paved grid \nand created a moat-ringed palace featuringin a moisture-starved \nregionpicturesque water gardens. He added\u0014\nan amphitheater and a hippodrome. But the jewel in the crown, the \nspiritual, economic and social center of Judea and an icon to Jews \nthroughout the region, was the Temple. It was his bid to rival \nSolomon, biblical builder of the Jews' first great house of worship, \nwhich had been razed by the Babylonians some 570 years earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Physical remains of Herod's masterpiece are \nscarce. But they tend to support descriptions in the four surviving \nwritten sources from approximately the same period: the Gospels and \nthe biblical book of Acts; the part of the Jewish Talmud called the \nMishnah; and the histories of Flavius Josephus, a Jewish priest and \ncommander turned Roman military aide who lived in the years A.D. 30 \nto A.D. 100. For instance, a stone found later near the Temple's \nlikely site was inscribed with the words to the place of trumpeting, \nwhich corroborate Josephus' description of the signal for the \nbeginning of the Sabbath. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Tradition forbade the Temple's enlargement \nbeyond Solomon's original dimensions. So Herod expressed his egomania \nby adding a 35-acre platform \"the greatest ever heard of,\" writes \nJosephuson which the Temple could sit. The Western Wall where Jews \npray today is a small slice of the platform's 16-ft.-thick western \nside. Some of the stones are 30 ft. long and weigh up to 50 tons. \n(\"Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!\" \nexclaims a disciple in the Gospel of Mark.) As Herod built out over \nthe adjacent valleys, the outline of the mountain on which the \ncompound sat gradually disappeared. The great stone featured in the \nDome of the Rock, the Muslim shrine that now occupies Herod's immense \npedestal, may be the mountain's peak. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the time, the platform (Jews call it the \nTemple Mount) had up to seven entrances. Most experts believe the \nremains of an expansive, carved-stone stairway on the south side of \nthe mount, perpendicular to the Roman street, were once the main \nentry for common pilgrims. At the foot of the stairs are the ruins of \na series of baths, for ritual purification, and small shops, some of \nwhich still have hitches for animals. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Temple worship revolved around sacrifice: a \nlamb for Passover, a bull for Yom Kippur, two doves\"the poor woman's \nsacrifice\"to celebrate a child's birth. Before buying an animal, \nvisitors changed their Roman denarii (the dollar of the day) for \nshekels, or Temple coins, that had no portraits on them and so did \nnot violate the Jewish prohibition of graven images. Herod appears to\u0014\nhave allowed the money changers onto the Temple platform, which may \nhave spurred Jesus' scourging of them in \"my father's house.\" Joshua \nSchwartz, a professor of historical geography at  Israel's Bar Ilan \nUniversity, styles the stairway as a Judean version of London's Hyde \nPark Corner. There would be \"beggars and upper-class Jews and \nGentiles from all over,\" he says. \"Scholars\u0014\nwould be teaching, and would-be prophets would be preaching. The \nsteps were the experience in Jerusalem.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      After the Temple itself, perhaps. Scholars have \nhypothesized that the southern steps led pilgrims into a tunnel under \nan administrative building and out again amid a series of courtyards. \nThe  outermost was open to curious Gentiles. The remaining enclosures \nwere for Jews only, as indicated by another of the Temple's remaining \nrelicsa sign, in Greek, warning that any non-Jew passing farther \"is \nanswerable himself for his ensuing death.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Next came the Court of Women, followed by the \nCourt of Israelites, the Court of the Priests and, above all, the \nmassive sacrificial altar. The Temple's innermost shrine, featuring \nthe holy room that the Bible said had been occupied by the Ark of the \nCovenant in Solomon's Temple, loomed 80 ft. high, a glistening tower. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The scene must have been spectacular. Whether \nthat spectacle is understood as deeply felt or empty depends on later \ninterpretation. \"The place was as vast as a small city. There were \nliterally thousands of priests, attendants, temple soldiers and \nminions,\" writes historian Paul Johnson. \"Dignity was quite lost amid \nthe smoke of the pyres, the bellows of terrified beasts, the sluices \nof\u0014\nblood, the abattoir stench, the unconcealed and unconcealable \nmachinery of tribal religion inflated by modern wealth to an \nindustrial scale.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bruce Chilton, a religion professor at Bard \nCollege whose book \"Rabbi Jesus\" was published in October, says \nrecent scholarship finds a great deal more meaning and joy in the \nproceedings. Pilgrimages were festive occasions, with families or \nfriends traveling together and camping overnight in the hills around \nthe city and singing cheerful sacred songs outside the Temple. \nAlthough parts of the sacrifice would be immolated for the Lord or \nconsumed by the priests, others would be cooked and shared by the \npilgrims, who ate little meat the rest of the year. \"Not only would \nthey offer this very scarce protein to the deity,\" says Chilton, \"but \nactually share a meal of meat with the Lord of Israel. The sense was \none of wealth and celebration.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hollow or hallowed, the Temple was a formidable \neconomic engine. Although only 2 million of the ancient world's 5 \nmillion Jews lived in the region, all were expected to pay a yearly \nhalf-shekel Temple tax. Historians have not definitively established \na shekel's worth, but certainly the total earnings were great. At the \nthree pilgrimage holidays, the economy shifted into overdrive. Jewish \nlaw required that sacrificial animals and grain offerings be \n\"unblemished.\" Rather than risk spoilage along the way, most pilgrims \nraised the sacrificial goods at home, sold them and used the proceeds \nto buy fresh items in the holy city, supporting farmers for miles \naround. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      An excavation under what is now the Jewish \nQuarter of Jerusalem's Old City reveals the way the town's lite \nlived. Two-story houses, built around stone-paved inner courts, had \nseparate baths for regular and ritual cleansing. Floors boasted fine \nmosaics; on the walls were frescoes or trompe l'oeil stucco that \nmimicked masonry. Archaeologists have uncovered finely crafted glass \ngoblets and delicate perfume flasks. Experts are divided as to \nwhether such prosperity was shared. Says Reich: \"There weren't any \nreal poor people in Jerusalem then. There were the rich and the less \nrich.\" Argues Fabian Udoh, professor of liberal studies at Notre Dame \nUniversity: \"The high priests, the aristocrats and the administrators \nwould have been very, very rich, but there were also people who were \nvery, very poor.\" The obvious economic tension in Jesus' preaching \nmay reflect his experience either in Jerusalem or in Galilee. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Those in the middle, the craftsmen (like Jesus) \nand small businessmen and jewelers and tax collectors, would have got \ntheir education at home and at their local synagogue. (The wealthy \nwould have hired tutors for their children, in the Greek style.) \nWomen married in their early teens and would generally undergo seven \nor eight pregnancies in hopes of having three or four surviving \nchildren. They often managed the household and exerted considerable \ninfluence in the synagogue.  The family would have observed religious \nlaws regarding food and ritual purity, although many aspects of \nJewish law were not formalized until later. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jerusalem was a monoculture, comparable to \nWashington or Redmond, Wash. (It remains so today, although it is now \ntourism rather than religion that is the city's dominant business.) \nUnlike many company towns, however, the city in Jesus' time had a \ncosmopolitan feel. Its material needs drew\u0014\ncaravans from Samaria, Syria, Egypt, Nabatea, Arabia and Persia. \nTwo-thirds of its population were Jews (roughly the same percentage \nas today), practicing a religion that counted millions of adherents \nin the Roman Empire and a large group of \"God fearers,\" Gentiles who \nobserved some key precepts without full conversion. At the same time, \nthe city was in its 15th generation of  Greco-Roman influence (since \nthe conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 B.C.). Parents gave\u0014\ntheir children Greek names; intellectuals were conversant in \nclassical philosophy. Greek had become along with Hebrew and Aramaic \none of the area's main languages, and one of the most commonly used \nversions of the Torah was in Greek. (Jesus presumably spoke all three \nlanguages.) The interaction of Jewish and classical thought would \nlend the Christian Bible much of its strength. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This Greco-Roman \"modernism\" was conflicted, \nhowever. A building full of soldiers loomed over the Temple \ncourtyards like a watchtower over a prison. As Jesus and the other \npilgrims performed the most sacred rites of their faith, they would \nnever be beyond surveillance. After Herod's initial rise, the Roman \nyoke was relatively light, consisting mostly of tribute. But the Jews \nhad been independent for a century before the imperial conquest, and \nmany hoped to return to that state. In recognition of this, above the \nTemple's northwestern corner stood the city's great Roman garrison, \nthe Antonia,\u0014\nnamed after Herod's patron Mark Antony and housing between 2,000 and \n3,000 soldiers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Their presence in the city's very soul posed a \npainful conundrum. Beneath its prosperous surface, says Neil Asher \nSilberman, director of the Ename Center for Public Archaeology in \nBrussels, Jerusalem was actually \"extremely turbulent.\" To some, \"the \nbeautiful Temple of Herod was a horrible betrayal of Israelite \ntradition. Herod obliterated the original Temple and replaced it with \na\u0014\nRoman one.\" Even the most prosperous citizens must have had some \nmajor identity issues. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This led, Silberman suggests, to \"movements of \ndesperation where people harked back to a purity of faith and looked \nfor signs of messianic redemption.\" The city's dominant religious \nauthorities, skewered in the Gospels, were the Sadducees, who made up \nmost of the Temple lite, and the Pharisees, respected for their \nongoing explorations of the correct interpretation of religious law. \nBut the city also played host to groups like the Zealots, a militant \nnationalist group, and the Essenes.\u0014\n                      \u0014\n           The Essenes detested the Temple priests, lived in monastic \ncommunities and may have been authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the \ntreasure trove of texts uncovered in the Judean desert in 1947. \nJosephus assigns the Essenes a membership of 4,000, only 2,000 fewer \nthan his count of Pharisees. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And then there were radical free-lancers like \nJesus. Up until 20 years ago, it was left to Jewish analysts to \npresent Jesus' various messagesof inner purity over legal adherence; \nof baptism; of messianism; of the expectation of God's kingdom on \nearthas growing out of various 1st century Jewish beliefs. But \nlately, says Chilton, more Christian scholars have scuttled the idea \nthat Jesus'\u0014\nJudaism was mere \"ethnic happenstance.\" He argues, \"If you were to \ntake the elements of Jesus' position in isolation, each would \n[recall] the practice of a certain type of Judaism. He is distinctive \nin the way in which he brings the elements together and is able to \nmediate the spirit of God to his followers so that they can be part \nof the revelation.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In any case, Jesus' radical new synthesisand \nhis dramatic preaching of itwas dangerous, especially in an \natmosphere that Schwartz says had turned into \"a tinderbox.\" Herod \nhad managed to keep a lid on anti-Roman sentiment for most of his \nreign. But starting with his fatal illness in 4 B.C. and continuing \nover the careers of several less effective successors, a series of \nbloodily suppressed revolts erupted. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 4 B.C., angry Jews, protesting the execution \nof students who had tried to remove a Roman eagle from the Temple \ndecorations, threw stones down on their occupiers from the mount's \nporches and set off a citywide riot; eventually 2,000 rebels were \ncrucified. In A.D. 26, the Roman governor\u0014\nprovocatively ordered his troops to raise flags with Caesar's face \nwithin a few hundred feet of the central shrine. A mob marched to his \nhouse in Caesarea. His soldiers drew their swords. The Jews, in an \nextraordinary act of passive resistance, laid bare their necks and \nsaid they would rather die than see their religious laws flouted. The \ngovernor, a normally hot-tempered newcomer named\u0014\nPontius Pilate, recalled the flags. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The situations now and then are not analogous. \nIsrael's current Jewish government, unlike the Roman Empire, is not \nalien to Jerusalem. The Palestinians are not as defenseless as the \nancient Jews. And Israeli opposition leader (now Prime Minister) \nAriel Sharon's unwelcome stroll last September around the two Islamic \nshrines that now occupy the Temple platforma provocation that may \nhave sparked the Holy Land's current strife when Muslims responded by \nthrowing rocks down on Jews at prayer belowhas no precise 1st \ncentury cognate. Still, the intertwined dynamic of military \noccupation and religious clash is shockingly familiar. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Two thousand years ago, the man in the middle \nof this potentially deadly tug-of-war was the high priest. The \nposition, ritually paramount at the Temple, had been politically \nhobbled by Herod. Nonetheless, as head of the Sanhedrin, a Jewish \nreligious and civic body, and a key participant at city council \nmeetings, the officeholder still had great power and responsibility. \nThe actions of Caiaphas, high priest from A.D. 18 to A.D. 36, are \ntraditionally attributed to rage over Jesus' challenges to his \nclass's power and his personal standing. But historians have begun to \nargue for a more nuanced appreciation. Caiaphas knew better than \nanyone that the doomed Jewish revolts inevitably started at the \nTemple, frequently during Passover, as keyed-up pilgrims celebrated \nIsrael's liberation from an earlier oppressor. He knew Pilate as a \nruler, says Richard Horsley of the University of Massachusetts, \nBoston, who \"shot first and asked questions later.\" Personal pride \nnotwithstanding, the high priest had reason to act against a Jew who \nhad disrupted the Temple and may have been plotting another grand \nentrance on the second day of the feast. To Caiaphas, says\u0014\nLee Levine, professor of Jewish history at Jerusalem's Hebrew \nUniversity, \"Jesus and others like him were just a bad idea. Bad for \nthe Temple, bad for the Romans and bad for the Jews.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rome reserved crucifixion primarily for capital \ncrimes and discontinued the practice in the 4th century. Historians \nlearned considerably more about its specifics in 1968, when the \nremains of a man crucified in his mid 30s were discovered north of \nJerusalem with a 7-in. iron nail still embedded\u0014\nin the heel. The state of the bones indicated that the condemned \nman's arms were outstretched and that his feet had been placed \nsideways, with the nail driven first through a small block of wood \nand then through both heels into the cross. Later the wood block \nwould prevent the feet from coming free as the wound ripped and \nenlarged. Contrary to most representations, the knees were bent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The path of the Via Dolorosa, the Stations of \nthe Cross, through the Old City of Jerusalem is almost certainly \ninaccurate. It follows a 14th century grid of the city rather than a \n1st century plan, and probably reflects the desire of 14th century \nmerchants along the way to get pilgrims' business. But the hill of \nGolgotha (a.k.a. Calvary) and Jesus' burial cave, both located by \ntradition in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher, are a \ndifferent matter. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Jesus' day executions and burials took place \noutside the city. Today the church is tucked within the Old City's \nChristian Quarter, but at the time, the area would have been safely \noutside town walls.  The niche-style grave is consistent with 1st \ncentury custom. Written attestations to its authenticityand that of \nthe Calvary rock a few yards awaydate back more than 1,800 years.\u0014\nTellingly, early rulers who might have been tempted to \"adjust\" the \nsite's location did not do so.  Says Dan Bahat, for many years \nJerusalem's district archaeologist: \"There's nothing to prove that \nthis is not the site of the Crucifixion.\" If this sounds weak to a \nbeliever, coming from an archaeologist, it carries significant \nweight. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When the unnamed disciple remarked on the size \nof the Temple stones, Jesus replied that \"not one stone will be left \nupon another; all will be thrown down.\" He was right. After one last \nrebellion, in A.D. 135, the Romans leveled Jerusalem, leaving only \nthe bald platform behind. The city, of course,\u0014\nrose again and fell again, was conquered and reconquered . . . \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Yousef Abu Ghannam's family holds the key (and \nthe souvenir concession) for the Mosque of the Ascension on the Mount \nof Olives; it was a Christian shrine until Saladin took Jerusalem \nback from the Crusaders. Abu Ghannam reports sadly that business is \ndown. \"We used to get 700 to 800\u0014\npeople a day,\" he says. \"Now we're lucky to get 150. People are \nafraid.\" The few visitors who brave Jerusalem today encounter a \nmetropolis again edgy and turbulent. In the sanctuary of the city's \nchurches, mosques and synagogues, pilgrims can find momentary \ntranquillity. But the streets bear new pocks from the bullets that \nflew here late last year. Herod's ancient platform had been closed\u0014\nsince last fall to all but Islamic worshippers to avoid further \nconfrontation: Sharon's directive last week to reopen it to \nnon-Muslims may make it a flashpoint again. Travel in the area is the \nriskiest in a decade, and a U.S. State Department warning against it \nremains in effect. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the Ascension Mosque there is at least one \noptimist, albeit with a long view. The Rev. Frank Booke of Anniston, \nAla., has led his tour group to the small off-white domed tower. On \nits floor is an indentation that pilgrims have thought for centuries \nis the imprint made by Jesus' right foot as he ascended to heaven. \nBooke is an ebullient Pentecostal Christian in an orange Stetson. \nConsistent with his faith, he takes solace in Christ's expected \nreturn to earth and his re-establishment of God's kingdom here, \nregardless of humankind's errors. Like many, Booke believes his \nSaviour will arrive at precisely the point from which he left. \"This \nis the place,\" he says. His flock responds with an explosive\u0014\n\"Hallelujah!\" and a rendition of The Old Rugged Cross. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Booke will not simply leave it at that. His \njoy over the eschatological future does not render him blind to the \nscandalous present. \"We love the Jewish people,\" he says, then \nglances at the Muslim gatekeepers and adds, \"These are all God's \npeople. When everybody else is afraid, we come to\u0014\nsupport this land. To support the souvenir sellers. We pray for this \nland. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With reporting by Andrea Dorfman and Jonathan \nCalt Harris/New York and Said Ghazali, Eric  Silver and Haim \nWatzman/Jerusalem\u0014",

Three come to mind. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Luke records, Jesus spent an entire night in \nprayer before\u0014\n                      choosing the inner core of twelve disciples. \nYet if you read the\u0014\n                      Gospels, you marvel that this dodgy dozen could \nbe the answer\u0014\n                      to any prayer. They included, Luke pointedly \nnotes, \"Judas\u0014\n                      Iscariot, who became a traitor,\" not to mention \nthe pettily\u0014\n                      ambitious Sons of Thunder and the hothead \nSimon, whom\u0014\n                      Jesus would once address as \"Satan.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"O unbelieving generation,\" Jesus would sigh \nabout these\u0014\n                      twelve, \"how long shall I stay with you? How \nlong shall I put up\u0014\n                      with you?\" I wonder if, in that moment of \nexasperation, Jesus\u0014\n                      questioned the Father's guidance. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Technically, I admit, the particular makeup of \nthe twelve does\u0014\n                      not qualify as an unanswered prayer, for we \nhave no reason to\u0014\n                      believe that any other choices might have \nserved Jesus better.\u0014\n                      Yet I find it comforting that while on earth \nJesus faced the same\u0014\n                      limitations as does anyone in leadership. The \nSon of God\u0014\n                      himself could only work with the talent pool \navailable. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Eventually, except for Judas, the twelve \nunderwent a slow but\u0014\n                      steady transformation, providing a kind of \nlong-term answer.\u0014\n                      John, a Son of Thunder, softened into \"the \napostle of Love.\"\u0014\n                      Peter, who earned Jesus' rebuke by recoiling \nfrom the idea of\u0014\n                      Messiah's suffering, later urged his followers \nto \"follow in his\u0014\n                      steps\" by suffering as Christ did. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The second \"unanswered prayer\" occurred in the \nGarden of\u0014\n                      Gethsemane when, as Luther put it, \"God \nstruggled with God.\"\u0014\n                      While Jesus lay prostrate on the ground, sweat \nfalling from him\u0014\n                      like drops of blood, his prayers took on an \nuncharacteristic\u0014\n                      tone of pleading. He \"offered up prayers and \npetitions with loud\u0014\n                      cries and tears to the one who could save him \nfrom death,\" the\u0014\n                      Letter to the Hebrews says, but of course Jesus \nknew he would\u0014\n                      not be saved from death. As that awareness \ngrew, Jesus felt\u0014\n                      distress. He had no community of supportthey \nhad all fallen\u0014\n                      asleep. \"Could you not keep watch for one \nhour?\" he chided. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A dramatic change takes place, however, between \nthat scene\u0014\n                      in the garden and what follows. The Gospel \naccounts of\u0014\n                      Gethsemane show a person in anguish. Afterward \nthey show\u0014\n                      one who, more than Pilate, more than Herod, \nacts in utter\u0014\n                      control. At his trials Jesus is no victim; he \nis serene, the master\u0014\n                      of his destiny. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      What happened in the garden? What made the \ndifference? We\u0014\n                      have few details about the content of Jesus' \nprayers, since\u0014\n                      potential witnesses were all dozing. He may \nhave reviewed his\u0014\n                      entire ministry on earth. The weight of all \nthat went undone may\u0014\n                      have borne down upon him: his disciples were \nunstable,\u0014\n                      irresponsible; the movement seemed in peril; \nGod's chosen\u0014\n                      people had rejected him; the world still \nharbored evil and much\u0014\n                      suffering. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus himself seemed at the very edge of human \nendurance.\u0014\n                      He no more relished the idea of pain and death \nthan you or I\u0014\n                      do. \"Everything is possible for you,\" Jesus \npleaded to the\u0014\n                      Father. \"Take this cup from me.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Somehow, though, in Gethsemane Jesus worked \nthrough that\u0014\n                      crisis by transferring the burden to the \nFather. It was God's will\u0014\n                      he had come to do, after all, and his plea \nresolved into these\u0014\n                      words: \"Yet not what I will, but what you \nwill.\" Not many hours\u0014\n                      later he could cry out, in profound summation, \n\"It is finished.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hebrews mysteriously concludes that, though \nJesus was not\u0014\n                      saved from death, nevertheless \"he was heard \nbecause of his\u0014\n                      reverent submission. Although he was a son, he \nlearned\u0014\n                      obedience from what he suffered.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      How many times have I prayed for one thing only \nto receive\u0014\n                      another? I long for the sense of detachment, of \ntrust, that I see\u0014\n                      in Gethsemane. God and God alone is qualified \nto answer my\u0014\n                      prayers, even if it means transmuting them from \nmy own\u0014\n                      self-protective will into God's perfect will. \nWhen Jesus prayed to\u0014\n                      the one who could save him from death, he did \nnot get that\u0014\n                      salvation; he got instead the salvation of the \nworld. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The third unanswered prayer appears in an \nintimate scene\u0014\n                      recorded by John, Jesus' last supper with his \ndisciples. Jesus\u0014\n                      expands the scope of his prayer far beyond the \nwalls of the\u0014\n                      Upper Room, to encompass even those of us who \nlive today: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           My prayer is not for them [the disciples] \nalone. I\u0014\n                           pray also for those who will believe in me \nthrough\u0014\n                           their message, that all of them may be one,\u0014\n                           Father, just as you are in me and I am in \nyou. May\u0014\n                           they also be in us so that the world may \nbelieve\u0014\n                           that you have sent me. I have given them \nthe glory\u0014\n                           that you gave me, that they may be one as \nwe are\u0014\n                           one: I in them and you in me. May they be \nbrought\u0014\n                           to complete unity to let the world know \nthat you\u0014\n                           sent me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Disunity virtually defines the history of the \nchurch.

    "words": "John Wesley SERMON 30    [text of the 1872 edition]\u0014\n\u0014\n                       UPON OUR LORD'S SERMON ON THE MOUNT\u0014\n\u0014\n                                        Discourse 10\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, \nye shall be judged; and with what measure ye\u0014\nmete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the \nmote that is in thy brother's eye, but\u0014\nconsiderest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou \nsay to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out\u0014\nof thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou \nhypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;\u0014\nand then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy \nbrother's eye. \"Give not that which is holy unto the\u0014\ndogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample \nthem under their feet, and turn again and rend you.\u0014\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and \nit shall be opened unto you. For everyone that\u0014\nasketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that \nknocketh, it shall be opened. Or what man is there\u0014\nof you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone? Or if he \nask a fish, will give him a serpent? If ye, then, being\u0014\nevil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more \nshall your Father which is in heaven give good\u0014\ngifts to them that ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would \nthat men should do to you, do ye even so to\u0014\nthem; for this is the law and the prophets.\" Matt. 7:1-12. \u0014\n\u0014\n1. Our blessed Lord, having now finished his main design, having \nfirst delivered the sum of true religion, carefully\u0014\nguarded against those glosses of men whereby they would make the Word \nof God of none effect; and having, next,\u0014\nlaid down rules touching that right intention which we are to \npreserve in all our outward actions, now proceeds to\u0014\npoint out the main hindrances of this religion, and concludes all \nwith a suitable application. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. In the fifth chapter, our great Teacher has fully described inward \nreligion in its various branches. He has there laid\u0014\nbefore us those dispositions of soul which constitute real \nChristianity; the tempers contained in that \"holiness,\u0014\nwithout which no man shall see the Lord;\" the affections which, when \nflowing from their proper fountain, from a living\u0014\nfaith in God through Christ Jesus, are intrinsically and essentially \ngood, and acceptable to God. In the sixth he hath\u0014\nshown how all our actions likewise, even those that are indifferent \nin their own nature, may be made holy, and good,\u0014\nand acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done \nwithout this he declares is of no value with\u0014\nGod: Whereas, whatever outward works are thus consecrated to God are, \nin his sight, of great price. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. In the former part of this chapter, he points out the most common \nand most fatal hindrances of this holiness: In the\u0014\nlatter, he exhorts us by various motives, to break through all, and \nsecure that prize of our high calling. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. The first hindrance he cautions us against is judging. \"Judge not, \nthat ye be not judged.\" Judge not others, that ye\u0014\nbe not judged of the Lord, that ye bring not vengeance on your own \nheads. \"For with what judgment ye judge, ye\u0014\nshall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured \nto you again:\" -- A plain and equitable rule,\u0014\nwhereby God permits you to determine for yourselves in what manner he \nshall deal with you in the judgment of the\u0014\ngreat day. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. There is no station of life, nor any period of time, from the hour \nof our first repenting and believing the gospel till\u0014\nwe are made perfect in love, wherein this caution is not needful for \nevery child of God. For occasions of judging can\u0014\nnever be wanting. And the temptations to it are innumerable; many \nwhereof are so artfully disguised that we fall into\u0014\nthe sin before we suspect any danger. And unspeakable are the \nmischiefs produced hereby, -- always to him that\u0014\njudges another, thus wounding his own soul, and exposing himself to \nthe righteous judgment of God; -- and\u0014\nfrequently to those who are judged, whose hands hang down, who are \nweakened and hindered in their course, if not\u0014\nwholly turned out of the way, and caused to turn back even to \nperdition. Yea, how often when this \"root of bitterness\u0014\nsprings up,\" are \"many defiled thereby;\" by reason whereof the way of \ntruth itself is evil spoken of, and that worthy\u0014\nname blasphemed whereby we are called! \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Yet it does not appear that our Lord designed this caution only, \nor chiefly, for the children of God; but rather for\u0014\nthe children of the world, for the men who know not God. These cannot \nbut hear of those who are not of the world;\u0014\nwho follow after the religion above described; who endeavour to be \nhumble, serious, gentle, merciful, and pure in\u0014\nheart; who earnestly desire such measures of these holy tempers as \nthey have not yet attained, and wait for them in\u0014\ndoing all good to all men, and patiently suffering evil. Whoever go \nbut thus far cannot be hid, no more than \"a city\u0014\nset upon a hill.\" And why do not those who 'see\" their \"good works \nglorify their Father which is in heaven?\" What\u0014\nexcuse have they for not treading in their steps? -- for not \nimitating their example and being followers of them, as\u0014\nthey are also of Christ? Why, in order to provide an excuse for \nthemselves, they condemn those whom they ought to\u0014\nimitate. They spend their time in finding out their neighbour's \nfaults, instead of amending their own. They are so\u0014\nbusied about others going out of the way, that themselves never come \ninto it at all; at least, never get forward, never\u0014\ngo beyond a poor dead form of godliness without the power. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. It is to these more especially that our Lord says, \"Why beholdest \nthou the mote that is in thy brother's eye;\" -- the\u0014\ninfirmities, the mistakes, the imprudence, the weakness of the \nchildren of God; -- \"but considerest not the beam that\u0014\nis in thine own eye?\" Thou considerest not the damnable impenitence, \nthe satanic pride, the accursed self-will, the\u0014\nidolatrous love of the world, which are in thyself, and which make \nthy whole life an abomination to the Lord. Above\u0014\nall, with what supine carelessness and indifference art thou dancing \nover the mouth of hell! And \"how then,\" with\u0014\nwhat grace, with what decency or modesty, \"wilt thou say to thy \nbrother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;\" --\u0014\nthe excess of zeal for God, the extreme of self-denial, the too great \ndisengagement from worldly cares and\u0014\nemployments, the desire to be day and night in prayer, or hearing the \nwords of eternal life? -- \"And behold a beam is\u0014\nin thine own eye!\" Not a mote, like one of these. \"Thou hypocrite!\" \nwho pretendest to care for others, and hast no\u0014\ncare for thy own soul; who makest a show of zeal for the cause of \nGod, when in truth thou neither lovest nor fearest\u0014\nhim! \"First cast out the beam out of thine own eye:\" Cast out the \nbeam of impenitence! Know thyself! See and feel\u0014\nthyself a sinner! Feel that thy inward parts are very wickedness, \nthat thou art altogether corrupt and abominable,\u0014\nand that the wrath of God abideth on thee! Cast out the beam of \npride; abhor thyself; sink down as in dust and\u0014\nashes; be more and more little, and mean, and base, and vile in thine \nown eyes! Cast out the beam of self-will!\u0014\nLearn what that meaneth, \"If any man will come after me, let him \nrenounce himself.\" Deny thyself, and take up thy\u0014\ncross daily. Let thy whole soul cry out, \"I came down from heaven,\" \n-- for so thou didst, thou never-dying spirit,\u0014\nwhether thou knowest it or no, -- \"not to do my own will, but the \nwill of him that sent me.\" Cast out the beam of love of\u0014\nthe world! Love not the world, neither the things of the world. Be \nthou crucified unto the world, and the world\u0014\ncrucified unto thee. Only use the world, but enjoy God. Seek all thy \nhappiness in him! Above all, cast out the grand\u0014\nbeam, that supine carelessness and indifference! Deeply consider, \nthat \"one thing is needful;\" the one thing which\u0014\nthou hast scarce ever thought of. Know and feel, that thou art a \npoor, vile, guilty worm, quivering over the great gulf!\u0014\nWhat art thou? A sinner born to die; a leaf driven before the wind; a \nvapour ready to vanish away, just appearing,\u0014\nand then scattered into air, to be no more seen! See this! \"And then \nshalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out\u0014\nof thy brother's eye.\" Then, if thou hast leisure from the concerns \nof thy own soul, thou shalt know how to correct thy\u0014\nbrother also. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. But what is properly the meaning of this word, \"Judge not?\" What \nis the judging which is here forbidden? It is not\u0014\nthe same as evil-speaking, although it is frequently joined \ntherewith. Evil-speaking is the relating anything that is evil\u0014\nconcerning an absent person; whereas judging may indifferently refer \neither to the absent or the present. Neither\u0014\ndoes it necessarily imply the speaking at all, but only the thinking \nevil of another. Not that all kind of thinking evil of\u0014\nothers is that judging which our Lord condemns. If I see one commit \nrobbery or murder, or hear him blaspheme the\u0014\nname of God, I cannot refrain from thinking ill of the robber or \nmurderer. Yet this is not evil judging: There is no sin\u0014\nin this, nor anything contrary to tender affection. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. The thinking of another in a manner that is contrary to love is \nthat judging which is here condemned; and this\u0014\nmaybe of various kinds. For, First, we may think another to blame \nwhen he is not. We may lay to his charge (at least\u0014\nin our own mind) the things of which he is not guilty; the words \nwhich he has never spoke, or the actions which he\u0014\nhas never done. Or we may think his manner of acting was wrong, \nalthough in reality it was not. And even where\u0014\nnothing can justly be blamed, either in the thing itself or in the \nmanner of doing it, we may suppose his intention was\u0014\nnot good, and so condemn him on that ground, at the same time that he \nwho searches the heart sees his simplicity\u0014\nand godly sincerity. \u0014\n\u0014\n10. But we may not only fall into the sin of judging by condemning \nthe innocent; but also, Secondly, by condemning\u0014\nthe guilty to a higher degree than he deserves. This species of \njudging is likewise an offence against justice as well\u0014\nas mercy; and yet such an offence as nothing can secure us from but \nthe strongest and tenderest affection. Without\u0014\nthis we readily suppose one who is acknowledged to be in fault to be \nmore in fault than he really is. We undervalue\u0014\nwhatever good is found in him. Nay, we are not easily induced to \nbelieve that anything good can remain in him in\u0014\nwhom we have found anything that is evil. \u0014\n\u0014\n11. All this shows a manifest want of that love which _ou logizetai \nkakon,_ -- thinketh no evil; which never draws an\u0014\nunjust or unkind conclusion from any premises whatsoever. Love will \nnot infer from a person's falling once into an\u0014\nact of open sin that he is accustomed so to do, that he is habitually \nguilty of it: And if he was habitually guilty once,\u0014\nlove does not conclude he is so still, much less, that if he is now \nguilty of this, therefore he is guilty of other sins also.\u0014\nThese evil reasonings all pertain to that sinful judging which our \nLord here guards us against; and which we are in\u0014\nthe highest degree concerned to avoid, if we love either God or our \nown souls. \u0014\n\u0014\n12. But supposing we do not condemn the innocent, neither the guilty \nany farther than they deserve; still we may not\u0014\nbe altogether clear of the snare: For there is a Third sort of sinful \njudging, which is the condemning any person at all\u0014\nwhere there is not sufficient evidence. And be the facts we suppose \never so true; yet that does not acquit us. For\u0014\nthey ought not to have been supposed, but proved; and till they were, \nwe ought to have formed no judgment; -- I\u0014\nsay, till they were; for neither are we excused; although the facts \nadmit of ever so strong proof, unless that proof be\u0014\nproduced before we pass sentence, and compared with the evidence on \nthe other side. Nor can we be excused if\u0014\never we pass a full sentence before the accused has spoken for \nhimself. Even a Jew might teach us this, as a mere\u0014\nlesson of justice abstracted from mercy and brotherly love. \"Doth our \nlaw,\" says Nicodemus, \"judge any man before\u0014\nit hear him, and know what he doeth?\" (John 7:51.) Yea, a Heathen \ncould reply, when the chief of the Jewish nation\u0014\ndesired to have judgment against his prisoner, \"It is not the manner \nof the Romans\" to judge \"any man, before he\u0014\nthat is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to \nanswer for himself concerning the crime laid\u0014\nagainst him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n13. Indeed we could not easily fall into sinful judging were we only \nto observe that rule which another [Seneca] of\u0014\nthose heathen Romans affirms to have been the measure of his own \npractice. \"I am so far,\" says he, \"from lightly\u0014\nbelieving every man's or any man's evidence against another, that I \ndo not easily or immediately believe a man's\u0014\nevidence against himself. I always allow him second I thoughts, and \nmany times counsel too.\" Go, thou who art called\u0014\na Christian, and do likewise, lest the heathen rise and condemn thee \nin that day! \u0014\n\u0014\n14. But how rarely should we condemn or judge one another, at least \nhow soon would that evil be remedied, were\u0014\nwe to walk by that clear and express rule which our Lord himself has \ntaught us! -- \"If thy brother shall trespass\u0014\nagainst thee,\" or if thou hear or believe that he hath, \"go and tell \nhim of his fault, between him and thee alone.\" This\u0014\nis the first step thou art to take. \"But if he will not hear, take \nwith thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or\u0014\nthree witnesses every word may be established.\" This is the second \nstep. \"If he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the\u0014\nchurch,\" either to the overseers thereof, or to the whole \ncongregation. Thou hast then done thy part. Then think of it\u0014\nno more, but commend the whole to God. \u0014\n\u0014\n15. But supposing thou hast by the grace of God \"cast the beam out of \nthine own eye,\" and dost now \"clearly see\u0014\nthe mote or the beam which is in thy brother's eye,\" yet beware thou \ndost not receive hurt thyself by endeavouring to\u0014\nhelp him. Still \"give not that which is holy unto dogs.\" Do not \nlightly account any to be of this number; but if it\u0014\nevidently appear that they deserve the title, then \"cast ye not your \npearls before swine.\" Beware of that zeal which is\u0014\nnot according to knowledge. For this is another great hindrance in \ntheir way who would be \"perfect as their heavenly\u0014\nFather is perfect.\" They who desire this cannot but desire that all \nmankind should partake of the common blessing.\u0014\nAnd when we ourselves first partake of the heavenly gift, the divine \n\"evidence of things not seen,\" we wonder that all\u0014\nmankind do not see the things which we see so plainly; and make no \ndoubt at all but we shall open the eyes of all we\u0014\nhave any intercourse with. Hence we are for attacking all we meet \nwithout delay, and constraining them to see,\u0014\nwhether they will or no. And by the ill success of this intemperate \nzeal, we often suffer in our own souls. To prevent\u0014\nthis spending our strength in vain our Lord adds this needful caution \n(needful to all, but more especially to those\u0014\nwho are now warm in their first love,) \"Give not that which is holy \nunto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before\u0014\nswine; lest they trample them under foot, and turn again and rend \nyou.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n16. \"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.\" Beware of thinking \nthat any deserve this appellation till there is full\u0014\nand incontestable proof, such as you can no longer resist. But when \nit is clearly and indisputably proved that they\u0014\nare unholy and wicked men, not only strangers to, but enemies to God, \nto all righteousness and true holiness; \"give\u0014\nnot that which is holy,\" _to hagion,_ -- \"the holy thing,\" \nemphatically so called, unto these. The holy, the peculiar\u0014\ndoctrines of the gospel -- such as were \"hid from the ages and \ngenerations\" of old, and are now made known to us\u0014\nonly by the revelation of Jesus Christ and the inspiration of his \nHoly Spirit -- are not to be prostituted unto these\u0014\nmen, who know not if there be any Holy Ghost. Not indeed that the \nambassadors of Christ can refrain from declaring\u0014\nthem in the great congregation, wherein some of these may probably \nbe; we must speak, whether men will hear or\u0014\nwhether they will forbear; but this is not the case with private \nChristians. They do not bear that awful character; nor\u0014\nare they under any manner of obligation to force these great and \nglorious truths on them who contradict and\u0014\nblaspheme, who have a rooted enmity against them. Nay, they ought not \nso to do, but rather to lead them as they\u0014\nare able to bear. Do not begin a discourse with these upon remission \nof sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost; but talk\u0014\nwith them in their own manner, and upon their own principles. With \nthe rational, honourable, and unjust Epicure,\u0014\nreason of \"righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.\" This is \nthe most probable way to make Felix tremble.\u0014\nReserve higher subjects for men of higher attainments. \u0014\n\u0014\n17. \"Neither cast ye your pearls before swine.\" Be very unwilling to \npass this judgment on any man. But if the fact be\u0014\nplain and undeniable, if it is clear beyond all dispute, if the swine \ndo not endeavour to disguise themselves, but\u0014\nrather glory in their shame, making no pretence to purity either of \nheart or life, but working all uncleanness with\u0014\ngreediness; then \"cast\" not ye your pearls before them. Talk not to \nthem of the mysteries of the kingdom; of the\u0014\nthings which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; which of consequence, \nas they have no other inlets of knowledge, no\u0014\nspiritual senses, it cannot enter into their hearts to conceive. Tell \nnot them of the \"exceeding great and precious\u0014\npromises\" which God hath given us in the Son of his love. What \nconception can they have of being made partakers\u0014\nof the divine nature, who do not even desire to escape the corruption \nthat is in the world through lust? Just as much\u0014\nknowledge as swine have of pearls, and as much relish as they have \nfor them, so much relish have they for the\u0014\ndeep things of God, so much knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel, \nwho are immersed in the mire of this world,\u0014\nin worldly pleasures, desires, and cares. O cast not those pearls \nbefore these, \"lest they trample them under their\u0014\nfeet!\" -- lest they utterly despise what they cannot understand, and \nspeak evil of the things which they know not.\u0014\nNay, it is probable this would not be the only inconvenience which \nwould follow. It would not be strange if they were,\u0014\naccording to their nature, to \"turn again, and rend you;\" if they \nwere to return you evil for good, cursing for blessing,\u0014\nand hatred for your goodwill. Such is the enmity of the carnal mind \nagainst God and all the things of God. Such is\u0014\nthe treatment you are to expect from these, if you offer them the \nunpardonable affront of endeavouring to save their\u0014\nsouls from death, to pluck them as brands out of the burning. \u0014\n\u0014\n18. And yet you need not utterly despair even of these, who, for the \npresent, \"turn again and rend you.\" For if all\u0014\nyour arguments and persuasives fail, there is yet another remedy \nleft; and one that is frequently found effectual\u0014\nwhen no other method avails; this is prayer. Therefore whatever you \ndesire or want, either for others or for your own\u0014\nsoul, \"ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; \nknock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" The neglect of\u0014\nthis is a Third grand hindrance of holiness. Still we \"have not, \nbecause we ask not.\" O how meek and gentle, how\u0014\nlowly in heart, how full of love both to God and men, might ye have \nbeen at this day, if you had only asked; -- if you\u0014\nhad continued instant in prayer! Therefore, now, at least, \"ask, and \nit shall be given unto you.\" Ask, that ye may\u0014\nthroughly experience and perfectly practise the whole of that \nreligion which our Lord has here so beautifully\u0014\ndescribed. It shall then be given you, to be holy as he is holy, both \nin heart and in all manner of conversation. Seek,\u0014\nin the way he hath ordained, in searching the Scriptures, in hearing \nhis word, in meditating thereon, in fasting, in\u0014\npartaking of the Supper of the Lord, and surely ye shall find: Ye \nshall find that pearl of great price, that faith which\u0014\novercometh the world, that peace which the world cannot give, that \nlove which is the earnest of your inheritance.\u0014\nKnock; continue in prayer, and in every other way of the Lord: Be not \nweary or faint in your mind. Press on to the\u0014\nmark: Take no denial: Let him not go until he bless you. And the door \nof mercy, of holiness, of heaven shall be\u0014\nopened unto you. \u0014\n\u0014\n19. It is in compassion to the hardness of our hearts, so unready to \nbelieve the goodness of God, that our Lord is\u0014\npleased to enlarge upon this head, and to repeat and confirm what he \nhath spoken. \"For everyone,\" saith he, \"that\u0014\nasketh, receiveth;\" so that none need come short of the blessing; \n\"and he that seeketh,\" even everyone that\u0014\nseeketh, \"findeth\" the love and the image of God; \"and to him that \nknocketh,\" to everyone that knocketh, the gate of\u0014\nrighteousness shall be opened. So that here is no room for any to be \ndiscouraged, as though they might ask or\u0014\nseek or knock in vain. Only remember always to pray, to seek, to \nknock, and not to faint. And then the promise\u0014\nstandeth sure. It is firm as the pillars of heaven; -- yea, more \nfirm; for heaven and earth shall pass away; but his\u0014\nword shall not pass away. \u0014\n\u0014\n20. To cut off every pretence for unbelief, our blessed Lord, in the \nfollowing verses, illustrates yet farther what he\u0014\nhad said, by an appeal to what passes in our own breasts. \"What man,\" \nsaith he, \"is there of you, whom if his son\u0014\nask bread, will give him a stone?\" Will even natural affection permit \nyou to refuse the reasonable request of one you\u0014\nlove? \"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\" Will he give \nhim hurtful instead of profitable things? So that\u0014\neven from what you feel and do yourselves you may receive the fullest \nassurance, as on the one hand that no ill\u0014\neffect can possibly attend your asking, so, on the other, that it \nwill be attended with that good effect, a full supply of\u0014\nall your wants. For \"if ye, being evil, know I how to give good gifts \nunto your children, how much more shall your\u0014\nFather which is in heaven,\" who is pure, unmixed, essential goodness, \n\"give good things to them that ask him!\" or,\u0014\n(as he expresses it on another occasion,) \"give the Holy Ghost to \nthem that ask him?\" In him are included all good\u0014\nthings; all wisdom, peace, joy, love; the whole treasures of holiness \nand happiness; all that God hath prepared for\u0014\nthem that love him. \u0014\n\u0014\n21. But that your prayer may have its full weight with God, see that \nye be in charity with all men; for otherwise it is\u0014\nmore likely to bring a curse than a blessing on your own head; nor \ncan you expect to receive any blessing from God\u0014\nwhile you have not charity towards your neighbour. Therefore, let \nthis hindrance be removed without delay. Confirm\u0014\nyour love towards one another, and towards all men. And love them, \nnot in word only, but in deed and in truth.\u0014\n\"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, \ndo ye even so to them; for this is the law and\u0014\nthe prophets.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n22. This is that royal law, that golden rule of mercy as well as \njustice, which even the heathen Emperor caused to be\u0014\nwritten over the gate of his palace; a rule which many believe to be \nnaturally engraved on the mind of everyone that\u0014\ncomes into the world. And thus much is certain, that it commends \nitself, as soon as heard, to every man's\u0014\nconscience and understanding; insomuch that no man can knowingly \noffend against it without carrying his\u0014\ncondemnation in his own breast. \u0014\n\u0014\n23. \"This is the law and the prophets.\" Whatsoever is written in that \nlaw which God of old revealed to mankind, and\u0014\nwhatsoever precepts God has given by his holy Prophets which have \nbeen since the world began,\" they are all\u0014\nsummed up in these few words, they are all contained in this short \ndirection. And this, rightly understood, comprises\u0014\nthe whole of that religion which our Lord came to establish upon \nearth. \u0014\n\u0014\n24. It may be understood either in a positive or negative sense. If \nunderstood in a negative sense, the meaning is,\u0014\n\"Whatever ye would not that men should do to you, do not ye unto \nthem.\" Here is a plain rule, always ready at hand,\u0014\nalways easy to be applied. In all cases relating to your neighbour, \nmake his case your own. Suppose the\u0014\ncircumstances to be changed, and yourself to be just as he is now. \nAnd then beware that you indulge no temper or\u0014\nthought, that no word pass out of your lips, that you take no step \nwhich you should have condemned in him, upon\u0014\nsuch a change of circumstances. If understood in a direct and \npositive sense, the plain meaning of it is, \"Whatsoever\u0014\nyou could reasonably desire of him, supposing yourself to be in his \ncircumstances, that do, to the uttermost of your\u0014\npower, to every child of man.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n25. To apply this in one or two obvious instances. It is clear to \nevery man's own conscience, we would not that others\u0014\nshould judge us, should causelessly or lightly think evil of us; much \nless would we that any should speak evil of us, --\u0014\nshould publish our real faults or infirmities. Apply this to \nyourself. Do not unto another what you would not he should\u0014\ndo unto you; and you will never more judge your neighbour, never \ncauselessly or lightly think evil of anyone; much\u0014\nless will you speak evil; you will never mention even the real fault \nof an absent person, unless so far as you are\u0014\nconvinced it is absolutely needful for the good of other souls. \u0014\n\u0014\n26. Again: We would that all men should love and esteem us, and \nbehave towards us according to justice, mercy,\u0014\nand truth. And we may reasonably desire that they should do us all \nthe good they can do without injuring\u0014\nthemselves; yea, that in outward things (according to the known \nrule,) their superfluities should give way to our\u0014\nconveniencies, their conveniencies to our necessities, and their \nnecessities to our extremities. Now then, let us walk\u0014\nby the same rule: Let us do unto all as we would they should do to \nus. Let us love and honour all men. Let justice,\u0014\nmercy, and truth govern all our minds and actions. Let our \nsuperfluities give way to our neighbour's conveniencies;\u0014\n(and who then will have any superfluities left?) our conveniencies to \nour neighbour's necessities; our necessities to\u0014\nhis extremities. \u0014\n\u0014\n27. This is pure and genuine morality. This do, and thou shalt live. \n\"As many as walk by this rule, peace be to them,\u0014\nand mercy;\" for they are \"the Israel of God.\" But then be it \nobserved, none can walk by this rule (nor ever did from\u0014\nthe beginning of the world,) none can love his neighbour as himself, \nunless he first love God. And none can love\u0014\nGod unless he believe in Christ; unless he have redemption through \nhis blood, and the Spirit of God bearing witness\u0014\nwith his spirit that he is a child of God. Faith, therefore, is still \nthe root of all, of present as well as future salvation.\u0014\nStill we must say to every sinner, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, \nand thou shalt be saved.\" Thou shalt be saved\u0014\nnow, that thou mayst be saved for ever; saved on earth, that thou \nmayst be saved in heaven. Believe in him, and thy\u0014\nfaith will work by love. Thou wilt love the Lord thy God because he \nhath loved thee: Thou wilt love thy neighbour as\u0014\nthyself: And then it will be thy glory and joy, to exert and increase \nthis love; not barely by abstaining from what is\u0014\ncontrary thereto, from every unkind thought, word, and action, but by \nshowing all that kindness to every man which\u0014\nthou wouldst he should show unto thee. \u0014\n\u0014\n[Edited by Dekek and Beryl Johnson (semi-retired Methodist pastor and \nwife in Meadpark, UK,) with corrections by\u0014\nGeorge Lyons for the Wesley Center for Applied Theology of Northwest \nNazarene College (Nampa, ID.)]\u0014",

    "words": "JERRY FALWELL AND THE PROPER \nCHRISTIAN RESPONSE\u0014\n\n                                                                       \nTO OUR TRAGEDY\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy David R. Currie\u0014\nAs a Christian minister, I was appalled to read that television \nevangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, two of the most \nprominent voices of the religious right, said liberal civil \nliberties' groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights \nsupporters bear partial responsibility for Tuesday's ter- rorist \nattacks because their actions have turned God's anger against America.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America \nto give us probably what we deserve,\" said Falwell, appearing on \nRobertson's Christian Broadcasting Network's \"700 Club.\"\u0014\nIncredible Insensitivity\u0014\nThese statements are shocking in their insensitivity to those who \nhave tragically lost fathers, mothers, sons, daughters and friends \nand to an entire nation dealing with grief, fear and anger. None of \nthese indi- viduals and families deserved to have this happen to them.\u0014\n\u0014\nFalwell and Robertson are equally shocking because they show such a \nhorrible understanding of the God we christians worship and the \nChristian ministers  role.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians worship the God of creation, life, love, compassion and \nsacrifice. God revealed his character when he became flesh in the \nperson of Jesus Christ. Our God did not desire a single person to be \nkilled in this horrible act of violence that occurred last Tuesday. \nActs of terror, such as we have witnessed are the result of the \nsinful free will of human beings, of hate that is not of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan God prevent such acts? Yes, he can when persons considering such \nacts listen to their inner spirit. He can when people acknowledge \nGod's active work to change us into loving, caring individuals. \nNever- theless, God does not override free will. Our freedom as \npersons is part of our being created in the image of God. Evil is the \nresult of our human sinfulness and selfish- ness, something each of \nus battles daily, including those of us who profess to be Christians. \nWe are all capable of horrible things. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe terrible tragedy experienced Tuesday (9/11/01) has nothing to do \nwith God removing his hand of protection from America. God has never \nprotected America any more than any other country or people. To claim \nsuch a protection is arrogant and misguided. God loves all persons \nand countries equally and wants a personal relationship with every \nperson.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica is not now, and has never been, a Christian nation in any \nformal or legal way, nor should it be. We are a secular nation, as \nall nations should be, with many Christians. We are a free republic \nthat allows total religious liberty for persons of all faiths or no \nfaith. Because of religious freedom, Christianity has flourished here \nand we now see an outpouring of faith by millions. This is wonderful \nand it is happening because of religious liberty .\u0014\n\u0014\nTo understand the significance of our religious freedom, look at \nAfghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is being protected, a country \nwithout religious liberty. It is a Muslim country , and at this very \nmoment, two recent female graduates of Baylor Uni- versity are on \ntrial for preaching Christian- ity. The joining of church and state \nleads to religious fanaticism and a confusion of the work of God with \nthe work of a nation. This is always dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\nBad Medicine\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertson's and Falwell's prescription for healing America is a \nformula to destroy America, by joining church and state and using \ngovernment for the propagation and enforcement of the Christian \nfaith. This sys- tem, a failure wherever itis practiced, leads \npersons to equate God and Country as the same, and therefore breeds \nreligious na- tionalism and fanaticism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis tragedy always highlights the importance of Interfaith efforts \nboth nationally and locally. We must get to know each other. We must \nlearn to understand each others faith. I do not apologize for \nbelieving in Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the full \nrevelation of God, but that does not mean I cannot respect and value \npersons of other faiths. The Rev. Billy Graham showed us again Friday \nhow to do this, participating in an Interfaith service at the \nWashington Cathedral. Falwell also shows a terrible understanding of \nsin. All nations are sinful because all persons are sinful. America \nis a sinful nation because we are sinful people. I am a proud \nAmerican, but we have stood for things that are not good. Sometimes \nour laws have not been jIJst. Our history is not pure, i.e., slavery \nis just one example. Are we so much more sinful people than we have \nbeen in the past? I do not think so. We have had to grow as a people, \nand we are still growing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe live in a dangerous world. God does not choose whom to protect and \nwhom to allow to experience tragedy. I have friends who have lost \nsons and daughters in tragic car accidents. My own son survived a \nhor- rible accident. God does not love my son or me more than my \nfriends or their chil- dren. Such thinking would be as sick as that \ndisplayed by Falwell and Robertson. God's desire is a personal \nrelationship with every person and a world of peace and love. He \nshares life with every person who will allow him to do so. He does \nnot choose favorite persons or nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, Falwell' s response to this national tragedy at a time when \nChristian ministers should be offering words of hope and heal- ing, \nis spreading hate. At a time when christian ministers should be \noffering words of prayer and petition, he is spreading prejudice \nagainst his particular list of sinners. At a time when Christian \nministers should be offering words of courage and compassion, he is \nspreading contempt.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Christian Response\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians in America are citizens of two Kingdoms, the United States \nof America and the Kingdom of God. Our highest alle- giance is to \nGod. We should be good patriots, yet, we should never give our \nultimate allegiance to anyone or anything other than God. As \nChristians, we believe our ulti- mate security is in our faith in a \nliving God. Our nation has an obligation to defend itself and protect \nthe safety of our citizens. I support a war on terrorism, when it is \ncarried out with justice as its guiding principle and peace as its \ngoal. As Chris- tians, we never seek retaliation, but peace. We never \nseek revenge, but justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days ahead, God will be available to every person who seeks \nhim. He will give guidance to all who ask. God will share the journey \nof all who fear and grieve. He will love everyone involved in the \nconflict on all sides. He will be working to guide leaders to wise \ndecisions for peace and justice. He will be hard at work through his \nSpirit and through his followers working for peace and sharing his \nlove with all who will respond and follow.\u0014",

(Osama bin Laden \nthinks much the same.) After an outpouring of criticism Falwell \napologized, sort of, and said his remarks were \"stupid\" and  \n\"indefensible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Yet now his ministry has sent out a fund-raising \nappeal by Falwell's son citing a \"vicious smear campaign to \ndiscredit\" the Reverend. \"Liberals of all stripes, especially in the \nmedia, have seized on this opportunity to trash dad's deeply held \nChristian beliefs and to literally attack him day and night . . . .It \nseems that Satan has launched a hail of fiery darts at dad recently. \nHe needs to know you still support him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Okay. Coupla points.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  First, no one we know of has trashed Falwell's \n\"deeply held Christian beliefs.\" We have not seen anyone castigating \nChristianity as a consequence of what he said. It is Falwell's \nfecklessness, not his faith, that has stirred anger.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Second, who are those liberals of all stripes, \nespecially in the media? Let's see. Among them are . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -That raving left-wing magazine, National Review, \nwhich inducted Falwell into its Hall of Shame for the remarks it \ncalled \"presumptuous\" and \"idiotic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -That godless atheistic columnist, Cal Thomas, who \nwrote: God has far more to say in Scripture about inattention to the \npoor, lying, gossip, and even divorce (which He says He \"hates\"). Why \nwouldn't any, or all,  of these sins make God at least as fed-up?\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -Washington Times editorial page editor Helle \nBering, who found it \"distressing\" that Falwell would \"jump on the \n'blame-America-first bandwagon'\" and \"deplorable\" that he blamed whom \nhe did.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  -Us.\u0014\n\u0014\n                  Now, if Falwell himself finds his comments stupid \nand indefensible, then just how vicious a smear campaign can it be \nfor others to agree? If criticism of his comments amounts to darts \nfrom Satan, then is the good Reverend among those drawing back the \nbow? Surely not. Yet perhaps it would be best if he and those around \nhim let the matter die, before he once again gets shot in the foot - \nor so shoots himself.\u0014",

A few miles\u0014\n                      further, down among the suburban office towers, \nis a tiny old white\u0014\n                      clapboard church. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I stepped inside the cool interior, which was \ndimly lit and covered on walls\u0014\n                      and ceiling with paintings of Christ and the \nApostles, of biblical figures and\u0014\n                      heroes from long ago. I took a seat to wait for \nmy spiritual father and\u0014\n                      looked around. I saw faces of men and women who \nhad known suffering,\u0014\n                      much more severe than what I had ever \nexperienced, even as rocked as I\u0014\n                      felt just then. They stood serene around the \nwalls, many holding symbols\u0014\n                      of victory.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Father George Calciu came out from beside the \naltar and greeted me. He\u0014\n                      is a small, resilient man, unusually vigorous \nfor his 76 years. His hair and\u0014\n                      beard are thick and white, and his face is \npermanently creased with the\u0014\n                      marks of indomitable good cheer. Cheerfulness \nis an unlikely attribute,\u0014\n                      given his story. In his native Romania Fr. \nGeorge challenged the\u0014\n                      communist authorities repeatedly and \nforcefully, with a courage that defied\u0014\n                      self-preservation. He was confined in brutal \nprisons, subjected to\u0014\n                      brainwashing, and formed a lifelong friendship \nwith a fellow prisoner,\u0014\n                      Richard Wurmbrand, author of Tortured for \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Today the first thing he asked me was, \"Why do \nyou think that happened\u0014\n                      yesterday?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I was stumped for a minute. I hadn't thought of \nexactly that question. I\u0014\n                      said, \"I don't know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fr. George said, \"It was the punishment of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Well, there's something I hadn't thought of. \nThough I wondered why I\u0014\n                      hadn't; I've just finished an intensive study \nof the fall of Jerusalem in A.D.\u0014\n                      70, and knew that the Jews have always seen \neven that brutal and\u0014\n                      sacrilegious tragedy as divine retribution for \ntheir sins. In fact, that seems\u0014\n                      to be the Old Testament pattern; anytime Israel \nsuffered a military defeat,\u0014\n                      they responded with repentance. It didn't \nreplace other strategic\u0014\n                      responses, but was an indispensable companion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This isn't just an Old Testament phenomenon. \nWhen people told Jesus\u0014\n                      that Pilate had killed worshippers at the \nTemple, he responded, \"Unless\u0014\n                      you repent, you will all likewise perish\" (Luke \n13:3). There seems to be a\u0014\n                      biblical pattern here: national suffering \nshould bring about repentance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I have often wondered what might return our \nsick culture to health. I've\u0014\n                      sometimes felt overwhelmed at the ugliness of \nAmerica's spiritual\u0014\n                      condition, at 40 million children killed by \nabortion, at the promotion\u0014\n                      world-wide of sexual promiscuity and \nmaterialism, the contempt of God,\u0014\n                      the spreading infection of American culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I've often wondered what might turn us around. \nEverything moves in\u0014\n                      cycles, and some sick cultures do return to \nhealth; it can happen in a\u0014\n                      generation. But I have never heard of a \nhistorical example that wasn't\u0014\n                      inaugurated by catastrophe. Healing is the \nfruit of repentance, and\u0014\n                      repentance comes in the wake of suffering. \nThere aren't many examples of\u0014\n                      spontaneous remission from this sort of illness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fr. George told me that the night before he had \nopened his Bible and it\u0014\n                      had fallen to Psalm 127. He read me the first \nverse: \"Unless the Lord\u0014\n                      builds the house, those who build it labor in \nvain. Unless the Lord watches\u0014\n                      over the city, the watchman stays awake in \nvain.\" How, he asked me,\u0014\n                      could the hijackers have overcome such a high \nlevel of security unless the\u0014\n                      Lord somehow permitted it?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He then turned to Daniel 9:12-14.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           He has confirmed his words, which he spoke \nagainst us and\u0014\n                           against our rulers who ruled us, by \nbringing upon us a great\u0014\n                           calamity; for under the whole heaven there \nhas not been\u0014\n                           done the like of what has been done \nagainst Jerusalem. As\u0014\n                           it is written in the law of Moses, all \nthis calamity has come\u0014\n                           upon us, yet we have not entreated the \nfavor of the Lord our\u0014\n                           God, turning from our iniquities and \ngiving heed to thy truth.\u0014\n                           Therefore the Lord has kept ready the \ncalamity and has\u0014\n                           brought it upon us; for the Lord our God \nis righteousness in\u0014\n                           all the works which he has done, and we \nhave not obeyed\u0014\n                           his voice. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Fr. George went on to say that the concepts of \nrepentance and humility\u0014\n                      are mostly absent in America, and it doesn't \nseem likely that we'll\u0014\n                      understand the lesson. When he first came to \nthe U.S. he would\u0014\n                      sometimes speak of the sins he committed in \nprison, and people would\u0014\n                      say, \"How could you commit sins? You were in \nprison.\" He smiled at this.\u0014\n                      \"Of course you still sin,\" he said. \"You sin in \nyour thoughts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But Americans, he says, are very proud, and are \nused to being powerful,\u0014\n                      and the concepts of repentance and humility are \nnot commonly expressed\u0014\n                      even among conservative Christians. Over the \nyears I have come to see\u0014\n                      how these concepts are the very core of the \nGospels; they were Jesus'\u0014\n                      most consistent message.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But we tend to skip over them in our rush to \nreassure ourselves that God\u0014\n                      loves us. He does, of course, but you don't \nreally know how much he loves\u0014\n                      you until you dare to repent. Until you see how \nmuch God had to forgive in\u0014\n                      you, you can't really see the height of his \nlove. Not many churches where\u0014\n                      that is preached today, conservative or liberal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Thus it won't do much good for us to spray on \nsome superficial piety, while\u0014\n                      not taking it to deep, self-challenging levels. \nFr. George said that he was\u0014\n                      very moved when he saw the Congressmen singing \n\"God Bless America.\"\u0014\n                      Then he began to think, in how many of their \nvotes and actions do these\u0014\n                      same men and women work to cast away the \nblessing of God?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The thought occurred to me that what the song \ncould really mean is,\u0014\n                      \"God, bless the things we already do; bless the \nthings we have decided to\u0014\n                      do.\" A friend of mine says the local strip club \nhas changed its sign to read\u0014\n                      \"God Bless America,\" which just about sums up \nthe problem.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This gave me a lot to think about. For years \nI've been thinking that the\u0014\n                      main thing America needed to do is to be humble \nand repent. Here comes\u0014\n                      a blow that looks a lot like things God has \ndone in the past to kindle that\u0014\n                      response, the kind of suffering that had Israel \nweeping in sackcloth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But no one, including Christians, is likely to \ndraw such conclusions.\u0014\n                      Instead, we'll focus on how much we have been \nwronged, and smite our\u0014\n                      adversaries by our own considerable earthly \npower, and feel satisfied at\u0014\n                      videotape of young Arab men frying to death in \nJeeps. If Fr. George is\u0014\n                      right, if \"repent\" is indeed God's message, I'm \nafraid we'll need more than\u0014\n                      one lesson to get it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday International/Christianity  \u0014\n                           Today magazine.\u0014",

    "words": "Jesus Calls the Common Man\u0014\n\u0014\nIn may 1855, an eighteen-year-old boy went to the deacons of the \nchurch in\u0014\nBoston. He had been raised in a Unitarian church, in almost total \nignorance\u0014\nof the gospel, but when he had moved to Boston to make his fortune, \nhe began\u0014\nto attend a Bible-preaching church. Then, in April of 1855, his Sunday\u0014\nschool teacher had come into the store where he was working and \nsimply and\u0014\npersuasively shared the Gospel and urged the young man to trust in \nthe Lord\u0014\nJesus. He did, and now he was applying to join the church. One fact \nquickly\u0014\nbecame obvious. This young man was almost totally ignorant of biblical\u0014\ntruth. One of the deacons asked him, \"Son, what has Christ done for us\u0014\nall--for you----which entitles him to our love? His response was, \"I \ndon't\u0014\nknow. I think Christ has done a great deal for us, but I don't think \nof\u0014\nanything in particular that I know of.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHardly and impressive start. Years later his Sunday school teacher \nsaid of\u0014\nhim: \"I can truly say that I have seen few persons whose minds were\u0014\nspiritually darker than was his when he  came into my Sunday school \nclass. I\u0014\nthink the committee of the church seldom met an applicant for \nmembership who\u0014\nseemed more unlikely ever to become a Christian of clear and decided \nviews\u0014\nof gospel truth, still less to fill any space of public or extended\u0014\nusefulness.\" Nothing happened very quickly to change their minds. The\u0014\ndeacons decided to put him on a year-long instruction program to \nteach him\u0014\nbasic Christian truths. Perhaps they wanted to work on some of his \nother\u0014\nrough spots as well. Not only was he ignorant of spiritual truths, he \nwas\u0014\nonly barely literate, and his spoken grammar was atrocious. The \nyear-long\u0014\nprobation did not help very much. At his second interview, there was \nonly a\u0014\nminimal improvement in the quality of his answers, but since it was \nobvious\u0014\nthat he was a sincere and committed (if ignorant) Christian, they \naccepted\u0014\nhim as a church member.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next years, many people looked at that young man and were \nconvinced\u0014\nthat God would never use a person like that. And in doing so they \nwrote off\u0014\nDwight L. Moody. But God did not. By God's infinite grace and \npersevering\u0014\nlove, Moody was transformed into one of the most effective servants \nof God\u0014\nin church history, a man whose impact is still with us today.\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Inrig, Hearts of Iron, Feet of Clay.\u0014",

    "words": "John Bunyan, a Baptist pastor in Bedford, England, was imprisoned for \nnothing more than simply preaching the gospel as he believed it and \npracticed it. A largely uneducated man, he was apparently very good \nat what he did, and the Royalists didn't like that because it didn't \nmatch the official church's ideas. For twelve years he remained \nthere.  He had four children.  His wife needed his help.  He had a \nchild with a major health issue, but he couldn't be there to lend a \nhand. Most of us would have bathed ourselves in self-pity and said, \n\"If only I were out of this jail, I could do something worthwhile and \ndo my job.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan, however, took a different view.  Instead of constantly \nfeeling, If only I could get out of here, he said, In spite of my \ncondition and my pain, I will make the most of a bad situation, and \nhe used his time to write Pilgrim's Progress, the greatest book ever \nwritten in the English language. It reflected his own spiritual \njourney and still today one is of the most widely read books in the \nworld.\u0014",

When the show's \nco-host Lee Webb asked you, \"If they have\u0014\nsuch contempt for our foreign policy, why'd they even want to live \nhere?,\" you offered a simple explanation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, as missionaries,\" you said, \"probably to spread the doctrine \nof Islam.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEarth to Pat: Could it be that most Muslim immigrants do seek a \nbetter life for themselves and their families?\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have taken issue with our esteemed president in regard to his \nstand in saying Islam is a peaceful religion,\" you said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's just not. And the Koran makes it very clear, if you see an \ninfidel, you are to kill him. That's what it says. Now that doesn't \nsound very peaceful to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhoa, you knocked me for a loop with that one. Where, I wondered, was \nyour source for that little nugget? In two later CNN appearances, you \nanswered my question. \"The Encyclopedia Britannica,\" you said, and \ninvited your doubters to look it up. I did. And you know what? You \nwere right--partly. Under \"jihad,\" the Britannica's online edition \noffers \"a religious duty imposed on Muslims to spread Islam by waging \nwar.\" But a few sentences later it elaborates, \"Modern Islam places \nspecial emphasis on waging war with one's inner self. It sanctions \nwar with other nations only as a defensive measure when the faith is \nin danger.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, that coincides with the \"religion of peace\" that most of the \nMuslims I have known, including Muslim clerics and a couple of my own \ncousins, say they are worshipping.\u0014\n\u0014\nI also looked up \"holy war,\" the translation of jihad, and the online \nBritannica led me to an abundance of examples of Christians who also \nhave used scripture taken out of the Book of Joshua and other Old \nTestament contexts, to justify their own jihads, particularly against \nMuslims and Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't need to tell you the bloody, sorry history of Christian \njihads, Pat. They happened in the Crusades and in the Spanish \nInquisition and countless other pogroms that today's Christians might \nrather forget.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn CNN you praised Bush for the master diplomatic stroke of charging \nthat Osama bin Laden had \"hijacked Islam.\" But then you said, \"When \nyou get right down to it, Osama bin Laden is probably truer to \n[Prophet] Muhammad\" than those to whom Bush is reaching out.\u0014\n\u0014\nOh? Who is to say who is \"truer to Muhammad?\" Certainly not us \nChristians. Today's Islamic world is divided enough within itself \nover such thorny issues as whose vision is \"truer to Muhammad.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one side, the backward-looking Islamic radicals follow bin Laden \nand his ilk, trying to stop the clock of world progress and wage war \nagainst the West. On the other side, forward-looking modernists want \nto emulate the political, economic, scientific and cultural progress \nthat the West has made, while much of the Islamic world has been \nstalled for centuries by internal strife.\u0014\n\u0014\nPat, you are absolutely right to say that Americans need to know \ntheir enemy. But as Bush has proclaimed repeatedly, the enemy is not \nIslam. It is terrorism. If we pick fights with our friends, the \nterrorists will win.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeace,\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS VS A GENERIC GOD",
    "words": "Jesus vs. Generic God \u0014\nSurrounded by \"In God We Trust,\" how specific should Christians get?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Will Willimon\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after September 11, a preacher told me about seeing a couple \ninterviewed on TV. In great grief, they had just lost their beloved \nadult daughter on that terrible Tuesday. The reporter, perhaps trying \nto find a way to wrap up the conversation, said, \"Well, er, I guess \nyou'll be going to your place of worship this weekend to receive some \nconsolation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother replied, \"No. You see, our religion teaches that we ought \nto forgive our enemies. And we are just not ready for that right now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNow there was a woman who knew something of the perils of worshiping \na God whose name is Trinity, who has come to us as a Jew from \nNazareth named Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen lecturing on preaching to fellow pastors, I have sometimes told \nthem, \"Some of your homiletical failures are not your fault. Many of \nyour failed sermons are due to Jesus. You have some tough material \nwith which to work!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn debates on campus, in order to put a point on this issue of divine \nparticularity, I have said, \"Christians don't believe in 'god.' We \nbelieve that Jesus Christ is God.\" That affirmation makes usin a \nworld of generic, fuzzy contemporary godspeculiar.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the September 11 disaster, I heard a professor of Islamic \nstudies say on TV, \"Well, after all, Christians and Muslims both \nworship the same God.\" In a divided America, there are understandable \npolitical reasons for hoping that were the case. However, I've read a \nfair amount of the Qur'an, and I find vast amounts of material there \nthat would not fit into the mouth of Jesus under any circumstances, \nno matter how much we need to get along with Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Muhammad is not thought to be the only begotten Son of God \n(an idea abhorrent to Islam). But he is believed to be a perfect \nrevelation of the true God.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad was a righteous warrior. Jesus died without defending \nhimself, died forgiving his enemies (us). Between these two \ndefinitions of \"God\" there is a great gulf that cannot be bridged by \nwell-intentioned attempts to jettison all of those troubling \npeculiarities that make Muhammad almost nothing like Jesus. To do so \nwould be unfair to Islam, to say nothing of what it would do to \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreaching a particular God\u0014\n\u0014\nWe preachers cannot get around the central Christian claim that, when \nwe look at the life and teachings of this Jew from Nazareth who was \nborn of a woman, lived briefly, died violently, and rose \nunexpectedly, we have seen much of God as we ever hope to see.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe current age is a particular challenge for preaching a particular \nGod who is manifest to us in Jesus the Christ. For some time now, we \nhave been in the mire of something called \"spirituality,\" which in my \nexperience tends to be decidedly anti-traditionalist, \nanti-institutional, amorphous, vague and therefore undemanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpirituality is what I feel when I feel better than I did before I \nfelt it. It is a big, accommodating basket into which I can put \nalmost anything I want to feel about the \"higher power,\" or \n\"spiritual force,\" or \"my own little voice,\" or whatever I call \nwhatever it is that makes me feel better.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust for now, I'm trying to discipline myself, whenever I hear \nsomeone around here say \"spirituality,\" to think \"idolatry.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trouble is, Jesus is demanding. He is not infinitely pliable. \nTrue, there is a great deal that we do not know about Jesus, a great \ndeal left unsaid by the Gospels. But there is also a great deal that \nwe do know that is undeniable, unavoidable, and troubling to our \nsettled arrangements with the present order.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago I heard theologian John Howard Yoder say that you can judge \na theology by how often it talks about \"God,\" or even \"Christ,\" and \nhow seldom it mentions Jesus. The Second Person of the Trinity is the \nethical stuff of our faith, the unmalleable, resistant fact that \ngives God a face, a name, an undeniable contour, an unavoidable claim \nupon us.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreachers are to preach that name, that contour, that claim, trusting \nthe Holy Spirit to change our hearers, rather than attempting, by our \nhomiletical skills, to make the Trinity more comprehensible to our \nhearers by scaling it down to \"God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nG.K. Chesterton once said something to the effect that it may be \npossible to have a good debate over whether or not Jesus believed in \nfairies. That could be a rather interesting argument. However, said \nChesterton, there is no point to a debate over whether or not Jesus \nbelieved that rich people were in big trouble. There is just too much \nevidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a world of nebulous spirituality and undemanding deity, we \npreachers must take care. We so desperately want a hearing, we so \nwish to be comforting, we so much would like to be helpful in \nbringing a frighteningly divided culture together, that we may be \ntempted to jettison the particular God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob \nin favor of a more generic one of our own making.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a generic God culture, we may be tempted to describe the faith as \nbroad, universal, and unrestrictive. So we may preach an amorphous \n\"love\" without giving it the cruciform shape that makes Christian \nlove possibleand so demanding. Or we may preach \"compassion,\" \n\"possibility thinking,\" \"self-fulfillment,\" or whatever vague virtues \nthat culture may be in the market for at the moment.\u0014\nWe must trust Jesus enough to create the hearing that he deserves. \nOur job is to keep our preaching tied to its proper objectnot the \nwishes and fears of the congregationbut rather the God who seeks and \nsaves in the person of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny preacher knows that the power of a good story is in the concrete \nparticularities. It is no good to offer an illustration that begins, \n\"A man, or it could have been a woman, a young or an old person, was \nwalking along a road, or perhaps a path, or even a superhighway, when \nall at once, this human being came upon a .\" The power of a story \nlies in the particularity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho where he \nfell among thieves who beat him, stripped him, and left him half \ndead.\" That's the way Jesus talks. In talking that way, with all of \nthe concrete specifics, we are not only presented with a realistic \nstory, but we are put in a real place, with real names.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news is thus allowed to take root among us, to be enacted \nwhere we live. The Incarnation is one of the main reasons why Jesus' \nprimary and most distinctive mode of communication appears to have \nbeen the parable.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur challenge, as communicators of the gospel, is not that God was in \nJesus but that God was in Jesus, reconciling the world to himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe cannot make this faith mean anything we want. There is mystery, \nroom for wonder, doubt, disagreement. But there are also these nasty \nparticularities that make the gospel unavoidably abrasive, \ndiscordant, and so very interesting.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't hide the peculiarities\u0014\n\u0014\nRather than attempt to smooth out the rough places between us and the \ngood news of Jesus Christ, we preachers (perhaps especially in the \npresent moment) ought to accentuate the peculiarities, highlight the \ndistance been our ways and God's way, a distance that is not bridged \nby simply smoothing down the rough edges until we can't tell the \ndifference between the incarnate Son of God and (in Flannery \nO'Connor's phrase) \"our own sweet concoction.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, this means the discipline of sticking as closely as I can to \nthe stuff of the biblical text. Rather than reading a text, \nattempting to distill from the text some grand abstract generality \n(\"God is love,\" or \"All the world's people are family\") and preaching \nthat, I want to marvel at the strange, unaccommodating, surprising \npeculiarity of the text.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dare not render the peculiar less peculiar, but rather, our task is \nto enable the congregation to enjoy how very odd, and therefore how \nwonderfully engaging, is salvation as embodied in Jesus.\u0014\nFor instance, in just the past few weeks, in studying the Scripture \nin preparation for preaching, I have been delightfully surprised:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tthat when Jesus pronounces his Beatitudes in Matthew 5, he doesn't \ntell anybody to do anything. He never says, \"Go out and be \npeacemakers,\" which is what I might have preached. He rather says \n\"God blesses peacemakers.\" It's not in the imperative (which we \nMother-I'd-rather-do-it-myself Americans love) but in the indicative.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tthat Jeremiah told suffering Israel, when they were in exile, that \nthey were in exile because of their sin and infidelity. They had \nnobody to blame for their suffering but themselves. I thought \npreachers were supposed to be compassionate! What kind of compassion \nalso deals in truth telling? As a pastor, I usually associate \ncompassion with my efforts to protect people from the truth!\u0014\n\u0014\n\tthat when God Almighty chose to win back the world, to reveal \nhimself in all of his glory, God did so as a Near Eastern male. Why \ndid God choose that part of the world rather than New York?\u0014\nSermons are interesting that have something interesting to say. A \ngeneric, one-size-fits-all, fuzzy deity is not worth the effort. What \nis fascinating is to be stuck with a Savior who, upon meeting an \nupwardly mobile young man one day, looks upon him and, having \"loved \nhim,\" tells him to go, sell everything he has, give it to the poor \nand \"follow me.\" Now that sort of story gives some interesting \nsubstance to the word \"love.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain I say, the great, invigorating challenge for us preachers is \nnot that Jesus was God, but that God was Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational,/Leadership journal.\u0014",

    "words": "Jesus Christ: Saviour \nand Lord\u0014\n                                             (Carlisle: Paternoster \nPress, 1997)\u0014\n                              \u0014\nFor the fourth volume in his comprehensive theological series, \nChristian Foundations, Donald G. Bloesch, Professor of Theology \nEmeritus of Dubuque Theological Seminary, turns to a study of the \nperson and work of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a brief survey of some of the key issues in contemporary \ndiscussion, he clearly indicates the nature of his approach to this \nmuch disputed area of theology by declaring that we \"cannot fully \nappreciate the significance of the cross and resurrection of Jesus \nChrist as well as his incarnation apart from a keen perception of the \nplight of humanity corrupted by sin.\" In his typical style, he first \nsurveys a range of views on the subject (both Christian and \notherwise) and then gives a clear although not extended statement of \nthe biblical position; he takes care to include personal, corporate \nand social aspects of sin.. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis initial chapter opens the way for a discussion of the \nincarnation, with summaries of early and later Christological \nperspectives and heresies; the author includes a helpful \ninvestigation of the different emphases found amongst Catholic, \nLutheran and Reformed churches. In re-affirming orthodox Chalcedonian \nChristology, Bloesch warns that \"the heresies of the church all have \ntheir source in the often well-meaning attempt to rationalize or \nresolve the christological paradox\" thus giving rise to either \ndocetic or ebionitic views, both of which are unsatisfactory. He \nseeks to overcome this problem by beginning neither with \"an abstract \nconcept of God or Christ removed from history nor with the historical \nman Jesus\" but with the \"paradox of God himself entering world \nhistory at a particular place and\u0014\ntime, in a particular historical figure - Jesus of Nazareth\" or in \nother words, \"the unique, incomparable\" and personal, ontological \nunion of divinity and humanity in Jesus Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nBloesch devotes a lengthy chapter to the Virgin Birth. He discusses \nthe doctrine from various angles showing its historical and \ntheological foundations, removing obstacles to its belief and warning \nagainst holding it for invalid reasons (including the idea that it \nproves the deity of Christ or that it was the only possible mechanism \nfor the incarnation). Thus, not wanting to claim too much for this \ndoctrine or too little, he affirms that it is \"an ineradicable sign \nthat God's great gift to humanity is entirely by grace.\" Although he \nholds that it is not a belief that is necessary for salvation, he \nbelieves it is \"necessary to maintain the integrity and consistency \nof the witness of the church\" and it \"serves to safeguard the faith \nagainst any heresy that separates or obscures the two natures of \nChrist.\" Even if it is not a core belief like the gospel itself, the \nkernel of the faith, it is \"a sign that serves to communicate the \nmystery.\"\u0014\nThe chapter concludes with a full appendix on the \"role of Mary\", in \nwhich the author seeks to \"reclaim Mary for the wider church.\" \nagainst the development of mariological doctrines; he asserts that \nfrom an evangelical perspective Mary is to be understood \nChristologically and given honour as \"the handmaid of the Lord and \ntherefore as a model of holiness\" according to the biblical witness. \u0014\n\u0014\nBloesch's Christological discussion does not include traditional \nsections proving the deity and humanity of Christ, but it does \ncontain a short chapter on the pre-existence of Christ, which the \nauthor acknowledges in his introduction as a point of some \nsignificance for him. After outlining various alternatives from the \nhistory of theology, he takes a minority option which affirms belief \nin the \"preexistent humanity of Jesus Christ.\" In adopting this \nposition, he again follows Karl Barth, to whom he is indebted for \nmany insights (although not uncritically). Bloesch does not believe \nthat the \"man\u0014\nJesus preexisted in heaven as a separate being\" but, basing his views \non a profound theology and in coordination with his fundamental \nincarnational approach to Christology, he thinks in terms of \n\"individuality, embodiment, vulnerability and dependency.\" These are \nall are implied in \"true deity\" and have important consequences for \nand give strength to the notion of incarnation understood in the \northodox sense of the assumption of human flesh by the second person \nof the Trinity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe second half of the book is devoted to chapters on the atonement, \nsalvation, and the law and gospel. For Bloesch the \"incarnation sets \nthe stage for the atonement, though the work of redemption already \nbegins in the decision of Christ to incarnate himself in human \nflesh.\" While Bloesch covers familiar material in these chapters, his \nown distinctive perspective linking both objective (atonement) and \nsubjective (faith) aspects is clear; it is therefore possible for him \nto integrate thoroughly theology with spirituality, discipleship and \nethics, and also to appreciate elements of otherwise rival theories \nof the atonement, salvation and sanctification. He is thus able to \nshow a more catholic spirit than many other evangelical theologians, \nadvocating the need to \"draw upon the insights of the fathers of the \nearly church as well as the doctors of the medieval church\", and at \nthe same time to \"give serious attention to the enduring witness of \nthe Protestant Reformation.\" Yet he is fully aware of the necessity \nof restating \"the ancient faith in the language of the present day \nand [to] relate that faith to the pivotal issues in modern philosophy \nand culture\", thus warning conservatives against the danger of simply \nreturning naively to older positions. \u0014\n\u0014\nBloesch illustrates this approach to dealing with traditional \ndoctrines in a new context with his treatment in the closing chapters \non the lordship and the finality of Christ. He speaks of a \n\"progressive lordship whereby the victory of Christ is carried \nforward into history through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit\" which \nallows for both the final victory of Christ and a \"christocracy\" of \nword and prayer. Strongly counteracting \"power theology\", he points \nout that \"As Christians we cannot bring in the kingdom but we can \nwitness to it . . . We can announce the coming of the kingdom and \ncall people to be ready for Christ's kingdom. We cannot build the \nkingdom, but we can serve the kingdom with the aid of the Spirit.\" \nThis is a perspective which places a heavy emphasis upon the church's \nmission and its engagement in the world, but avoids the pitfalls of \nconsidering these topics exclusively in terms of doctrine, \necclesiology or the history of religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout this lucidly written volume, the author touches on a wide \nrange of issues, both contemporary and historical, effectively \nshowing their key elements and responding in terms of his own \ndistinctive theological insights and methods. Although the book does \nnot provide as much detail as some readers might expect, it is a \nvaluable statement of a senior evangelical theologian's understanding \nof some of the most important and controverted aspects of Christian \ntruth today.\u0014",

    "title": "JERRY VINES ATTACKS ISLAM",
    "words": "Baptist Pastor Attacks Islam, Inciting Cries of Intolerance\u0014\nBy SUSAN SACHS, New York Times  6/15/02\u0014\n\u0014\nA prominent Southern Baptist pastor caused protests this week with a \nspeech condemning American religious pluralism and calling the \nprophet of Islam, Muhammad, a pedophile.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritics said the remarks by the Rev. Jerry Vines, pastor of First \nBaptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla., and a past president of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention, illustrated how hate speech against \nMuslims had become a staple of conservative Christian political \ndiscourse. The speech also briefly united Muslim and Jewish groups in \noutrage over what they called the Baptists' intolerance of other \nreligions.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Vines called Muhammad a \"demon-possessed pedophile,\" asserting \nthat his 12th and final wife was a 9-year-old girl, and declared that \nMuslims worshiped a different God than Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpeaking to fellow pastors on Monday at the Baptists' annual \nconvention in St. Louis, Mr. Vines said pluralism wrongly equated all \nreligions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Allah is not Jehovah,\" The Associated Press quoted him as saying. \n\"Jehovah's not going to turn you into a terrorist that will try to \nbomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOpen scorn for Islam has become a staple ingredient in the speeches \nof conservative Christian leaders since the Sept. 11 terrorist \nattacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Web sites of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Christian \nBroadcasting Network, run by Pat Robertson, have articles that \npurport to explain Islam. Mr. Robertson, in his television speeches, \nhas called Islam a religion that seeks to control, dominate or \"if \nneed be, destroy\" others. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, with an estimated 16 million members \nand an active political lobby, has long provoked public protests with \nits views condemning homosexuality and its open proselytizing of Jews \nand members of other religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the attack on Islam by one of its best-known pastors could have \nwider political repercussions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It matters a great deal, because it's the largest Protestant \ndenomination in the United States, and one that is particularly \npoliticized these days,\" said John C. Green, the director of the Ray \nBliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany in the evangelical Christian community truly believe that Islam \nis wrong, Mr. Green said. They have been uncomfortable with the Bush \nadministration's efforts since Sept. 11 to emphasize that the United \nStates does not consider Islam an enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Evangelicals, including the Southern Baptists, have been very strong \nsupporters of President Bush and he has tried hard to appeal to \nthem,\" Mr. Green said. \"But at the same time, Bush has tried hard in \nhis foreign policy to maintain good relationships with moderate \nMuslim countries.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist leaders defended Mr. Vines, saying his statements \nwere based on his research into Islam, although many Muslims have \nsaid that his views are inaccurate. \u0014\n\u0014\nBarrett Duke, vice president for research for the Southern Baptist \nConvention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said the \ncomments reflected Mr. Vines's personal convictions. \u0014\n\u0014\nPresident Bush spoke by satellite to this week's Southern Baptist \nmeeting, praising the group as the \"earliest champions of religious \ntolerance and freedom.\" There was no indication in his remarks that \nhe was aware of what Mr. Vines had said about Islam the evening \nbefore.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, civil rights groups have called on Mr. Bush to distance \nhimself publicly from Mr. Vines's comments.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He should not embrace leaders whose message is based on sowing \nintolerance,\" said Ralph G. Neas, president of People for the \nAmerican Way, a liberal lobby in Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\nCriticism of Mr. Vines's statements also came from the \nAnti-Defamation League, which has urged religious tolerance but has \nalso refused to work on civil rights issues with national Arab- and \nMuslim-American organizations because of disagreements over the \nconflict between Israel and Palestinians.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The reason we don't stand with the organizations is that they are \nhypocrites on terrorism,\" said Abraham H. Foxman, the national \ndirector of the league.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalam al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Political Affairs Council \nin Los Angeles, said he was gratified in any case for some Jewish \nsupport in protesting Mr. Vines's statement on pluralism. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There has been a pattern of escalating hate speech toward Muslims, \nwith people saying that Islam is an evil religion,\" Mr. Marayati \nsaid. \"We have demanded that the administration repudiate those \ncomments.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMuslim groups have also argued that actions by the Bush \nadministration, especially those singling out Muslim \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nfor investigation and detention, have encouraged public hostility \ntoward Islam.\u0014",

    "title": "JUDGMENT DAY IS COMING",
    "words": "The late great Bishop Ken Goodson of Virginia was considered a staunch\u0014\nconservative. He had a very liberal Methodist lady in his conference \nnamed\u0014\nTess Hoover. One day Tess said to him, \"Bishop, you're so \nconservative that\u0014\nyou probably believe in the devil.\" \"Yes I do,\" he said, \"and I don't \nlike\u0014\nher at all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe text this morning says that one daywe do not know whenbut it \nasserts\u0014\nthat one day the ages of earth will end. There will be a final \njudgment when\u0014\nGod separates those whom he calls wheat and those whom he calls \nweeds. The\u0014\none will be brought into the kingdom of their Father and the other \nwill be\u0014\nthrown into the fiery furnace. Now you might ask me, \"Preacher, do you\u0014\nreally believe that there will be an end of the ages and a final day \nof\u0014\nreckoning?\" I could give you a lot of educated answers about the \nmeaning of\u0014\nJesus' parables, and \"End Times\" theology called eschatology. But let \nme let\u0014\nme answer you directly. Yes I do. I believe that a judgment day is \ncoming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a final Judgment Day followed by an eternal heaven or \nhell seems\u0014\nalien to this permissive culture. Ours is a \"three strikes and you're \nout\"\u0014\nculture, and if you whine a bit, we will give you four or five \nstrikes. We\u0014\neven curve the grades on the Scholastic Aptitude Test so that the \noutcome\u0014\nwill look better. Many schools have many valedictorians rather than \none\u0014\nbecause we don't like to have winners and losers. In such a society, \nit\u0014\nsounds strange to hear about a final Judgment Day and eternal \npunishment and\u0014\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus told two simple parables or stories to illustrate the truth \nabout\u0014\nJudgment Day. These stories were designed to be familiar to people who\u0014\ndepended on agriculture and commercial fishing for a living. A farmer\u0014\nplanted good wheat seed in a field. But under cover of night, an \nenemy came\u0014\nin and planted weeds. At first no one noticed. There was a common \nweed in\u0014\nPalestine called bearded darnel, which was a common curse of farmers. \nIn its\u0014\nearly stages it looked just like the wheat. But when both had \"headed \nout\"\u0014\nor produced seeds up top, the two could be distinguished by color. \nThen the\u0014\ndarnel had to be separated from the good grain because its seeds were\u0014\nslightly poisonous. The farm hands came to the owner and asked, \"Do \nyou want\u0014\nus to pull the weeds?\" \"No,\" said the owner. \"If you try, you might \ndamage\u0014\nthe grain in the process. Let the weeds alone. At harvest time we will\u0014\nseparate the two.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second story has to do with fishing. Commercial fisherman on the \nSea of\u0014\nGalilee used a large square-shaped drag-net or seine net. They pulled \nit\u0014\nbehind a boat, trawling. They caught all kinds of fish. Remember, the \nJews\u0014\nwere forbidden to eat anything from the water unless it had fins and \nscales.\u0014\nBy the way, I nominate as the bravest person who ever lived the one \nwho\u0014\nfirst ate an oyster. I can just imagine some cave-woman saying to her\u0014\nhusband, \"Don't you dare put that thing in your mouth!\" But when those\u0014\noysters are steamed and placed along side some coleslaw and hush \npuppies, my\u0014\ngoodness, it's wonderful! When the fisherman of Galilee had been \ntrawling\u0014\nfor a while, he dragged his net to the shore and then began to \nseparate the\u0014\ngood, useful fish from the bad. Similarly, said Jesus, a time is \ncoming when\u0014\na great separation will take place. Judgment Day is coming!\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are four truths declared here about Judgment Day. Let's take a \nlook at\u0014\nthem:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.  First, the enemy is real.\u0014\n2.  Second, God is patient and kind.\u0014\n3.  Third, it is God who judges in the end not us.\u0014\n4.  Fourth, the Judgment Day is coming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Tare, as it is sometimes called, is the bearded darnel, mentioned \nonly\u0014\nin Matt. 13:25-30. It is the Lolium temulentum, a species of rye \ngrass, the\u0014\nseeds of which are a strong soporific poison. It bears a close \nresemblance\u0014\nto wheat till the ear appears, and only then can the difference be \ndiscerned. It grows\u0014\nplentifully in Syria and Palestine.\u0014",

    "words": "The early Methodist meetings were often led by lay preachers with \nvery limited education. On one occasion,such a preacher took as his \ntext Luke 19:21, \"Lord, I feared thee, because thou art an austere \nman.\" Not knowing the word \"austere,\" he thought that the text spoke \nof \"an oyster man.\" He spoke about the work of those who retrieve \noysters from the seabed.

He gropes \nin the dark, cutting his hands on the sharp edges of the shells. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow he has the oyster, and kicks back up to the surface, up to the \nwarmth and light and air, clutching in his torn and bleeding hands \nthe object of his search. So Christ descended from the glory of \nheaven into the squalor of Earth, into sinful human society, in order \nto retrieve humans and bring them back up with him to the glory of \nheaven, his torn and bleeding hands a sign of the value he has placed \non the object of his quest. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwelve people were converted that evening. Afterward, someone \ncomplained to the classically trained, Oxford educated John Wesley \nabout the inappropriateness of allowing preachers who were too \nignorant to know the meaning of the texts they were preaching on, to \npreach. Wesley simply said, \"Never mind, the Lord  got a dozen \noysters tonight.\"\u0014",

Beginning \nabout 1913, certain\u0014\n                      Pentecostal ministers began to ask, \"What is \nthe correct apostolic\u0014\n                      formula for baptizing believers?\" Several \nministers concluded that the\u0014\n                      correct formula, the one used by the apostles \nthemselves, was found\u0014\n                      in Acts 2:38, where Peter proclaims, \"Repent, \nand be baptized, every\u0014\n                      one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the \nforgiveness of your\u0014\n                      sins.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Attentive Bible readers will immediately ask, \n\"But didn't Jesus\u0014\n                      command the disciples to baptize in the name of \nthe Father, Son,\u0014\n                      and Holy Spirit?\" Indeed, that formula is found \nin Matthew 28:19. But\u0014\n                      Oneness Pentecostals have chosen to focus on \nthe Acts 2:38\u0014\n                      formula because, they say, that is the actual \nformula used by the\u0014\n                      apostles. In fact, they are correct in \nobserving that the baptismal\u0014\n                      formula of Matthew 28:19 is never again \nmentioned, while several\u0014\n                      references are made to baptism in the name of \nJesus (see Acts\u0014\n                      10:48, 19:5). The earliest Oneness Pentecostals \nfelt so strongly\u0014\n                      about the baptismal formula that many of them \nchose to be\u0014\n                      rebaptized in the name of Jesus only, which led \nto splits in\u0014\n                      congregations and denominations. The greatest \ndivide among\u0014\n                      Pentecostals today is between orthodox \nPentecostals and Oneness\u0014\n                      Pentecostals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This difference in the matter of words used \nduring baptisms\u0014\n                      represents something far more important: a \ndifferent view of the nature\u0014\n                      of Father, Son, and Holy Spiritwhat orthodox \nChristians refer to as\u0014\n                      the Trinity. If asked if they believe in God \nthe Father, Son, and Spirit,\u0014\n                      all Oneness Pentecostals would answer yes. Like \nall Pentecostals,\u0014\n                      Oneness Pentecostals place great emphasis on \nthe role of the Spirit\u0014\n                      in the Christian life. But to them, the \ntraditional Christian view of the\u0014\n                      Trinity is dangerously close to \ntritheismbelief in three distinct gods.\u0014\n                      Their view is, as one of their authors has put \nit, \"Christian\u0014\n                      monotheism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But orthodox Christian theologians believe \nOneness theology is guilty\u0014\n                      of the heresy of modalism. While orthodox \nChristian theologians often\u0014\n                      refer to the three \"Persons\" in the Trinity, \nOneness authors speak of\u0014\n                      the three \"manifestations\" (or \"offices\") of \nthe one God. They tend to\u0014\n                      connect the term person with the modern \nconception of the\u0014\n                      wordthat is, a person is a distinct \nindividualwhich is why they see\u0014\n                      the orthodox view as being close to tritheism. \nBelieving strongly in\u0014\n                      one undivided God, Oneness authors teach that \nthe whole essential\u0014\n                      Godhead is present in Jesus (an idea supported \nby Colossians 2:9\u0014\n                      and other passages). God, the one divine Being, \nis the Father in the\u0014\n                      Son, and is Spirit through the Son. Fairly \nearly in Christian history\u0014\n                      this belief was condemned as heresy. Mainstream \nChristian theology\u0014\n                      continues to reject modalism because it does \nnot do justice to the\u0014\n                      Bible's view of God as three distinct Persons.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This view of the Trinity is connected with \nOneness Pentecostals'\u0014\n                      Christology. They place much emphasis on the \nname of God. They\u0014\n                      believe that the name of the Lord Jesus is, \nunder the new covenant,\u0014\n                      God's means of self-revelation and salvation. \nThey cite Colossians\u0014\n                      2:9, with Paul's declaration that \"in Christ \nall the fullness of the Deity\u0014\n                      lives in bodily form.\" In their view, \ntraditional Trinitarianism minimizes\u0014\n                      the full revelation of God in Christ. Their aim \nis to elevate the Son to\u0014\n                      his proper place in the Godhead. Consequently, \nJesus is elevated to\u0014\n                      the point that one might as well say, \"God is \nJesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Are these differences in belief enough to \nqualify Oneness\u0014\n                      Pentecostals as a cult or sect? For most \northodox Christians, the\u0014\n                      Oneness movement occupies a kind of cloudy no \nman's land between\u0014\n                      orthodox Christianity and the various groups \nthat, because of their\u0014\n                      beliefs and practices, are decidedly not \northodox (e.g., Mormons,\u0014\n                      Christian Scientists). Unfortunately, it's \nlikely that most Christian\u0014\n                      laypeople, if they were presented with the \northodox view and the\u0014\n                      Oneness churches' view, would either shrug off \nthe differences as\u0014\n                      extremely minor or would not even be able to \ngrasp them. For the\u0014\n                      leading conservative ecumenical groups, \nhowever, the differences are\u0014\n                      not cloudy at all: the National Association of \nEvangelicals,\u0014\n                      Pentecostal World Fellowship, and Pentecostal \nFellowship of North\u0014\n                      America rightly find Oneness Pentecostals too \nfar removed from\u0014\n                      classical orthodoxy to include in their ranks.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      J.

More than a century later, in 1839, \nAmerican composer and music educator Lowell Mason decided to set them \nto music, modestly including the phrase \"From George Frederick \nHandel,\" apparently to honor his idol, the composer of Messiah and \nmany other masterpieces. For nearly 100 years, the world accepted \nthis ascription, until musicologists pointed out that not a single \nphrase in the music can be said to have come straight from any work \nof Handel's.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoy to the world!

    "title": "JESSE JAMES - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Amazon.com\u0014\nProbably no American outlaw has attracted more attention--much of it \nflattering--than Jesse James. This revisionist biography by T.J. \nStiles delves into the exciting life James led--\"a tale of ambushes, \ngun battles, and daring raids, of narrow escapes, betrayals, and \nrevenge.\" Yet it also places James within a specific political \ncontext, showing why it was possible for this murderous bandit to \nemerge as a folk hero among Southern sympathizers following the Civil \nWar (in which he fought as a teenager). James is often grouped with \nfamous frontier criminals like Billy the Kidd and Butch Cassidy, but \nhe's best understood as a Southerner who forged partisan alliances in \npostwar Missouri and promoted himself as a latter-day Robin Hood. \nStiles describes James as \"a foul-mouthed killer who hated as \nfiercely as anyone on the planet\" and places his life in the context \nof \"the struggle for--or rather, against--black freedom.\" Stiles's \nfundamental point about James is as startling as it is convincing: \n\"In his political consciousness and close alliance with a \npropagandist and power broker, in his efforts to win media attention \nwith his crimes ... Jesse James was a forerunner of the modern \nterrorist.\" Tough words, but also deserved. --John J. Miller\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Publishers Weekly\u0014\nIn a lucid reexamination of one of the nation's most notorious \noutlaws, independent historian Stiles argues that Jesse James \n(1847-1882), like his fellow \"bushwhackers,\" had a political agenda \nand that this made him more terrorist than bandit, and more \nsignificant than we credit. \"He was,\" Stiles says, \"a political \npartisan [wh0] eagerly offered himself up as a polarizing symbol of \nthe Confederate project for postwar Missouri.\" By the age of 16, \nJames was engaged in guerilla warfare against Union forces; when the \nwar was over he remained a staunch and outspoken ex-Confederate. His \nletters to friend and newspaper editor John Newman Edwards, in which \nhe described himself as \"the target of unjustified, vindictive \npersecution,\" and exonerative articles published about him after the \nwar, show that James used and was used by the newspapers to further \nMissouri's opposition to Reconstruction. White-supremacist \nbushwhackers targeted Unionists as well as institutions that \nbenefited the Union. Political posturing aside, though, James and his \nilk used the booty to line their own pockets and if James mirrored \nthe bigger picture of a society that pushed him into a life of crime, \nhe also embraced that life without remorse. That said, Stiles's \npainstaking research has produced a compelling book that recreates, \nsometimes graphically, the ruthlessness that prevailed in Missouri, \nwhere neighbor fought neighbor and nobody was safe. He also offers a \ncritical understanding of how deep-seated hatred breeds \nself-righteous fanatics, who can justify violence against anyone \ndeemed an enemy. 16 pages of illus. and six maps.\u0014\nCopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\n\u0014\nThe exploits of the James-Younger gang have become enshrined in our \nnational ore. Even while he was alive and active, James was extolled \nby some as a Robin Hood and condemned by others as a vicious, \ncold-blooded predator. Historian Stiles has written a generally \nbalanced account of James' life while accurately placing him within \nthe context of pre- and post-Civil War Missouri. Extreme political \nand cultural fissures that constantly resulted in violence \ncharacterized that environment, and the violence did not cease when \nthe war ended. James and his family were staunch supporters of the \npro-slavery faction. James, who earned his spurs as a member of a \nbrutal Confederate guerrilla band, seems to have regarded his \npost-Civil War depredations as a continuation of the struggle. Stiles \nconvincingly asserts that his activities were supported covertly (and \nsometimes overtly) by some members of Missouri's more respectable \npolitical establishment.

    "title": "JOHN POLKINGHORNE: SCIENCE AND RELIGION",
    "words": "John Polkinghorne\u0014\nThe 2002 Templeton Prize winner sees the Bible as \"the laboratory \nnotebook\" of the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Dr. John Polkinghorne worked for years as a theoretical \nelementary particle physicist and then a mathematical physics \nprofessor at Cambridge University before resigning to train for \nministry in the Church of England. Earlier this year, he was awarded \nthe 2002 Templeton Prize for progress in religion. He is the author \nof The Faith of the Physicist (1994), Belief in God in an Age of \nScience (1999), and Faith, Science and Understanding (2000).\u0014\n\u0014\nAt what point did science emerge as a passion in your life?\u0014\n\u0014\nI went to Cambridge to study mathematics, and during my undergraduate \ntime I got interested in the fact that you could use mathematics to \nunderstand the physical world. And so when I came to do a Ph.D., I \ndid it in theoretical physics. That led me onto my career in that \narea. I enjoyed doing all that very much, but after 25 years of it I \nfelt I had done my bit for science and I would try and do something \nelse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas there ever a conflict for you between science and faith?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've never felt an either/or situation that I had to choose either my \nscience or my religious belief. Of course, there are puzzles about \nhow the two relate to each other, and I tried to think about those \nduring my science days. And, of course, I've thought a great deal \nmore about them since then. \u0014\n\u0014\nI try to hold the two together as far as I can myself. I want to be, \nso to speak two-eyed: looking through my science eye and my religious \neye at the same time. I'm glad that I'm both a physicist and a priest \nand, though I'm puzzled by how those aspects of me fit together, I \nwant to hold them in dialogue with each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy should a scientist believe that theology has a place at the \nacademic table?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think all scientists are imbued with a thirst for understanding. \nThey want to make sense of the world in which we live. Science helps \nus to a very significant extent to do that. But not every question \nthat we want to ask is a scientific question and, therefore, not \nevery question we want to ask will have a scientific answer. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, scientists are very struck with the beautiful order of \nthe worldthis universe that started as a ball of energy 15 billion \nyears ago now is the home of saints and mathematicians. Science \nexplains some of that process but it doesn't explain where the \nbeautiful laws of nature come from.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does it come about that this physical world that's made up of \nquarks and gluons and electrons is also the arena of moral choice? \nReligion explains that because just as it sees God's mind behind the \nscientifically discerned order of the world, it sees God's will and \npurpose behind our ethical intuitions. So it ties things together for \nme.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou talk a lot about theology as an integrating discipline. A lot of \nscientists recoil at that notion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe integrative part of theology is in setting science within an even \nbroader and more profound setting of understanding. Science is really \ntrying to know the world in an objective way, treating reality as an \n\"it,\" as an object. This gives science its secret weapon, which is, \nthe experimental method. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe know that there are other encounters with reality where we get to \nknow things in a different way. There, testing has to give way to \ntrusting. If I'm always setting little traps to see if you're my \nfriend, I destroy the possibility of friendship between us. So that's \na different way of knowing, which is adapted not to the impersonal \nworld that science describes, but to the personal world of human \nencounter. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe transpersonal world of encounter with the divine reality requires \nyet another way of knowing, which involves worship and awe and \nobedience. And I think it's very important to recognize that we don't \nmeet reality in a single way.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation is a huge stumbling block for scientists. What perspective \ndo you give on the revelation?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think there's a tremendous misapprehension in many scientists's \nminds. They think the revelation is some sort of unquestionable \nauthority. You shut your eyes, grit your teeth, [and] believe six \nimpossible things before breakfast, because you're told that's what \nyou've got to do.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey don't want to do that, nor do I. I don't want to commit \nintellectual suicide. I'm trying to persuade my scientific friends \nthat I have motivations for my religious beliefs just as I have \nmotivations for my scientific beliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation is the account of those particular events and people in \nwhom the divine presence has been most clearly revealed and \ndiscerned. They are like critical experiments, so to speak. So I see \nthe Bible as the laboratory notebook of the spirit in the way that a \nscientist notes down the results of his or her experiments in the \nlaboratory.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is divine self-limitation and how does it work itself out?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think it's an extremely important idea, which, in the twentieth \ncentury, became pretty dominant in many forms of theological \nthinking. And it's this: That when God brings into being a creation, \nbecause God is a God of love, God allows creatures to be themselves, \nindeed to make themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's how we might theologically understand an evolving universe. \nCreation is not God's divine puppet theater in which God pulls every \nstring, but God allows creatures to be themselves. That means that \nnot everything that happens will be in accordance with God's will. I \ndon't think that God wills the act of a murderer. But, of course, \nbecause God has given free will to human beings, God allows murders \nto happen. I also actually think that God does not will the incidence \nof a cancer, but God allows that to happen in a world in which \nmalignancy is an unavoidable possibility.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine self-limitation is important to me because it is the sort of \nrelationship a loving God would have with creatures: to share with \nthem rather than to dominate them. I think that God interacts with \nthe world but does not overrule it. It also explainsthe deepest \ntheological problem, which is the problem of the existence of evil \nand suffering in the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the current relationship between the scientific community and \nthe theological community? \u0014\nThere's quite a brisk conversation going on. I think the difficulty \nis that the scientists are wary of religion. A great many scientists \ncan see that science by itself is not enough. But they are wary of \nreligion because they think it is based upon unquestioning authority. \nTheology has to be a bit more up front in exhibiting that it doesn't \nhave all the answers put up its sleeve, but it, too, is in the search \nfor truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the big differences between scientific faith in that sense and \nreligious faith in another sense is that religious faith involves \ncommitment of the whole person. I believe in quarks and gluons very \nstrongly, actually, but it doesn't affect my life in any very \ncritical way. I can't be a Christian without it affecting my life in \nall sorts of ways. There is moral demand in religious belief as well \nas an intellectual demand, which does make it more costly, more \nchallenging, and in the end more worthwhile.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "JUST A LITTLE RED BIBLE",
    "words": "JUST A LITTLE RED BIBLE\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that busy Monday morning, the thing that I wanted to hear least \nwas the buzzer telling me that I had a caller who needed some of my \ntime. But it happened!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe receptionist said in her pleasant voice, \"You have a gentleman \nwaiting to see you.\" I had thought a thousand times that I should \ntell her to try to distinguish between my callers by referring to \nsome of them as \"men\" and some \"gentlemen.\" I thought that this \nsystem would help prepare me for the interview.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a social worker on the staff of a large inner-city church in Fort \nWorth, Texas I had all kinds of people coming to my office. The \nfreight train hitchhikers were our most frequent \"customers,\" but we \nalso had the highway hitchhiker since we were located at the \ncrossroad of the freeways. This type of caller usually was fairly \neasy to distinguish, but our receptionist called them all \n\"gentlemen.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAt my busy times, I felt a bit annoyed at the interference they \ncaused in my work, but there were a few times when I had the courage \nto pray: Please, Lord, keep me from putting people in categories and \nhelp me see them all as equals, as Jesus did when he was on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis particular morning was not one of those days that I felt like \npraying such a prayer. I just wanted to get my desk work done.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I opened my office door, I knew that there was a 90 percent chance \nthat the \"gentleman\" would be a transient; and I had my speech ready \n- one that would send him on his way downtown to the rescue mission. \nBefore I could open my mouth, however, I was being introduced to a \ndistinguish looking man dressed in a striking, gray plaid suit (one \nlike I had always wanted). The colors in his shirt and tie were \nperfectly matched. He was well built and handsome. As he spoke, his \ndeep, well-modulated voice impressed me so much that I was taken \naback and stammered a bit as I invited him into my\u0014\noffice. He was so immaculate and well-ordered in behavior that I \nfound myself apologizing for the clutter in the office.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't until he was seated that I noted the small, soiled, and \nrugged red Bible that he held in his hands. That little inexpensive \nitem hardly complemented the rest of his attire - that is, not until \nI heard his story.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince it was obvious that he was a bit uncomfortable and since I \ncould tell that the red Bible was the center of his attention, I \nfocused my mind on it and inquired about it. He quickly admitted that \nhe had come to our church for the express purpose of giving it to a \nminister and was going to make the presentation to me since our \npastor was not available.\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew now that the pile of work on my desk could wait. My curiosity \nand interest had been captivated by this man of distinction who \nwanted to make a ceremony out of giving a preacher a cheap, worn-out, \nfaded red Bible. Of all the things I needed in my library, another \nBible was not one of them!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe well-controlled voice soon lost some of its depth and resonance. \nHe was not overcome with emotion as he began his story, but it was \nobvious that he was certainly performing a deed and telling a story \nthat had deep significance for him. His feeling charged the room, and \nI sat in expectation as he began.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy first fear was that the spell of this room might be broken by \nanother buzz from the receptionist. I knew that I couldn't stand \nthat; so I signaled her to hold all calls. Then he proceeded.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I was a small boy, my mother ran a boarding house for railroad \nmen over on Main Street, just three blocks from this church. To help \nmy mother out, I used to polish shoes for the men for a nickel a \npair. I never had shoes, myself, except in the coldest winter. \nOveralls were my seven-day-a-week uniform, sometimes with a shirt but \nusually with none. Haircuts were rare. Treats and toys were anything \nI could find on the streets to play with. Neighborhood fights, \nbrawls, and rumbles were part of my social life. It was plenty rough, \nand I guess I looked the part.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can't remember having anything very beautiful ever come into my \nlife until one day when my scrounging through the neighborhood \nbrought me right over here to St. Louis Street, and the day just \nhappened to be Sunday. All days were alike to me in the summertime. \nAnd it was summer. The church windows were open, and singing was \nfilling the air around me. I was enthralled with the sound of it. I \nhad never heard anything like it before in all my life. I stopped \ndead in my tracks and listened. It was beautiful.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point in his story, tears were rolling down his cheeks and he \nwiped them away with an embarrassed look. By this time, I was so \ncaught up in his story that he began to feel that those tears no \nlonger mattered. He sensed my understanding and concern.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The beauty of those tones set my imagination wild,\" he continued, \n\"and I stood there envisioning that the church must be filled with \nangels, for surely only angels could sing so beautifully. My heart \nand soul never responded to anything like that before. I immediately \nsat down on the curb and listened. I listened and I listened. I never \ntired of it. My soul was being filled with beauty and I knew it and I \nloved it - and I was grateful. I was so glad that the church was \nthere and that there was a curb for boys like me to sit on.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I began to keep track of days; and when Sunday came around, I would \ngo sit on the curb and wait for the music to start. Each Sunday it \nseemed lovelier. Each Sunday my heart seemed fuller of beauty. And I \ncontinued to be glad that I could listen. I started watching people \nas they came and went and wondered how it must feel to be able to go \ninto the church and watch the people sing as well as listen to them. \nI know that I could never be so fortunate. I wasn't bitter, nor hurt, \nand really not too disappointed. I was just glad that no one chased \nme away from the curb where I could listen as long as I wanted to.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would hate for winters to come, because that meant that all church \nwindows were closed and the music couldn't drift out to my curb; but \nspring and summer brought my recital of heavenly music back to me.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I had a real scare one Sunday morning when the tall Negro man, who \nalways stood at the door, came across the street to my curb. I was \nafraid that he was going to ask me leave. Rather, he approached me \ngently and asked if I wouldn't like to go inside the church and sit \nwith the people. I thought that he must be joking, but I tested him \nand said, 'If you think it will be all right.' He assured me that no \none would mind. I can't describe what I felt as he ushered me in - \nthe beauty of well dressed people; the smiling faces, the \nstained-glass windows, the height of the ceiling, the dark glistening \nwoodwork,\u0014\nthe pipes of the organ, and, most of all, the grand music from the \nvoices in the choir. I was enraptured - a dirty, ragged boy sitting \nin the midst of such beauty. I had to cry.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I didn't move a muscle. I was mesmerized by the sights and sounds \nand fragrances. Pretty women smell so pretty. I was in another world \n- away from railroad men with their loud talk, smoky smell, dirty \nclothes, and cheap conversation. What ecstasy! And then it was over.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Not entirely over, because the janitor walked out with me and told \nme to return next Sunday and come an hour earlier and he would show \nme another part of the church. The longest week of my life followed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The next Sunday I washed my face, my hands, and my feet. John, the \nNegro doorman, greeted me as it I had been delivered to the door in \nthe finest chaffered carriage. He ushered me grandly to the Junior \nSunday School department, where I was met by a lady with an angelic \nface and gracious manners. She made me feel as if she cared. And once \nagain I was in the presence of pretty clothes, pretty music, and \nhappy faces. I kept thinking that this was a dream. But it happened \nSunday after Sunday after Sunday. And I became a part - a part of a \nchurch, a part of a Sunday School department, a part of a crowd of \nlovely people.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The thrill of all thrills came weeks later when this lovely lady \ncalled out my name and asked my to come stand beside her - right up \nthere in front of all those other boys and girls. I was being \nrecognized; I was up front; and all eyes were on me. Can anyone ever \ndescribe how a boy feels when he is made to feel important? My heart \npounded. I choked back tears. I stood uncomfortably on one foot and \nthen the other. It was an exhilarating moment. I loved the discomfort \nof being uneasy for such a brief span of total importance. The she \nsaid, 'Since you have been regular in attendance for thirteen\u0014\nSundays, we, the Junior Department of Broadway Baptist Church, want \nyou to have your own Bible - one that you can read every day at home \nand one that you can bring to Sunday School every Lord's Day.' This \nwas too much! - my own Bible and a red one. It was the most beautiful \nbook I had ever seen - more that I would have dared wish for.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And to add to my ecstasy, she reported that our pastor had \nautographed it for me. Sure enough, there in the front he had written \nmy name and then signed his. I wanted to cry - but not in front of \nall the kids. I saved that for the privacy of my soul - and I did. On \nthe way home, I found a big tree and hid behind it and wept and wept. \nI was so grateful for beautiful things - music, people, faces, \nbooks.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of the little, faded red Bible was beginning to open up; \nbut why the treasure was to be presented to me was still a mystery. I \nthought that is must be one of his fondest possessions. Why would he \nwant to give it to a stranger?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe continued by saying: \"In a few years, a man in the church began to \ntalk to me about the love of God and how Jesus had been sent to give \nall people eternal life and to give them peace in their hearts. I did \nstruggle to try to understand. He was patient, and I was eager. Soon \nthe Spirit of God revealed the blessed truth of salvation to my heart \nand mind, and I accepted Christ as my Savior.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The pastor baptized me and pasted here in the back of this Bible is \nthe pretty little card that he sent me, telling the date of my \nconversion and baptism. No one will ever know how much this great old \nchurch has meant to me. I have completed all the education I need or \nwant. My wife and children and I are well-situated in a lovely home \nand in a lovely church on the edge of town. We are active in every \nphase of our church life. We are prospering spiritually and \nmaterially every day. We are totally happy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The other day I noticed that the little red Bible had been hidden \nbehind a stack of books in our den. No telling how long it had been \nout of sight, and I suddenly realized that it no longer belonged to \nme. I wanted Broadway to have it. That is where it belongs.\u0014\n\u0014\nI couldn't keep from interrupting him at this point to ask why we \nneeded it more then he. He had a ready answer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This old church has had many chances to move out from this downtown \narea and leave the neighborhood of the inner city with all its \nproblems, its dirty apartments, and high crime rate; but she stayed. \nShe needs to stay right here because, you see, you never can tell \nwhen another little dirty, ragged boy might come and sit on your curb \nto listen to the beautiful music. If you weren't here, there would be \nnone for him to hear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just want this little red Bible to be a reminder to the pastors of \nthis church that one day, a long time ago, a rough little kid was \nfilled with beauty, and that there are other dirty waifs nearby who \nneed the same feeling he had from listening, attending, and \nbelieving. I pray God will use this little red Bible to the end.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWith this, my friend shook my hand firmly and meaningfully and said, \n\"May God bless the church that stays where the people need beauty the \nmost.\" With that he walked out of my office.\u0014\n\u0014\nI stood in wonderment, holding the little red Bible in my hand. I \nwatched the vigorous, prosperous young man leave my office and \nmarveled at how he had transformed from a dirty little bootblack to \nan eloquent, warm, successful man. The little red Bible tells the \nwhole story.\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES H. CONE: MIDWIFE OF BLACK THEOLOGY",
    "words": "James H. Cone: Midwife of Black Theology\u0014\n\u0014\nRick Wilson\u0014\n11-08-02 \u0014\nThe social ferment of the mid-20th century produced the new wine of \nBlack Theology. What began in the struggles over slavery and \nabolition in the mid-19th century turned into a segregated society \nyearning for justice 100 years later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision in 1954, which \nforced the integration of public schools in Little Rock, Ark., and \nbeyond, opened the floodgates of hope and despair across the country. \nWithin a decade of the Brown decision, the civil rights movement had \nhit its stride and the first rumblings of a Black Power movement were \nbeing heard. \u0014\n\u0014\nJames H. Cone turned out to be midwife who assisted at the birth of \nBlack Theology. He continues to be the most constant voice and \ninfluence among those who have nurtured Black Theology. His story \nmirrors the context out of which Black Theology arose and gained \nacceptance along with other political theologies of the 20th century. \u0014\n\u0014\nPolitical theology results from reading the Gospel in light of \ncurrent social contexts, with the explicit goal of transforming \nsociety on the basis of the Gospel. Perhaps more than any other \ntheological development in the United States, Black Theology \nillustrates what happens when the Gospel is actively directed toward \nsocial change.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1938, the state of Arkansas was in the clutches of separate but \nequal public education that epitomized a segregated culture in the \nUnited States. Cone was born that year in a small town not far from \nLittle Rock. He grew up in a society divided by race, and he matured \nin the midst of painful attempts to address and correct those \ninjustices through appeals to the Gospel. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt 16, he was ordained in the A.M.E. Zion Church and began a life of \nministry. Cone graduated from high school only two years after the \npivotal Brown decision, and he was a student at Philander Smith \nCollege in Little Rock during Martin Luther King Jr.s rise to \nprominence as a movement leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1963, Cone had completed his basic seminary training at Garrett \nTheological Seminary near Chicago, and had begun work on a doctorate \nat Northwestern University. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned to his alma mater in Little Rock to teach theology. In \nthe classroom, Cone was confronted by a wide gap between theology as \nmere ideas and theology as a foundation for life. Reflecting upon \nthat confrontation in his 1975 book, God of the Oppressed, Cone \nwrote, I encountered head-on the contradictions of my seminary \neducation as I attempted to inform black students about the \nsignificance of theological discourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years later Cone took an appointment at Adrian College, a small \ncollege near Detroit, where he saw firsthand the devastating effects \nof the race riots that swept Detroit, Newark and Watts. It was a \nturning point for Cone and a launching pad for Black Theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nCone gathered up his Arkansas experience, which gave him confidence \nin the Gospel, and began seeking to apply the hope of the Gospel to a \nsociety coming apart at the seams. Cone was deeply impressed by \nKings nonviolence, but he could not shake the results of the Black \nPower movement.\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1968 Cone published the first of many books laying out the \nprinciples of Black Theology. Black Theology and Black Power boldly \nconfronted the hopes of the Gospel (following the influences of King) \nand the effectiveness of the more aggressive and political work of \nthe likes of Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X. The tensions between \nKings nonviolence and the more aggressive influence of Malcolm X \nhave shaped Black Theology for more than 30 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe content of Cones work makes it Christian. Without fail over the \nyears he has explored the heart of the Gospel as setting at liberty \nthose who are oppressed (Lk 4:18) and challenged others to do the \nsame. The context of Cones work makes it political. To hear the \nGospel call of liberation is, for Cone, a summons to bear the literal \ngood news to those who have been systematically oppressed because of \nthe color of their skin. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe summons is also for those who have contributed to the oppression \nby refusing to hear the cries of the oppressed, or by remaining \nsilent in the face of the continued sin of racism. To set free the \noppressed is also to set free those who oppress. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlack Theology is a Christian response to the persistent sin of \nracism that has stampedand continues to stampAmerican culture. \nBlack Theology is more than a response to racism, however. It is also \nan invitation and model to see how the Gospel is always concrete, \npractical and prophetic.\u0014\n\u0014\nRick Wilson is the Columbus Roberts Professor of Theology and chair \nof the Roberts Department of Christianity in Mercer University's \nCollege of Liberal Arts in Macon, Ga.\u0014",

    "title": "JACOB ROTHCHILD:  FINANCIAL ROYALTY",
    "words": "The five Rothschild brothers constituted the world's most influential \nfinancial power during much of the 19th century. They enjoyed \nlifestyles more lavish than most of their clients, including some \nkings. Indeed, when King Wilhelm I of Prussia occupied Jacob's \nchateau as temporary headquarters during the Franco-Prussian War \n(1870-1871), he was stunned by the sheer opulence. \"Folks like us \ncan't rise to this,\" the monarch gasped. \"Only a Rothschild can \nachieve it!\" The Rothschild clout was so formidable that, on \noccasion, they could be as imperious as their monarchs. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1830s, youngest brother Jacob (1792-1868), head of the Paris \noffice, ignored public outcry that trains would stampede cattle and \nset the countryside on fire and persuaded the government to sanction \nhis railroad. He then floated a stock issue worth 150 million francs \nand calmly gave 7.5 million shares to the politicians and journalists \nopposing his project. His shrewdness gained Jacob so much support \nthat Frenchmen rushed to buy shares, and his highly successful \nrailroads helped give France an edge in the Industrial Revolution. \u0014\n\u0014\nA decade later, Jacob coolly refused to underwrite the stocks for the \nSuez Canal, the most ambitious, potentially lucrative project of the \ncentury. He did so simply because Ferdinand de Lesseps, the canal's \nbuilder, refused to pay his 5 percent commission for arranging the \ndeal. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch power and influence brought Jacob and his family fantastic \nwealth. He and his brothers literally lived like kings, complete with \npalaces and a corps of private couriers with trademark blue and \nyellow caps. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1862, Jacob entertained the French Emperor Napoleon III at his \nspectacular chateau outside Paris. The royal guest admired paintings \nby Rubens, Van Dyck, and Velasquez, dined from plates of Sevres \nporcelain, and enjoyed a composition by Rossini written especially \nfor the occasion. The final amusement was an afternoon hunt on the \nvast estate grounds, during which 1000 head of game were shot.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS' SWORD - PEACE IN TUMULTUOUS TIMES",
    "words": "Jesus' Sword\u0014\nLonging for peace in tumultuous times.\u0014\nBy Philip Yancey | posted 1/7/2003\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did \nnot come to bring peace, but a sword,\" Jesus told his disciples, \ntwelve fresh recruits who on hearing that must have wondered what \nthey were getting into. Jesus would later rebuke Peter for wielding a \nliteral sword, and by that time, all twelve must have had at least a \nhint of the broader scope of Jesus' words.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' \"sword\"the disruption his presence inevitably createshas \nsplit families, neighborhoods, and nations. As the Misfit in one of \nFlannery O'Connor's stories puts it, \"Jesus thrown everything off \nbalance.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I recently read the first two chapters of Luke, it struck me that \nthe shadow of a sword hangs over Jesus' birth as well. We tend to \nrecall the story in cheerful tones, but when Christ was born, menace \nfilled the air.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He will be a joy and delight to you,\" an angel prophesied to \nZechariah about his son John. Yes, and a worry and a grief too, as \nreports filtered in of him eating bugs in the desert and incurring \nthe wrath of Herod. As for John, he seemed to recognize his more \nfamous cousin in utero: \"The baby in my womb leaped for joy,\" \nElizabeth told Mary when she learned of Mary's pregnancy. (Flash \nforward 30 years, though, when John would send a haunting question \nfrom prison: \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect \nsomeone else?\" John would feel the sword at its sharpest.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI love the ironies embedded in Luke's Christmas story. While news of \nElizabeth's pregnancy spread like gossip throughout the hill country \nof Judea, and her son John became a local hero for a time, poor Mary \nhad to slip out of town to avoid the ugly accusations, and her son \nwould be chased from the neighborhood by a murderous crowd. \"A sword \nwill pierce your own soul too,\" the old man Simeon warned Mary, a \nstatement she no doubt pondered during her boy's tumultuous time on \nearth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel Gabriel, indignant over Zechariah's lack of faith, renders \nhim temporarily mute and thus unable to vocalize the best news he's \never heard. Joseph and Mary, far from home and robbed of the \ntraditional serenade by neighbors at the birth of a son, instead got \na choir of angels in the sky. The baby himself began life on earth as \nhe would end it, wrapped in binding cloths as if suggestive of the \nrestraints he accepted in visiting this dark planet. God's Son\"the \nbread of life,\" he would later call himselfspends his first night in \na feeding trough slick with animal saliva and unchewed food.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA historian, Luke carefully dates the birth stories: \"In the time of \nHerod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah.\" That simple \nconjunction foretells one disruption that will define much of human \nhistory: the uneasy relationship of church and state. Herod the Great \nsought to kill the baby Jesus. The monarch's son, another Herod, \nwould later behead Zechariah's son John and torment Jesus in a \nmocking trial. And after Jesus' death, Romans would persecute his \nfollowers, as would Mongols, Huns, Turks, Vikings, Russians, Chinese, \nAlbanians, Arabians, Sudanese, and a host of others.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nZechariah prayed for \"salvation from our enemies,\" a timeworn Jewish \nprayer that assuredly never got the answer he yearned for. Like so \nmany who encountered Jesus, he expected a different kind of Messiah, \none who would lead armies to triumph astride a stallion, not ride a \ndonkey toward his crucifixion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOf all the characters in Luke's birth story, Mary seems to have the \nbest grasp of the sword about to descend. Though often set to \nbeautiful music, her Magnificat has a fierce and revolutionary tone, \nwith rulers scattered with the proud and the rich sent away empty, \neven as the humble are exalted and the hungry filled.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a kind of counterpoint, Zechariah's song ends with a prophecy that \nsets a lofty tone for the spread of the Good News: \"the rising sun \nwill come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and \nin the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, looking back over two millennia of Christian history, \nI see much evidence of disruption caused not just by Jesus' message \nbut also by his followers. At this very moment war sabers are \nrattling, the land of Jesus' birth convulses and bleeds, and the \nworldwide church shows more division than unity. I find myself \nrepeating Zechariah's song of joy as an urgent prayer, wishing that \nMessiah's visit would be seen as a dawning of light and annunciation \nof peace.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel choir announced Jesus' birth with the words, \"on earth \npeace, good will toward men.\" If only today we men and women could \nlive out those words that filled the sky that Christmas day so long \nago.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN SPONG'S VIEW OF ASSISTED SUICIDE",
    "words": "Assisted Suicide: A Christian Choice and a New Freedom \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Christianity to grapple with the ethical issues that \nface us at the end of life. \u0014\n \u0014\nA century ago it was not an option. The final moments of life came \nwith no heart pump or ventilators, no shrinking of tumors with \nradiation, no ability to cleanse a person's blood supply. Death was \nnormally quick, since medical science had little help to offer. Then \ncame the quantum leap in medical knowledge that expanded longevity \nbeyond anyone's fondest dreams.  \u0014\nI rejoice in these incredible human accomplishments, grieving only at \ntheir limited availability across the world. Religious leaders \nuniversally applaud these medical advances that seem to validate the \nclaim that life is sacred and calls us anew to acknowledge and even \nto worship the Source of this sacred life, whose name, they proclaim, \nis God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese stunning developments, however, did not come without raising \nhuge issues. If death is not as inescapable as it once was, a whole \nnew level of decision making must be engaged. We are no longer simply \nchildren leaning on the Deity with no responsibility except to \nembrace our destiny. New dimensions of maturity become obvious. We \nnow share in the life and death decisions that once were thought to \nlie solely in the domain of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no virtue in refusing to accept this new human reality. \nNothing is changed by hiding our heads in the sand. This revolution \nhas called us to frontiers where many religious ideas about the end \nof life must be set aside as no longer fitting our world. When that \noccurs, assisted suicide--under certain conditions--emerges as a new \nalternative for Christian people; the values marking the Christian \nfaith and those motivating the 'Death with Dignity' movement begin to \nmerge. The key to this union lies in the commitment by both groups to \ndefend the dignity and sacredness of human life. That is a \nrapprochement I welcome and hope to facilitate. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs these new realities engage both groups, core definitions demand to \nbe recast. For Christians that will not be easy. Just as we have come \nto believe that St. Paul was wrong in his attitude toward women and \nhomosexuality, we now must see that he was also wrong when he viewed \ndeath as an enemy, even the \"the last enemy\" that had to be \ndestroyed. When Paul wrote those words, he was under the influence of \nthe ancient biblical myth of creation. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn that story, first thought of quite literally and later regarded as \nonly metaphorically true, the explanation was offered that the \ndisobedience of the first man and woman had plunged the whole world \ninto sin, breaking the divine image in human life and causing \nbanishment from the Garden of Eden. This fall was also said to have \ndestroyed our immortality, causing us ultimately to die. The fact \nthat no one escaped death was prima facie evidence for those like \nPaul, who were shaped by this defining myth, that sin was universal \nand death, its punishment, was the ultimate human enemy that had to \nbe overcome. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is easy to understand how ancient people came to these \nconclusions, since death was a lurking presence ready to pounce upon \nits victims at every stage of life. This biblical definition of \ndeath, however, is clearly wrong and must be dismissed as no longer \noperative. It is not even a correct metaphor. \u0014\n\u0014\nDeath is not divine punishment endured because we are fallen people. \nDeath is a natural part of life's cycle. It must, therefore, be \nembraced as something good--a friend, not an enemy. Can any of us \nreally imagine life without death being a part of it? Far from being \nevil, death is simply that shadow which gives life its passion, its \ndepth, its sense of urgency. Death walks with us from the moment we \nare born. It pressures life. It is that reality which makes life's \nexperiences unrepeatable. Childhood lasts but a limited time. It \nshould be neither rushed nor restrained. The same is true for our \nadolescence, adulthood, and every other identifiable stage of our \nlives. There is only one journey through the middle years, the aging \nprocess, and into old age itself. Each stage must be grasped with \nvigor. \u0014\n\u0014\nLife is meant to be lived. We are to scale its heights, plumb its \ndepths, and taste its sweetness. Death rings the bell on all \nprocrastination. It cannot, therefore, be our enemy, something we \nstrive to defeat. It is our friend, something we must learn to accept \nas an ultimate source of life's meaning. When modern medicine pushes \ndeath back in order to expand the length and quality of our \nexistence, it is not defeating our enemy, it is revealing our \nholiness. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut a perilous boundary becomes visible in this new consciousness \nwhen the efforts of medical science cease expanding the length and \nquality of life, and begin postponing death's inevitability. With \nthat subtle and poorly defined moment comes, a new arena is entered \nwhere both a new Christian belief system and a new ethic about final \nthings needs to be born. \u0014\n\u0014\nDo we honor the God of life by extending the length of our days when \nthe quality of our life has dissipated? Is a breathing cadaver a \nwitness to the God of life? Should powerful narcotics be used to \nlessen our pain and thus to extend our days even if they rob us of \nthe relationships which give life its meaning? \u0014\n\u0014\nIf I have a medically-confirmed incurable disease, and can bear the \npain of that sickness only by being placed into a kind of twilight \nzone, where I neither recognize the sweet smile of my wife nor \nrespond to the touch of her hand, do I not have the ethical right to \nend my life with medical assistance? Can dedicated Christians step \ninto this process and say we have now reached the point in human \ndevelopment where we have not just the right, but the moral \nobligation, to share life-and-death decisions with God? Do we not \nserve our deepest convictions if we decide to end our life at the \nmoment in which its sacredness becomes compromised? \u0014\n\u0014\nI am one Christian who wants to say not just one 'yes' to these \nquestions, but Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes! I want to do it not in \nthe guilt of yesterday's value system that proclaimed that only God \ncould properly make these decisions. I want to do it, rather, as a \nmodern Christian, asserting that human skill has brought about a new \nmaturity in which we are both called to and equipped for the awesome \ntask of being co-creators with God of the gift of life. As such we \nmust also be responsible with God for guaranteeing the goodness of \nour deaths. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am not put off by the slippery slope arguments that are so often \nused by religious forces and that resort to fearmongering when they \ncannot embrace the new realities. I do not believe that this stance \nwill lead to state-ordered executions of the elderly, or to health \nmaintenance organizations curtailing medical payments until a quick \ndeath is achieved. I do not believe that greedy potential heirs will \nuse this power to hasten the receipt of their inheritances. These \nare, in my mind, nothing but the smokescreens of negativity, designed \nto play on the fear present when childlike dependency is threatened \nand when mature human decisions are mandated. \u0014\n\u0014\nA world that is bright enough to create these opportunities is surely \nbright enough to control those who might misuse them. All of these \nabuses could be eliminated by investing this life-and-death decision \nsolely with the affected individual. Advance directives, signed when \nthat person is in good health, should be honored. The decision-making \npower should reside with the individual, who alone is to be granted \nthe legal right to determine how and when his or her life is to come \nto an end. That is how we will surround death with the dignity that \nthis ancient friend deserves. I regard this choice as a right to be \nenshrined alongside \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" at \nthe center of our value system, a basic human freedom that we must \nclaim.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbove all, I affirm that the choice of death with dignity, whether by \nmy own hand or with the assistance of my physician, is a moral and a \nmore godly choice than passively enduring a life pointlessly devoid \nof hope or meaning. I believe this option is rooted in the Christian \nconviction that life is sacred. It is thus not life denying, but life \naffirming. It is because we honor life that we want to end it with \nour faculties still intact, our minds still competent, and our \ndignity still respected. Assisted suicide, as a conscious choice made \namid the extremity of sickness, is the way that I, as a Christian, \ncan pay homage to the Christ who stands at the center of that faith, \nwhose purpose, says the Fourth Gospel, was to bring life and to bring \nit abundantly. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo accept the responsibility of making ultimate decisions about life; \nto celebrate the fact that I live in an age of remarkable ingenuity; \nto embrace the truth that death is not our enemy but the shadow that \ngives life its purpose; to claim the right to determine how and when \nI shall die; these are the opportunities that confront people in the \n21st century. I embrace them as a Christian who deeply believes in \nthe God who is the Source of Life, who makes all life holy. \u0014\n\u0014\nI shall live as deeply as I can while I have the opportunity. I hope \nto end my life as gracefully as circumstances will allow. But in both \nmy living and my dying, even if that dying is by my own choice or \nhand in the face of the end of meaning and dignity, I want to assert \nthat my decisions are within the framework of what I call Christian \nethics.\u0014",

Like\u0014\n                 Andrew Fuller, Bunyan came from the working class and\u0014\n                 understood poverty early in life. His early life \nincluded a good\u0014\n                 deal of degradation as well as a stint in the army. \nEven after he\u0014\n                 had married, Bunyan was what we would call today a \nwayward\u0014\n                 Christian. He later realized he was no Christian at \nall. The story\u0014\n                 is oft told of how Bunyan heard a sermon one Sunday \nmorning\u0014\n                 against the evils of Sunday sports. That afternoon, \nwhile playing\u0014\n                 \"cats\", Bunyan heard a voice in his heart which \nsaid, \"Wilt thou\u0014\n                 leave thy sins and go to Heaven, or have thy sins \nand go to hell?\"\u0014\n                 Those words would not leave him over the next few \nmonths. In\u0014\n                 one of Gods divine encounters, John Bunyan began to \nturn from religion in form to Christ\u0014\n                 in fact. One day Bunyan tried to join in on a \nconversation about religion with several poor\u0014\n                 women he heard talking as he walked down the street. \nHe thought himself to be quite\u0014\n                 knowledgeable about such things so he attempted to \nreason along with these godly\u0014\n                 women. Instead, Bunyan had no idea what they were \nspeaking of. He wrote: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Their talk ... was about a new birth, the work \nof God on their hearts, also\u0014\n                      how they were convinced of their miserable \nstate by nature. They talked how\u0014\n                      God had visited their souls with His love in \nthe Lord Jesus, and with what\u0014\n                      words and promises they had been refreshed, \ncomforted, and supported\u0014\n                      against the temptations of the devil.\" 1 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Later those same women introduced Bunyan to their \npastor, John Gifford. While not\u0014\n                 Baptist, Gifford and the church he pastored were \ndefinitely congregational and definitely\u0014\n                 not \"high church.\" The church was comprised of both \nCongregational and Baptist\u0014\n                 believers. It was under Giffords preaching and \nteaching that Bunyan at last came to\u0014\n                 Christ. Bunyan's, Grace Abounding is his own \nspiritual biography. In it he tells how the\u0014\n                 verse, \"He hath made peace by the blood of His \ncross\" (Colossians 1:20), finally broke\u0014\n                 through to his heart and he was truly saved. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Several years (1656) after coming to Christ, Bunyan \nbegan to preach at the same church\u0014\n                 which Gifford had pastored. He was above all a \npreacher who would proclaim God's Word\u0014\n                 anywhere and everywhere:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"He himself ... went out to preach the Word in \nthe open air on village greens,\u0014\n                      in barns, in private houses, and sometimes even \nin parish churches.\u0014\n                      Bedfordshire and neighboring shires are full of \ntraditions of his preaching,\u0014\n                      and several Congregational and Baptist churches \nclaimed to have been\u0014\n                      founded through his preaching.\" 2\u0014\n\u0014\n                 It was not long before Bunyans willingness and \ndrive to preach the gospel everywhere got\u0014\n                 him into trouble. By 1660, Anglican royalists had \nstepped up their attacks on\u0014\n                 non-conformist preachers (Baptists, \nCongregationalists, and Puritans in general). It\u0014\n                 became illegal to preach in non-sanctioned places. \nSo on Nov 12, 1660, John Bunyan\u0014\n                 was arrested for preaching in a field near a \nfarmhouse. Upon his arrest, Bunyan was\u0014\n                 informed that if he would apologize to the \nmagistrates and refrain from preaching, he\u0014\n                 would be released. Bunyan replied that such a \npromise was not possible and thus began\u0014\n                 a twelve year imprisonment. His refusal to cease \npreaching reminds one of Peter and\u0014\n                 John's reply to the Jewish leaders when they were \ninstructed to refrain from preaching: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Acts 4:18-20 - \"Then they called them in again \nand commanded them not to\u0014\n                      speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But \nPeter and John replied,\u0014\n                      'Judge for yourselves whether it is right in \nGod's sight to obey you rather\u0014\n                      than God. For we cannot help speaking about \nwhat we have seen and\u0014\n                      heard.'\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                 During those 12 years of imprisonment, Bunyan wrote \nGrace Abounding, Confessions of\u0014\n                 Faith, and A Defense of the Doctrine of \nJustification by Faith. Ernest Bacon speculates that\u0014\n                 it was in the last part of his imprisonment that \nBunyan began to formulate his greatest\u0014\n                 work, Pilgrim's Progress.3 Finally, King Charles II \nreleased most religious prisoners\u0014\n                 including John Bunyan. Bunyan emerged a leader among \nnon-conformist and the pastor\u0014\n                 of the church at Bedford. He wouldn't have long to \nspend with his wife and seven children,\u0014\n                 however. On Feb 1675, Charles II changed his mind \nand Bunyan along with others was\u0014\n                 arrested again. This time more legally minded \nfriends accomplished the release of\u0014\n                 Bunyan after a short time. On leaving prison this \nsecond time, Bunyan released for\u0014\n                 publication part one of his monumental The Pilgrims \nProgress in 1678. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 What may seem like a question for church historians \nand no one else is whether Bunyan\u0014\n                 was really a Baptist at all. The answer is important \nto modern Christians as you will see.\u0014\n                 There can be no doubt that Bunyan had little use for \ndenominational titles. He once said: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"As for those titles of Anabaptists, \nIndependents, Presbyterians, or the like, I\u0014\n                      conclude that they come neither from Jerusalem \nnor from Antioch, but\u0014\n                      rather from hell and Babylon, for they \nnaturally tend to division.\"4 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 In fact, it would probably be safer to call Bunyan a \nbaptist rather than a Baptist. He was\u0014\n                 baptized as a believing adult and often taught that \nbaptism should be administered only to\u0014\n                 those who had heard and embraced the gospel. At the \nsame time, Bunyan did not believe\u0014\n                 that either baptism or the Lord's Supper should \ndivide true Christians. \"Instead of\u0014\n                 accenting the differences  he emphasized the \nfundamentals of the faith which all true\u0014\n                 believers shared. He defended the gospel as the \nbasis of Christian unity  When he\u0014\n                 involved himself in controversy, he did so because \nhe saw a challenge to the gospel\u0014\n                 itself.\"5 Bunyan was a baptist in the sense that he \nheld to what became the foundational\u0014\n                 tenets of Baptists. He was committed to God's Word \nfirst and foremost; he held to a\u0014\n                 congregational form of church government; and he \nstrongly emphasized justification by\u0014\n                 faith alone. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 Bunyan certainly was in sympathy with the Particular \nBaptists in his firm grip on the\u0014\n                 Doctrines of Grace. We, of what is sometimes called \nthe Reformed Faith, could learn\u0014\n                 much from John Bunyan. He was far more interested in \nGod's glory and man's salvation\u0014\n                 than he was in restrictive denominational tags.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 By the time of Bunyans death in 1688, eleven \neditions of The Pilgrims Progress had been\u0014\n                 published with over 100,000 copies in print. He left \na legacy of many other great books and\u0014\n                 poems. None of these, however, are his greatest \nlegacy to us. Bunyans greatest gift to the\u0014\n                 church was his demonstration that the Doctrines of \nGrace are not static or cold. The\u0014\n                 gospel is not predestination - it is Christ! Grace \nis how God brings us to Christ. Above all\u0014\n                 Bunyan loved Christ. He preached Christ and exalted \nChrist. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"There was first and foremost in John Bunyan a \ndeep personal love for his\u0014\n                      Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ ... Bunyan's \nbooks are full of Christ - His\u0014\n                      welcome, His unshakable truth, his advocacy for \nsinners ... His preaching\u0014\n                      and writing were Christ-centered, and it was \nthis that carried men's hearts\u0014\n                      captive to Christ. If our present day preachers \nand theologians had the\u0014\n                      same emphasis a very different spirit would \nprevail in both the Church and\u0014\n                      the State.\" 6\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Check out these works by Bunyan \nOn-Line \u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Grace Abounding to the Chief of \nSinners \u0014\n                                 Justification by an Imputed \nRighteousness \u0014\n                                       The Acceptable Sacrifice \u0014\n\u0014\n                                       Return to Portraits Page\u0014\n\u0014\n                 1 John Bunyan: Pilgrim and Dreamer by Ernest W. \nBacon, Baker Book House: Grand\u0014\n                 Rapids, MI, 1983., p. 65 \u0014\n\u0014\n                 2 ibid., p. 79. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 3 ibid., p.118. \u0014\n\u0014\n                 4 A Confession of My Faith by John Bunyan, 1672, v. \n191.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 5 Baptist Theologians by Timothy George and David S. \nDockery, Broadman Press:\u0014\n                 Nashville, TN, 1990, p. 26.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 6 Bacon, p. 178\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN LELAND ON SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE",
    "words": "John Leland on Separation of Church and State\u0014\n\u0014\nAll quotation taken from Charles Hyneman and Donald Lutz, Political \nWriting During the Founding Era:\u0014\n1760-1805, in two volumes. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Leland (1754 - 1841) was a Baptist Minister that lived and \nworked in the state of Massachusetts. Leland was committed to \nseparation, and helped Madison win the Virginia battles for religious \nfreedom. In addition, he helped lead the fight to ratify the \nConstitution in Massachusetts. His writings under the name Jack Nips \nin THE YANKEE SPY was an effort to gain support for separation of \nchurch and state in Massachusetts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n     Let it suffice on this head to say, that it is not possible in \nthe nature of things to establish religion by human laws without \nperverting the design of civil law and oppressing the people (from \nThe Yankee Spy, John Leland writing under the pen name of Jack Nipps, \nBoston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     Is it the duty of a deist to support that which he believes to \nbe a cheat and imposition? Is it the duty of the Jew to support the \nreligion of Jesus Christ, when he really believes that he was an \nimposter? Must the papist be forced to pay men for preaching down the \nsupremacy of the pope, whom they are sure is the head of the church? \nGovernment has no more to do with the religious opinions of men than \nit has with the principles of  mathematics (from The Yankee Spy, John \nLeland writing under the pen name of Jack Nipps, Boston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     To say that religion cannot stand without a state establishment \nis not only contrary to fact (as has been proved already) but is a \ncontradiction in phrase. Religion must have stood a time before any \nlaw could have been made about it; and if it did stand almost three \nhundred years without law it can still stand without it (from The \nConnecticut Dissenters Strong Box, Number One, New London 1802). \u0014\n\u0014\n     If government can answer for individuals at the day of judgment, \nlet men be controlled by it in religious matters; otherwise let men \nbe free (from The Connecticut Dissenters Strong Box, Number One, New \nLondon 1802. \u0014\n\u0014\n     To read in the New Testament, that the Lord has ordained that \nthose that preach the gospel shall live by its institutions and \nprecepts, sounds very harmonical; but to read in a state \nconstitution, that the legislature shall require men to maintain \nteachers of piety, religion and morality, sounds very discordant \n(from The Yankee Spy, John Leland writing under the pen name of Jack \nNipps, Boston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     In the second article [of the Massachusetts state constitution \nof 1780] it is said, 'is the right and duty of all men publicly, and \nat stated seasons, to worship the Supreme Being.' This article would \nread much better in a catechism than in a state constitution, and \nsound more concordant in a pulpit than in a statehouse (from The \nYankee Spy, John Leland writing under the pen name of Jack Nipps, \nBoston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     ...[A]nd the reason why public worship is enjoined (required) by \nauthority, and private worship is omitted, is only to pave the way \nfor some religious establishment by human law, and force taxes from \nthe people to support avaricious priests. (from The Yankee Spy, John \nLeland writing under the pen name of Jack Nipps,  Boston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     What leads legislators into this error, is confounding sins and \ncrimes together -- making no difference between moral evil and state \nrebellion: not considering that a man may be infected with moral \nevil, and yet be guilty of no crime, punishable by law. If a man \nworships one God, three Gods, twenty Gods, or no God -- if he pays \nadoration one day in a week, seven days or no day -- wherein does he \ninjure the life, liberty or property of another? Let any or all these \nactions be supposed to be religious evils of an enormous size, yet \nthey are not crimes to be punished by laws of state, which extend no \nfurther, in justice, than to punish the man who works ill to his \nneighbor (from The Yankee Spy, John Leland writing under the pen name \nof Jack Nipps,\u0014\n     Boston, 1794). \u0014\n\u0014\n     In a well regulated state it will be the business of the \nlegislature to prevent sectaries of different\u0014\ndenominations from molesting and disturbing each other; to ordain \nthat no part of the community shall be permitted to perplex and \nharass the other for any supposed heresy, but that each individual \nshall be allowed to have and enjoy, profess and maintain his own \nsystem of religion, provided it does not issue in overt acts of  \ntreason against the state undermining the peace and order of society. \n(from The Yankee Spy, John Leland  writing under the pen name of Jack \nNipps, Boston, 1794).\u0014",

In the latter \npassion, Leland\u0014\n      agreed with the position of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, \nboth of\u0014\n      whom he knew personally. Leland spent approximately 14 years in \nVirginia from\u0014\n      1776 to 1790-91. He was a major leader of the Baptists in \nVirginia. He helped\u0014\n      Madison by rounding up support for the defeat of the assessment \nbill in Virginia\u0014\n      in 1784-86, and by supporting the ratification of the new \nconstitution (only after\u0014\n      being assured that Madison did favor the addition of a bill of \nrights), He worked to\u0014\n      get Madison elected (over Patrick Henry's hand-picked James \nMonroe) to the\u0014\n      House of Representatives of the First Federal Congress.

    "title": "JUSTICE, SAFETY, AND THE SYSTEM",
    "words": "Justice, Safety and the System: A Witness Is Slain in Brooklyn\u0014\nBy WILLIAM GLABERSON\u0014\n\u0014\nt had been nearly 10 months since Bobby Gibson had watched a stranger \ndressed in black ride a bicycle into a Brooklyn schoolyard, draw a \ngun from his waistband and kill his friend.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow he was ready to walk into a courtroom to testify in the murder \ncase. But on the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the word had been out \nfor months: \"lie or die,\" as one neighborhood girl put it. The half \nbrother of the defendant in the schoolyard shooting, himself a \nsuspect in another slaying, was said to be tracking down witnesses. \nPeople said money had changed hands. Eyewitness accounts had been \nrecanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, on June 27, 2002, with the trial set to begin, Bobby Gibson's \nname was there, on a list of witnesses read aloud in a courtroom on \nthe seventh floor of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, Bobby Gibson was dead, shot through the heart a block \nfrom the schoolyard where his friend had been killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe murder of a witness is a calamity for the American legal system  \nnot shocking, perhaps, in the world of international drug \ntrafficking, but close to unthinkable in New York. There are supposed \nto be effective protections and programs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Bobby Gibson, prosecutors said, was killed precisely because he \nwas going to testify  slain at 21 after his name was turned over to \nthe defense, and after a whispered courtroom exchange between the \nschoolyard suspect and the suspect's half brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New York Times spent three months examining the killing of Bobby \nGibson and the question of witness protection in New York City  \ncompiling statistics on witness intimidation, reviewing trial \ntranscripts, audiotaped testimony and grand jury records, and \ninterviewing police officers, prosecutors and friends and relatives \nof Bobby Gibson.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe picture that emerges is disturbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least five people with ties to the schoolyard case have testified \nor said in interviews that witnesses, including Bobby Gibson, told \nlaw enforcement officials about threats or asked for protection, and \nwere ignored. The police and prosecutors deny this.\u0014\n\u0014\nTestimony shows, and prosecutors have indicated in court, that in the \nmonth before Bobby Gibson was killed, a prominent defense lawyer, \nMichael Warren, was used in what prosecutors charge was a plot by the \nsuspect's half brother to coerce three teenage girls into changing \ntheir testimony. The lawyer said he had no reason to believe anything \nimproper had occurred, and was shocked when Bobby Gibson wound up \ndead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe killing of Bobby Gibson was not a complete anomaly. At least 19 \nwitnesses have been killed in New York City since 1980. Around the \nstate in the last seven years, local district attorneys have charged \nat least 14 people with killing witnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew York City prosecutors, wading through a sea of daily cases, admit \nthey have limited resources with which to maintain witness protection \nprograms. The programs in the city vary borough by borough, and \nstatewide some counties do not have them at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn New York City, \"you can't afford to put people up in a hotel and \nhave armed guards for them in every case,\" said Anthony J. Schepis, \nan executive assistant district attorney in the Bronx, \"because there \njust are not the resources.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, would not \npersonally answer questions about the killing of Bobby Gibson. Other \nprosecutors in his office provided partial accounts. The last \nprosecutor to meet with Bobby Gibson  they met barely a day before \nthe trial was to start after the case was handed off by another \nmember of Mr. Hynes's office  prepared a memorandum about his \nlast-minute substitution, parts of which were read to a reporter.\u0014\n\u0014\nSenior police officials in Brooklyn defended their performance, and \nsaid, in a claim dismissed by prosecutors, that they did not think \nBobby Gibson's killing was connected to his scheduled testimony.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, numerous witnesses, including the three teenage girls, \ndid testify and helped to convict the schoolyard killer. But the \nwitnesses, and more than a dozen other friends and relatives, remain \nin hiding as the trial nears in the killing of Bobby Gibson. \nProsecutors asked that the three girls be identified only by their \nnicknames  Naia, Mookie and Quanna.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the witnesses' detailed testimony  including the girls' \ndescriptions of threats and bribes, and the claim that their anxiety \nwas ignored  is a matter of public record, and was used to piece \ntogether the story of Bobby Gibson's killing. The girls' decision to \ntestify was reported in an article by The Associated Press last fall.\u0014\n\u0014\nSylvia Gibson, Bobby's mother, has notified the city that she intends \nto sue over the death of her son. Bobby Gibson was a product of some \nrough Brooklyn streets, but he had a job, girlfriends and, his mother \nsaid, a determination to stand up after his friend was gunned down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe system, she said, failed him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"All they wanted was his testimony,\" she said of prosecutors. \"They \nweren't concerned with his safety. They were just trying to make \ntheir case.\"\u0014\nIt Started With a Slap\u0014\nThe path to two murders began on an August night in 2001, in the \nschoolyard behind Public School 23 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. A teenage \ngirl said something to a hotheaded 20-year-old, who did something \nstupid. \"I smacked her,\" the young man, Corey Brown, later testified. \nThen he smacked her friend.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the worn Brooklyn neighborhood, near the corner of Tompkins and \nWilloughby Avenues, people call the blacktop behind the school a \npark. On summer nights, young people gathered on the benches  some \nharmless kids, others with criminal records and gang affiliations. \nThere was liquor and marijuana, cheap talk and short tempers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three teenage girls were best friends and schoolyard regulars. \nBobby Gibson was one of the regulars, too. A 10th-grade dropout, he \nwas a slender young man with earnest brown eyes and a job at a \nMcDonald's on Fulton Street. He was known by his middle name, Kareem, \nor K for short, a name given to him by his mother after the \nbasketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\u0014\n\u0014\nBobby had moved to Crown Heights after growing up in the \nneighborhood. But he always came back  to his friends, to the \nschoolyard, to the trouble that could unfold there.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis best friend was Corey Brown. Corey had an ominous street name  \nSlay  and an older brother, Dennis. The brothers, both round in the \nface with gap-toothed smiles, were often mistaken for each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople told Dennis he looked like the heavyset, doomed character \nDoughboy in John Singleton's film \"Boyz N the Hood.\" Everyone called \nhim Doughboy. He took to the name, and tattooed it on his right arm.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the schoolyard that August night, Corey Brown was drunk, as usual. \nOne girl told him to get away, and he slapped her. He smacked a \nsecond girl, too  the girlfriend of a 17-year-old from the \nneighborhood, Corey McCullough. The two Coreys tussled. Corey \nMcCullough did not have a reputation for toughness  prosecutors \nthemselves later referred to him as \"the Lamb\"  but he had his pride.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks later, the prosecutors said, the Lamb brought his wounded \npride back to the schoolyard. He did not come alone.\u0014\nThe Killing of Doughboy Brown\u0014\nIt was dusk. The summer days were beginning to shorten. Bobby and the \nothers were at the benches. Corey Brown was there, with Doughboy.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo young men, one dressed in black, came into the schoolyard. They \nwere on bikes. It was Sept. 4, 2001\u0014\n.\u0014\nOn one bike was Corey McCullough. On the other was Wesley Sykes. He \nhad been shot in the face at age 16 and left with a glass eye  an \neye that to everyone looked white, somehow dead. He was 21, and from \na nearby housing project.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe testimony from witnesses was exacting about what happened next: \nWesley Sykes, a black baseball cap low on his head, studied the group \nof regulars. He made a circle on his bike and then returned. \"I felt \nsomething wasn't right,\" said one witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nBobby Gibson picked up the narrative for investigators: \"The pace on \nthe bike,\" he said in a tape-recorded interview, \"was getting slower \nand slower, and he looked, looked at every one of us on the bench, \nstaring for a while.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were whispered comments between the bike riders. Then, \naccording to trial testimony, Wesley Sykes, his distinctive dead eye \ncatching the attention of everyone on the benches, said something \nabout disrespect, got off his bike, and pulled a black gun from his \njeans.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe pointed it toward Corey Brown. Then, one of the schoolyard \nregulars testified, he pointed it toward Doughboy, as if confused. \nThe brothers were next to each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoughboy put his hands up. \"Yo, son. I don't know what you talking \nabout,\" he said. \"It's not me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo bullets tore into his stomach. Wesley Sykes fired into the \nfleeing crowd. Corey Brown ran as well, but then returned. He dropped \nto the ground, he later testified, took his bleeding brother in his \narms and asked him, \"Was you hit?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He just told me his stomach was burning,\" Corey Brown testified.\u0014\n\u0014\nNine operations over the next 23 days could not save Doughboy, and he \ndied at Bellevue Hospital Center on Sept. 27, 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat October, Wesley Sykes was arrested in the killing of Doughboy \nBrown. The police had each of the men in a lineup wear an eye patch \nso the flash of white beneath Wesley Sykes's drooping eyelid would \nnot give him away. Five witnesses identified Wesley Sykes as the \nkiller that day: the three teenage girls, Corey Brown and Bobby \nGibson.\u0014\nThe Intimidation Problem\u0014\nNo one knows how many criminal cases evaporate because witnesses are \nthreatened or assaulted. But if the prosecutors are right about what \nhappened to Bobby Gibson, the case brings to light a seldom-seen \ndefiance of the system. Some prosecutors acknowledge that fear among \nwitnesses is a staple of their work lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We deal with it every day of the week, seven days a week,\" said \nMichael J. Mansfield, an executive assistant Queens district attorney \nwho is in charge of his office's witness protection program. A rare \nreport from 1990 by Victim Services, a nonprofit agency, found that \n36 percent of victims and witnesses in cases in Bronx Criminal Court \nsaid they had been threatened\u0014\n.\u0014\nTellingly, a United States Department of Justice study this year \nfound that nationally, only about half of violent crimes committed \nagainst people 12 and older are reported. The report provided \nevidence of fear's effect on victims and other witnesses, said Susan \nHerman, executive director of the National Center for Victims of \nCrime, in Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If people felt they could rely on police and prosecutors for basic \nprotection,\" she said, \"you wouldn't have so many people opting out \nof the system.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, a 1995 Justice Department study said prosecutors reported \nthat intimidation was present in 75 to 100 percent of cases in some \nneighborhoods where gangs are prevalent. It also said that \nprosecutors in 18 urban areas during that period of higher crime \nrates said violent acts of intimidation, including homicides, \nkneecappings and beatings, occurred regularly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Many cases do not go forward, because the victim does not come in,\" \nsaid Mr. Schepis, the Bronx prosecutor.\u0014\nAn Unwelcome Visitor\u0014\nIt wasn't long after Doughboy's death, with the trial of Wesley Sykes \nstill months off, that Bobby Gibson began to get menacing messages. \nThe girls from the schoolyard brought them, his mother said. Dupree \nHarris, Wesley Sykes's half brother, wanted to speak to Bobby.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 240 pounds, Dupree Harris was an imposing hulk of a man. He had a \nbig face and a black mustache. He also had a half-dozen aliases and a \nstreet name, Turf. The police had identified him as a local Bloods \ngang leader, and he had twice been imprisoned.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurf, 28, had been arrested on gun, drug and robbery charges. He had \nalso been arrested in the 1993 killing of a man who had been shot in \nthe head, although the charges were eventually dropped. The summer of \nthe schoolyard shooting, though, the police in Brooklyn were \ninvestigating him in a second murder, from 1999. In that case, they \nsay, he shot a 23-year-old man in the heart in an argument over a \ngirl.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the streets, as 2001 faded and the trial loomed, the girls, Bobby \nand Corey heard about Turf's reputation. The streets, the girls later \ntestified, were awash in rumors that Turf had stayed out of prison \nfor a brutally straightforward reason: He killed witnesses. Turf \nflatly denies this.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls testified that Turf made his first contact through an \nintermediary. The girls said the contact was not subtle: \"Talk to him \nbecause if you don't take the money, you're going to die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTurf, the girls said, then began visiting them. \"He was coming like \nevery day, every other day, telling us what to say,\" Naia testified. \nIn time, the girls testified, he gave them a total of $2,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurf was soft-spoken. He was persuasive. He began correcting the \nversion of events they had given officials. \"He told me,\" Mookie \ntestified, \"that I made a mistake when I said I think the boy has a \nglass eye.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBobby Gibson told friends that the demand that he stay quiet had been \ndelivered to him more emphatically. Corey Brown, his best friend, \nsaid Bobby had told him he was stopped in the neighborhood one day by \na young man he had never seen before. The man, Corey said, pulled a \ngun on Bobby, said nothing and then departed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Bobby's mother said, the girls kept suggesting that Bobby \nmeet Turf. Throughout, Bobby's mother said, he told the girls to stop \nbringing him messages.\u0014",

After \nJoan's capture by the English army, this behavior led to her \nconviction on charges of heresy. Heretics who repented, however, were \nnot executed, so Joan signed a pledge never to dress as a man again. \nA few days later, she awoke in her cell to find her dress missing and \nonly men's clothes available. She had to wear them. Now the English \nhad proof that Joan had relapsed--the proof they needed to put her to \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a heretic, Joan's claim that God had authorized her mission to \nfree France from English rule would be considered false and Charles \nVII's claim to the French throne would be discredited. The English \nalso knew that only Joan's death would ensure that she could never \nagain rally support for the French cause. During a four-month trial, \nscores of charges were leveled against the 19-year-old, including \nwitchcraft. Although there was little evidence, the hostile jury \nfound Joan guilty.\u0014\n\u0014\nHundreds of people gathered to witness her execution on May 30, 1431. \nBefore she was burned at the stake, Joan knelt before the crowd and \nasked for their prayers. She also forgave everyone who conspired in \nher death. She would have spoken longer, but the English soldiers \ngrew impatient and dragged her to the pyre.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pious young girl who heard the voices of angels was not allowed a \nChristian burial. Instead, her ashes were scattered into the river \nSeine. But her memory continued to inspire her countrymen, who \nsucceeded in driving the English out of France a decade later. In the \nultimate irony, Joan of Arc, heretic, was canonized in 1920.\u0014",

    "words": "A few years ago, Joel Gregory became the pastor of First Baptist \nChurch of Dallas, an impressive congregation with almost thirty \nthousand members. It was the crowning achievement of his career. \nFirst Baptist Church occupies five city blocks in downtown Dallas. It \nhouses two schools, a college, and a radio station. The church gave \nhim a nice home, memberships in exclusive country clubs, and luxury \nbox seats for Dallas Cowboys football games. They weren't box seats \nfor the kingdom, but in Dallas a box seat for one is as good as a box \nseat for another.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut something went wrong in Gregory's pastorate. Church leaders \nwanted more members; thirty thousand weren't enough. People wanted \nthe physical plant to grow; five city blocks wasn't big enough. Most \nof all, everyone expected Gregory to tag along behind his \npredecessor, W. A. Criswell, who had served that congregation for 46 \nyears and who, despite his announcements to the contrary, showed no \nsigns of retiring. \"There wasn't room for both of us,\" Joel Gregory \nsaid. \"The whole zoo of human ambition and power and ego is the \nfabric of some super churches.\" A power struggle began, dividing the \nchurch into opposing sides. One day in September 1992, Gregory \nstunned many Southern Baptists by resigning from that prominent \npulpit.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday he travels through Fort Worth neighborhoods as a door-to-door \nsalesman. A lot of people say he's a failure. Joel Gregory says \notherwise. \"For the first hobbes's in my life, at 46, I'm learning \nwhat it means to be a servant,\" he says. \"It gives me a different \nview of Christ, and a different view of the real needs of human \nbeings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said, \"Are you able to drink my cup? Are you able to share my \nbaptism? Are you able to walk with me, giving yourself to others in a \nlife of service?\" If we dare say yes, we must remember the road of \ndiscipleship is uphill all the way, and it leads to the foot of the \ncross. Whoever would follow Jesus must follow him there. He never \npromised anything else.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam G. Carter, No Box Seats In The Kingdom, CSS Publishing, Lima, \nOhio, 1996.\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES MADISON -- BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "It's tough to write a compelling biography of Madison: though a great \npolitician, he was also a provincial, cerebral and slightly dull man;\u0014\n                     any account of his life must contain the kinds \nof dry legislation the Non-Intercourse Act, Macon's Bill Number 2, \nfor example that have\u0014\n                     driven generations of history students to \ndistraction. But Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Wills does as good \na job as possible in this brief\u0014\n                     volume, the latest addition to a series on the \nnation's presidents edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. With prior \nstudies of Washington,\u0014\n                     Jefferson and other Framers (including Madison) \nunder his belt, Wills is well acquainted with his subject and \nbalanced in his assessments.\u0014\n                     Madison, \"this unimpressive little man with \nlibraries in his brain,\" was the \"Father of the Constitution\" and the \nnation's fourth president. But\u0014\n                     during an extraordinary four-decade public \ncareer, Madison also guided Washington and Jefferson in their \npresidencies; steered the\u0014\n                     pioneering Virginia Statute for Religious \nFreedom through that state's legislature in 1786 and the Bill of \nRights through Congress; and\u0014\n                     helped Jefferson found the Democratic Party. But \nfor all Madison's greatness, Wills nevertheless (and justifiably) \njudges him nave,\u0014\n                     inconsistent, occasionally dishonest, prone to \nsniff conspiracy in any opposition, and, like so many Southerners of \nthe time, deaf to and\u0014\n                     finally paralyzed by slavery. Moreover, although \nhe was a first-class committeeman, he lacked executive talent. His \npresidency was a\u0014\n                     near disaster and he narrowly averted defeat in \nthe War of 1812. To Madison's credit, unlike other wartime \npresidents, he didn't stretch\u0014\n                     the Constitution or invade civil liberties. \nMadison had \"the strength of his weaknesses,\" concludes Wills in this \nfine, short biography of one\u0014\n                     of the nation's greatest public servants. \u0014\n                     Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Library Journal\u0014\n                     In this work one of the first in a new series \nbeing published under the general editorship of Schlesinger Pulitzer \nPrize-winning historian\u0014\n                     Wills (e.g., Lincoln at Gettysburg, 1992) does \nnot attempt to offer a complete biography of Madison. Rather, he sets \nout to solve a\u0014\n                     mystery: how could Madison have been such a \nspectacularly important Founding Father and later just a slightly \nabove average\u0014\n                     President? Wills provides a thoroughly \nsatisfying answer. He maintains that Madison possessed qualities that \nserved him well early in his\u0014\n                     career but proved to be a handicap during his \nPresidency. For example, his superior skills as a legislator were not \nwhat he needed to\u0014\n                     face the crises of his presidential years, when \npersonal charisma, social charms, and a wider vision would have been \nmore useful.\u0014\n                     Moreover, Madison's parochialism (reflected in \nhis aversion to traveling outside his beloved Virginia) made him \ngreatly misjudge Britain\u0014\n                     in the War of 1812. Written with flair, this \nclear and balanced account is based on a sure handling of the \nmaterial. It should appeal to\u0014\n                     general readers as well as specialists. Highly \nrecommended for all libraries. T.J. Schaeper, St. Bonaventure Univ., \nNY \u0014\n                     Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \u0014\n                     In this biography, Garry Wills takes a harsh \nlook at an early president and shaper of the U.S. Constitution. James \nMadison, who led the\u0014\n                     nation in its first foreign war, the War of \n1812, was a rare wartime leader who is not ranked among our nation's \ntop presidents, Wills\u0014\n                     writes. Here, Wills sets out to articulate why, \ndetailing Madison's personal flaws, the political climate he faced, \nand the often questionable\u0014\n                     decisions he made because of these influences. \nAlthough often critical, Wills ultimately reaches a balanced \nassessment of Madison's\u0014\n                     career. Ira Claffey reads with the necessary \ndetachment. Most interesting is the glimpse of how personality has \nalways shaped politics,\u0014\n                     not just in the TV age. J.A.S.

    "title": "JOHN LELAND, JOSEPH SMITH AND 21ST CENTURY PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS",
    "words": "Over two centuries after the Baptist-infused First Amendment became \nthe law of the land, the United States seems unable to move beyond \npublic religious tests of presidential candidates. Otherwise \nlevel-headed Baptists fell into this trap in the twentieth century, \nopposing Roman Catholic presidential candidates solely on the grounds \nof the candidates faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Baptists knew better. In 1794, some three decades before a \ntreasure-seeker named Joseph Smith claimed a revelation from God in \nthe form of golden plates, the famed Baptist evangelist John Leland, \nechoing American Baptist founder Roger Williams, declared that it \nmakes no difference in the public or political sphere if a man \nworships one God, three Gods, twenty Gods, or no God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early decades of the American nation, to the chagrin of many \nChristians, several Deists were elected to the presidency. Today, \nMormonism is under political scrutiny as twice-presidential candidate \nMitt Romney is berated by many Christians for his Mormon (Latter Day \nSaints) faith, a religion frequently referred to by some Christians \nas a cult. In response to these charges, Latter Day Saints \nofficials openly affirm that Mormonism is not orthodox Christianity \nand that Mormon doctrine is, instead, grounded in biblical teachings \nas confirmed by the witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorically, enmity between Christians and Mormons has existed since \nMormon founder Joseph Smith declared Christianity to be an \nabomination in his [Gods] sight; that those professors [Christian \nbelievers] were all corrupt; that: they draw near to me with their \nlips, but their hearts are far from me. (Joseph Smith, History, \n\\1:19) Because Christianity was false, God instructed Smith to \nrestore the true church. Contemporary Mormons affirm these \ndeclarations of Joseph Smith as divine teaching. In order to be \nconsidered a full-fledged (temple-worthy) Mormon, one must personally \nembrace Joseph Smiths revelation of the apostasy of Christianity and \nhold to the exclusive truthfulness of the Mormon faith (of the \nlatter, some Baptists have historically been guilty of claiming the \nBaptist faith as the one truth faith). Mormonisms claim to exclusive \ntruth is manifested in the ordinance of baptism for the dead (one of \ntwo temple rites, the other being eternal marriage) performed on \nbehalf of non-Mormons (or Gentiles) as the only way non-Latter Day \nSaints can obtain salvation. (In recent years, the Roman Catholic \nChurch has criticized the Mormon practice of baptism for the dead.)\u0014\n\u0014\nA further source of friction between the two faiths is the Mormon \nbelief in henotheism, a form of polytheism that is characterized by \nthe worship of one God among many recognized Gods. In Mormon \ntheology, faithful adherents are Gods-in-the-making. Men and women \nwho are faithful in receiving the necessary ordinances, keeping their \ncovenants, and obeying Gods commands will enter into their \nexaltation and become as God. (The Guide to the Scriptures: \nGodhood, Man) This doctrine of Mormon theology is called Exaltation, \ndefined as eternal lifethe kind of life God lives. Heavenly \nFathers plan enables his children to return to live with Him forever \nas exalted beings, ultimately becoming gods.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as John Leland and other Baptists of yesteryear would say  so \nwhat? Whether Mormonism is a cult (as Baptists were once considered \nby many) or not, or the declarations of Joseph Smith are true (or \nnot), should be irrelevant in American politics. The United States is \na secular nation founded upon the separation of church and state, our \nlaws making no distinction between monotheists, polytheists, and \natheists. Thus, the personal faith of any given presidential \ncontender is a non-issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was a concern to Baptists of old, and should be a concern of all \nAmericans today, is whether or not a given candidate is committed to \nthe separation of church and state. Tragically, though, many \ncandidates today are pressed by the Religious Right to deny church \nstate separation or, at the least, to castrate the concept by \nadvocating government favoritism of a particular faith. The platform \nof the Texas Republican Party, for example, declares: We pledge our \ninfluence  toward dispelling the myth of separation of church and \nstate.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome two centuries ago, Baptists rejoiced in the presidency of Thomas \nJefferson, a man considered by many other Christians as an atheist \n(he was more properly a Deist), because Jefferson was their staunch \nally in church state separation. Todays Baptists can  as citizens  \nbest serve their country by remaining true to their four-century \nheritage of church state separation.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Bruce Gorley\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptist History and Heritage Society\u0014",

It's easy if you try.\u0014\n\u0014\nA molar from the Beatle legend's mouth will go on the auction block \nnext month, and the reserve price has been set at $16,000.

    "title": "JOSEPH MOHR'S FAMOUS \"SILENT NIGHT\" CAROL",
    "words": "December 11, 1792 \u0014\nJoseph Mohr's Famous \"Silent Night\" Carol\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was an illegitimate child--his mother's third. A child who might \nhave been a casualty of abortion in today's world, grew up to have a \nname that will forever be associated with the Christmas season.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents of history remember that in 1792, King Louis XVI of France \nwent on trial for treason before the Revolutionary Convention that \nhad replaced the French National Assembly. His head would roll the \nfollowing January. But on this day, December 11, 1792, a few days \nbefore Christmas--the same day, in fact, that the French king faced \nhis cruel judges--a much quieter event took place. Joseph Mohr was \nborn in Salzburg. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of his birth, it appeared his name would be associated \nwith nothing but disgrace. When Franz Joseph Mohr learned he'd gotten \nAnn Schoiber pregnant, he fled the home and deserted the army, \nleaving the mother to face the music alone, including a steep fine. \nShe was a knitter who earned little. It would have taken her a full \nyear's wage to pay the penalty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe town's brutal executioner stepped into the picture. He would pay \nthe fine and become the child's godfather. He hoped by doing this to \nimprove his own reputation. But little Joseph's life now bore another \nstigma: godson of the feared and hated executioner. He was banned \nfrom attending school or learning a trade, or even from holding a job.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe loved to sing. While playing on steps leading up to a Capuchin \nmonastery, he was overheard singing by Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, a \nBenedictine monk and cathedral choirmaster. Hiernle thought the boy's \nvoice so good, he could not bear to see it wasted. He found Ann \nSchoiber and arranged for Mohr to study with his elite group of \nstudents.\u0014\n\u0014\nHiernle's kindness was not wasted. Mohr proved to be an outstanding \npupil and mastered the organ, violin and guitar by the time he was \ntwelve. He always placed in the top quarter of the class. His \ntraining continued and he was ordained a priest in 1815.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of his life, he was assigned duties in many towns. \nBut it was while he was yet a young assistant in Oberndorf that he \nwon lasting fame. He wrote the words to a new Christmas carol and \nasked the church organist, Franz Gruber, to set them to music. On \nChristmas Eve, 1818, the two first sang what has since become the \nmost popular Christmas carol of all time: \"Silent Night, Holy Night.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Silent Night\" captures the awesome humility of a God who stooped not \njust to the level of mankind, but to the lowest level--born among \nanimals and announced to common shepherds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his last post, at Wagrain, Mohr opened a school which took in poor \nchildren. He gave virtually his entire income to this project and \ndied as poor as he was born. But he left us the riches of \"Silent \nNight\" which has been translated into 200 languages. Millions who \nhave never given a thought to Louis XVI sing Joseph Mohr's words \nevery Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur. Saints in Christian Art.

    "title": "JOHN WYCLIFFE ON HIS DEATH BED",
    "words": "December 30, 1384 \u0014\nJohn Wycliffe on His Death Bed\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWord that John Wycliffe was dying whipped like storm winds across \nEngland. Now on this day, December 30, 1384, clerics--many of them \nhis enemies--crowded into his room at Lutterworth. If they hoped to \nhear some last word or a recantation from him, they were \ndisappointed. John could not speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days earlier, he had grown numb and collapsed while saying mass. \nWhen he came to from this, his second stroke, he was paralyzed and \nunable to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was the most famous priest of his day. His learning was immense. \nHe had been a leading scholar at Oxford and a chaplain to the King of \nEngland. More to the point, he spoke out boldly against the errors of \nthe popes, the organizational hierarchy of the Roman Church, and the \ncorruption of the clergy in his day. He criticized not only the \norganization of the medieval church but its theology as well and \nargued for a return to the Scriptures. Pastors should live lives of \nsimplicity and holiness, he taught, shepherding their flocks \n(people)--not plundering them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the people in England were to know the truth, John reasoned that \nthey must have the Word of God in their own language. Under his \ndirection, the Bible was translated into English for the first time, \nalthough the job was not completed by his associates until 1395, \neleven years after his death. Repeatedly condemned and burned by \nchurch authorities, copies of Wycliffe's Bible continued in use for \nover a century, until printed Bibles took their place. This work \ngreatly influenced William Tyndale who made the first printed \ntranslation of the New Testament in English.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can still puzzle out the meaning of John Wycliffe's words. Here is \nhow he describes the transfiguration: \"And aftir sixe dayes Jhesus \ntook Petre, and James, and John and ledith [led] hem [them] by hem \nselve aloone in to an high hil ; and he is transfigurid before hem. \nAnd his clothis ben maad [were made] schynynge [shining] and white \nful moche [much] as snow, and which maner clothis a fullere [cloth \nworker], or walkere [worker] of cloth, may not make white on erthe. \nAnd Helye [Elijah] with Myses apperide [appeared] to hem, and thei \nweren [were] spekynge [speaking] with Jhesu.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe died of his stroke on the last day of the year. The \nreligious authorities had never excommunicated him because they \nfeared public opinion--the people loved John and his fame was \ninternational. So he was buried in consecrated soil. But about thirty \nyears later, the Council of Constance revenged itself on his \ncriticism by condemning his teachings and ordering his bones to be \ndug up and burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the burning of such a man's bones could not end his influence. As \nJohn Foxe said in his book of martyrs, \"though they digged up his \nbody, burnt his bones, and drowned his ashes, yet the Word of God and \nthe truth of his doctrine, with the fruit and success thereof, they \ncould not burn; which yet to this day...doth remain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from earlier Christian History Institute stories. \u0014\nBowie, Walter Russell.

    "title": "JOAN OF ARC, ENDURING POWER",
    "words": "JOAN OF ARC was born 600 years ago. Six centuries is a long time to \ncontinue to mark the birth of a girl who, according to her family and \nfriends, knew little more than spinning and watching over her \nfathers flocks. But type her name into Amazons search engine and \nyou get more than 6,000 results. Frances national archives include \ntens of thousands of volumes about her. She has been immortalized by \nShakespeare, Voltaire, Twain, Shaw, Brecht, Verdi, Tchaikovsky and \nRubens; more recently, her life was fodder for the CBS television \nseries Joan of Arcadia. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is it about Joan of Arc? Why is her story of enduring interest \nmore than a half a millennium after her birth? \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time Joan of Arc was 16 and had proclaimed herself the virgin \nwarrior sent by God to deliver France from her enemies, the English, \nshe had been receiving the counsel of angels for three years. Until \nthen, the voices she said she heard, speaking from over her right \nshoulder and accompanied by a great light, had been hers alone, a \nrapturous secret. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut in 1428, when the voices pressed her to undertake the quest for \nwhich they had been preparing her, they transformed a seemingly \nundistinguished peasant into a visionary heroine who defied every \nlimitation placed on a woman of the late Middle Ages. The least \nlikely of military leaders, Joan of Arc changed the course of the \nHundred Years War and of history. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoan said she sheared off her hair, dressed in male attire, put on \narmor and took up her sword at Gods behest. She was feverish in her \ndetermination to succeed at what was, by anyones measure, a \npreposterous mission. As Joan herself protested to her voices, she \nknew not how to ride or lead in war; and yet she roused an \nexhausted, underequipped and impotent army into a fervor that carried \nit from one unlikely victory to the next. She raised the siege of \nOrlans by defying the cautious strategies of seasoned generals to \nfollow inaudible directions from invisible beings. \u0014\n\u0014\nIlliterate and uncouth, Joan moved purposefully among nobles, bishops \nand royalty. So intent on vanquishing the enemy that she threatened \nher own men with violence, she herself recoiled at the idea of \nbloodshed. To avoid having to use her sword, she led her army \ncarrying a 12-foot-long banner emblazoned with the words Party of the \nKingdom of Heaven. Witnesses said she was luminous in battle, light \nnot glinting off her armor so much as radiating from the girl within. \nHer enemies spoke of clouds of butterflies following in her wake, a \ncuriously beatific report from men who said she was in league with \nthe devil. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the aftermath of combat she didnt celebrate victory but mourned \nthe casualties; her men remembered her on her knees weeping as she \nheld the head of a dying enemy soldier, urging him to confess his \nsins. Her courage outstripped that of seasoned men at arms; her tears \nflowed as readily as any other teenage girls. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a series of victories, Joan suffered the reversals her voices \nhad predicted. Captured and sold to the English, and shackled in a \ndank cell for more than a year, Joan was put on trial for her life. \nFor refusing to renounce the voices that guided her as deviltry, \nJoan, 19 years old, was burned at the stake before a jeering crowd, \nher charred body displayed to anyone who cared to examine it. Thirty \nyears later, in 1450, a Rehabilitation Trial overturned the guilty \nverdict that condemned her to death; the 19th-century rediscovery of \nthe transcripts from both trials resulted in her canonization in \n1920. \u0014\n\u0014\nLike all holy figures whose earthly existence separates them from the \nbroad mass of humanity, a saint is a story, and Joan of Arcs is like \nno other. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe self-proclaimed agent of Gods will, she wasnt immortalized so \nmuch as she entered the collective imagination as a living myth. \nCenturies after death, she has been embraced by Christians, \nfeminists, French nationalists, Mexican revolutionaries and even \nhairdressers. (Her crude cut inspired the bob flappers wore as a \nsymbol of independence from patriarchal strictures.) Her voices have \nbeen diagnosed retroactively as symptoms of schizophrenia, epilepsy, \neven tuberculosis. It seems Joan of Arc will never be laid to rest. \nIs this because stories we understand are stories we forget? \u0014\n\u0014\nJoan frustrates efforts to reduce her to mortal proportions. What can \nexplain what her voices told her, whether directing her movements in \nbattle or scripting answers to her inquisitors. And what about her \nreputed clairvoyance, accounts that her touch raised a child from the \ndead, her ability to direct the wind to fill her stalled boats \nsails? \u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont need narratives that rationalize human experience so much as \nthose that enlarge it with the breath of mystery. For as long as we \nlook to heroes for inspiration, to leaders whose vision lifts them \nabove our limited perspective, who cherish their values above their \nearthly lives, the story of Joan of Arc will remain one we remember, \nand celebrate. \u0014\n\u0014\nKathryn Harrison is writing a biography of Joan of Arc.\u0014\n January 5, 2012, New York Times\u0014",

    "words": "September 12, 1805 \u0014\nJohn J. Herzog's Huge Church Encyclopedia\u0014\nDan Graves, MS\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of a church-historian's valuable resources is theSchaff-Herzog \nEncyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. John Jacob Herzog--the Herzog of \nthe encyclopedia title--was born on this day, September 12, 1805, \nprobably in Basel, Switzerland. The Herzog family had recently moved \nthere from Wurtemburg.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was left an orphan at a young age and relatives raised him. He \nshowed himself an apt pupil of the sciences and then of theology, \nstudying with such notable individuals as the mathematician Christoph \nBernoulli and with theologians Schleiermacher and Neander. He became \nan educator at Lausanne, specializing in historical theology. John \nissued works on several of the major reformers, including Zwingli, \nCalvin and Ocolampadius.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian thought often needs defenders because scholarly and \npseudo-scholarly attacks never cease. John stood for the faith \nagainst damaging influences, including attempts to rewrite Christ's \nlife so as to rob Him of his deity. When Plymouth Brethren began \nspreading their message in Germany, John opposed them because he \nconsidered their teaching as too individualistic for the good of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the government made demands that overstepped the bounds of \nchurch and state, John refused to go along. He resigned his position \nat Lausanne and worked as a private scholar for much of 1846 and \n1847. He was glad to accept an invitation to teach at Halle, because \nhe had had little to live on during the previous months. At Halle, he \ndeveloped a close relationship with the well-known Protestant \ntheologian Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same year that John resigned his job at Lausanne, Roman Catholic \nscholars issued the first volume of the Catholic \nEncyclopedia.Protestants immediately felt the need to produce an \nencyclopedia of their own to counterbalance the Catholic version. \nPolitical troubles slowed down the project and its editor died. \nTholuck recommended Herzog for the vacant position.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was liked by all parties--in part because of his generous \ntreatment of Reformation figures. He got the job. His vast knowledge \nof church history made him the perfect editor. In fact, he wrote 500 \nof the articles that appeared in the first edition. Later, he was \nco-editor of a second edition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Schaff was well-acquainted with John, who asked him to adapt \nthe encyclopedia for American use. Schaff agreed to undertake the \nhuge project. And that is how we got the famous and useful \nSchaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge.

    "title": "JONATHAN GOFORTH WENT FORTH",
    "words": "September 13, 1888 \u0014\nJonathan Goforth Went Forth\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Goforth heard his call to evangelize while reading the \nmemoirs of the famed preacher Robert Murray McCheyne. A student at \nKnox College, Toronto, he offered himself for missionary service. \nOther Christian students found him too narrow and ragged him. \nConsequently, he vowed that he would go it alone and apart from his \nfamily; he remained a loner all his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Rosalind Bell-Smith became a Christian, she determined that she \nwould never marry a man who had anything less than her own complete \nzeal for the Lord. She was quite certain that she would recognize \nquickly the man for her. She met Jonathan Goforth and within a couple \ndays was quite sure. The two were married.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoforth's interest was in China. He attempted to join the China \nInland Mission, but decided that his Presbyterian thinking was \nincompatible with the Brethren ideas espoused by Hudson Taylor. And \nso, with the support of a newly-formed Presbyterian mission, he and \nhis wife set out for China in 1888 and settled temporarily in \nCheefoo. His appointed coworker, James Frazer Smith followed a few \nmonths behind. Two weeks after Smith arrived, on this day, September \n13, 1888, Goforth and Smith began a tour of the North Honan region of \nChina. This is where they intended to work, and they felt they must \nget a feel for the region.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorth Honan had flooded badly the year before and the damage was \nstill being addressed. Smith and Goforth observed first-hand the \nefforts to repair the breaches made by the Yellow River. Altogether \nthe two traveled over 1,200 miles, assessing the entire region. They \ngathered whatever data they could during their two and a half month \ntour and observed the Chinese in their home environment. In December \nmore missionaries arrived and soon four workers were busy translating \nand preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoforth had success in planting churches and was associated with \nrevival among Korean Christians in the early 1900s and with revival \nin Manchuria in 1908. The Presbyterians, however, dismissed him; and \nGoforth, Rosalind and their five children became missionary gypsies, \npreaching across China with no fixed abode.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor and Jonathan Goforth also clashed. Despite the great \nneed of all Chinese to hear of Christ, which no combination of \nmissions could hope to fully meet, Hudson Taylor issued a stiff \nprotest that Goforth was invading North Honan, a region he had \nearmarked for the China Inland Mission. Goforth respected Taylor's \nmethods and imitated them. However, neither he nor the Presbyterians \nsaw fit to comply with the great man's complaint. Thus Goforth indeed \nwent forth in the pages of Christian history as a great pioneer, but \nlike others also given unusual gifts, not always easy to get along \nwith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnderson, Gerald H.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions.

    "words": "September 14, 407 \u0014\nJohn Chrysostom Died on Forced March\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he spoke out boldly against the sins of Constantinople, John \nthe Patriarch of Constantinople found himself in exile in the Taurus \nmountains. Several of the elite had taken offense at his sermons \nwhich showed up their shame. Among them was the Empress Eudoxia, who \npulled strings to get him banished.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe winter before his death, John suffered dreadfully in the \nmountains. No amount of wood on the fire and no pile of blankets on \nhis bed kept his shivering body warm. Still he wrote strong letters \nto the people under his care. Trained as a lawyer, his letters and \nsermons were masterpieces of religious literature. Although he was \nabsent from them, church folk continued to take direction from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo John's enemies, his power still seemed to be too great, his \npresence still too close. Although he was old and frail, his health \nundermined by years of stern living, they decided to move him up by \nthe Euxine (Black) Sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey promised a reward to the guards who transferred him. The reward \nwould be increased according to how quickly they made the transfer. \nThere could not have been much doubt in the soldiers' minds that the \ncourt wanted John walked to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so his guards showed him little mercy. Relentlessly they hurried \nhis tottering legs forward. Movement was torture. Five miles beyond \nCamona in Pontus (now in Turkey) he spent his last night alive in a \nchurch dedicated to another martyr, Bishop Basiliscus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat night, Basiliscus supposedly appeared to John in a dream, \nassuring him that on the morrow they would meet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe soldiers refused permission for him to have his devotions at the \nshrine the next morning. They hurried him on his way. But they had \ngone only about three miles when it became apparent John was dying. \nThey took him back to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere, he asked for a white robe, which was given him. He gave away \nhis old clothes and surrounded by monks and nuns, raised himself up, \nsaying, \"Glory be to God for all things. Amen.\" Those were his last \nwords. He died on this day, September 14, 407.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after his death, the title \"Chrysostom,\" (golden mouth) was \nadded to his name. Eventually his remains were brought back to \nConstantinople where they received honor. He is remembered as one of \nthe greatest orators of all history, a saint honored in many \nchurches.

You football fans remember \nPerry. In a four-week period, he did the unthinkable. He stepped out \nof his role as a lineman and ran the ball successfully for yardage. \nHe even caught a pass for a touchdown. Then he ran for another \ntouchdown. It was the first time a defensive tackle had ever, in the \nhistory of football, been given the ball to carry to make a \ntouchdown. Sports fans were captivated by this extraordinary \nevent--which, for many people, put the fun back in football. Perry \nbecame a television star, appearing on the Tonight show, the \nToday show, and the nightly network news shows. There were as many \nas one hundred requests per day for endorsements, and an extra \n$750,000 in fees came his way. \u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile his mother said, I know he was good, but I don't think \nhe's that good.

That was on top of the $7 million in compensatory damages \\it \nawarded her on Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of \\New York, the Jehovahs \nWitnesses legal entity, is responsible for the entire punitive \ndamages amount and 40 percent of the compensatory damages, said Rick \nSimons, attorney for the plaintiff. Sixty percent of the \nccompensatory damages was assessed against Jonathan Kendrick, the man \naccused of abusing her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman sued Watchtower, the Fremont, Calif., congregation of \nJehovahs Witnesses and Kendrick in 2011. She contended church elders \nacting under the authority of Watchtower knew about the risk of child \nsex abuse in their midst but kept it secret.\u0014\n\u0014\nI once wanted to be the best Jehovahs Witness I could be.

    "words": "FRS: This account is highly suspect. \"Tradition\" is the source for \nmuch of this information.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugust 29, 28 \u0014\nJohn the Baptist Beheaded\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHerod Antipas smiled and nodded with approval. His step-daughter \nSalome* swayed and twirled in front of him and his birthday-party \nguests, her graceful figure filling them with longing. Her \nperformance done, Herod and the guests applauded. What a dance! \nInflamed by his senses and the mood of the moment, Herod cried, \"Ask \nme what you want--up to half my kingdom--and it is yours!\" And he \nswore a great oath to confirm his promise.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Tetrarch (ruler of one quarter of a Roman province) Herod was \nmore than able to provide a handsome gift even by first century \nstandards. Would Salome ask for a jeweled necklace? A dowry? A house? \nHerod and the guests waited to hear her request. The girl herself \nhesitated. Uncertain what to ask for, she whispered with her mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nDown in the dungeons of Herod's fortress (named Machaerus) a man's \nfate was about to be decided. John the Baptizer was under lock and \nkey in one of those gloomy holds. The cause was this: he had rebuked \nHerod for stealing another man's wife--Herodias. This woman had been \nmarried to Herod's quiet half-brother, Phillip. Herodias was furious, \nand convinced Herod to arrest John. Herod was only too willing; he \nwas suspicious of the large crowds John attracted.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, once Herod got John in his lockup, he talked with him and \nfound he liked the guy. He didn't understand what John was saying \nabout holiness and salvation, but it seemed to be something he should \nhear. Instead of executing John, he gave him visitation privileges. \nExecution would be a bad idea, anyway: John had a lot of followers; \nwhy make them mad and risk rebellion?\u0014\n\u0014\nSalome approached Herod. Evidently she had made up her mind. The \nguests and the king turned to hear what she would ask.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Give me now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter!\" said the \ngirl. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven that reckless, hardened lot must have drawn sharp breaths at the \ngruesome request. How quickly the indulgent mood melted. Did Herod's \nface change? Here was an awkward demand! Used to thinking of people \nas objects, used to beheading men at a whim, it never occurred to him \nto say, \"An incorruptible prophet like John the Baptizer is worth \nmore than my whole kingdom.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking around at his guests, he saw only one thing. If he was to \nsave face, he must fulfill his promise. He ordered the execution. \nAccording to a long-standing tradition, John was beheaded on this \nday, August 29, probably around the year A.D. 28.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat happened to John's head, we do not know. His disciples came and \nburied the body. Remains alleged to be his were later taken to \nAlexandria, Egypt and placed in a specially built church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen John's cousin Jesus heard the news, it hit him as hard as it \nwould any of us. He tried to get away by himself for a time. John, \nwho had preached Christ's coming and prepared for his messianic \nministry was needlessly dead in the prime of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have no sure knowledge of Salome's fate. Herod and Herodias stuck \ntogether, performing desperate and diabolical deeds until they died. \u0014\n\u0014\n* The name Salome is not biblical, but is given by tradition. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S.

    "words": "September 20, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nJury Convicts Amish Group of Hate Crimes\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ERIK ECKHOLM\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Mullet Sr., the domineering leader of a renegade Amish sect, \nand 15 of his followers were convicted on Thursday in Cleveland of \nfederal conspiracy and hate crimes for a series of bizarre beard- and \nhair-cutting attacks last fall that spread fear through the Amish of \neastern Ohio. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe convictions of Mr. Mullet, along with several relatives and \nothers from his settlement who carried out the assaults, could bring \nlengthy prison terms. The verdicts were a vindication for federal \nprosecutors, who made a risky decision to apply a 2009 federal \nhate-crimes law to the sects violent efforts to humiliate Amish \nrivals. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefense lawyers in the case and an independent legal expert had \nargued that the government was overreaching by turning a personal \nvendetta within the Amish community, and related attacks, into a \nfederal hate-crimes case. But the jury accepted the prosecutors \ndescription of the attacks as an effort to suppress the victims \npractice of religion, finding Mr. Mullet and the other defendants \nguilty on nearly all the multiple charges they faced of conspiracy, \nhate crimes and obstruction of justice. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe victims simply wanted to be left to practice their own religion \nin their own way in peace, said Steven M. Dettelbach, the United \nStates attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, in a news \nconference after the verdicts were announced. The defendants invaded \ntheir homes, physically attacked these people and sheared them almost \nlike animals, Mr. Dettelbach said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Mullet, 66, founder of a community near Bergholz, Ohio, and 15 \nfollowers, including six women, were tried for their roles in five \nseparate attacks last fall, involving assaults on nine people whom \nMr. Mullet had described as enemies. The jury heard three weeks of \ntestimony and deliberated more than four days before reaching a \nverdict at midday Thursday. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Mr. Mullet did not directly participate, prosecutors labeled \nhim the mastermind of the assaults, in which groups of his followers \ninvaded the homes of victims, threw them down and sheared their \nbeards and hair. Among the traditional Amish, mens long beards and \nwomens uncut hair are central to religious identity. \u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors argued that the attacks were intended to humiliate those \nwho questioned Mr. Mullets cultlike methods, which included forcing \nerrant followers to sleep in chicken coops and pressing married women \n including his own daughter-in-law  to accept his intimate sexual \ncounseling.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the victims had angered Mr. Mullet by refusing to honor his \nshunning decrees against his foes, calling them an improper use of \nhis power as a bishop and accepting those he sought to banish into \ntheir own churches. Other victims had moved out of his settlement and \nattacked him as a cult leader.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN THE BAPTIST",
    "words": "In all four canonical Gospels, Jesus begins his adult activities with \nJohn's baptism. How- \u0014\never, each Gospel presents the baptism account in a different way. \nFor Mark, John is a \u0014\npreacher of the end time who anchors the story of Jesus into the \nprophetic traditions of \u0014\nIsrael; this Gospel displays no difficulty in Jesus' submission to \nbaptism for repentance. For \u0014\nMatthew, Jesus and John debate the appropriateness of the baptism; \nJohn yields to Jesus' \u0014\ninsistence that the action is required \"to fulfill all righteousness\" \n(Mt 3.15). Luke depicts \u0014\nJesus as superior to John even prior to their births (Lk 1.39-44) and \ndescribes the baptism \u0014\nin the passive voice rather than highlighting the Baptist's \ninvolvement (\"when Jesus also had \u0014\nbeen baptized ... ,\" Lk 3.21). In John's account, likely the latest \nof the four, John the Baptist \u0014\nis presented as a witness to Jesus, but the baptism is not depicted \nJn 1.29-34). The Gospels \u0014\nalso indicate that John retained his disciples rather than, together \nwith his followers, joining \u0014\nJesus, and that John's disciples engaged in practices distinct from \nthose of Jesus. The Gospels' \u0014\nincreasing subordination of John to Jesus may well reflect conflict \nand debate between the \u0014\ntwo groups of followers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jewish historian Josephus corroborates the Gospels' testimony \nthat John spoke about \u0014\nrepentance and the remission of sins, that he gathered large crowds, \nand that he was executed \u0014\nby Herod Antipas. Antiquities of the Jews (Book 18) explains that \nJohn encouraged the Jews \u0014\nto lead righteous lives, to practice justice to others and piety \ntoward God and, once they had \u0014\nso oriented their lives, to submit to John's baptism. The ritual act \ndid not gain pardon for sins; \u0014\nrather, it was a consecration of the body which implied that the soul \nwas already cleansed. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's enormous popularity threatened the Galilean tetrarch, Herod \nAntipas. According to \u0014\nthe Gospels, Herod arrested John because of the Baptist's \ncondemnations of his marriage. \u0014\nJosephus provides background information. First, he notes that \nHerod's motivation was his \u0014\nfear that John's enormous popularity would eventually lead to \nsedition. Second, he states that \u0014\nby marrying Herodias, the wife of his half-brother, Herod rejected \nhis own first wife, the \u0014\ndaughter of Aretas, King of Nabataea. Understandably upset, Aretas \nwaged war against An- \u0014\ntipas and defeated his troops. According to Josephus, the destruction \nof Antipas's army ap- \u0014\npeared to many Jews to be divine vengeance for his execution of the \nBaptist.\u0014",

    "words": "Do you preach for the feet or the heart?\u0014\nBryan Loritts \u0014\n\u0014\nposted 11/19/12\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Jackson's rise to fame is the stuff of legend. He began in \nthe small town of Gary, Indiana. His father, Joseph Jackson, saw the \ngiftedness in Michael and his brothers at an early age and was \nobsessed with turning them into the greatest singing and dancing \ngroup of all time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis obsession with their success teetered on abuse. Joseph Jackson \nwould rush home from the steel mills, push the furniture to the \noutskirts of the living room, and demand that Michael and his \nbrothers relentlessly rehearse the routine. They would do so under \nthe watchful eye of Joseph Jackson, belt in hand, daring his children \nto miss a step. If they had the audacity to turn right when they \nshould have turned left, if they had the nerve to move forward when \nthey should have moved backwards, they could expect to experience the \nwrath of Joseph.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Jackson got his son's feet but never got his son's heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did Joseph's obsession produce? From a performance perspective, \nwe could deem Joseph to be a success. His relentless, abusive \ntechnique gave the world the greatest entertainer ever to work a \nstage. And yet, while he was successful as a manager, he was a \nfailure as a father. For while he got his kids' feet, he missed their \nhearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know this is true from the 2003 interview that journalist Martin \nBashir conducted with Michael Jackson at Neverland Ranch. For several \ndays Bashir talked to the 40-something Michael Jackson, and they \nreminisced on days gone by. They sat in Michael Jackson's theater and \nwatched video of Michael as a little kid, doing all the steps in the \ndance routine that his father obsessed over. What you may notice as \nyou watch this interview is that as Michael Jackson reflected on his \npast he never referred to his father as father or dad. Instead he \ncalled him Joseph.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Bashir picked up on this and said: Michael, I've spent several \ndays with you, and I've heard you talk about your dad. Why do you \nnever call your dad Dad? Why do you always call him Joseph?\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael said: From the time I was a little kid, my heart always \nlonged for dad, but all I ever got was Joseph.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Jackson got his son's feet but never got his son's heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Jackson in the Pulpit\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm concerned that many pulpits across our country are filled with \nspiritual Joseph Jacksons. They wield the Bible as if it's a belt, \ndemanding that their parishioners do the right steps: stop porn, give \nmoney, stop shacking up, put down the bottle.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, don't get me wrong. Is there a place for holiness? \\Hebrews \n12:14 says, \"Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to \nbe holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.\" Some postmodern \npreachers have a distorted view of grace. Anything that smacks of \nholiness or conviction we label as legalistic, and we use grace as \nlicense to do whatever we want. We need to hear the words of Paul, \nwho said, \"Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no \nmeans! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?\" (\\Romans \n6:1-2) So there is a place for holiness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEven so, \"Joseph Jackson\" preaching won't cut it. The Joseph Jacksons \nof the pulpit get to the people's feet but not their hearts. Such \npreaching is too low. \"Joseph Jackson\" preaching won't change the \npeople in your church.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou have folks in your church who want to change. You've got little \nMichael Jacksons in your church who long to change. You've got a \nsingle mother who longs to change. You've got a greedy couple whose \nhearts cry, Abba Father. But all they get is Joseph Jackson. What \nwill bring change is not a legalistic, Joseph Jackson approach to the \nScriptures, but rather an approach to the Scriptures that is so lofty \nand lifts up God so high that along the way it gets to the heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nfirst | prev| 2 of 2\u0014\nBryan Loritts is pastor of Fellowship Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee.\u0014",

    "words": "How Japanese Pilot at Pearl Harbor Became God's Samurai \u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat\u0014\nPosted: Friday, December 7, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nDec. 7, 1941, was a big day for Mitsuo Fuchida, a day he had long \nprepared for and looked forward to. For, you see, Fuchida was the \nlead pilot of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. And his life story \nis quite amazing. \u0014\n\u0014\nI have heard Fuchida's story from time to time through the years, \nmaybe first in 1954 when his article \"I Led the Attack on Pearl \nHarbor\" appeared in Reader's Digest, which I often read when I was in \nhigh school.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I have just finished reading for the first time a book that \nimpressively tells of his preparation for 12/7/41, his battles over \nthe next 3 years, and then the remarkable story of his becoming a \nChristian and an evangelist after the war.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book is titled \"God's Samurai: Lead Pilot at Pearl Harbor\" (1990).\u0014\n\u0014\nGordon W. Prange, professor of history at the University of Maryland, \nis the primary author of \"God's Samurai,\" but it was not published \nuntil 10 years after his death in 1980.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrange's manuscript, completed by two colleagues, was based mostly on \nhis extensive interviews of Fuchida in the mid-1960s.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrange and Fuchida first met in the late 1940s and had regular \ncontact with each other until Fuchida's death in 1976.\u0014\n\u0014\nLieutenant Fuchida was thrilled when he was chosen to lead the attack \non Pearl Harbor.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No moral qualms assailed him,\" according to Prange. So it was that \non the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Fuchida led the attack, triumphantly \nshouting over the radio to the other fighter planes following him as \nthey neared Pearl Harbor, \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(Tora, the Japanese word for tiger, was the code word indicating that \ncomplete surprise had been achieved. \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" was the \ntitle of a 1970 movie on the Pearl Harbor attack. Prange was a \ntechnical consultant during its production.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPrange remarks that after the attack Fuchida \"was filled with pride \nof his men and of himself, and from his standpoint he had every right \nto be. The airmen had succeeded beyond all expectation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next 150 pages narrate events in the Pacific War, detailing the \ninitial Japanese successes, the decisive battle of Midway that \nchanged the course of the war, and then the dropping of the atomic \nbombs and the subsequent end of the war.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was rather miraculous that Fuchida came through all that alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nA little over three years later in October 1948, Fuchida was handed a \nChristian tract near the famous Hachiko (a dog) statue in Tokyo.\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly a year later, he decided to become a Christian, and then \ncontacted the man whose name and address was on the tract. That man \nwas Timothy Pietsch, a missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was quite interested to see Prange's reference to Pietsch, for his \nwife, Helen, was the sister of Edwin Dozier. And Dozier was the \nchancellor of Seinan Gakuin in Japan when I became a faculty member \nof the university there in 1968.\u0014\n\u0014\n(Although I never met Pietsch, I have met his wife, Helen, and their \nson. And their grandson, Billy Pietsch, is one of my Facebook \nfriends.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter becoming a Christian, Fuchida soon began giving his testimony \nand later sailed with Timothy Pietsch to the United States where he \nspent several months, speaking in numerous churches and even being \ninterviewed by Billy Graham. That interview was telecast on Graham's \n\"Hour of Decision\" on Dec. 7, 1952.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Mitsuo Fuchida is a fascinating one, and Christians can \neasily understand why he has been called God's Samurai. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat was a missionary to Japan from 1966-2004 and is both \nprofessor emeritus of Seinan Gakuin University and pastor emeritus of \nFukuoka International Church.

    "title": "JESUS RELATING TO THE PHARISEES, FRIENDS AND FOES",
    "words": "LUKE 13:34-35\u0014\n\u0014\nThis text is one of several in Luke that indicate that many of the \nPharisees were friendly and supportive of the Jesus of history, and \nit is likely that many of them were. His message was also their \nmessage. In every instance in the Lukan account, however, the Lukan \nwriter arranged the context and the situation in such a way that the \nJesus of this Third Gospel turns against the Pharisees, denounces \nthem, and embarrasses his Pharisee hosts in front of their friends, \neven when Jesus is a dinner guest.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith regard to the lament over Jerusalem, it is likely that the \nspeaker here, as in Luke 11:49, was at one time the \"Wisdom of God,\" \na supra-historical hypostasis. After the divine Wisdom calls in vain \nfor men to follow her, she departs and will not return until the \nMessiah comes. Some followers of Jesus, possibly in \"Q\" material \ncommunities, may have seen in the resurrected Jesus the same \nqualities that had earlier been attributed to the \"Wisdom of God.\" \nThis association was probably particularly appropriate in \"Q\" \ncommunities with their interests in motifs that Richard Edwards in A \nTheology of Q (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1976, p. 84), identified as a) \neschatological hope, b) wisdom teaching about the present, and c) \neither a reference to the prophets as models and examples or the use \nof the prophetic-messenger forms of speech. In the text represented \nin Luke 11:49 and 13:34-35 the \"Q\" communities probably used wisdom \nand prophetic forms and images in presenting their case against Jews \nwho would not unite with them (Edwards, p. 133). Once the association \nof the Wisdom of God with Jesus had been made, the Matthean tradition \nplaced the account into a Jerusalem setting after the entry of Jesus \ninto the city and made Matthew 23:19 into a prophecy that the \ninhabitants of Jerusalem would not see Jesus again until they will \nsay, \"Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\" The \nLukan writer placed the account prior to the entry of Jesus into \nJerusalem and made it into a prediction that Jesus would not be \nkilled until he would enter the city of Jerusalem, but that once he \nwas there he would surely die at the hands of those whom he would \nhave liked to have gathered together as a hen gathers her chicks \nunder her wings to protect them from danger from predators. The \ninhabitants of the city would have to wait until Jesus would finally \ngo there and then they would say, \"Blessed is the one who comes in \nthe name of the Lord!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the association of the Wisdom hypostasis with Jesus had been \nmade, the lament became virulently anti-Jewish. Jerusalem was then \naccused of continuously killing the prophets and stoning the ones \nsent to her. The quotation based on Jeremiah 22:5 and 12:7 became \nexternal anti-Jewish condemnation, and Psalm 118:26 was given a \nvariety of new messianic possibilities. For more details about this \nreconstruction of the development of this tradition, see Barnabas \nLindars, New Testament Apologetic (London: SCM Press, 1961, pp. \n171-173).\u0014\n\u0014\nSince Luke 13:34-35 and Matthew 23:37-39 as they were developed \nwithin the early Church are viciously anti-Jewish with their unfair \ncondemnation of Jerusalem for killing its prophets and in their \nglorying in the forsaken and desolate condition of the people of \nJerusalem after 70 CE, other accounts from the Gospels should be used \ninstead of these in the Church today to demonstrate the love and \nconcern that the Jesus of history had for his fellow oppressed Jews. \nIf these texts are used, they should be redacted and addressed to the \nChristian people of God today self-critically, perhaps in words such \nas follows: \"O my people! O my people! How you have turned from me! \nHow many times have I wanted to gather together your children as a \nhen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you have not wanted me to \ndo this.\" A redaction of these verses that would reverse the process \nof their development within the early Church would put them back once \nmore into a series of sayings of Jesus such as they were when they \nwere circulated in \"Q\" materials.\u0014",

    "words": "Jewish Religious Groups When, following Alexanders conquest, \nHellenism challenged the thinking of the Near East, some Jews clung \nmore tenaciously than ever to the faith of their fathers, while \nothers were willing to adapt their thinking to the newer ideas \nemanating from Greece. Ultimately the clash between Hellenism and \nJudaism gave rise to a number of Jewish sects. \u0014\n\u0014\nPharisees The Pharisees were the spiritual descendants of the pious \nJews who had fought the Hellenizers in the days of the earlier \nMaccabees. The name Pharisee, separatist, was probably given them \nby their enemies to indicate that they were nonconformists. It may, \nhowever, have been used in scorn because their strictness separated \nthem from their fellow Jews as well as from the heathen. Loyalty to \ntruth sometimes produces pride and even hypocrisy, and it is this \nperversion of the earlier Pharisaic ideal that is denounced by Jesus. \nPaul reckoned himself a member of this orthodox group within the \nJudaism of his day (Phil. 3:5). \u0014\n\u0014\nSadducees The Sadducean party, probably named for Zadok, the high \npriest appointed by Solomon (1 Kings 2:35), denied the authority of \ntradition and looked with suspicion on all revelation later than the \nMosaic Law. They denied the doctrine of resurrection, and they did \nnot believe in the existence of angels or spirits (Acts 23:3). They \nwere largely people of wealth and position, and they cooperated \ngladly with the Hellenism of the day. In New Testament times they \ncontrolled the priesthood and the Temple ritual. The synagogue, on \nthe other hand, was the stronghold of the Pharisees. \u0014\n\u0014\nEssenes   Essenism was an ascetic reaction from the externalism of \nthe Pharisees and the worldliness of the Sadducees. The Essenes \nwithdrew from society and lived lives of asceticism and celibacy. \nThey gave attention to the reading and study of Scripture, prayer, \nand ceremonial cleansings. They held their possessions in common and \nwere known for their industry and piety. Both war and slavery were \ncontrary to their principles. The monastery at Qumran, near the caves \nin which the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, is thought by most scholars \nto have been an Essene center in the Judean wilderness. The scrolls \nindicate that members of the community had left the corrupt \ninfluences of the Judean towns to prepare, in the wilderness, the \nway of the Lord. They had faith in the coming Messiah and thought \nof themselves as the true Israel to whom He would come. \u0014\n\u0014\nScribes The Scribes were not, strictly speaking, a sect but rather \nmembers of a profession. They were, in the first instance, copyists \nof the law. They came to be regarded as the authorities on the \nScriptures, hence exercised a teaching function. Their thoughts were \nusually akin to those of the Pharisees, with whom they are frequently \nassociated in the New Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\nHerodians Herodians believed that the best interests of Judaism lay \nin cooperation with the Romans. Their name was taken from Herod the \nGreat, who sought to romanize the Palestine of his day. The Herodians \nwere more of a political party than a religious sect. Roman political \noppression, symbolized by Herod, and the religious reactions \nexpressed in the sectarian reactions within pre-Christian Judaism, \nprovided the historical framework into which Jesus came. Frustrations \nand conflicts prepared Israel for the advent of Gods Messiah, who \nappeared \"when the fulness of the time was come (Gal. 4:4).\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN HOWARD GRIFFIN'S STORY OF \"BLACK LIKE ME\"",
    "words": "The remarks below speak of Griffin's preparation to becoming a \"black \nman.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter getting blasted with shrapnel in an enemy air raid a few months \nbefore the end of the war, Griffin awoke in a hospital, seeing only \nshadows; eventually, he saw nothing. The experience was revealing. \nThe blind, he wrote, can only see the heart and intelligence of a \nman, and nothing in these things indicates in the slightest whether a \nman is white or black. Blindness also forced Griffin to find new \nstrengths and talents. Over the next decade, he converted to \nCatholicism, began giving lectures on Gregorian chants and music \nhistory, married and had the first of four children. He also \npublished two novels based on his wartime experience. Then in 1955, \nspinal malaria paralyzed his legs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlind and paraplegic, Griffin had reason to be bitter, yet his \ndeepening faith, based on his study of Thomas Aquinas and other \ntheologians, focused on the sufferings of the downtrodden. After \nrecovering from malaria, he was walking in his yard one afternoon \nwhen he saw a swirling redness. Within months, for reasons that were \nnever explained, his sight was fully restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nAcross the South in the summer of 1959, drinking fountains, \nrestaurants and lunch counters still carried signs reading, Whites \nOnly. Most Americans saw civil rights as a Southern problem, but \nGriffins theological studies had convinced him that racism was a \nhuman problem. If a white man became a Negro in the Deep South, he \nwrote on the first page of Black Like Me, what adjustments would he \nhave to make? Haunted by the idea, Griffin decided to cross the \ndivide. The only way I could see to bridge the gap between us, he \nwould write, was to become a Negro.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn acquaintance told Griffin the idea was crazy. (Youll get \nyourself killed fooling around down there.) But his wife, Elizabeth, \nbacked his plan. Soon Griffin was consulting a dermatologist, \nspending hours under sunlamps and taking a drug that was used to \ntreat vitiligo, a disease that whitened patches of skin. As he grew \ndarker day by day, Griffin used a stain to cover telltale spots, then \nshaved his head. Finally, his dermatologist shook his hand and said, \nNow you go into oblivion.\u0014\n\u0014\nOblivion proved worse than Griffin had imagined. Alone in New \nOrleans, he turned to a mirror. In the flood of light against white \ntile, the face and shoulders of a strangera fierce, bald, very dark \nNegroglared at me from the glass, he would write. He in no way \nresembled me. The transformation was total and shocking....I felt the \nbeginnings of a great loneliness.\u0014\n\u0014\nStepping outside, Griffin began his personal nightmare. Whites \navoided or scorned him. Applying for menial jobs, he met the ritual \nrudeness of Jim Crow. We dont want you people, a foreman told him. \nDont you understand that? Threatened by strangers, followed by \nthugs, he heard again and again the racial slur for which he had been \nslapped as a boy. That word, he wrote, leaps out with electric \nclarity. You always hear it, and always it stings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRead more: \n\\http://www.SmithsOnianMag.coM/arts-culture/black-like-me-50-years-later.html#ixzz2Le0xbBaF\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Howard Griffin offered one of the most important contributions \nto the Civil Rights movement when his work Black Like Me was \npublished in 1960. Griffin approached his study on race relations in \nthe South by asking a very poignant question: \"If a white man became \na Negro in the Deep South, what adjustments would he have to make?.\" \nTo answer this question, Griffin shaved his head and had his skin \ntemporarily darkened by medical treatments and stain in order to \ntravel through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia \nas a black man.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGriffin had a deep understanding of discrimination even before he \nbegan this ambitious project. As a medic in the French Resistance \nArmy, Griffin helped evacuate Austrian Jews away from the advancing \nNazis. During the Second World War, Griffin lost his sight and was \nforced to live with this disability for over ten years. By 1959, \nGriffin was a published author and a specialist on race relations. \nDespite such credentials Griffin \"really knew nothing of the Negro's \nreal problem.\" Only by becoming black did Griffin understand what it \nwas like to live as a second class citizen in \"the land of the free.\"\u0014\nAs a black man, Griffin described the variations and similarities of \nrace relations in different areas of the South. Although some states \nwere more \"enlightened\" than others, blatant acts of racism were \nfound almost everywhere Griffin went. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Alabama, where Martin Luther King first introduced passive \nresistance, Griffin endured the hate stares from whites and observed \nthat even graduates from Tuskegee Institute would not be allowed to \nclimb the social ladder in the South because, \"whites cannot lose to \na traditionally servant class.\" Finally, while traveling to the \notherwise enlightened city of Atlanta, the simple act of a bus driver \nsaying \"Watch your step\" as his passengers filed out was only \nreserved for whites.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEven more interesting than these experiences was the way in which \nGriffin was allowed to converse with blacks and whites on racial \nmatters. Understandably, blacks were highly suspicious of whites and \nwere often inclined to play \"the stereo-typed role of the 'good \nNegro'\" when around whites to survive in white southern society. As a \n\"black\" man, Griffin enjoyed a rare glimpse of how blacks really \nregarded segregation beyond the white propaganda. He also discovered \nthe ways in which blacks assisted and supported each other against \nthe perils of racism. In other cases, Griffin observed blacks who \nwere ashamed of their race and who would denounce other blacks for \ntheir darker skin or shabby clothes. As a \"black\" man, Griffin also \nsaw a side of whites that would otherwise be hidden if he had met \nthem as a fellow white man. His experiences with whites while \nhitchhiking through Mississippi are particularly intriguing. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his experiences, Griffin was surprisingly fair in his \nanalysis. While the reader may despise the hate-filled whites in his \nstory, Griffin did not stoop to the racist's level by denying them \ntheir humanity. Instead, Griffin made it a point to see the whites in \nother roles-as a parent, grandparent, church leader, and loyal \nneighbor. He also realized that whites who may have been sympathetic \ntowards their African American neighbors, were pressured by southern \nsociety to continue segregation. In his epilogue, Griffin was even \ncritical of fellow white freedom fighters who often failed to consult \nwith black community leaders on the race issue.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGriffin's work was a landmark for his time, but weaknesses in his \nstudy were present. Griffin visited the larger cities of the South; \nhowever, a comparison of race relations between the major cities and \nthe countryside may have created a more complete study as would a \nvisit to other states in the South. A better explanation was needed \nregarding Griffin's practice of alternating his role as a black man \nand a white man by scrubbing the stain off his skin. At first, the \nreader may assume that the author could no longer handle the \ndiscrimination and longed to enter the South as a first class citizen \nagain. Later, Griffin maintained that he was studying how the \nreactions of blacks and whites reversed themselves as he changed his \nskin color. Both reasons are valid; however, if a need to be white \nagain was the primary explanation than an important point was made: \nAn educated and worldly white man could barely survive in six weeks \nwhat a black person must endure every moment of his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Griffin only spends a month with dark skin, by the time you \nfinish the book it feels like an eternity.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS AND THE WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY",
    "words": "There's a story in the Gospel of John that I've always liked. Some of \nthe Pharisees who have it out for Jesus try to catch him in a trap. \nThey bring to him a woman who was \"caught in the act of adultery,\" \nand they ask Jesus what he thinks they should do with her. They tell \nhim that, as any good Jew knows, a woman committing adultery must be \nput to death, according to the Law that Moses gave them. After a \nmysterious episode of writing something unknown in the sand, Jesus \nboth agrees and challenges the woman's accusers. He says, in effect, \n\"Alright, this is what the Law says, and it is very noble of you to \nwant to honor the Law by stoning her. So we will do that. And we will \nstart with the one of us who is blameless and perfect. Who's first? \nPick up your stone.\" Apparently, this really aggravated and bested \nall of the religious accusers because, according to the gospel \naccount, all of them left, leaving Jesus and the woman there alone. \nIt's at this point Jesus utters one of his more famous sayings. \n\"Neither do I condemn you,\" he tells her. \"Go, and sin no more.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story centers around Jesus' declaration that he does not condemn \nthis woman. This is something that really resonates with me. Many of \nthe same passages of Scripture that condemn adultery as abominable \nalso condemn homosexuality. Anyone who is even slightly familiar with \nTorah or the Book of Romans would have to admit that both activities \nare regarded as sinful. Jesus, a first-century Rabbi, would have also \nheld this belief. And yet, when the abstract sin is given a human \nface, Jesus responds with acceptance and mercy, proving the truth of \nAlexander Pope's adage, \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\" It's \neasy to despise an idea. But give that idea a human body, beat her \nup, and toss her down on the sand in front of youdo this, and then \ntry to hate her. It's not that easy. \u0014\n\u0014\nBrandon Ambrosino Apr 4 2013   The Atlantic\u0014\nA former student a Liberty\u0014",

    "title": "JAMESTOWN SETTLERS RESORTED TO CANNIBALISM",
    "words": "Jamestown settlers resorted to cannibalism, archaeologists say\u0014\n\u0014\nBy The Associated Press \u0014\nMay 1, 2013  ABC News\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Scientists said Wednesday that they have found the \nfirst solid archaeological evidence that some of the earliest \nAmerican colonists at Jamestown, Va., survived harsh conditions by \nturning to cannibalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years, there have been tales of the starving English settlers \nresorting to eating dogs, mice, snakes and shoe leather at Jamestown, \nthe first permanent English settlement in America. There were also \nwritten accounts of settlers eating their own dead, but \narchaeologists had been skeptical of those stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now, the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and \narchaeologists from Jamestown are announcing the discovery of the \nbones of a 14-year-old girl that show clear signs that she was \ncannibalized. Evidence indicates clumsy chops to the body and head, \nand it appears the girl was already dead at the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmithsonian forensic anthropologist Douglas Owsley said the human \nremains date back to a deadly winter known as the \"starving time\" in \nJamestown from 1609 to 1610. Hundreds of colonists died during the \nperiod. Scientists have said the settlers likely arrived during the \nworst drought in 800 years, bringing a severe famine for the 6,000 \npeople who lived at Jamestown between 1607 and 1625.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe historical record is chilling. Early Jamestown colony leader \nGeorge Percy wrote of a \"world of miseries,\" that included digging up \ncorpses from their graves to eat when there was nothing else. \n\"Nothing was spared to maintain life,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one case, a man killed, \"salted,\" and began eating his pregnant \nwife. Both Percy and Capt. John Smith, the colony's most famous \nleader, documented the account in their writings. The man was later \nexecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One amongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten \npart of her before it was known, for which he was executed, as he \nwell deserved,\" Smith wrote. \"Now whether she was better roasted, \nboiled or carbonado'd (barbecued), I know not, but of such a dish as \npowdered wife I never heard of.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nArchaeologists at Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia \nwere somewhat skeptical of the stories of cannibalism in the past \nbecause there was no solid proof, until now.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Historians have questioned, well did it happen or not happen?\" \nOwsley said. \"And this is very convincing evidence that it did.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOwsley has been working with William Kelso, the chief archaeologist \nat Jamestown, since their first burial discovery in 1996.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe remains of the 14-year-old girl discovered in the summer of 2012 \nmarks the fourth burial of human remains uncovered at Jamestown. Her \nremains were found in a cellar at the site that had been filled with \ntrash, including bones of animals that had been consumed, according \nto archaeologists.\u0014\n\u0014\nOwsley, who has also done forensic analysis for police \ninvestigations, analyzed the girl's remains and how the body had been \ndismembered, including chops to the front and back of the head. The \ngirl was likely already dead at the time. There was a cultural stigma \nagainst killing someone for food, Owsley said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it was clear to him immediately that there were signs of \ncannibalism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is the evidence found on those bones that put it within the \ncontext of this time period,\" he said. \"This does represent a clear \ncase of dismemberment of the body and removing of tissues for \nconsumption.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the work of someone not skilled at butchering, Owsley said. \nThere was a sense of desperation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bones show a bizarre attempt to open the skull. Animal brains and \nfacial tissue would be considered accepted and desirable meat in the \n17th century, Owsley said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe human remains will be placed on display at Jamestown to explain \nthe \"starving time\" and the horrid conditions early settlers faced. \nAt the Smithsonian, curators will display a digital reconstruction of \nthe girl's face to explain the discovery in an exhibit about life at \nJamestown.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Smithsonian and Jamestown archaeologists are also publishing \ntheir findings in a book but decided against waiting to announce the \ndiscovery through a peer-reviewed journal.\u0014\n\u0014\nOwsley said archaeology is helping to fill in details from a time \nwhen few records were kept - details that won't likely be found in \nhistory books.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It provides a more personal glimpse into the lives and events that \nthese people experienced,\" he said. \"When you're dealing with 17th \ncentury sites like Jamestown, I think it really enhances what we know \nabout these people.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Acts 1:1-11\u0014\nJesus' Ascension In Acts\u0014\n\u0014\nThis passage occurs in all three annual cycles of the lectionary for \nthis day. After a brief prologue, in which Luke makes necessary \nconnections with the events of his gospel (vv. 1-5), he relates the \nstory of Jesus' ascension. He has already told this story once \nbefore, in Luke 24:50-53. In verses 6-7, he deals with the question \nof when Israel will be restored to its former glory. \"It is not for \nyou to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own \nauthority,\" he replies (v. 7). \u0014\n\u0014\nDon't become obsessed with crossing off dates on the calendar, he \nadvises. Learn how to wait in hope and expectation for God's time to \nbecome fulfilled. Verse 8 sets the scene for the gift of the Holy \nSpirit at Pentecost, clearly the most significant story Luke has to \ntell in these early chapters, and perhaps in the entire book. In full \nsight of all the disciples, Jesus is then lifted up, and \"a cloud \n[takes] him out of their sight\" (v. 9). Understandably, the disciples \ncontinue to gaze up into the sky. Two angelic figures appear, and \ngently chide the disciples for continuing to look up. \"This Jesus, \nwho has been taken up from you into heaven,\" they say, \"will come in \nthe same way as you saw him go into heaven\" (v. 11). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the ascension presents certain problems of comprehension for \npeople like us -- whose cosmology indicates that heaven is not \"up \nthere,\" above the dome of the firmament -- this was an extremely \nimportant story for the early church. Not only does it mark the \nconclusion of Jesus' ministry and the beginning of the era of the \nchurch, it suggests that Christ is now reigning over all and will one \nday return.\u0014",

I was sheltered from much of the reality and shaped by a \nsocial context that placed blame solely on \"troublemakers\" like \nMartin Luther King Jr.\u0014\n \u0014\nLiving in a community where African Americans were scarce and \nisolated led to little contact outside my small, white, \nblue-collared, baptized world.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the few personal experiences with the struggle for racial \nequality was the minor inconvenience caused by curfews in nearby \nChattanooga, Tenn., designed to stem rioting. We had to get home from \nKmart by the designated hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, any effort to raise the visibility of discrimination was \nviewed as troublemaking, if not rioting. All blame, according to the \nfamiliar narrative, rested with those seeking equality, never those \nwho denied it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, while younger moviegoers gasped at the use of strong racial slurs \nhurled at young Jackie Robinson in the movie \"42,\" it was sadly not \nshocking to those of us who heard such insults and insensitivity in \ndaily discussions decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, I wondered how the grandchildren of those baseball players, \ncoaches and executives felt about the ignorant and obstructionist \nways of their forebears.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr how do the offspring of those who turned water hoses and billy \nclubs on defenseless black citizens in Alabama feel today? Is \"thats \nthe just way things were back then\" enough of a response?\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the more constructive question for us is what are we saying \nand doing today that might cause those who spill out of our family \ntrees to shake their heads in amazement and shame at our ignorance \nand insensitivity?\u0014\n\u0014\nTake a young person to see \"42\" or to visit a civil rights site in \nBirmingham, Montgomery, Memphis or Atlanta  and then listen. Listen \ncarefully.\u0014\n\u0014\nExpect to hear an incredulous questioning of: \"How could people who \nclaimed to be good Christians act that way?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd dont give some flippant answer in an attempt to justify such \nhorrors. It doesnt help as much as confessing, \"I dont know; I just \ndont know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, we must keep moving to the present tense. What am I saying \nand doing today that someone else will someday struggle to reconcile \nwith the faith and goodness I claimed?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a question many dismiss with, \"but this one is different.\" And \nthen \"the Bible says\" gets thrown in for justification, as if that \nwasn't used to justify bad behavior before.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think about the three men representing the Georgia Baptist \nConvention who, a few years ago, paid a visit to the historic First \nBaptist Church of Decatur, Ga., that provides a wide and wonderful \nministry in that community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey warned the pastor that the convention would break ties with them \nfor one reason only  because she was a woman in a position of \nauthority reserved by God for men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the families of these men are not ashamed now, they should be (and \nmore so should these men). But I wonder, what will their \ngranddaughters or great-granddaughters think if they read the reports \nof that action years from now?\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, so many examples could follow. We are much too comfortable in \njustifying prejudices and discrimination.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, there are those who look back now with great pride \nat courageous and insightful relatives who stood for what was just \nand loving, even when it was against the grain of their culture. That \nmust be very gratifying.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the wholly sufficient reason for doing what is right is \nbecause it is right.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be found on the right side of history, when it comes to issues of \njustice and equality, is not some careful strategic plan to leave a \ngood legacy or reputation.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it sure doesnt hurt if we stand for truth, justice and love  \nand those who follow are glad we did.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn D. Pierce is executive editor of Baptists Today.\u0014",

Arriving in \n1768 with his family and 300 books for the college library, he threw \nhimself into the task of building up the young school. \"He laid the \nfoundation of a course of history in the college, and the principles \nof taste and the rules of good writing were both happily explained by \nhim, and exemplified in his manner,\" a colleague said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the Revolution approached, Witherspoon's Presbyterian belief that \npeople should choose their own government put him firmly on the \nPatriot side. He realized the colonies would have to fight Britain. \n\"If your cause is just, if your principles are pure, and if your \nconduct is prudent, you need not fear the multitude of opposing \nhosts,\" he preached. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Continental Congress, some delegates worried the country was \nnot yet ripe for independence. \"The country is not only ripe for the \nmeasure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it!\" Witherspoon \nretorted. He became the only minister to sign the Declaration of \nIndependence. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe lost a son in the Revolution, which also left the college in dire \nstraits. After the war he tackled the job of rebuilding the school. \n\"Do not live useless and die contemptible,\" he exhorted his students, \nwho included nine future cabinet officers, 21 senators, 39 \ncongressmen, three Supreme Court justices, 12 governors, a vice \npresident, and a presidentJames Madison, who was also one of five \nWitherspoon students at the Constitutional Convention.\"\u0014",

Kimel talks about the name God has given Himself \nin the pages of Scripture and why it is important: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Within Christian usage Father is not just one of many metaphors \nimported by fallen sinners onto the screen of eternity. It is a \nfilial, denominating title of address revealed in the person of the \neternal Son. 'On the lips of Jesus,' Wolfhart Pannenberg states, \n'Father became a proper name for God. It thus ceased to be simply one \ndesignation among others. It embraces every feature in the \nunderstanding of God which comes to light in the message of Jesus. It \nnames the divine Other in terms of whom Jesus saw Himself and to whom \nhe referred His disciples and hearers.' \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jesus names the Holy God of Israel Abba, Father, thereby expressing, \nand indeed effectuating, the intimate inner communion between them, a \nunique relationship of knowing and love. 'No one knows the Son except \nthe Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son' (Matt. \n11:27). By this historical address, God is acknowledged as the hope, \njoy, ultimate source and final authority in our Lord's life; by this \naddress, He is constituted as the Father. The dominical naming occurs \nwithin the being of the Godhead. It is an event of the divine \nbiography, an eternal act of self-differentiation occurring in time. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When uttered by the incarnate Word, Father (defined exclusively by \nChrist Himself in the totality of His filial existence) is a created, \nperformative word of eschatological poweranalogous, on a different \nlevel, to God's speaking forth the universe in Genesis 1which \neternally calls into being the One who loves His Son beyond all \nimaginings, beyond all conditions and limits.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest \nson of John Todd, Jr. and his wife, Dolley Payne, who is better known \nto history as Dolley Madison.

    "title": "JESUS AND SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "The Synoptic problem\u0014\n\u0014\nFor over two centuries scholars have been trying to determine the \nrelationship between the Gospels. Anyone who reads the Gospels \ncarefully will soon discover that Matthew, Mark and Luke have much in \ncommon but John is very different. With the exception of the feeding \nof the 5,000 and the walking on water, John has a completely \ndifferent set of miracle stories from the other three Gospels, which \nbecame known as the Synoptic Gospels (meaning they can be seen \ntogether). John is seen by most scholars as the latest of the \nGospels, and contains a great deal of theological reflection on such \nthemes as Jesus' pre-existence, incarnation and divinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis contrast is easily seen by considering how each Gospel begins. \nMark begins with the adult Jesus coming to John for baptism and \nexperiencing the descent of the Spirit, which empowers him for a \nministry of teaching and healing. Readers of Mark have no reason to \nthink that Jesus was anything 'special' before this event. In \ncontrast, both Matthew and Luke begin with two chapters of nativity \nstories that show that Jesus had a miraculous birth (by the Holy \nSpirit). This explains why he grew up to have a ministry of teaching \nand healing; he was 'special' from the moment of conception. However, \nwhile readers of Matthew and Luke have no reason to conclude that \nJesus had an existence before his birth, this is precisely what the \nopening chapter of John states. Jesus was in the beginning with God \nbut also 'became flesh and lived among us' (John 1:14). And it is \nfrom this perspective that John tells his story of Jesus, so that the \nmeaning of the words 'It is finished' is that Jesus came from God to \ndo the will of God and is now returning (John 17:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nNow while we are not to imagine that the Gospels represent three \nstages of theological development (Jesus as empowered human, Jesus as \nmiraculous human, Jesus as divine human), most scholars do believe \nthat Mark was the earliest Gospel (c. 65 ce), that it was followed by \nMatthew and Luke (c. 7585 ce) and that John was the latest (c. 95 \nce). The reasons for this can be found in most introductions to the \nGospels and need not detain us further. When applied to Jesus' final \nwords on the cross, this understanding suggests that Mark is closest \nto what Jesus actually said. This is reproduced by Matthew, except \nthat he changes the Aramaic saying ('Eloi, eloi') to the Hebrew \n('Eli, eli'), either because he thought it more apt that Jesus would \nquote the Hebrew text or because he thought it better explains the \nconfusion with the name 'Elijah' that follows. Luke has a different \npurpose for writing his Gospel and wishes to emphasize how Jesus \nlived his life in service for others. He thus substitutes for Psalm \n22:1 a different psalm of DavidPsalm 31:5. John is more concerned to \nshow that Jesus has fulfilled his mission, and has no interest in \nshowing that Jesus ended his life citing Scripture. For him, the \nwords 'It is finished' have more meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis I shall call the 'moderate' view. It accepts that real events \nlie behind the Gospel stories but believes that they have been \nembellished as each Gospel writer adapts the tradition to meet his \nreaders' needs. Thus Mark is known as the 'suffering Gospel' and \nseems to go out of its way to emphasize the suffering aspects of \nJesus' ministry. John is at the other end of the spectrum, \nemphasizing that what looked like suffering was in reality Jesus' \nvictory. Both are emphasizing those things their readers need to \nhear, but Mark's earlier date means that it is generally more \nreliable than John. The word 'generally' is important here. The \nearlier Gospels are generally more reliable than the later ones but \nthat does not mean that everything in the latter is unreliableit is \npossible that they sometimes had access to earlier sources that were \nunknown when the first Gospels were written.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a further feature of modern scholarship relevant to our \nstudy. Some 200 verses of Jesus' teaching are present in Matthew and \nLuke but not in Mark. These include such sayings as the Beatitudes \n('Blessed are the meek ?'), the Lord's prayer ('Our Father ?') and \ncertain parables, such as the marriage feast. Where did these sayings \ncome from and are they earlier or later than Mark's Gospel? Most \nscholars believe they come from a sayings collection that is referred \nto as 'Q' (from the German Quelle, source) and is a decade earlier \nthan Mark. Thus the traditional answer to the Synoptic problem is \nthat Matthew and Luke both expanded Mark by incorporating additional \nteaching from Q and material that was known only to them (designated \n'M' and 'L'). The 'moderate' view of Gospel study is that we can have \nsome confidence in sayings found in Mark and Q but need to exercise \ncaution with material found only in Mark or Luke (M and L), \nespecially if it appears to serve the main emphases of these Gospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore we embark on our study there is a third group of scholars that \nI will call 'minimalist'. By and large they agree with the analysis \npresented above but do not regard Mark as an accurate record of what \nJesus said and did, which has implications for the accuracy of \nMatthew and Luke. Their reasons go back to a book by William Wrede, a \nfamous German scholar active at the very beginning of the twentieth \ncentury. He challenged the consensus view that Mark's abrupt and \ncandid style was indicative of eyewitness testimony by showing that \nMark is pursuing a theological agenda just as much as the other \nGospels. For example, it was often said that stories that end with \nthe disciples misunderstanding Jesus would hardly have been invented \nby the early Church. But Wrede suggested that Mark goes out of his \nway to portray Jesus as misunderstood, in order to explain the \ndiscrepancy between what the first disciples believed and what the \nlater Church was proclaiming. For example, in Mark 8 the disciples \nare completely baffled as to how Jesus can feed a crowd of 4,000 with \na few loaves and fishes, but not long before thisMark 6they had \nseen Jesus feed a crowd of 5,000. Their lack of understanding is \nincomprehensible.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the key positions of modern 'minimalists' is that Jesus did \nnot predict the future destruction of the world and his own return to \nearth. This has commonly been taught in churches ('he will come again \nto judge the living and the dead') and appears to be the teaching of \nthe Synoptic Gospelssee Table I.2.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key argument for the authenticity of these 'apocalyptic' sayings \nis that the end of the world did not come within a generation and \nJesus has still not returned. Who then would have invented sayings \nthat in the 70s and 80s (Matthew and Luke), if not in the 60s (Mark), \nwould have been problematic? It was the argument of Albert Schweitzer \nthat Jesus believed that the end was nigh and that this is what gave \nthe urgency to his preaching (repent while there is still time). The \nfact that it did not happen is a tremendous testimony to the accuracy \nof the scribes, who transmitted these sayings even though they knew \nthey had not come true.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Jesus and Scripture (Logos  Bible Software online) by Steve \nMoyise\u0014\n\u0014\nSee this book for the fullest discussison of the subject\u0014",

    "words": "James Milton Black Wanted His Name on God's Roll\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When James Milton Black came home, his wife saw at once that he was \ndeeply troubled. Tears filled his eyes as he entered his gate. Now he \nsat down at his piano and in a few minutes wrote the words and \ncomposed a song that is familiar to most American church-goers: \"When \nthe Roll Is Called up Yonder.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Milton Black was born on August 19, 1856 in South Hill, New \nYork. He acquired an early musical education in singing and organ \nplaying and knew such famous songsters of his day as Daniel Towner \nand John Howard. Around 1881, he moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania \nwhere he carried on Christian work through the Methodist Episcopal \nchurch. Teaching music during the week, he was a song leader, Sunday \nschool teacher and youth leader in his spare hours. In addition to \nall this work, he edited hymnals.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe loved young people and tried to win them for Christ. One day, as \nhe passed through an alley, he met a ragged fourteen-year-old girl. \nShe was the daughter of an alcoholic. He invited her to his Sunday \nschool and youth group and she began to attend.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, one day when he took roll, the girl did not respond. Each \nchild had to say a Scripture verse when his or her name was called. \nJames saw a lesson in her silence. \"I spoke of what a sad thing it \nwould be when our names are called from the Lamb's Book of Life, if \none of us should be absent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was not the kind of man to let the matter die with a moral lesson. \nAfter Sunday school, he went to his pupil's home to find out why she \nhad not showed up for class. He found her dangerously ill and sent \nfor his own doctor--they still made house calls then. The doctor said \nthat she had pneumonia. Since that was before the days of \nantibiotics, death was highly likely.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames returned home. He tried to find a song to fit the thought of a \nheavenly roll call but could not locate one. An inner voice seemed to \nsay, \"Why don't you write one.\" And that is what he did:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,\u0014\nAnd the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair; \u0014\nWhen the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore, \u0014\nAnd the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I played the music just as it is found today in the hymn-books, note \nfor note, and I have never dared to change a single word or a note of \nthe song,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later, he had the sad opportunity of explaining in public \nhow he came to write the song when it was sung at the funeral of the \ngirl whose absence at roll call had inspired it.\u0014",

    "words": "August 26, 2014 by Alan Bean \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus is my savior, but Im a killer!\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Page, the St. Louis police officer who famously pushed CNN anchor \nDon Lemon, has been relieved of duty. Pushing Lemon in front of a \nnational television audience had nothing to do with it. It was Pages \nbizarre speech, delivered in April of 2012 to the Oath Keepers of \nSt. Louis and Lake Charles, a group that describes itself as a \nnon-partisan association of current and formerly serving military, \npolice, and first responders who pledge to fulfill the oath all \nmilitary and police take to defend the Constitution against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are a few highlights from Pages screed:\u0014\n\u0014\nPolicemen are very cynical. I know I am. I hate everybody. Im into \ndiversity. I kill everybody.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have no business passing hate crime laws. None. Because were \nsetting aside a group of people special. We got a Supreme Court out \nof control with laws on sodomy. (Page then refers to the four \nsodomites sitting on the Supreme Court.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPage says he left the army because he refused to serve under that \nillegal alien who claims to be our president.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, has suspended Mr. \nPage pending an internal investigation and psychiatric evaluation. \n(I) apologize to the community and anybody who is offended by these \nremarks, Belmar said, and understand from me that he  does not \nrepresent the rank-and-file of the St. Louis County Police \nDepartment.\u0014\n\u0014\nI doubt Dan Page reflects mainstream opinion within the police \ndepartment or the military. But until the video was released, he was \nan officer in good standing after serving, he claims, nine tours of \nduty in the US military.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are plenty of mentally unstable people with bizarre opinions \nafoot in the land, and they seem to be attracted to authoritarian \ninstitutions such a law enforcement and the military.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe social upheaval in Ferguson, Missouri over the past two weeks \nraised serious questions about the culture of law enforcement. \nEvidence suggests that there is a strain of intolerance, \nauthoritarianism and racial hostility within law enforcement and \nmilitary culture that is tolerated and, in some quarters, tacitly \nencouraged. These attitudes may not be characteristic of these \nentities, but they are clearly part of the mix.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Dan Page had nuanced his remarks a bit when he spoke in 2012, he \nwould still be on the force. To what extent is Page an egregious \nexample of normal?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I wonder who invited Dan Page to address the Oath keepers group \nin 2012, and why. You dont invite complete unknowns to address your \norganization; you invite people with a reputation for being \ninformative, entertaining or amusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently, somebody thought Page fit that bill.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did they feel when he concluded his remarks? Page ends his \nrambling remarks by asking for questions and the audience appears to \naccept him as an authority on the coming One World Government \ntakeover. A man asks if it is true that Tea Party members and \nChristians in the military are being court marshaled (Page says they \nare). A woman asks So what happens because good men like you are all \nretiring from the military, so what kind of military will we have \nleft then?\u0014\n\u0014\nSodomites and females Page answers without hesitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman asking the question finishes his statement for him . . . \nThat are willing to do what theyre told.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnd of statement, Page says.\u0014\n\u0014\nPage is convinced that the federal government, whether led by \nRepublicans or Democrats, is intent on enslaving the American people.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid anyone associated with the organization complain about the \ncontent of Pages remarks?\u0014\n\u0014\nDid anyone send of copy of Pages speech to his superiors and ask if \nthey knew what their officer was saying in public?\u0014\n\u0014\nNot at all. The Oath Keepers gave their guest speaker a warm round of \napplause and presented him with an Oath Keepers pin.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most disturbing excerpt from Dan Pages rant didnt get quoted in \nmost of the news stories I have seen.\u0014\n\u0014\nI personally believe in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, but Im \nalso a killer. Ive killed a lot, and if I need to, Ill kill a whole \nbunch more. If you dont want to get killed, dont show up in front \nof me. Its that simple.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout his speech, officer Page brandished a big black Bible, a \nsign, one assumes, that he believes the Good Book provides a warrant \nfor his personal brand of hate. If you listen to the video of his \nremarks, you quickly get a feel for the speakers worldview.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is no unified America. There are 24 states that are resisting \nthe federal government and talking about secession, and there are 26 \nstates that are part of the One World Government conspiracy. It wont \nbe long before the children in the 24 good states will be rounded up \nand sent to re-education camps. 97% of the population will do \nwhatever the federal government wants; only 3% will resist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Iraq invasion was all about creating a One World Government and \nthe conservative sections of America are next on the hit list. White \nChristian males who believe in the Second Amendment will be regarded \nas terrorists and hunted down like dogs. The federal government and \nthe mainstream media are either dupes, or theyre in on the \nconspiracy.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN HERZOG'S GIANT ENCYCLOPEDIA",
    "words": "One of a church-historian's valuable resources is the Schaff-Herzog \nEncyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. John Jacob Herzog--the Herzog of \nthe encyclopedia title--was born on this day, September 12, 1805, \nprobably in Basel, Switzerland. The Herzog family had recently moved \nthere from Wurtemburg. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was left an orphan at a young age and relatives raised him. He \nshowed himself an apt pupil of the sciences and then of theology, \nstudying with such notable individuals as the mathematician Christoph \nBernoulli and with theologians Schleiermacher and Neander. He became \nan educator at Lausanne, specializing in historical theology. John \nissued works on several of the major reformers, including Zwingli, \nCalvin and Ocolampadius.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian thought often needs defenders because scholarly and \npseudo-scholarly attacks never cease. John stood for the faith \nagainst damaging influences, including attempts to rewrite Christ's \nlife so as to rob Him of his deity. When Plymouth Brethren began \nspreading their message in Germany, John opposed them because he \nconsidered their teaching as too individualistic for the good of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the government made demands that overstepped the bounds of \nchurch and state, John refused to go along. He resigned his position \nat Lausanne and worked as a private scholar for much of 1846 and \n1847. He was glad to accept an invitation to teach at Halle, because \nhe had had little to live on during the previous months. At Halle, he \ndeveloped a close relationship with the well-known Protestant \ntheologian Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same year that John resigned his job at Lausanne, Roman Catholic \nscholars issued the first volume of the Catholic Encyclopedia. \nProtestants immediately felt the need to produce an encyclopedia of \ntheir own to counterbalance the Catholic version. Political troubles \nslowed down the project and its editor died. Tholuck recommended \nHerzog for the vacant position.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was liked by all parties--in part because of his generous \ntreatment of Reformation figures. He got the job. His vast knowledge \nof church history made him the perfect editor. In fact, he wrote 500 \nof the articles that appeared in the first edition. Later, he was \nco-editor of a second edition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Schaff was well-acquainted with John, who asked him to adapt \nthe encyclopedia for American use. Schaff agreed to undertake the \nhuge project. And that is how we got the famous and useful \nSchaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Herzog died in \n1882.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFreudenberg, Matthias. \"Herzog, Johann Jakob.\" Kirchenlexicon. \u0014\n\"Herzog, Johann Jakob.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch, edited by F.

Fuller of the Middle District \nof Alabama was arrested and charged with battery in early August, it \nwas only this week that several of his states top political figures \ndemanded in rapid succession that he leave the bench.\u0014\n\u0014\nRepresentative Terri Sewell, the sole Democrat representing Alabama \nin Congress, drew a direct connection between Judge Fullers future \nand the current storm over domestic violence in the N.F.L. If an \nN.F.L. player can lose his job because of domestic violence, she \nsaid in a statement, then a federal judge should definitely not be \nallowed to keep his lifetime appointment to the federal bench.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore critically, Judge Fuller, an appointee of President George W. \nBush and a frequent target of Democratic ire, has also received harsh \ncriticism from Republican members of Alabamas congressional \ndelegation, including the states two senators, who both called for \nhim to resign.\u0014\n\u0014\nSenator Richard C. Shelby said Wednesday that the judge had lost the \nconfidence of his colleagues and the people of the state of Alabama, \nand Senator Jeff Sessions, of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \nthat Judge Fullers unacceptable personal conduct violates the trust \nthat has been placed in him.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier in the week, Representative Martha Roby, a Republican whose \nfather is a senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe 11th Circuit, which includes Alabama, raised the possibility that \nJudge Fuller could be vulnerable to impeachment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reaction was a remarkable display of how accusations of domestic \nviolence are suddenly being viewed with new urgency far beyond the \nN.F.L.\u0014\n\\\u0014\nThe judge is brought down to the level of football players, said \nArthur D. Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh \nwho specializes in judicial ethics.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou dont normally see people talking about those two occupations in \nthe same paragraph.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the evening of Aug. 9, the judges wife, Kelli Fuller, dialed 911 \nfrom a Ritz-Carlton to report that he had assaulted her during an \nargument about her suspicions that he was engaged in an extramarital \nrelationship with a law clerk. An Atlanta police officer wrote in an \nincident report that Mrs. Fuller had visible lacerations to her \nmouth and forehead when she opened the door of her hotel room, which \nthe officer said smelled of alcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Fuller stated when she confronted him about their issues, he \npulled her hair and threw her to the ground and kicked her, the \npolice report said. Mrs. Fuller also stated she was dragged around \nthe room and Mr. Fuller hit her in the mouth several times with his \nhands.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Fuller, in his own interview with the police, said that he had \nreacted defensively after his wife hurled a drink glass toward him \nwhile he watched CNN.\u0014",

The Imperial messengers were deaf to \nhis pleas. They had their secret orders. He was coming with them \nwhether he wished it or not. Outside Antioch they transferred him \ninto a royal chariot and rode for Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere, in the capital of the Roman Empire he learned the truth. He \nwas to be Bishop of the imperial city, a position he never wanted but \nfor which many others were fiercely vying. His heart must have sunk \nas he realized that the other candidates would form implacable \nresentments against him. But what could he say? The imperial \napparatus had brought about his elevation and he was helpless before \nit. History must play itself out. He would preach with the same \nauthority as he always had. So on this day, February 26, 398, John \nChrysostom unwillingly became bishop of Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was John and why was he in such demand? Born in Antioch, Syria, \nhe had been reared by a widowed mother who taught him Christianity. \nBut John intended to go into law. His mother, trusting God for the \noutcome, sent him to study with Libanius, the great pagan rhetorician \nof the day. But John's conscience troubled him. Lawyers must \nconstantly take oaths. His mother had taught him oath-taking was \nwrong. Furthermore, through the influence of saintly Bishop Meletius, \nthe young man was attracted to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nConverted and baptized, John resisted becoming a bishop. Instead he \nspent four years in the desert, and two as a hermit in Bible study, \nduring which he practiced austerities. Filled with scripture \nknowledge, he finally agreed to be made a deacon in 381 and priest in \n386. (Unfortunately, some of those sermons were also antisemetic.)\u0014\n\u0014\nLess than a year later he rose to special attention. A tax increase \nthrew the citizens of on Antioch into a frenzy. Rioting, they tore \ndown imperial statues. While Bishop Flavian rushed to Constantinople \nto plead for mercy with the emperor, who was expected to take awful \nrevenge, Chrysostom preached a series of sermons to the terrified \npopulace. As they awaited the imperial decision, death stared them in \nthe face. Chrysostom's fierce attacks on sin cut their consciences \nand many sought the peace of confession and repentance. Fortunately, \nthe Emperor pardoned the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's brilliant preaching had made him famous.* His nickname \n\"Chrysostom\" means \"Golden tongue.\" Eloquent preaching won him the \ndesignation. When the court in Constantinople could not agree on any \nof the rival candidates for the empty see, the court turned to John. \nIf the people of Antioch had known that John was being taken in 398, \nthey might have rioted again for his straight talk made him popular \nwith them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Constantinople, Chrysostom continued his attacks on sin, \nespecially on greed and the accumulation of wealth. The Empress \nEudoxia became angry when John rebuked her in person for depriving a \nwidow of her vineyard. Eudoxia suspected that John was directing \nother sermons at her. The emperor also became unhappy with John whom \nhe felt had been raised to his position by court intrigue. The \nimperial couple teamed up with Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria to \ndepose John on trumped up charges through a synod of enemy bishops in \n403. These enemies exiled John, but the people of Constantinople were \nso enraged that the terrified empress quickly ordered him brought \nback.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when John spoke out against excessive ceremonies in honor of \na new statue erected to the empress, Eudoxia became so furious she \nordered the bishops to exile John again. This time it was permanent. \nHe died on a forced march that was designed to take him even further \naway from the court which had made him bishop in the first place \nagainst his will.\u0014\n\u0014\n*We are sad to report his sermons, so good in most respects, were \nsometimes antisemetic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaur, Chrys. \"Chrysostom, St. John.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

    "title": "JOHN - BY CYNTHIA LENNON -- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "I have been a John Lennon fan since I was about six years old. I have \nread alot of books about him, and was always fascinated by him. This \nbook by Cynthia is by far my favorite. I admit I have never been one \nto like Yoko, so I could come off as bias. I always felt really bad \nabout Cynthia but never fully understood what had happened. I cant \nsay for sure what she writes is true, but the pain that was caused at \ntimes had me disgusted with John.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the beginning the book is wonderful. It provides really good \nmental pictures and shows a John Lennon that we havent seen before. \nReading about their college years and younger days was fascinating. \nTo see John more human was refreshing. We see a side of Mimi that has \nnever really been written about. Cynthia seems to still be affected \nby her. Although Mimi is presented as nasty, rude, and demanding, you \nstill feel she was loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nHearing about John during his first years of fame was really great \ntoo. It is neat to be able to see sides of him that we havent before. \nAlthough always on the edge, he is seen here as a loving man who \ndesperately misses Julian but continues to mess up. The letter shown \nin here that John writes home is sad, and showed he was very \nvulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou begin to feel the tension as John spins more and more out of \ncontrol. You feel the sadness and you can understand how both of them \nfelt. That is one thing I really enjoy about this book. Althought \nwritten from Cynthia's perspective, she strives to explain John's \nalso and understands they were both vastly different in many areas. \nIt showed to me that she still loves John to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book gets pretty sad to read as John plummets. The chilling way \nin which he dumps Cynthia is almost hard to read. John goes from \nwanting to repair the marriage to coldly cutting both Julian and her \noff completely. It is really hard to read. And this is where I began \nto feel bad for Cynthia and Julian, and John who seems to be \nsuffering from mental problems in some way. Someone I admire so much \ncould do such cruel things. Cynthia mentions how it was disgusting to \nsee John singing on T.V. about peace but couldn't even show peace to \nhis family and most importantly Julian.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the book we are given the affect John's behavior had on \nJulian and this is also hard to read. But, I don't want to spoil the \nbook anymore. But as I have always felt, John seemed to be really \ngetting things together towards the end. He seems more like his \nold-self and I have read other accounts of this and it is sad \nconsidering what happened to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll in all, this is a fantastic book. It was a very easy read and \noffers incredible insight into John's life. A very well written book. \nI love it!\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Beatles Fan on October 2, 2005\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's a lot of cruelty (his) and bitterness (hers) in this book by \nthe late Beatle's first wife and mother of his elder son, Julian \nLennon. A rehash of the Beatles' beginnings from the wife's point of \nview, the book reveals that Lennon was a pretty messed-up guy who \npreached universal love for the world and ignored his own family. \nSaddest, of course, is the effect of all this on Julian, who writes \nthe introduction and praises Mum for her courage and love. Three \nmarriages later, though, Cynthia still burns with angermostly at \nYoko Ono, whom she believes brainwashed John. When asked if she was \nsorry she'd fallen in love with the singer-songwriter in the first \nplace, she writes, \"If I'd known as a teenager what falling for John \nLennon would lead to, I would have turned round right then and walked \naway.\" If only she had let him be. (Oct.) \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc. \u0014\n----------------------------------------\u0014\nThis isn't Cynthia Lennon's first book about her legendary \nex-husband. A Twist of Lennon--a slim volume that John tried to \nsuppress on grounds of libel--came out in 1978. But now, 25 years \nafter his death, she finally feels ready to tell the \"full and \ntruthful story\" of their life together. Why? In his foreword, son \nJulian writes of their being \"dismissed or at best treated as \ninsignificant bit players\" in the story of John's life; it's \nCynthia's goal, with John, to set the record straight. She does make \na case for being more than just \"the impressionable young girl who \nfell for him, then trapped him into marriage,\" and it's moving to \nread, in his own words, of John's love for his son. And while there's \nnothing new in her account of the Fab Four's rise to fame, as the \ngreatest success story of the rock era, it's a legend that bears \nretelling. But most salient of all are Cynthia's sketches of pain, \nregret, and intimidation. John was indeed a brilliant, loving man, \nbut he was also \"passionately jealous,\" \"verbally cutting,\" sometimes \nabusive, and often neglectful. (It is hinted that his behavior may \nhave paralleled that of the woman who raised him, his Aunt Mimi.) \nUnfortunately, Cynthia's \"response to John's provocative and cruel \nbehavior was to stick by him more solidly than ever...[feeling] that \nif he could trust me and believe that I loved him he might soften.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not this dysfunction, however, but rather John's use of LSD, on \nwhich she blames the emotional \"chasm\" that led to the failure of \ntheir marriage. And though the Lennons' divorce comes relatively late \nin the book, the pages that follow are by far the saddest, as they \nchronicle John's increasing distance from and neglect of his former \nfamily--especially Julian, who would only see his father three times \nafter he moved to New York in 1971. It's no surprise that Cynthia \nlays much of the blame for this at the feet of Yoko Ono, who is \ndescribed as controlling and insensitive, especially in the wake of \nJohn's murder. But even though there's a lot of bitterness and \nresentment in these pages, it's not overwhelming, being offset by \nCynthia's fierce love for her son and her continuing affection for \nher ex-husband. A full picture of John Lennon's life will never exist \nas long as Ono judges herself unable to write about their time \ntogether, but John goes a long way toward improving the situation. \n--Benjamin Lukoff\u0014",

    "words": "John \nBroadus Taught Sermon-Making\u0014\n\u0014\n\tJohn A. Broadus was famed as a preacher able to present the truths \nof the Bible so simply that the simplest listeners could understand \nthem. In fact, the first person he led to Christ was a simple-minded \nman who ever afterward said to him, \"Thankee, John\" whenever he saw \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBorn in 1827, John became a Christian at sixteen when a friend \nurged him to claim Christ's promise \"All that the Father giveth me \nshall come to me. And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast \nout.\" John did. Thereafter he witnessed, taught Sunday school, lived \nout his faith and gained what education he could.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe planned to become a doctor. However, a sermon on Christ's \nparable of the talents convinced him he should study to become a \nminister. He was a minister who did not pastor a great deal, however, \nconcentrating more on seminary teaching, although at one church he \nbaptized 241 converts, including a girl who later became famous as a \nmissionary--Lottie Moon. Although he often filled pulpits, preached \nat conferences and to troops during the Civil War, his life's work \nwas as a professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in \nwhich he taught homiletics (the art of preaching). He often told his \nstudents, \"If you forget everything else I have told you, don't \nforget to treat the Scripture in a commonsense way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tJust how conscientious he was is shown by the fact that he once \nrevised his entire course notes for a single blind student. He \nstudied the sermons of the most effective preachers of all time to \nlearn how they should be put together. When it looked as if the \nseminary would go under because of the Civil War, John said to the \nother professors, \"...perhaps the seminary may die, but let us \nresolve to die first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n         John stressed the importance of preaching: \"We know that \npreaching deserves the highest excellence since it is the chosen \ninstrument of the Savior of the world, who himself came preaching.\" \nHe worked hard on his own sermons, wearing a path into the grass near \nthe school, pacing as he fixed key points in mind. He learned what \nmany pastors never learn, to preach so as to persuade listeners to \ntake spiritual action based on the truths presented.\u0014\n\u0014\n        As an example of his style, take these words from his sermon \nHe Ever Liveth to Intercede: \"Here then is hope for us. 'If any man \nsin,' much as he ought to deplore it, he need not despair. Our \nadvocate with the Father ever liveth to make intercession for them \nthat come unto God through him, and through him we may find mercy. \nAnd here is no encouragement to sin, but the very contrary. If we \ntruly trust in, truly love our interceding Lord, we shall be \nsupremely anxious for his dear sake to turn from sin, to live for him \nwho died for us; yea who ever lives as our Savior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n       On this day March 16, 1895 John Albert Broadus died. True to \nhis word, he had done all in his power to keep the seminary alive and \nit lives today. His Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew is one of his \nbetter-known writings and his book On the Preparation and Delivery of \nSermons was widely used as a textbook for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "words": "James Milton Black Wanted His Name on God's Roll\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\"When James Milton Black came home, his wife saw at once that he \nwas deeply troubled. Tears filled his eyes as he entered his gate. \nNow he sat down at his piano and in a few minutes wrote the words and \ncomposed a song that is familiar to most American church-goers: \"When \nthe Roll Is Called up Yonder.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tJames Milton Black was born on this day, August 19, 1856 in South \nHill, New York. He acquired an early musical education in singing and \norgan playing and knew such famous songsters of his day as Daniel \nTowner and John Howard. Around 1881, he moved to Williamsport, \nPennsylvania where he carried on Christian work through the Methodist \nEpiscopal church. Teaching music during the week, he was a song \nleader, Sunday school teacher and youth leader in his spare hours. In \naddition to all this work, he edited hymnals.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe loved young people and tried to win them for Christ. One day, as \nhe passed through an alley, he met a ragged fourteen-year-old girl. \nShe was the daughter of an alcoholic. He invited her to his Sunday \nschool and youth group and she began to attend.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHowever, one day when he took roll, the girl did not respond. Each \nchild had to say a Scripture verse when his or her name was called. \nJames saw a lesson in her silence. \"I spoke of what a sad thing it \nwould be when our names are called from the Lamb's Book of Life, if \none of us should be absent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was not the kind of man to let the matter die with a moral lesson. \nAfter Sunday school, he went to his pupil's home to find out why she \nhad not showed up for class. He found her dangerously ill and sent \nfor his own doctor--they still made house calls then. The doctor said \nthat she had pneumonia. Since that was before the days of \nantibiotics, death was highly likely.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames returned home. He tried to find a song to fit the thought of a \nheavenly roll call but could not locate one. An inner voice seemed to \nsay, \"Why don't you write one.\" And that is what he did:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,\u0014\nAnd the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair; \u0014\nWhen the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore, \u0014\nAnd the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll, is called up yonder, \u0014\nWhen the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I played the music just as it is found today in the hymn-books, note \nfor note, and I have never dared to change a single word or a note of \nthe song,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later, he had the sad opportunity of explaining in public \nhow he came to write the song when it was sung at the funeral of the \ngirl whose absence at roll call had inspired it.\u0014",

    "title": "JANICE JOPLIN'S WASTED LIFE",
    "words": "BURIED \nALIVE \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a frighteningly nightmarish thought caught by the title of a \nrecent \u0014\nbiography of a popular rock star: Buried Alive: The Biography of \nJanis Joplin. \u0014\nA reviewer of the book comments: \"Janis Joplin chose to drown herself \nin Sou- \u0014\nthern Comfort and in drugs. She was either on speed or heroin. Her \nfriends are \u0014\nnearly unanimous in labeling her egocentric, megalomaniac, paranoic, \nand stingy. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf Miss Joplin had made some sort of investment in reclaiming \nherself. we might \u0014\nhave a moment or two in which to dam up some sympathy for her. but \nthe bottle \u0014\nor the pill was always in her mouth or the needle in her arm.\" And \nthen the re- \u0014\nviewer touched perhaps the root cause of her wasted life. \"She could \nhave had \u0014\nall the love she wanted if she had only accepted it.\" Thus it was \nthat she was \u0014\nburied alive. The person she could have been was kept captive within \nher and \u0014\nwas buried alive. The heart that could have shared and known the joy \nof sharing \u0014\nwas never freed. and it too was buried alive.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nElectrifying, highly acclaimed, and intensely personal, this new and \nupdated version of Myra Friedman's classic biography of Janis Joplin \nteems with dramatic insights into Joplin's genius and into the \nchaotic times that catapulted her to fame as the legendary queen of \nrock. It is a stunning panorama of the turbulent decade when Joplin's \nwas the rallying voice of a generation that lost itself in her music \nand found itself in her words.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom her small hometown of Port Arthur, Texas, to San Francisco's \nHaight-Ashbury, from the intimate coffeehouses to the supercharged \nconcert halls, from the glitter of worldwide fame to her tragic end \nin a Hollywood hotel, here is all the fire and anguish of an \nimmortal, immensely talented, and troubled performer who devoured \neverything the rock scene had to offer in a fatal attempt to make \npeace with herself and her era. Yet, in an eloquent introduction \nrecently written by the author, Joplin emerges from her \"ugly \nduckling\" childhood as a woman truly ahead of her time, an outrageous \nrebel, a defiant outcast and artist of incomparable authenticity who, \nalmost in spite of herself, became to so many a symbol of triumph \nover adversity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis edition also contains an afterword detailing the whereabouts of \na large and colorful cast of characters who were part of Joplin's \nlife, as well as \"We Remember Janis,\" a new chapter of poignant and \naffectionate anecdotes told by friends.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nBy F. Gentile on July 29, 2002\u0014\nFormat: Paperback\u0014\n\u0014\nI found this book to be the most intelligent ever written about the \nlegendary Janis. I bought this book upon its publication, and  to me, \nit remains the definitive biography on the greatest woman rock star \never. While this book angered many (and apparently still does), I \nfeel Friedmans perspective is very valid. This book is amazingly \nhonest and insightful, considering it was written so shortly after \nJoplins death, without the benefit of time, which changes the patina \nof a life. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile it would have been easy for any author taking on such an \nintimidating subject so soon after their demise to be tempted to \neither canonize them or vilify them, Friedman does neither. She very \neloquently tells of the Janis she knew for the maybe 2 year period \nthat she was her public relations person, and her opinions are not \nalways popular. We like our icons deified, and it's not always easy \nhearing about their faults, superficialties, and demons. What can \nmake the difference between an honest telling of a life, and an \nunfair portrayal, is the balance in which it is written. Though \nFriedman is sometimes brutal in the honesty of her observations of \nJanis, and sometimes perceived as judgmental, I never doubted for a \nsecond that she loved Janis, and her grief at the wretched tragedy of \nher ending is apparent, to me, through-out, though never maudlin. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe even admits that she was not a particular fan of Joplins at the \nbeginning of her involvement with her, having more of a classical \nbackround. Her chapters on Janis' early years, when she was an \noutcast, and all but banished from school for being different, \nun-pretty, and un-popular, are especially filled with empathy. And \nher re-counting of the young Janis, the seemingly hopeless no-body, \naccidentally discovering she had a voice, as she sits with a friend \non a train trestle..\"Guess what...I think I can sing\", sends a little \nshiver down the spine. Her love for Janis, and the immense respect \nthat Friedman developed for the intangible magic that she created, \ntranscended her personal likes and dislikes, as far as musical style \nwas concerned, though she never became a \"yes\" person to Joplin \n(there were enough of those buzzing around the hive of her fame... \nunfortunatley.) \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is not a hint of the patronizing, self-serving viewpoints seen \nin many other biographies of the famous. Several which came out after \nher death were so despicable as to not being worthy of a mention. \nBut, compared to \"Pearl\", which was mildly interesting, and \"Scars Of \nSweet Paradise\", which I found to be just re-heated opinions, this \nbook , along with \"Love, Janis\", by Joplins sister Laura, is the most \ntelling, compassionate, honest book you're going to find about the \nincredibly intelligent, self-destructive, very brave, once un-popular \nugly duckling, whose fame became a burden at once her savior and her \nexecutioner, but had a humanity and genius that can still be heard in \nthe un-fathomable and irreplacable power of her voice. That is what \nwe are left with. And...that's alot.\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book was AWFUL. It starts out like a regular biography, but \nabout a quarter of the way through, the author, Ms. Myra Friedman, \nbegins to inject too much of her own personal opinions, and before \nyou know it, the whole thing turns into a rant about the evils of the \nSixties. This book can't really be called a biography because it is \nfilled with too many opinions and diagnosises and not enough \nobjective facts.\u0014\nI found the author's psychoanalytic approach to be overbearing, \npreachy, and frankly, passe. In portraying her subject, she mixes \nsome smug sneers at rock culture with a shallow, psyche textbook \ndescription of Janis's supposed affection/rejection complex, free of \nany insight into the complicated consciousness of the '60s. The \nauthor writes that Joplin referred to her (Friedman) as a \"Jewish \nmother.\" We can be assured the quote is accurate, given the tone \nthroughout.\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing escapes her contempt, especially poor Janis, who is really \nhung out to dry in the book's latter sections by the author's overly \nrighteous harangues, all very mean-spirited. She was her publicity \ngirl for a couple of years starting in 1968, but maybe she should \nhave put in for a transfer to another department if she hated the \nrock scene so much.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author conveys an almost sadistic pleasure in pointing out her \nsubject's weaknesses. In her version of events, Janis Joplin \napparently had not one shred of redeemable qualities and was a weak, \nwretched human being on all counts. She writes that Janis was \"no \nmusician,\" an \"amateur\" during her entire time with Big Brother, not \nat all spontaneous with her phrasing, \"contrived,\" emotionally \n\"astigmatized,\" \"infantile,\" \"deplorably self centered,\" copied other \npeople's fashion styles and had no original fashion style of her \nown,(!!?) and chose to sing the blues strictly because it was more \n\"marketable.\" She describes the album Cheap Thrills as \"abominable.\" \n(Quote: \"And I personally thought Cheap Thrills abominable.\") and \nthat Big Brother and the Holding Company were \"absurd, ludicrous, \ndaffy, impossible, a violation of every musical standard I held dear, \na minstrel show.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe also believes that the many famous photos that were taken of \nJanis were products of her own \"narcissism and self-hatred,\"(?!) and \nthat the Woodstock festival was simply an overrated, glorified \ncelebration of drugs as the holy grail, (no mention of the musicians, \njust the drugs). She also asserts that Janis's bisexuality (and \nbisexuality in general), is the result of an unstable, \"diffused\" \npsyche as opposed to if Janis were strictly gay or straight, which \nwould require her to be more \"tidy\" in her personality. And this bit \nof absurdity is Miss Friedman's psychiatric diagnosis on the Kozmic \nBlues band: \"The unsettled, internal argument, the conflict for the \nprimitive yearning and the desire for control, were reflected in the \narrangements, the songs, the character of the sets. The tone was \nsluggish, imposing, massive and dismal.\" Her explanation for why \nJanis was so popular with her audiences? Because they were too stoned \nto know the difference!!\u0014\n\u0014\nOne wonders, what was such a conservative and humorless individual, \nnegative about most aspects of rock n' roll, doing in the center of \nit? In interviewing two girls from the Haight, the one with a husband \nand children rates her approval while the one who discussed the \ncreative potential of drug use in the early Sixties meets with her \ndisapproval. She also is horrified and offended that Janis would ask \nher if she'd read \"The Sensuous Woman,\" and takes issue with the \ntattoo party Janis threw, portraying the event as the height of \ndebauchery even though she admits she didn't attend. Peggy Caserta, \nJoplin's lover and shooting partner, is dismissed as an insignificant \nacquaintance despite evidence to the contrary. The author also \nbelittles Joplin for not following her request to promote a peace \nconcert during an appearance on the Dick Cavett show. You can hardly \npicture Janis Joplin, a self-described, apolitical cynic from the \nBeatnik era, promoting a peace concert in deference to her publicist, \nor tearfully apologizing for not doing so afterward, as the author \nclaims.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother thing I noticed was that she misspells the obvious, such as: \n\"Bobby McGee\" is spelled \"McGhee.\" She also insists on hyphenating \nFull Tilt Boogie Band, even though that was not the official \nspelling. For a biographer, she should know basic facts, such as that \nat the Monterey Pop festival, Janis wore the famous gold outfit at \nthe Sunday performance, NOT Saturday. She should dot her I's and \ncross her T's if she wants to be definitive. And instead of analyzing \nJanis, she should psychoanalyze herself as to why she needed to write \nsuch a book and expose personal information from Janis's doctors and \npsychologists, not to mention betraying the anguished confidences \nthat Janis allegedly made to her when she was having bad days. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd after all this, she claims she did her job by protecting Janis \nagainst the \"nastiness\" of the press, a total joke given the contents \nof this book, especially in light of her statement that she thought \nthe negative press was \"valid\"!!! Also, she claims that Janis asked \nher to write her biography and tell the truth about the drugs and \n\"everything,\" yet she writes that Janis never, ever confided into her \nabout her lesbian relationships, much less talked to her very much at \nall about her drug use. There is one good thing about this book that \nI will admit: Its exhaustive listing of bars and pubs frequented by \nJanis. So if ever you wanted to re-create your own Janis pub \"crawl\" \nin NY or L.A., this book is a good reference source.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurning Janis Joplin into the poster child for everything that went \nwrong with the '60s does not really address the life and work of this \nartist. I frankly think the book's title more accurately describes \nwhat the author does to her subject, rather than what the subject did \nto herself.\u0014\nTo Myra Friedman: Next time, try just a little bit harder, to be nice.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN DYKES, COMPOSER OF \"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY\"",
    "words": "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty,\" read Reginald Heber's widow. \nAmong her dead husband's papers she found the words of one of the \nmost powerful and beautiful hymns ever written. But years would pass \nbefore the lines took their place in worship services around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1861, a publisher rediscovered the words. He asked John Bacchus \nDykes to furnish him with a tune. It made sense for him to turn to \nJohn who had a natural aptitude for music (he graduated with a music \nmaster that same year). John had been a church organist since he was \nten-years-old and was co-founder and president of the Cambridge \nUniversity Musical Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn accepted the words. Within thirty minutes he wrote the tune \n\"Nicea,\" which carried the praise of the Trinity to Christians \neverywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty\u0014\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; \u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty! \u0014\nGod in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he composed this famous tune, John was appointed vicar \nof St. Oswald. This put him in charge of a parish. He was thirty-nine \nand had already held several lesser church posts. John's people came \nto love him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis bishop, however, did not care for John's views. John was \n\"high-church.\" This meant that he stressed the continuity of the \nChurch of England with the Roman Catholic church from which it had \nsprung. He believed that church and monarchy had divine rights which \nwere being washed away by modern changes. There was long-lasting \ndisagreement between John and his bishop because of this.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Baring, his bishop, refused to give John any help with his \nlarge parish unless he would agree to conduct his services in a more \n\"low-church\" style. He had to get rid of colorful collars, stop \nburning incense and not turn his back on his congregation at times \nduring the service. John wouldn't agree and so he had to handle the \nwhole parish himself, a job which exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, in addition to his regular duties, he managed to write \nover 300 hymn tunes. These included some for our favorite hymns, such \nas \"Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee\" and less familiar songs such as \n\"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand\" and \"Lead, Kindly Light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWorn out with his labors and constant friction with his bishop, John \ndied on this day, January 22, 1876.

    "words": "Who would be the next president of the United States? The election of \n1824 gave none of the three candidates a majority vote. Under the \nConstitution, the House of Representatives must decide the matter.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 9th, 1825 they did so. Rejecting Andrew Jackson \nand Henry Clay, they chose one of their own, John Quincy Adams.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil George W. Bush's election, he was the only president's son to \nhave become president himself. Before holding America's highest \noffice, Adams was a lawyer, senator, diplomat, and Secretary of State.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man could be elected is a reflection of America's \nreligious roots. John Quincy Adams sprang directly from those roots \nand had a firm faith. If Christianity is proven by character, Adams \nwas surely a Christian. This stubborn man whose motto was \"Watch and \nPray,\" spoke openly of his trust in God: but not for that did he win \nhis nickname \"Old Eloquence.\" Rather, it was for championing \nprinciple and attacking the institution of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was an unyielding patriarch, tough as the granite of his native \nNew England. Every day he read two to five chapters of the Bible in \nthe original Hebrew and Greek and drew strength from them. He prayed \ndaily. Not content merely to read, he acted on what he read. So often \ndid he put principle before party he became highly unpopular with his \nfollowers.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Quincy did not let their disapproval alter his course. \"The \nSermon on the Mount commends me to lay up for myself treasures, not \non earth, but in Heaven. My hopes of a future life are all founded \nupon the Gospel of Christ...\" he had written his father. After his \nsingle term as President, he returned to Congress.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist was central to John's theology. When Unitarianism emerged, \ndenying the divinity of Christ, Adams flirted with it, but the Bible \nsoon convinced him the doctrine was false. Either Jesus is God \nincarnate and our path to salvation or we have none. With \ncharacteristic rectitude John wrote as much to his parents.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I find in the New Testament, Jesus Christ accosted in His own \npresence by one of his disciples as God, without disclaiming the \nappellation...I see him named in the great prophecy of Isaiah \nconcerning him to be the mighty God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from and earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\n\"Adams, John Quincey.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "words": "Judaism Is a Family       \u0014\n\u0014\nYehiel Poupko/ June 2, 2016   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nJudaism is not just a religion. Judaism and Jewishness are an \nindivisible amalgam of God, Torah (the scriptures), Mitzvot \n(commandments), land, language, and familial peoplehood. In the main, \none is not born a Christian; one becomes a Christian by affirming the \nChristian faith. While one can convert to Judaism, for the most part, \none is born a Jew. Irrespective of what a Jew believes or practices, \na Jew is a Jew. Every Jewish person is a child of Abraham and Sarah \nand a member of that first family of believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudaism is a family that became a faith and remained a family. One of \nthe consequences of this is the unconditional love of one Jew for \nanother Jew, no matter their depth of religious faith. It is still a \nfamily despite growing differences in various Jewish beliefs and \npractices.\u0014\n\u0014\nEssentially two schools of thought emerged among the Jewish \npopulation. One focused on therethe Land of Israel. This solution \ninvolved establishing a nation-state where Jews could determine their \nown destiny. This movement is known as Zionism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother group reasoned that their problem was not so much a Jewish \nproblem as it was universal problem. That problem was capitalism, \nwhich oppressed workers. A socialist revolution would solve the \nuniversal oppression, and thus the two great Jewish problems. It \nwould not only deal with their oppression, but the early socialist \nleaders believed socialism would allow them to assimilate into \nEuropean society without having to convert to Christianity. On top of \nthat, socialism drew upon the universal Jewish impulse to do Mitzvot, \nto relieve human suffering.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nYehiel E.

    "title": "JESUS, THE MAN OF VIOLENCE",
    "words": "Jesus, the man of violence\u0014\n                                                           Miguel De \nLa Torre | June 23, 2016\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we think of Jesus, images of a peace-loving, gentle pacifist \ncomes to mind, at least it did to the mind of Howard Yoder. We read \nour particular ideology into the biblical text when we claim Jesus \nwas a pacifist. As much as I want to adhere to nonviolence, \nintellectual honesty forces me to recognize that Jesus was no \npacifist. And if this is true, what becomes of my Christian ethical \nresponse to oppression?\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was a troublemaker, instigator of conflict, disrupter of unity. \nA violent Jesus who resolutely makes a whip to forcefully drive \nmoneychangers (bankers) out of the Temple, over-turning their tables \n(John 3:15). Before, his disciples went out without a money belt, bag \nor sandals, and lacked nothing. But now, they are to bring a money \nbelt and bag; and if they lack a sword, they are to sell their cloak \nand purchase one (Luke 22:35-36). Jesus the so-called pacifist \ninstructing his followers to buy a sword? It would be as if today he \nadvised purchasing a gun. This Jesus warns his disciples that he did \nnot come to bring peace to earth, but division (Luke 12:51). Not \npeace, but a sword. Because of him, son will turn against father, \ndaughter against mother, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. \nEven a persons enemy will be a member of ones own household (Matt. \n10:34-36).\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the night he was arrested, Peter impulsively drew his sword and \ncut off the ear of the high priests slave (John 18:10). Jesus \nresponded to this violent act stating All those who take the sword \nshall perish by the sword (Matt. 26:52). Jesus may be speaking to \nPeter; but to whom is he directing his comment? After all, it was \nJesus who told his disciples to sell their cloak and buy a sword. \nSome of the disciples were already armed, boasting, Look, Lord, we \nalready have two swords. Thats enough! (Luke 22:38).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus comments are directed to his disciples, then he is \ncontradicting his earlier instructions. He therefore must have meant \nhis comments for those aligned with the colonizer who came to arrest \nhim. Those who pick up swords to defend the empire will, along with \nthe empire, perish with the sword. We may argue that Jesus abhors \nviolence, but it would be simplistic to argue that he was a pacifist. \nHe calls his disciples to become the recipients of violence, calling \nthem to radical solidarity with a bloody cross. Violence can never be \naccepted as a necessary evil as per some revolutionaries, nor \nrejected as antithetical to Jesus as per pacifists. After all, Jesus \nprophesies about the Day of Judgment has him at the center of a \nviolent bloodbath.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me be clear, this violent Jesus disturbs me. In disobedience to \nJesus, I do not own a gun and work for gun control. Although Im no \npacifist, I find the words of Csar Chvez descriptive of my stance: \nI am not a nonviolent man. I am a violent man who is trying to be \nnonviolent. Those, like myself, who did not grow up in so-called \ngood neighborhoods discover quickly that pacifism seldom works in \nthe schoolyard. History demonstrates the futility of simply \ndenouncing unjust social structures, for those whom the structures \nprivileges will never willingly abdicate what they consider to be \ntheir birthright.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all violence is the same. The violence employed by the \nmarginalized to overcome oppression, is in reality self-defense to \nthe oppressors institutionalized violence designed to sustain and \nmaintain subjugation. Unconditional love for the very least might \nlead to the unselfish act of standing in solidarity with the \noppressed in their battle for self-preservation. Protecting a \nnonperson might invite a violent confrontation as the oppressor \nuses all police and military tools at their disposal to maintain the \nstatus quo.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo make a preferential option of love for the oppressed means harming \nthe oppressor who has a vested interest on insisting solely upon the \nuse of nonviolence as the only ethically acceptable methodology \nemployed by those s/he oppresses. The conflict and disruption that \ncomes with following Jesus, whose consequence at times is violence, \nillustrates the need for an ethical praxis for the disenfranchised \nlacking the physical or military power to confront or overcome \noppressors. Because the usage of violence all too often becomes the \noppressors excuse to unleash greater violent retaliation; a need to \nbe as wise as serpents but gentle as doves is required. How does one \ncreate ethical acts that disrupt structures that support and maintain \noppression?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn several of my books I have suggested the need to joder. To joder \nis a Spanish verb, a word one would never use in polite conversation, \nbasically meaning to screw with. An ethics para joder is an ethics \nthat screws with the prevailing power structures. Those standing \nbefore the vastness of domination have few ethical alternatives. When \nthose who are disenfranchised start to joder, they play the trickster \nrole, literally creating instability, upsetting the prevailing social \norder designed to protect the power and privilege of the few.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo joder refuses to play by the rules established by those who \nprovide a space for orderly dissent, pacifying the need to vent, but \ndesigned not to change the power relationships within the existing \nsocial structures. If the goal of praxis is to bring about change, \nthen it is crucial to go beyond the rules created by the dominant \nculture, to move beyond what is expected, to push beyond their \nuniversalized experiences. This is an ethics that refuses to go to \nthe police department, to get permit from the police department, \nproviding permission from the police department, to protest the \npolice brutality of the police department.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus overturned those tables in the Temple that day, he was, I \nargue, participating in an ethics para joder.\u0014",

    "title": "JULIAN THE APOSTATE COULDN'T DEFEAT CHRIST",
    "words": "Julian the \nApostate Couldn't Defeat Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, \nif a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, \nJune 27, 363.* Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just \ntwo years of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he bled, the dying emperor groaned, \"You have conquered, O \nGalilean\"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later \nreports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had \nassassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they \nhad reason to. Julian had struggled to end the power of Christians in \nthe Roman Empire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine \nwon a key victory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had \nsteadily grown.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had \nbeen brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader \n(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led \nChristians to call him \"Julian the Apostate.\" (An apostate is one who \nfalls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?\u0014\n\u0014\nA gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic \ncivilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who \nused magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason that may have influenced Julian was that a \"Christian\" \nemperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although \nJulian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed \nall Christians for the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, \nJulian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to \nsupremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He \ndeveloped a pagan priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions \n(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his \nrejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not \naccept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another \nmove apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their \nJewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in \nJerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true \nheritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged \nthe pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, \nnoting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for \nthe pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral \nadvantage among their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had \njudged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the \nabrupt end of their perks and plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Historians disagree on this date. Will Durant, Christian History, \nand other sources give the 27th, but Encyclopedia Britannica and the \nCatholic Encyclopedia give the 26th.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "JOSEPH GILMORE'S MEMORABLE HYMN",
    "words": "Joseph Gilmore's Memorable Hymn\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph Henry Gilmore died on this day July 23, 1918, he had \ntaught for many years at the University of Rochester in New York and \nauthored several books on literature. He is remembered in educational \ncircles for these contributions and others. But in Christian circles \nhe is remembered for a single hymn written over half a century before \nhis death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1862, as a 28-year-old student who was about to become a pastor, \nHenry was invited to preach at the historic First Baptist Church of \nPhiladelphia. \"I set out to give the people an exposition of the \nTwenty-third Psalm. I had given this exposition on three or four \nother occasions; but this time I did not get beyond the words 'He \nleadeth me.' So greatly impressed was I with the blessedness of \ndivine guidance that I made this my theme.\" He later felt that the \ndark days of the Civil War may have subconsciously led him to focus \non God's leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the close of the meeting, Henry and some others went to the home \nof a deacon. \"There,\" he wrote, \"we continued our discussion of \ndivine guidance. While I was still talking and listening, I wrote on \na piece of my exposition manuscript the words to this hymn. I handed \nthe paper to my wife and more or less forgot the incident.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words that Henry had written began with this famous stanza:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe leadeth me! O blessed tho't! \u0014\nO words with heav'nly comfort fraught! \u0014\nWhat-e'er I do, wher-e'er I be, \u0014\nStill 'tis God's hand that leadeth me!\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years later, having pastored for some time in New Hampshire, \nHenry was invited to preach a trial sermon at the Second Baptist \nChurch in Rochester. \"I picked up a church hymnal to see what songs \nthey sang and was surprised to have the book fall open to the very \nsong I had written three years earlier,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I returned home, I related this experience to my wife. 'I do \nnot understand it,' I said. 'My words had been set to music by Dr. \nWilliam B. Bradbury; yet I had not given the words to anybody.' My \nwife smiled and said, 'I can explain it, Joseph. I felt that the \nwords would bless the hearts of people in these troublesome times; so \nI sent the poem to The Watchman and Reflector. I am glad to know that \nthey have printed it.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous hymn composer William Bradbury had seen the lines and \nadded music and the last two lines of the chorus. Henry took this \nincident as divine leadership that he should accept a situation at \nthe Rochester church. That put him in position two years later to \naccept an offer to teach Hebrew at Rochester Theological Seminary. \nThe following year, he was offered a professorship of logic and \nEnglish literature at the University of Rochester, which he held \nuntil his retirement in 1908. An English chair at the school is named \nafter him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah. The Story of the Hymns and \nTunes. New York: George H.

A man who insults Hispanics, Muslims, African \nAmericans, women, and anyone else who disagrees with him. A man who \nrejects foundational Christian principles such as love for enemies, \nradical forgiveness, turning the other cheek and unqualified \nhospitality.\u0014\n\u0014\nLets admit right off the top that if the vote was restricted to \nwhite people Trump would win in a cake walk. In mid-July, 66 percent \nof registered white voters were planning to vote for Trump, and in \nsome Southern states the figure is close to 90 percent. So, white \nevangelicals are no more pro-Trump than white folks generally.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, shouldnt we expect that, strictly on moral and theological \ngrounds, disciples of Jesus Christ, red and yellow, black and white, \nwould pass en masse on a man with Trumps rsum?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, we should expect nothing of the kind.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all its apparent diversity, American evangelicalism is dominated \nby two theological systems, both of which are uncomfortable with the \nradical words of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Reformed river is fed by John Calvin, a brilliant biblical \ntheologian who ruled Geneva with an iron fist in the mid-16th \ncentury. Calvins God was sovereign and unchanging (the theological \nterm is immutable). If God told Joshua to massacre the Amalekites, \nman, woman and child, who are we to quibble? However things may \nappear to a flawed and fallen humanity, Calvin taught, Gods decrees \nare just and true by definition.\u0014\n\u0014\nA sovereign and immutable God has one limitation: he can never change \nhis mind. The New Covenant inaugurated by Jesus could not be \nsubstantially different from the Old Covenant bequeathed to Moses. \nThe genocidal carnage of Joshua and the Sermon on the Mount may \nappear irreconcilable, but God cant change the rules without \nchanging his character. So, Jesus and Joshua dont just share a name; \nthey share a theological vision. They have to. The unchanging \ncharacter of God demands it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen your theology forces you to reconcile Joshua and Jesus, the New \nTestament teaching on enemy-love, non-resistance, unqualified \nhospitality and radical forgiveness become inconvenient.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only popular alternative to Calvinism in American evangelicalism \nis dispensationalism, a systematic attempt to account for the \ndivergent traditions within the Bible without surrendering the \nprinciple of biblical inerrancy. Although God does not change, \ndispensationalists say, he occasionally changes the rules.\u0014\n\u0014\nOld School dispensationalists like C.I. Scofield and Lewis Sperry \nChafer had a clever solution to the Joshua-Jesus problem. The kingdom \nteaching found in Matthew, Mark and Luke (including the Sermon on the \nMount) were never intended for the Church. Jesus came into this world \nto establish the kind of earthly kingdom anticipated by the Old \nTestament prophets, but Israel refused to cooperate. The Church, \naccording to this interpretation, is a kind of Plan B, or \nparenthesis, that will persist until the church is raptured to \nheaven and the millennial reign begins on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything Jesus said about non-violence, enemy-love, and turning the \nother cheek was never intended for the Church age, Scofield and \nChafer taught, but will be in full force when Christ sets up his \nthousand-year reign.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou will be relieved to learn that some Calvinists (like Russell \nMoore) and some Dispensationalists (like Darrell Bock) are trying to \nfind a middle ground between Reformed and Dispensational theology \nthat makes more room for the teaching of Jesus. Neither Moore nor \nBock will be voting for Donald Trump in November and thats what you \nwould expect. The closer you get to the Savior, the harder it becomes \nto embrace the Donald. You can love the man, forgive him, struggle to \nunderstand him; but you cant vote for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, Russell Moore and Darrell Bock are evangelical \noutliers. The rhetoric flowing from popular, made-for-TV \nevangelicalism has assumed a desperate quality. America will only \ncontinue to be exceptional if she continues to be Christian, \npreachers say. If not, our beloved country will become a toxic slough \nof secularity  Sweden writ large.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts the children of light versus the children of darkness and \nsomebody has to lose.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe premonitions of doom issuing from the religious right are \nreminiscent of Psalm 44, which begins with a celebration of Gods \nvictories in the days of Joshua:\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough thee we push down our foes; \u0014\nthrough thy name we tread down our assailants.\u0014\nFor not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.\u0014\nBut thou hast saved us from our foes, \u0014\nand hast put to confusion those who hate us.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, without a hint of transition, the mood changes:\u0014\n\u0014\nThou hast cast us off and abased us, \u0014\nand hast not gone out with our armies.\u0014\nThou hast made us turn back from the foe; \u0014\nand our enemies have gotten spoil.\u0014\nThou hast made us like sheep for slaughter, \u0014\nand hast scattered us among the nations.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr, to quote Donald Trumps paraphrase, We never win anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 44 was likely written about the same time the book of Joshua \nassumed its present form: shortly after a remnant returned from \nBabylonian captivity to a heap of ruins that once was Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nBooks like Deuteronomy and Joshua were written to answer the why \nquestion. God told us to exterminate the inhabitants of Canaan down \nto the last sucking infant; but we made our peace with the infidel, \nmarrying their daughters and worshiping their gods.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Ezra and Nehemiah, the returning exiles divorce their foreign \nwives and build a big wall around Jerusalem, a line of demarcation \nbetween saints and sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\nOld Testament texts like Joshua and Nehemiah get more attention in \nAmericas white evangelical churches than the words of Jesus. The man \nwho talks about recovering American greatness by building a wall is \nspeaking a language conservative white Christians can understand.\u0014",

    "title": "JUSTIFYING LIBERTY  -- JAMES MADISON'S INFLUENCE",
    "words": "Through Madison's efforts, religious liberty in the United States is \na fundamental right, and the way, whether, and how one chooses to \nworship God is essentially an act of faith, a personal choice, and \nnot one of statute.\u0014\n--------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nWith independence from Great Britain finally secured through the \nratification of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, domestic concerns once \nagain became more prominent. Many Virginians were appalled by what \nwas generally perceived to be a lack of civic virtue among their \ncitizens. There was a widespread consensus that this problem was \ncaused by the growing secularization of society and the resulting \nmoral laxity. To compensate, a seemingly minor and innocuous piece of \nlegislation was introduced in the state legislature to authorize the \ngovernment to financially support teachers of the Christian \nreligion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bill was well intentioned, outwardly benign, and enjoyed the \nstrong support of Patrick Henry. It seemed predestined to be enacted \ninto law without either much discussion or debate. For James Madison, \nthough, the legislation was a violation of the fundamental principle \nof religious freedom that had been codified in the Virginia \nDeclaration of Rights. Madison believed that no one should be \ncompelled by a secular or ecclesiastical power to support any \nreligious theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeft unchallenged, the law would establish a dangerous precedent that \nwould allow the government to intrude at will into what were \nessentially matters of personal belief. The potential for future \nmischief was great, Madison warned. It is proper to take alarm at \nthe first experiment I our liberties. . . . The freemen of America \ndid not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise. \n. . . They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they \navoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this \nlesson too much, soon to forget it.1 Madison found a willing and \nable ally in his old mentor, the curmudgeonly George Mason of Gunston \nHall. Mason not only agreed philosophically, but also had a general \naversion to all forms of taxation.2\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this critical time Madison remained in frequent correspondence \nwith his good friend Thomas Jefferson, who was serving abroad as \nAmerican minister to France. Jefferson, an equally outspoken advocate \nof the separation of church and state, was predictably outraged that \nthe battle for freedom of conscience had to be waged once again. In a \nprivate letter to Madison, Jefferson offered a surprisingly candid \nappraisal of the situation, blaming Patrick Henry for causing the \npolitical morass.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Mr. Henry lives another bad constitution would be formed, and \nsaddled for ever on us. What we have to do I think is devoutly to \npray for his death, in the mean time to keep alive the idea that the \npresent is but an ordinance and prepare the minds of the young men. I \nam glad the Episcopalians have again shown their teeth and fangs. The \ndissenters had almost forgotten them.3\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite Jefferson's peculiar desire that Henry be removed from the \nstate legislature by divine intervention, the far more pragmatic \nMadison orchestrated an equally effective, albeit more subtle, scheme \nto reduce Henry's influence within the state. Through clandestine \nmaneuvering, Madison helped elect Henry governor and thus removed the \ngreat orator from the debates in the state legislature. Henry proudly \nassumed his new office, leaving the assessment legislation in hands \nless able to manage the growing opposition from the Baptists and \nother religious minorities.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an era when communication was primitive, letter-writing expensive, \nand information undependable, the most effective way for citizens to \nseek redress for their grievances was through formal petition.4 \nMadison wrote and circulated what became known as Memorial and \nRemonstrance for the citizens of Orange Country, although he would \nnot publicly acknowledge authorship for decades. Ultimately 15 of \nthese petitions protesting the plan for government funding for \nreligious teachers circulated throughout the state and garnered an \nimpressive 1,552 signatures.5\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMemorial and Remonstrance remains the single-greatest justification \nfor religious liberty in American history. The logic contained within \nthe document is unassailable, and Madison's arguments are persuasive \nand eloquent. He steadfastly maintained that the way a person chooses \nto worship God was a matter of personal conscience and could be \ndirected only by reason and conviction.6 Thus, any effort by a \ngovernment to either sanction or prohibit religious beliefs was, in \nfact, an essential act of tyranny.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe memorial further asserted that individuals had a fundamental \nright not to believe in any theology and could not be compelled to \naccept the legitimacy of a given church. Individuals could not be \nforced to tithe or financially support any religious denomination \nthat they did not voluntarily accept as true.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWhilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess and \nto observe the Religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we \ncannot deny an equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet \nyielded to the evidence which has convinced us. If this freedom be \nabused, it is an offense against God, not against man: To God, \ntherefore, not to man, must an account of it be rendered.7\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Jefferson had offered a similar assessment in his Notes on the \nState of Virginia, claiming that a person's religious beliefs were \nwholly outside of the public forum. But it does me no injury for my \nneighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my \npocket nor breaks my leg.8\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Memorial and Remonstrance consisted of 15 paragraphs and \nconcluded with a firm statement.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWe the Subscribers say, that the General Assembly of this \nCommonwealth have no such authority: And that no effort may be \nomitted on our part against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to \nit, this remonstrance; earnestly praying, as we are in duty bound, \nthat the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe, by illuminating those to \nwhom it is addressed, may on the one hand, turn their Councils from \nevery act which would affront his holy prerogative, or violate the \ntrust committed to them: and on the other, guide them into every \nmeasure which may be worthy of his blessing, may redound to their own \npraise, and may establish more firmly the liberties, the prosperity \nand the happiness of the Commonwealth.9\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1through \nMadison's efforts the assessment bill was voted down in the \nlegislature, and its defeat provided the opportunity to resurrect \nThomas Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom, which had been \ntabled since 1779. The legislation passed the General Assembly \nquickly, and James Madison proudly informed Jefferson, I flatter \nmyself [we] have in this Country extinguished for ever the ambitious \nhope of making laws for the human mind.10 These same sentiments \nwould be later codified into federal law with the adoption of the \nFirst Amendment to the Constitution in 1791.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Madison, Jefferson, and the other founders, religion was an \nintensely personal matter. Although secular government had no role in \nsupporting or advancing religion, Madison felt that it was essential \nto the moral order of the World and to the happiness of man.11 \nMoreover, in a letter written in 1822, Madison maintained that \nreligion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of \nGovt.12 Through Madison's efforts, religious liberty in the United \nStates is a fundamental right, and the way, whether, and how one \nchooses to worship God is essentially an act of faith, a personal \nchoice, and not one of statute.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/ Justifying Liberty\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN GLENN, AMERICAN'S LAST HERO?",
    "words": "John Glenn, astronaut and politician, died on December 8th, aged 95 \u0014\n\u0014\nDEC. 9, 2016  The Economist \u0014\n\u0014\nTOO big, too unschooled, too oldonly narrowly did John Glenn gain \nentry to the training programme which would make him Americas space \nhero. To meet NASAs size requirements, he briskly lost 28lb (nearly \n13kg) and even put books on his head to try to squeeze a little off \nhis height.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue, nothing could be done about his lack of academic \nqualifications: he had dropped out of his engineering course in 1941 \nafter learning to fly. But what flying it was: 149 combat missions, \nfirst against Japan in the Pacific, then in the Korean war, returning \nfrom one of them with more than 200 bullet-holes in his planes \nfuselage. It earned him six Distinguished Flying Crosses and 18 \nclusters on his Air Medal. And he was a celebrity already, having \njust made Americas first transcontinental supersonic flight, in a \nrecord three hours 23 minutes, testing a new Air Force fighter.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericas spirits needed lifting in 1959. The Soviet Unions space \nprogramme seemed unstoppable. Communist scientists had put the first \nsatellite, the first dog, and the first man into orbit. Americas \nefforts flared and fizzled on the launch pad. Despite the mishaps, \nthere was intense competition for the privilege of perching in a \nflimsy metal capsule on top of 100-plus tons of rocket fuel. It was a \ncompetition ideally suited made for the clean-cut, God-fearing, \nintensely competitive mid-Westerner. Some found his austere approach \nirritatingthough Mr Glenn insisted he was not the pious saint, nor \nthe other guys the hellions depicted in the film version of Tom \nWolfes The Right Stuff.\u0014\n\u0014\nGloom and ire alike ended on February 20th 1962. To the words \nGodspeed, John Glenn from Mission Control he and Americas spirits \nsoared to the heavens in the Friendship 7 spacecraft. In the space of \nfour hours and 55 minutes he saw three sunrises, orbiting the earth \nat more than 17,000mph.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was puzzled by what looked like fireflies on the window. A sign of \nmalfunction on the spacecraft? A sign of failing eyesight? A \ncelestial mirage, or even (some wondered) a miracle? Later it turned \nout that they were frozen crystals of condensation, catching the \nsunlight.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe run-up had been nerve-racking, with 10 delays stretching over two \nmonths. But once in orbit, a more serious worry dawned. Some controls \nin the capsule had apparently failed, meaning that the astronaut \nwould have to calculate the angle of his re-entry to the earths \natmosphere. Worse (but also wrongly) NASA had received a signal \nsuggesting that the capsules heat shield had broken loose. In the \nfinal minutes of the flight, his pulse raced from 87 to 132.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a flawless splashdown, he reached Cape Canaveral, to be greeted \nand decorated on the spot by President John Kennedy. In New York, 4m \npeople turned out for a ticker-tape parade. Mr Glenn ranked with the \nWright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh in the American pantheon. He \nreceived a standing ovation from a joint session of Congressand was \nso popular, the BBCs Alastair Cooke said only half-jokingly, that he \ncould have abolished the Constitution and been proclaimed president \novernight.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaunch pad\u0014\n\u0014\nHis success had opened the way for the moon landings yet his \npopularity kept him earthbound. Without his knowledge, JFK ruled out \nany more space flights for Americas idolhe was too precious to \nlose. And perhaps more useful elsewhere. The Kennedys urged him to \nenter politics. Frailer souls might have been daunted their fate; in \n1968 it was Mr Glenn, an aide and family friend, who had to break the \nnews to Bobby Kennedys children that their father had been \nassassinated.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis early steps in politics were faltering. But in 1974 he stormed \nthrough the Democratic senate primary in Ohio after his rival, a \nwealthy businessman, implied that the challenger had lacked \nreal-world experience. With cosmic scorn, Mr Glenn suggested that his \nopponent visit a veterans hospital and look those men with mangled \nbodies in the eyes and tell them they didnt hold a job.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was a model senator, with only one whiff of scandal in 24 years, \nwhen he unwisely associated with Charles Keating, a fraudster in \nsearch of a bail-out. A moderate Democrat, he promoted \nenvironmentalism, nuclear non-proliferation and (of course) space \ntravel: it wasnt a question of whether America could afford it, but \nwhether it could afford not to, he argued. He strongly defended \nevolution, saying science and religious belief did not clash: they \nreinforced each other. He had seen more of Gods creation than most \npeople, he would note.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the legislature was his ceiling: he was too dull a speaker, too \nbad at delegating and, oddly for someone so famous, lacked the \nsparkle needed for a real run at the presidency. His only bid for the \nDemocratic nomination, in 1984, crashed amid humiliation and debts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1998, aged 77, he became the oldest person to go into spacein \ntheory to study its ageing effects, but in truth a favour from his \nfriend President Bill Clinton, most reckoned. Few begrudged him his \nlast hurrah. Only at the age of 90 did he give up flying: old people, \nhe said, should not let the calendar dictate their lives.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN BROADUS TAUGHT SERMON MAKING",
    "words": "\u0014\nJohn A. Broadus was famed as a preacher able to present the truths of \nthe Bible so simply that the simplest listeners could understand \nthem. In fact, the first person he led to Christ was a simple-minded \nman who ever afterward said to him, \"Thankee, John\" whenever he saw \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1827, John became a Christian at sixteen when a friend urged \nhim to claim Christ's promise \"All that the Father giveth me shall \ncome to me. And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\" \nJohn did. Thereafter he witnessed, taught Sunday school, lived out \nhis faith and gained what education he could.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe planned to become a doctor. However, a sermon on Christ's parable \nof the talents convinced him he should study to become a minister. He \nwas a minister who did not pastor a great deal, however, \nconcentrating more on seminary teaching, although at one church he \nbaptized 241 converts, including a girl who later became famous as a \nmissionary--Lottie Moon. Although he often filled pulpits, preached \nat conferences and to troops during the Civil War, his life's work \nwas as a professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in \nwhich he taught homiletics (the art of preaching). He often told his \nstudents, \"If you forget everything else I have told you, don't \nforget to treat the Scripture in a commonsense way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust how conscientious he was is shown by the fact that he once \nrevised his entire course notes for a single blind student. He \nstudied the sermons of the most effective preachers of all time to \nlearn how they should be put together. When it looked as if the \nseminary would go under because of the Civil War, John said to the \nother professors, \"...perhaps the seminary may die, but let us \nresolve to die first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn stressed the importance of preaching: \"We know that preaching \ndeserves the highest excellence since it is the chosen instrument of \nthe Savior of the world, who himself came preaching.\" He worked hard \non his own sermons, wearing a path into the grass near the school, \npacing as he fixed key points in mind. He learned what many pastors \nnever learn, to preach so as to persuade listeners to take spiritual \naction based on the truths presented.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an example of his style, take these words from his sermon He Ever \nLiveth to Intercede: \"Here then is hope for us. 'If any man sin,' \nmuch as he ought to deplore it, he need not despair. Our advocate \nwith the Father ever liveth to make intercession for them that come \nunto God through him, and through him we may find mercy. And here is \nno encouragement to sin, but the very contrary. If we truly trust in, \ntruly love our interceding Lord, we shall be supremely anxious for \nhis dear sake to turn from sin, to live for him who died for us; yea \nwho ever lives as our Savior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day March 16, 1895 John Albert Broadus died. True to his \nword, he had done all in his power to keep the seminary alive and it \nlives today. His Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew is one of his \nbetter-known writings and his book On the Preparation and Delivery of \nSermons was widely used as a textbook for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "words": "Back from Captivity, Jews \nCompleted New Temple\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 539 BC, Babylon fell to a coalition of Medes and Persians. The new \nrulers of the Mid East made it their policy to restore captive \nnations to their respective homelands. Among those captives were the \nJews. They returned to Judah with authority to rebuild their temple. \nSeventeen years later, construction still languished, and God raised \nup the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to rebuke the neglect of his \nhouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 520 Haggai preached \"Is it time for you to live in your paneled \nhouses while this house lies in ruin?\" Through Haggai, the Lord asked \nthe Jews how they had fared since their return. \"You have sown much \nand harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, \nbut you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is \nwarm; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with \nholes\" (Haggai 1:6, Revised Standard Version). Haggai said God wanted \nthem to bring wood and rebuild His house.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudah's political and religious leaders listened. Under their \nleadership, the remnant of exiles who had returned to Israel rebuilt \nGod's house, which was completed on this day, March 12, 515 BC But it \nwasn't much to look at.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it not in your sight as nothing?\" the Lord asked them. Well, they \nshould not think that way. God's Spirit was with them. And a day was \ncoming when the Lord would shake Heaven and earth, the sea and the \ndry land. \"I will fill this house with splendor,\" God promised. \"The \nlatter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former,\" said \nthe Lord. \"From this day on, I will bless you,\" he promised.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe temple, rebuilt in 515 BC, was rebuilt yet again by Herod the \nGreat, who restored it in stone and covered it with gold. It was that \ntemple that Christ visited in his life, bringing it glory. A \ngeneration after Christ's death and resurrection, Herod's temple was \ncast down by the Romans. A mosque now stands on its platform.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaggai also prophesied that all the nations would bring their \ntreasures to the temple. That event has not been fulfilled. It awaits \nyet another temple when Christ returns to rule the earth from Zion. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBible. O.T. Haggai. Revised Standard Version.\u0014\nFinegan, Jack.

Prosecutors say Mr. Thomas was kept in a cell with no access \nto water for seven days. Credit Kimberly Perry, via Associated Press \u0014\n\u0014\nCHICAGO  A Wisconsin jail commander repeatedly lied after her \nofficers cut off water to an inmate who later died of dehydration, \nprosecutors said on Monday as they described a series of lethal \nmissteps and a two-year investigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commander, Maj. Nancy Evans, was one of three Milwaukee County \njail officials charged with a felony in connection with the 2016 \ndeath of the inmate, Terrill Thomas, who had no access to water for \nseven days before he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen police make an arrest and they bring somebody into our \ncustody, said District Attorney John T. Chisholm of Milwaukee \nCounty, who announced the charges, there is a fundamental \nobligation to make sure they are kept safe.\u0014\n\u0014\nMajor Evans, who could face more than four years in prison, was \naccused by prosecutors of withholding information from her \nsuperiors, lying to her superiors, failing to preserve evidence, \nrepeatedly lying to law enforcement investigators and lying at the \ninquest last year where jurors recommended criminal charges against \nseven jail employees.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe announcement on Monday of charges against Major Evans and two \nothers  Lt. Kashka Meadors and James Ramsey-Guy, a correctional \nofficer  came more than nine months after that inquest, a relatively \nrare court proceeding in which jurors review evidence relating to a \ndeath and decide whether to recommend charges. The four other jail \nemployees who were faulted by jurors at the inquest are not expected \nto face charges, Mr. Chisholm said, but the investigation was \ncontinuing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMr. Thomas was arrested in April 2016 and accused of shooting a man \nand later firing a gun inside a hotel and casino, \taccording to \nlocal news reports. A federal lawsuit filed by Mr. Thomass estate \nsaid he had bipolar disorder and had been prescribed medication by a \npsychiatrist.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tOnce he was at the jail in downtown Milwaukee, prosecutors said, \nMr. Thomas flooded his cell by stuffing his mattress cover into the \ntoilet. The charging documents said that when Mr. Thomas was moved to \nanother cell, Lieutenant Meadors told Mr. Ramsey-Guy to turn off the \nwater supply to that cell. For the next week, Mr. Thomas did not \nleave his cell, and was not given any water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tHe was literally punished for the manifestations of his mental \nillness, said Erik Heipt, a lawyer for Mr. Thomass estate who has \nfiled a federal lawsuit against Milwaukee County and jail officials. \nHe was not in his right mind. You dont take someone like that and \nthen punish them by turning off their water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAfter Mr. Thomass death, prosecutors said, Major Evans had a guard \nwatch a weeks worth of security video footage of Mr. Thomass cell, \nwhich showed that the water had never been turned back on. \nProsecutors said she did not take steps to preserve that video, and \nit was eventually recorded over and deleted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tMajor Evans was charged with obstructing an officer, a misdemeanor, \nand misconduct in office, a felony. Mr. Ramsey-Guy and Lieutenant \nMeadors were each charged with felony neglect of a resident of a \npenal facility, which can carry more than three years in prison.\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES MADISON'S CONSTITUTION",
    "words": "In popular history, when we think about the formation of American \ndemocracy and its Constitution, the prominent names are Washington \nand Jefferson and Franklin. They, however, were relatively \nunimportant. Washington was an aloof chair of the Continental \nCongress as it wrote the Constitution. Jefferson was in France. \nFranklin was old and irrelevant. It was James Madison who pushed the \nvision of equalityequality before the law and equality of \nopportunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who are opposed to equality of opportunity, who want certain \nopportunities for themselves and not for others, say that opportunity \nequality is an illusion. Only the tall and fast can play in the NBA. \nOnly the highly intelligent can be quantum physicians. Only the brave \ncan be astronauts. Only the skinny can be supermodels. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat, of course, is a red herring, a false comparison. The point of \nMadisons American constitutional democracy is not sameness equality \nbut opportunity equalityyou cannot be barred from the NBA because \nyou are white, from being a quantum physicist because you are a \nwoman, from being an astronaut because your ancestors came to America \nfrom Ireland. If you have the quicks, the smarts, the guts, thats \nall that matters, not your gender or race or religion or national \norigin.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, though, we have a de-facto inequality of opportunity because of \nthe huge wealth gap.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second equality Madison wrote into the Constitution is before the \nlaw. There are not separate laws for Christians and Jews, men and \nwomen, whites and blacks. That, of course, was not true for a long \ntime. We had laws about who could marry whom according to race and \ngender, who could vote according to race and gender, who could live \nin particular communities or go to particular schools according to \nrace and gender.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were like the old-time sumptuary laws, in which only people of a \ncertain class could wear a certain color or a particular style of \nclothing, so that everyone would know who was rich and who was poor, \nwho was nobility and who was common.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe still have de-facto sumptuary laws because of wealth. You cant \nbuy a Tesla or a Mercedes if you are a school teacher. You cant even \nplay golf if you dont have a hundred bucks [or a thousand] for the \ngreens fees. But you cant be barred from buying a BMW because \nyoure of Chinese descent, or because youre a woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nEquality before the law means the legal system is the same for \neverybody. There cant be a law that forbids you to walk on the beach \nbecause youre an accountant. Or makes you sit in the back of the bus \nbecause youre black. There are not different laws--a different \njustice--for rich and poor, black and white, Christian and atheist. \nIf its a crime, its a crime, regardless of who commits it.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least that was the vision of James Madison.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadison was smart enough to know that his Constitution was exactly \nthata vision. It was not a reality, and would not be until people \nbegan to realize that equality was a good thing, for the powerful and \nthe powerless alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nJRMcFARLAND\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN BROADUS TAUGHT PREACHING AND SAVED THE SEMINARY",
    "words": "John Broadus Taught Sermon-Making and Saved a \nSeminary\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn A. Broadus was famed as a preacher able to present the truths of \nthe Bible so simply that the simplest listeners could understand \nthem. In fact, the first person he led to Christ was a simple-minded \nman who ever afterward said to him, \"Thankee, John\" whenever he saw \nhim.\u0014\nBorn in 1827, John became a Christian at sixteen when a friend urged \nhim to claim Christ's promise \"All that the Father giveth me shall \ncome to me. And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\" \nJohn did. Thereafter he witnessed, taught Sunday school, lived out \nhis faith and gained what education he could.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe planned to become a doctor. However, a sermon on Christ's parable \nof the talents convinced him he should study to become a minister. He \nwas a minister who did not pastor a great deal, however, \nconcentrating more on seminary teaching, although at one church he \nbaptized 241 converts, including a girl who later became famous as a \nmissionary--Lottie Moon. Although he often filled pulpits, preached \nat conferences and to troops during the Civil War, his life's work \nwas as a professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in \nwhich he taught homiletics (the art of preaching). He often told his \nstudents, \"If you forget everything else I have told you, don't \nforget to treat the Scripture in a commonsense way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust how conscientious he was is shown by the fact that he once \nrevised his entire course notes for a single blind student. He \nstudied the sermons of the most effective preachers of all time to \nlearn how they should be put together. When it looked as if the \nseminary would go under because of the Civil War, John said to the \nother professors, \"...perhaps the seminary may die, but let us \nresolve to die first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn stressed the importance of preaching: \"We know that preaching \ndeserves the highest excellence since it is the chosen instrument of \nthe Savior of the world, who himself came preaching.\" He worked hard \non his own sermons, wearing a path into the grass near the school, \npacing as he fixed key points in mind. He learned what many pastors \nnever learn, to preach so as to persuade listeners to take spiritual \naction based on the truths presented.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an example of his style, take these words from his sermon He Ever \nLiveth to Intercede: \"Here then is hope for us. 'If any man sin,' \nmuch as he ought to deplore it, he need not despair. Our advocate \nwith the Father ever liveth to make intercession for them that come \nunto God through him, and through him we may find mercy. And here is \nno encouragement to sin, but the very contrary. If we truly trust in, \ntruly love our interceding Lord, we shall be supremely anxious for \nhis dear sake to turn from sin, to live for him who died for us; yea \nwho ever lives as our Savior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day March 16, 1895 John Albert Broadus died. True to his \nword, he had done all in his power to keep the seminary alive and it \nlives today. His Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew is one of his \nbetter-known writings and his book On the Preparation and Delivery of \nSermons was widely used as a textbook for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "title": "JAMES CONES, THE CROSS, AND THE LYNCHING TREE",
    "words": "James Cone, the cross, and the lynching memorial\u0014\nMay 1st, 2018\u0014\nBy Jemar Tisby / Religion News Service\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002(RNS)  On April 26 America received its first-ever memorial \ndedicated to the more than 4,000 victims of lynching in this country. \nTwo days later, James Cone, the acclaimed author of The Cross and the \nLynching Tree, died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in \nMontgomery, Ala., and the passing of a theological legend coincide in \nways that provoke thoughts about the spiritual implications of \nAmerican racism. How do the cross and the lynching tree represent \nboth injustice and redemption? How do we confront the dark truths of \nour past to create a future that is brighter for all people?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the lynching memorial, rusted iron columns hang suspended from the \nceiling. Each column, numbering about 800 in total, represents a \ncounty where a lynching occurred. Many feature multiple names as the \nnumber of human beings killed for their color stacks up to create the \ncrushing weight of an undeniable, yet underrepresented, history.\u0014\n\u0014\nVisitors to the lynching memorial learn that racial terrorists \ndesigned lynching as a public spectacle to intimidate black people.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacial terror was characterized by extreme violence: victims were \ntortured for hours before their brutalized bodies were left out on \ndisplay to traumatize other black people, one placard reads. It goes \non to explain that members of the mob often posed for photographs \nnext to the mutilated corpses of their victims. These horrific \ndisplays served as the primary tool to enforce racial hierarchy in \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe memorial reminds visitors that lynching victims are real people, \nnot simply anonymous figures from history. They have heart-wrenching \nstories such as Luther Holbert who was forced to watch as a white mob \nburned his wife, Mary, alive before they killed him. Others lynched \nElizabeth Lawrence for telling white children not to throw rocks at \nblack children. Lynchers killed Mary Turner, eight months pregnant, \nfor protesting the lynching of her own husband, Hazel Turner. The \nvoyeuristic and violent deaths of these individuals plus thousands \nmore represent the heinous apotheosis of American racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe systematic terrorization of black people created indescribable \ngrief in the past and has contributed to the generational trauma of \nracism today. Against this backdrop of unremitting suffering, black \npeople looked to religion for answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften, however, they found not comfort but affliction. Christianity \nas practiced by white racists and segregationists merely compromised \nwith the status quo. But James Cone refused to assign any \nauthenticity to a religion that claimed to be Christian but did not \naddress the liberation of black people from white supremacy. Cone \nwrote The Cross and the Lynching Tree as a theological response to \nthe extrajudicial murders of black people due to racism.\u0014\n\u0014\nA father of black liberation theology, Cone helped pioneer a field \nthat dealt with the racism at the core of much of American \nChristianity. His journey into black theology began with the social \nupheavals of the mid-1960s. Malcolm X, in particular, had a pivotal \neffect on him. The more he listened to the most well-known prophet of \nthe Nation of Islam, the more disturbed he became by the Eurocentric \nform of Christianity he and other black people practiced.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, the burning theological question was, how can I reconcile \nChristianity and Black Power, Martin Luther King, Jr's idea of \nnonviolence and Malcolm X's 'by any means necessary' philosophy? he \nasked in the book \\Black Theology & Black Power, published in 1969. \nCone's book became his initial public attempt to answer those \nquestions.\u0014\n\u0014\nDecades later in 2011, Cone wrote \\The Cross and the Lynching Tree, \nand it quickly became one of his seminal works. In the book, he \ntraces the parallels between Christ's crucifixion and the persecution \nof black people in America. For Cone, the lynching tree is a visual \nand historic representation of white racist tyranny. Juxtaposed with \nthe cross of Jesus Christ, lynching becomes a kind of crucifixion for \nblack people.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as the religious and political leaders of his day lifted Jesus \nup on a cross to remove his threat to an oppressive hegemony, white \nsupremacists lifted up black people in brutal lynchings designed to \npreserve the racial hierarchy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Jesus and blacks were 'strange fruit', Cone explains. \nTheologically speaking, Jesus was the 'first lynchee,' who \nforeshadowed all the lynched black bodies on American soil.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe shows that black people could understand Christ's suffering by \nrecalling their own sorrow related to the lynching tree. At the same \ntime, the cross provided comfort because black people could know for \ncertain that in his life and death, Christ identified with the \noppressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cross helped me to deal with the brutal legacy of the lynching \ntree, and the lynching tree helped me to understand the tragic \nmeaning of the cross, Cone writes.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Jesus did not remain on the cross. The resurrection represents \nhope out of despair and life out of death. It is the cross that \npoints in the direction of hope, the confidence that there is a \ndimension to life beyond the reach of the oppressor, Cone writes. It \nis to the cross  as the triumph of liberty over lynching  that \nblack people must cling in order to make sense of their plight in \nAmerica.\u0014\nBoth the cross and the lynching memorial invite people into \nsolidarity with the oppressed. Both stand as signs of lethal \ninjustice while also illustrating the possibility of change and \ngrowth. They send a message that hope is not meant for some far-off \ntomorrow; Christians have a responsibility to act today.\u0014\n\u0014\nCone believed in the power of the cross because I have seen with my \nown eyes how that symbol empowered black people to stand up and \nbecome agents of change for their freedom.\u0014\nJames Cone has laid down his cross to take up his eternal rest. The \nlynching memorial in Montgomery challenges a new generation to take \nup the cross of justice today and continue with the struggle for \nblack liberation.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN LELAND'S CHANGING VIEW OF SLAVERY",
    "words": "In 1789, the General Committee of Virginia Baptists turned to \nMassachusetts native John Leland to craft a statement concerning \nslavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn articulate spokesperson for religious liberty among Virginia \nBaptists, Leland produced a stirring statement against slavery. (1) \n\"Slavery is the violent deprivation of the rights of nature, and \ninconsistent with republican government,\" Leland declared, as he \ncalled for \"the use of every legal measure to extirpate this horrible \nevil from the land.\" (2)\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty years later, in 1839, Leland, then living in his home state of \nMassachusetts, called the institution of slavery \"humane, just and \nbenevolent,\" and argued for the rights of slave owners rather than \nthe liberty of slaves. In addition, Leland declared that slavery was \n\"not an article to be settled by legislation.... It belongs to the \nmoral and religious department, and not to the legislative.\" (3)\u0014\n\u0014\nHeld up as a foremost advocate of religious liberty among \npost-Revolutionary-era Baptists, Leland's writings on the subject of \nslavery have long claimed much less attention among scholars. When \nreferenced, historians have tended to point only to Leland's early \nviews on slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeland lived against the backdrop of changing evangelical views \nconcerning slavery. In recent decades, historians have sought to \ninterpret the evangelical transition from antislavery sentiment to \nproslavery views following the Revolutionary era. In In His Image, \nBut ...: Racism in Southern Religion, 1780-1910, H. Shelton Smith \nargued that late eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century evangelical \nviews of slavery were ultimately framed in light of underlying white \nsupremacist views. (4) James D. Essig, in The Bonds of Wickedness: \nAmerican Evangelicals Against Slavery, 1770-1808, concluded that \nmarginalized, ascetic, Revolutionary-era evangelicals opposed slavery \non grounds that it inhibited righteousness, whereas worldly success, \nthe 1808 prohibition of slave trade, and the Second Great Awakening \nblunted opposition to slavery. (5) In Southern Cross: The Beginnings \nof the Bible Belt, Christine Heyrman argued that Baptists and \nMethodists embraced southern proslavery views as a means of \nestablishing a viable presence in the South. (6) John R Daly, in When \nSlavery Was Called Freedom: Evangelicalism, Proslavery, and the \nCauses of the Civil War, concluded that both proslavery and \nantislavery evangelical views stemmed from biblical morality informed \nby individualism and the free market economy. (7)\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite widespread acknowledgement of changing Baptist views on \nslavery, John Leland's evolving position on slavery has gone \nvirtually unnoticed. Bill J. Leonard's recently published \ndenominational history, Baptist Ways: A History, followed this \npattern, briefly noting Leland's opposition to slavery as stated in \nhis early years. (8) Likewise, Robert G. Torbet's A History of the \nBaptists referred only to Leland's early views on slavery. (9) Leon \nMcBeth's The Baptist Heritage: Four Centuries of Baptist Witness made \nno mention of Leland's slavery sentiments. (10) The 1958 Encyclopedia \nof Southern Baptists noted that Leland was concerned about the \n\"humanitarian aspects of slavery and manumission,\" (11) while \nLeonard's 1994 Dictionary of Baptists in America was silent on the \nsubject. (12) Essig argued that the early Leland was a leading \nantislavery Baptist. (13) Smith briefly mentioned the early Leland's \nantislavery views. (14) Heyrman made note of Leland's suspicion of \nthe ecstatic nature of the African-American religious experience, \n(15) while Daly failed to mention Leland altogether. Mechal Sobel, in \nhis seminal Trabelin' On: The Slave Journey to an Afro-Baptist Faith, \nreferred to Leland's early antislavery influence as \"extensive,\" yet \nfailed to explore Leland's later views on slavery. (16)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, one must turn to Brad Creed's dissertation, John Leland: \nAmerican Prophet of Religious Individualism, in order to engage \nLeland's larger views on slavery. Creed concluded that individualism, \na product of the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment, was the \ndefining, overarching framework in which Leland's religious and \npolitical beliefs must be understood. Within this context, Creed did \nnot find a substantial change in Leland's views of slavery, as he \nasserted that Leland consistently hoped for abolition, yet \nsteadfastly refused to be an abolitionist. Noting that Leland's \npolitical views of slavery changed over time, Creed argued that the \nchange was the result of \"extreme individualism,\" and did not negate \nLeland's lifetime opposition to slavery. (17) In short, Leland's \nviews on slavery are both underappreciated and underdeveloped among \nhistorians.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE STRIDENT ANTI-SLAVERY LELAND: 1789-1802\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the decade following Leland's 1789 pronouncement against slavery, \nVirginia Baptists on the local church, associational, and state \nlevels struggled with the issue of slavery, against the backdrop of \nslavery becoming ever more instrumental in a cotton-based southern \neconomy. (18) Leland, who lived in Orange County in north central \nVirginia during the turbulent 1780s, never owned slaves. (19) \nNonetheless, slavery in Virginia made an indelible impression upon \nhim. Following his return to the North in his later years, Leland \ninsisted that anyone who desired to have an informed opinion on \nslavery should first live at least seven years in a slave state. (20)\u0014\n\u0014\nLeland's 1789 Baptist General Committee anti-slavery resolution was \nconsistent with his other slavery-related statements in the middle \nyears of his life. In 1790, Leland wrote \"The Virginia Chronicle,\" a \nbrief history of religion in the state, particularly as related to \nBaptists. Nearly five pages of this relatively short document dealt \nexpressly with the issue of slavery. As did most whites of his day, \nLeland viewed African Americans as an inferior race. His opposition \nto slavery, however, was clear and pointed. He judged the entire \nmatter of slavery to be so vile that \"the whole scene of slavery is \npregnant with enormous evils. On the master's side, pride, \nhaughtiness, domination, cruelty, deceit and indolence; and on the \nside of the slave, ignorance, servility, fraud, perfidy and despair.\" \n(21) Leland's observations led him to call for abolishing slavery. \n\"The sweets of rural and social life will never be well enjoyed, \nuntil it [abolition] is the case.\" (22)\u0014\n\u0014\nLeland was well aware that the sudden emancipation of slaves would \nwreck financial havoc. He also believed that abolishing slavery would \ndestroy Virginian society, and was convinced that the prospect of \ndisruption of social status alone ensured that Virginians would not \nliberate their slaves. (23) Nonetheless, Leland insisted that slavery \nmust come to an end, and quickly. \"It is a question, whether men had \nnot better lose all their property, than deprive an individual of his \nbirth-right blessing-freedom. If a political system is such, that \ncommon justice cannot be administered without innovation, the sooner \nsuch a system is destroyed, the better for the people.\" (24) Leland \ncontinued, \"one thing is pretty certain ... [slaves] could [not] \nserve the whites worse than the whites now serve them. Something must \nbe done! May Heaven point out that something, and may the people be \nobedient.\" (25) Prophetically, Leland declared, \"If they [slaves] are \nnot brought out of bondage, in mercy, with the consent of their \nmasters, I think they will be, by judgment, against their [masters'] \nconsent.\" (26)\u0014\n\u0014\nOne year later, in 1791, on the eve of his departure for New England, \nLeland wrote a \"Letter of Valediction\" to Virginia Baptists, in which \nhe asserted: \"I can never be reconciled to the keeping of them \n[slaves]; nor can I endure to see one man strip and whip another, as \nfree by nature as himself ... slavery, in its best appearance, is a \nviolent deprivation of the rights of nature, inconsistent with \nrepublican government, destructive of every humane and benevolent \npassion of the soul, and subversive to that liberty absolutely \nnecessary to ennoble the human mind.\" (27) Leland longed for the day \nof freedom for slaves and employed powerful biblical imagery of \nliberation: \"How would every benevolent heart rejoice to see the ... \nday appear ... when the poor slaves, with a Moses at their head, \nshould hoist up the standard, and march out of bondage!\" (28)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his parting letter to Virginia Baptists, Leland reserved his final \nwords for his \"black brethren.\" He acknowledged that most slaves were \ndealt with harshly by their masters, and pointed out that the \nmasters' souls were being punished for such evil. Yet, he admonished \nslaves to obey their masters until God sent his deliverance, and he \nexpressed confidence that he would meet them again in heaven, \"where \nyour melodious voices, that have often enchanted my ears and warmed \nmy heart, will be incessantly employed in the praise of our common \nLord.\" (29)\u0014\n\u0014\nMoving back to New England, Leland's attention for the next decade \nwas consumed by other matters, of which religious liberty was \nforemost. In 1802, he again addressed the issue of slavery in a \npolitical speech delivered in Cheshire, Massachusetts. \"Poor \nCreatures! is there no liberty for them? must they forever drag the \ngalling chain of vassalage under their despotic masters? How would \nevery benevolent heart rejoice to see them all emancipated from \nslavery, and enjoy that little pittance of freedom, by nature due to \nthem. May heaven move on the minds of their masters, and open a way \nin Providence to bring them out of bondage, with the consent of their \nmasters, and consistent with good policy.\" (30) Yet in the next \nbreath, Leland shifted his focus from \"personal slavery,\" a new \ndesignation he employed to refer to chattel slavery, to religious \nenslavement, referring to those under bondage of church-state \nalliances: \"Oh! that the day ... may come, when the chains of \npersonal slavery, and the manacles of religious despotism may be \nbroken asunder, and freedom and religion pervade the whole earth.\" \n(31)\u0014\n\u0014\nBruce Gourley\u0014",

Working alone in Mongolia, he poured \nout his heart to his diary: \"preached to 24,000 people, treated 7,500 \npatients, distributed 10,000 books and tracts...and out of all this \nthere are only two men who have openly confessed Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nActually two converts in eight months was double the fruit that he \nhad seen in his first fourteen years on the mission field, in which \nhe had won only one convert.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Gilmour led an unusual--some would say eccentric--life. Born at \nCathkin, Scotland, on this day, June 12,1843, he learned to trust \nChrist from godly parents and grandparents. His mother read him \nstories of missionaries. The boy loved nature and wandered alone \namong the hills and glens of his homeland as he would later wander \nalone in Mongolia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of his parents' prosperity, he was able to afford an \neducation. He worked hard to master his subjects at Glasgow \nUniversity and was his class's outstanding student. Yet to him, \nChristianity was not merely a classroom exercise. Evenings, he went \nalone to speak with workers as they walked home, reminding them of \ntheir eternal souls. His efforts to save others did not stop at \nspeech. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinding a friend drinking, he opened the window and poured the liquor \nonto the ground, remarking that it was better for it to be there than \nin a man who was made in God's image.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1870, he sailed for China, planning to work in Mongolia. Soon \nafter his arrival, 22 Roman Catholic priests were massacred. Gilmour \nwas willing to die if it advanced God's work, but fortunately calm \nprevailed. In August 1870, he was able to set out for Mongolia.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe learned Mongolian and engaged in years of seemingly fruitless \nevangelism. The common folk accepted him because he came with all his \ngoods in a backpack just as their own lamas did. His expenses \naveraged just six cents a day. But such poverty barred him from inns. \nEventually he had to rent a mule just to appear high enough in caste \nto be accepted as a guest. He healed the sick with simple remedies. \nMedicine became his main tool for touching lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nGilmour began to pray for a helper. He saw a portrait of a young \nwoman. Convinced that God meant her for him, he wrote asking her to \nmarry him. No other correspondence had passed between them and they \nhad never met. Miss Emily Prankard prayed for guidance and was \nconvinced God meant the marriage to happen and accepted Gilmour, \nsight unseen. Is it eccentric to accept God's advice? \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were happy. She braved Mongolia's dust storms and tiresome \nmutton with him, quickly learning the language. Gilmour considered \nher a better missionary than himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nEleven years and two sons later, Emily died. Gilmour sent the boys \nback to Scotland to be reared by their grandparents. Worn out with \ntravels and lack of necessities, he died in North China at age 47 \nfrom a severe and sudden case of Typhus Fever.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGilmour, James.

Still others \nmoved far away to the North.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the freed-persons was Virginia native John Henry Jack Yates \n(1828-97), his wife, Harriet, and their 11 children.\u0014\nBorn into slavery, Yates was one of the few slaves who learned to \nread and write, in addition to acquiring carpentry skills.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing emancipation, the Yates family moved to Houston, where Jack \nbecame a wagon driver and a Baptist preacher, ministering to \nfreed-persons moving into the area.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn January 1866, Yates became the founding pastor of the Antioch \nMissionary Baptist Church, the first black Baptist church organized \nin Houston.\u0014\nJuneteenth Celebrates Freedom from Slavery, Respects Cultures\u0014\nBy Bruce T. Gourley | June 19, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nCommitted to the education of freed-persons, Yates and his \ncongregation allowed the Freedmens Bureau to use their building as a \nschool site.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn June 19, 1866, Texas freed-persons celebrated the anniversary of \nthe announcement of their liberation. Anniversary celebrations became \nan annual holiday, Juneteenth.\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially observed in rural areas and often on the grounds of black \nchurches, the daylong event, replete with food and recreation, also \nbecame a pilgrimage and reunion for many former Texas slaves who had \nmoved elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Rev. Yates in 1872 raised the funds to buy land in Houston \nfor a public park for freedmen. Thereafter, Houstons Juneteenth \ncelebrations were held in Emancipation Park.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing the turn of the 20th century, and with the coming of age of \na new generation of African Americans, the Texas tradition of \nJuneteenth declined, little observed for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome civil rights demonstrators in the early 60s wore Juneteenth \nbadges. But not until the Poor Peoples March on Washington in 1968 \ndid Juneteenth experience a true resurrection and became popular \nbeyond Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning on May 30, 1968, marchers from throughout America began \njourneying to the nations capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the more prominent marchers, a group from Marks, Mississippi, \ntraveled 1,000 miles to D.C. in a caravan of 28 wagons pulled by 56 \nmules. They arrived on Juneteenth, replete with a parade down \nPennsylvania Avenue.\u0014\n\u0014\nMade aware of the significance of Juneteenth, some D.C. marchers \nafterward initiated observances of the tradition in their communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1980, and thanks to the effort of Al Edwards, an African American \nstate legislator, Juneteenth was declared an official state holiday \nin Texas.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards, who became known as Mr. Juneteenth, thereafter became a \nnational ambassador for promoting the observance of June 19 as a day \nof celebrating and honoring African American freedom, achievement, \nhistory and culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, all but four states officially recognize Juneteenth as a \nholiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Juneteenth organizations exist for fostering the memory and \nobservance of Juneteenth, while major cultural institutions, such as \nthe Smithsonian, sponsor activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe holiday is celebrated by Americans of all ethnicities and fosters \nrespect for all cultures.\u0014",

    "words": "Julian the Apostate Couldn't Defeat Christ\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nEmperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, \nif a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, \nJune 27, 363.* Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just \ntwo years of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he bled, the dying emperor groaned, \"You have conquered, O \nGalilean\"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later \nreports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had \nassassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they \nhad reason to. \u0014\n\u0014\nJulian had struggled to end the power of Christians in the Roman \nEmpire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine won a key \nvictory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had steadily \ngrown.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had \nbeen brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader \n(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led \nChristians to call him \"Julian the Apostate.\" (An apostate is one who \nfalls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?\u0014\n\u0014\nA gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic \ncivilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who \nused magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason that may have influenced Julian was that a \"Christian\" \nemperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although \nJulian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed \nall Christians for the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, \nJulian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to \nsupremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He \ndeveloped a pagan priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions \n(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his \nrejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not \naccept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another \nmove apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their \nJewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in \nJerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true \nheritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged \nthe pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, \nnoting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for \nthe pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral \nadvantage among their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had \njudged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the \nabrupt end of their perks and plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Historians disagree on this date. Will Durant, Christian History, \nand other sources give the 27th, but Encyclopedia Britannica and the \nCatholic Encyclopedia give the 26th.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "As the battle between Catholics and Protestants seesawed back and \nforth, the Jews assumed a great importance to both sides. Their \nlearning, idealism, and ethical conduct were esteemed by millions of \nChristians who did not believe all the slurs against the Jews. Both \nCatholics and Protestants felt it would be a persuasive argument for \nmillions of waverers between Catholicism and Protestantism if the \nJews would join their side.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was with superb confidence that Luther asked the Jews to join him \nand the Lutherans. In an article entitled, \"That Jesus Was Born a \nJew,\" dated 1523, Luther wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nFor they [the Catholics] have dealt with the Jews as if they were \ndogs and not human beings. They have done nothing for them but curse \nthem and seize their wealth. I would advise and beg everybody to deal \nkindly with the Jews and to instruct them in Scriptures: in such a \ncase we could expect them to come over to us We must receive them \nkindly and allow them to compete with us in earning a livelihood ...\u0014\nand if some remain obstinate, what of it? Not everyone is a good \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe refusal of the Jews to accept his sincere offer came to him as an \nunexpected and cruel blow, and he turned bitterly against them. In \nfairness to Luther, it must be said that by this time he was a sick \nman, disillusioned by many setbacks and betrayed by many friends. He \nturned not only against the Jews, but also against the German \npeasants who were using Protestantism to free themselves from \nserfdom. Nobody was listening to him any longer, except the devoutly \nreligious. The others were using his Protestantism for their own \neconomic and political ends.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Jews, God and HIstory, p. 233.\u0014",

    "words": "John Adams Lost His Re-Election. How He Responded Set a Precedent \nThat's Been Followed for More Than 200 Years\u0014\n\u0014\ncirca 1790: John Adams (1735 - 1826) second president of the United \nStates of America.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nBY R. B. BERNSTEIN / HISTORY NEWS NETWORK \u0014\n \u0014\nSEPTEMBER 10, 2020 \u0014\n\u0014\nThis post is in partnership with the History News Network, the \nwebsite that puts the news into historical perspective. A version of \nthe article below was originally published at HNN.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents of the Presidency honor George Washington for establishing \nthat two terms as president were enough for any man. The precedent he \nset, the two-term tradition, bound his successors, even those who \nwanted more time in office, until Franklin D. Roosevelt won a third \nterm in 1940. In 1946 Congress proposed, and in 1951 the states \nratified, the 22nd Amendment, writing Washingtons legacy into the \nnations fundamental law.\u0014\n\u0014\nRight after Washington, in 1801, John Adams did something just as \nmomentous, just as reaffirming of democratic constitutional \nprinciple. After losing the presidential election of 1800 to his \nformer friend and political rival Thomas Jefferson, Adams decided \nthat losing an election, even one for the presidency, means what it \nsays. Adams went home. He did not dig in his heels and try to stay in \noffice. Nor did he propose to play with the elections date. Nor did \nhe listen to hints by fellow members of his Federalist party that he \nlet them keep him in office as a caretaker president while the House \nof Representatives wrestled to resolve the electoral deadlock between \nJefferson and Aaron Burr. Adams made his plans clear. As his term of \noffice was to end on March 4, 1801, he would stay in office not one \nminute past noon on March 4. He wanted no part of schemes or cabals. \nHe wanted retirement. And he was going to embrace it.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Adams had had a rough time as the nations second president. He \nfound the office frustrating beyond measure, largely because the \nmembers of his cabinet were loyal to Washington or to Alexander \nHamilton rather than to him. His popularity with the people was shaky \nand uncertain. Private family unhappiness, including his wifes \nfragile health and his son Charles early death, shadowed his acts as \na public man. Even so, he compiled an estimable record as president, \nconvincing him that he deserved a second term. Staving off war with \nFrance, he established peace between the two nations. He also \nre-established control over his administration by firing his cabinet. \nEven after his defeat, he appointed John Marshall as chief justice, \nthat offices greatest holder in U.S. history.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdams was profoundly committed to constitutional and political \nprinciple. That principle fitted with personal inclination. He had no \ndesire to ignore constitutional terms of office and he had no desire \nto behave, let alone look, like an American monarch. He made no \nmention in his correspondence of any suggestion that he should occupy \nthe presidency beyond the constitutional end of his term. He assured \nhis youngest son, Thomas Boylston Adams, in the summer of 1800, when \ndefeat loomed, Be not concerned for me. I feel my shoulders relieved \nfrom a Burthen. The Short remainder of my days will be the happiest \nof my Life. Perhaps he also thought that his adamant decision to \nstep down would pressure the wrangling members of the House to \nresolve the deadlock between Jefferson and Burr, forcing a \nconstitutional solution to the constitutional tangle. Besides, \nAbigail was waiting in Quincy. He had not seen her in months, since \nshe departed Washington, D.C., which she loathed, for Quincy. He \nmissed her.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore dawn on the morning of March 4, John Adams left the executive \nmansion and began the arduous two-week journey home by stagecoach and \nboat. He never left Quincy again. For 25 years, he read, wrote, \nargued, reflected and philosophized about politics, government, \nhistory, religion and his life and career. He carried on a bitter \nquarrel in print with a foe long dead, Alexander Hamilton. He \nentertained himself by exchanging dozens of letters with such old \nfriends as Benjamin Rush and Benjamin Waterhouse, and revived an old \nfriendship by exchanging more letters with Thomas Jefferson. And he \nnamed his house twiceonce as Peacefield, to commemorate his success \nin making peace with France in 1800, and once as Montezillo (little \nhill), in affectionate satire of Thomas Jeffersons Monticello \n(little mountain). As the Sage of Quincy, he taught us how to live, \nand then he taught us how to die.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one thing that he never did was to voice a word of regret about \nleaving the presidency at his terms end. None of his successors has \never violated or dishonored the precedent he established. And, if we \nare fortunate, none ever will.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nR. B. Bernstein teaches political science at City College of New \nYork. His most recent book is The Education of John Adams (Oxford \nUniversity Press).\u0014",

    "words": "Death of Soul-winning Merchant, John Wanamaker\u0014\n\u0014\nOn March 12, 1888, fifty year old John Wanamaker laboriously \nhand-copied letters to each member of his large Sunday School \nclass--a Sunday school which he had founded. The central thought of \nthe letter was, \"If you are not saved my dear friend--flee to the \nmerciful Savior, as you would fly, into this warm room tonight out of \nthe cold streets & the drifting snow. -- If you are saved -- humbly \ntrusting in what Jesus did when his loved failed not on the Cross -- \nthink of others not saved -- NOT SAVED -- going to the eternal \ndarkness -- your near friend, your relative -- and do something!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of his life, John Wanamaker did something--not only toward \nconverting people but in making American business what it became. A \nPresbyterian, he was a strong advocate of the YMCA in the years when \nits chief concern was to convert men to Christ. He was so successful \nin promoting the organization that its backers named him national \nsecretary. But John married and had to find work that would support \nhis family. A go-getter (he took his first job as an errand boy at \nage thirteen for the salary of $1.25 a week) John and a partner \nbought a men's clothing business.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a flair for big projects, John bought an abandoned rail depot \nand tried to coax other merchants to open shops in the building. When \nhe couldn't persuade others to take the risk, he set up his own \nshops, creating one of the first successful department stores in the \nnation. His building even had a wireless telegraph--and consequently \nwas the first station in the United States to learn of the sinking of \nthe Titanic. John was a leader in advertising, in money-back \nguarantees and in offering his employees benefits such as pensions, \nlife insurance, and vacations. His New York store was the first to \ndisplay electric Christmas lights.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough it all, John's concern for souls continued. During the Civil \nWar, he was a strong supporter of the United States Civil Commission, \nan agency which brought medical and spiritual comfort to soldiers. He \ngave enormous sums to charities, such as the Children's Wing of \nPhiladelphia's Presbyterian hospital. He devoted Sundays to religious \nwork. \"If you once have the joy and sweet pleasure of bringing one \nsoul to Christ, you will be hungry to get another,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked in an interview how he managed to carry the load of his many \ntasks (which, in addition to everything else, included a strong \ncommitment to Masonry), John replied, \"When I weary of one detail, I \nturn to another, and there is rest of mind in that.\" He advised, \"Do \nthe very best you can and leave the rest to Providence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a soul-winner, he believed he did not have to work alone. \"When \nyou have faith enough & love enough to start out in the effort to \nbring a soul to the Savior -- God the Holy Ghost joins in your \neffort, for God wants every one saved & He works with even the \npoorest instrument that engages in His work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn died on this day, December 12, 1922.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Brother John Wanamaker.\" Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. \nhttp://www.pagrandlodge.org/mlam/wanamaker/\u0014\nExecutive Committee of the International Sunday school Association. \nDevelopment of the Sunday School.

    "title": "JOSEPH MOHR'S FAMOUS CAROL \"SILENT NIGHT\"",
    "words": "Joseph Mohr's Famous \"Silent Night\" Carol\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Mohr was born in the city of Salzburg, Austria on the 11th of \nDecember, 1792. He was an illegitimate child--his mother's third. She \neventually had four. A child who grew up to have a name that will \nforever be associated with the Christmas season.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents of history remember that in 1792, King Louis XVI of France \nwent on trial for treason before the Revolutionary Convention that \nhad replaced the French National Assembly. His head would roll the \nfollowing January. But on this day, December 11, 1792, a few days \nbefore Christmas--the same day, in fact, that the French king faced \nhis cruel judges--a much quieter event took place. Joseph Mohr was \nborn in Salzburg. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of his birth, it appeared his name would be associated \nwith nothing but disgrace. When Franz Joseph Mohr learned he'd gotten \nAnn Schoiberin pregnant, he fled the home and deserted the army, \nleaving the mother to face the music alone, including a steep fine. \nShe was a knitter who earned little. It would have taken her a full \nyear's wage to pay the penalty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe town's brutal executioner stepped into the picture. He would pay \nthe fine and become the child's godfather. He hoped by doing this to \nimprove his own reputation. But little Joseph's life now bore another \nstigma: godson of the feared and hated executioner. He was banned \nfrom attending school or learning a trade, or even from holding a job.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe loved to sing. While playing on steps leading up to a Capuchin \nmonastery, he was overheard singing by Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, a \nBenedictine monk and cathedral choirmaster. Hiernle thought the boy's \nvoice was so good, he could not bear to see it wasted. He found Ann \nSchoiber and arranged for Mohr to study with his elite group of \nstudents.\u0014\n\u0014\nHiernle's kindness was not wasted. Mohr proved to be an outstanding \npupil and mastered the organ, violin and guitar by the time he was \ntwelve. He always placed in the top quarter of the class. His \ntraining continued and he was ordained a priest in 1815.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of his life, he was assigned duties in many towns. \nBut it was while he was yet a young assistant in Oberndorf that he \nwon lasting fame. He wrote the words to a new Christmas carol and \nasked the church organist, Franz Gruber, to set them to music. On \nChristmas Eve, 1818, the two first sang what has since become the \nmost popular Christmas carol of all time: \"Silent Night, Holy Night.\" \nThirty years later, on December 4, 1848, Joseph Mohr died of lung \ndisease.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Silent Night\" captures the awesome humility of a God who stooped not \njust to the level of mankind, but to the lowest level--born among \nanimals and announced to common shepherds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his last priestly post, at Wagrain, Mohr opened a school which \ntook in poor children. He gave virtually his entire income to this \nproject and died as poor as he was born. But he left us the riches of \n\"Silent Night\" which has been translated into 200 languages. Millions \nwho have never given a thought to Louis XVI sing Joseph Mohr's words \nevery Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn December 4, 1848, Joseph Mohr died of lung disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBell, Mrs. Arthur.

    "title": "JOSEPHINE BUTLER CHAMPIONED WOMEN",
    "words": "Josephine Butler Championed Women\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Six-year-old Eva Butler was excited. Mom and dad were home. She \nrushed to the staircase to greet her parents--and lost her footing. \nIn front of her mother's horrified eyes, she fell over the bannister \nonto the hard tile floor to her death. Josephine would never erase \nthat haunting sight from her memory. \"It was pitiful to see her, \nhelpless in her father's arms, her little drooping head resting on \nhis shoulder and her beautiful golden hair all stained with blood, \nfalling over his arm!\" But rather than retire into a half-mad world \nof grief and nostalgia, she turned her attention outward. \"[I] became \npossessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain \nkeener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe started to work with the prostitutes of Liverpool. Many had \nbecome street women out of desperation. Josephine was a beautiful \nupper-class woman, well-to-do with many connections. She opened a \nhome to reclaim lost women. As she learned more about their \ncondition, she became increasingly indignant at the unfair laws of a \nsystem that refused women the right to vote. Women should not be \ndenied the vote because they are different than men, she argued. They \nshould be given the vote precisely for that reason, because their \nneeds are different. She became a champion for women.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosephine, who had undergone a strong conversion experience as a \nteenager, needed the strength of faith in her lifelong battle for \nlaws favorable to women. She took on the Contagious Diseases Acts \nthat aimed to stop the spread of venereal disease. Under these laws, \nany woman in designated military towns could be forcibly inspected \nfor venereal disease. The law was completely unfair. Men were not \nexamined. Any woman, however pure, could be denounced to the \nauthorities and forced to get a certificate. Her reputation ruined, \nthe woman might actually be forced into the sex trade. \"This \nlegalization of vice, which is the endorsement of the 'necessity' of \nimpurity for man and the institution of slavery of woman, is the most \nopen denial which modern times have seen of the principle of the \nsacredness of the individual being,\" Josephine declared. She warned \nthat if a woman's rights could be stolen, so could anyone's.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she stood up to speak against outrageous practices, Josephine \nwas slandered. Her enemies heckled and harassed her. They smeared her \nwith dung. A mob smashed the windows of a hotel where she was \nstaying, trying to get at her and threatening to set it on fire. She \nfled through unfamiliar streets and hid behind piles of soap and \ncandles in a shop. Another time, she hid in a hayloft while her \nopponents lit a fire to smoke her out. Her husband's college job was \nthreatened but he encouraged her on. When his wife sheltered fallen \nwomen in their home, he treated them like high society ladies.\u0014\n\u0014\nFar from retreating, Josephine expanded her activities. \"...I felt \nvery weak and lonely,\" she admitted. \"But there was One who stood by \nme.\" She fought similar laws in Europe. In an age that tried to cover \nup sexual problems, she had the courage to address them openly. She \nfought against forced prostitution and appealed to governments not to \nlicense whorehouses. A government should never be in the sin \nbusiness, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile fighting government-sponsored prostitution, she always stood \nbeside the prostitutes. If Christ forgave such women, so should we, \nshe argued. Josephine succeeded in getting some hateful laws repealed \nand helped rouse public sentiment to pass a bill that raised the age \nof consent from thirteen to sixteen. However, she was largely \nforgotten when she died on this day, December 30, 1906.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Josephine. \"Some Thoughts on the Present Aspect of the \nCrusade Against the State Regulation of Vice.\" \nhttp://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/butler/ thoughts.html\u0014\nFisher, Trevor. \"Josephine Butler, Feminism's Neglected Pioneer.\" \nhttp://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m1373/n6_v46/ \n18381679/p1/article.jhtml?term=w.t.stead\u0014\nHay-Cooper, L.

    "words": "JOHN PIPER'S SON TAKES TO TIKTOK TO DENOUNCE EVANGELICALISM \u0014\nMilton Quintanilla | Contributor for ChristianHeadlines.com | \nWednesday, April 14, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Piper's son speaks out against evangelicalism on TikTok\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Piper, the son of popular theologian and best-selling author \nJohn Piper, has become a rising star on TikTok, where he speaks out \non a variety of topics, including critiquing evangelical Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nPiper, an artist in Minneapolis, Minnesota, posted his first TikTok \nvideo in November. He has since amassed close to one million \nfollowers and 14.8 million likes on the popular video-sharing \nplatform. Pipers TikTok content was also featured in the New York \nTimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one video, as reported by Faithwire, Piper questioned, Is it even \npossible for the universe to have a meaning?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor anything to matter, we have to matter to ourselves first. And if \nwe all matter to ourselves, then there cant be one single ultimate \nmeaning, he contended.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, threatening hell for not believing in the Christian \nGod proves that its our own fear of pain that motivates us, he \nargued. We are the most fundamental things that matter to ourselves. \nEven if we choose to behave as if something is more valuable than us, \nwere doing it because its what we feel like doing, so were still \nwhat matters most to ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another TikTok video, Piper responded to someone who asked why his \ncontent has turned more and more to attacking Christianity, adding, \nIts getting really hard to believe the love everyone you teach.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont attack Christianity, he argued. I berate evangelicalism, \nfundamentalism. Its a destructive, narrow-minded worldview. And one \nof the most destructive, narrow-minded aspects of it is that its \nadherents feel as if they are the entirety of Christianity rather \nthan the tiny sliver of it that they actually are.\u0014\n\u0014\nPiper also denounced fundamentalism as bizarre [and] \nanti-intellectual.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2009, John Piper, who served as pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church \nfor 33 years, explained that Abraham first fell away from \nChristianity at 19 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time, the elders of Bethlehem Baptist Church pursued \nAbraham, but he was later excommunicated when he didn't come back to \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to The Times, the preachers son would return to the faith \nfour years later before ultimately leaving it for good.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer. He is also the co-hosts of \nthe For Your Soul podcast, which seeks to equip the church with \nbiblical truth and sound doctrine\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN HERSCHEL LAID TO REST BESIDE ISAAC NEWTON",
    "words": "John Herschel Laid to Rest beside Newton\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Herschel was bullied at school so his parents had him tutored at \nhome. Born the only child of the astronomer William Herschel, who \ndiscovered Uranus and cataloged the objects of the northern sky, John \ngrew up knowing the most famous scientists of his day. The young man \nshot past his rivals in mathematics and science. At Cambridge, he \nplaced first in mathematics exams. At twenty-one, he became the \nyoungest person admitted to the Royal Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraveling the European continent, he met other great scientists. He \nwas so impressed with French mathematics that he translated three \nvolumes worth of papers into English. Abandoning Newton's clumsy \ncalculus, he adopted the clearer system created by Newton's German \nrival, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and convinced the English to do so, \ntoo. These were small potatoes for the man who became world-famous as \nan astronomer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Herschel had urged his son to enter the ministry, which he \nsaw as a safe civil service career. John balked. He tried his hand at \nlaw instead. When his father died, John used his inheritance to \nstrike out on his own. He sailed to South Africa with his wife, \nMargaret Stewart to scan the southern skies as William had scanned \nthe northern. The pair lived there for several years. The British \ngovernment offered John a salary, but he refused it, preferring to \nstick to his own researches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith techniques learned from his father, John ground lenses and built \nsome of the largest telescopes in the world. Through these scopes, he \ncompared stellar magnitudes (true brightness) by contrasting them \nwith the moon's image which he reduced to a pinprick for contrast. \nJohn was fascinated with double stars. He logged over 1,200 new \nexamples. The importance of double stars (binaries) is that they \nrotate around each other. By observing their rotations, he could \ncalculate their masses and prove that Newton's laws applied to \ndistant stellar bodies.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn also cataloged many nebulae (gas clouds and galaxies) and showed \nthat most consisted of faint stars. He made calculations of the \ndensity of the Milky Way and tried to determine its structure. He \ntied together all of the day's astronomical knowledge in a popular \ntextbook. Space does not permit us to list all of his contributions \nto science and technology. For example, when he heard the first \nreport on daguerreotype photography, he was able to develop a similar \nprocess within a week and to create a completely new photographic \nprocesses afterwards.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was happy with his wife, Margaret Stewart. She was the daughter \nof a Scottish Presbyterian. Under Margaret's influence, John \nunderwent a genuine conversion experience. Men like John Herschel \ngive the lie to the notion that great scientists cannot be genuine \nChristians. His faith fired him with zeal for educational reforms in \nSouth Africa--zeal that spurred the development of public education \nin that nation. One reason that John wanted public education was \"to \nfit [students] for a higher state of existence, by teaching them \nthose [things] which connect them with their Maker and Redeemer.\" He \nsaid of the Bible, \"All human discoveries seem to be made only for \nthe purpose of confirming more and more strongly the truths that come \nfrom on high and are contained in the sacred writings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his death, on this day, May 12, 1871, Sir John Herschel was laid \nto rest in Westminster Abbey alongside Sir Isaac Newton.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "title": "JOHN PENRY PLEADED FOR WELSH SOULWINNERS",
    "words": "John Penry Pleaded for Welsh Soulwinners\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Penry wept for Wales. In Elizabeth's England, there were far too \nfew pastors assigned to teach the Welsh, and of those, many were \nabsentees from their flocks or little better than rogues. Penry wrote \nEquity of a Humble Supplication in Behalf of the Country of Wales \nthat Some Order May Be Taken for the Preaching of the Gospel Among \nThose People. He complained that thousands in Wales had almost never \nheard of Christ. \"O destitute and forlorn condition! Preaching itself \nin many parts is unknown. In some places a sermon is read once in \nthree months.\" He proposed a system of lay pastors supported in part \nwith voluntary gifts from the people. His attack on the neglectful \npractices of the Church of England won Penry the undying enmity of \nJohn Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving become a Puritan separatist in his thinking, Penry could not \naccept a state-run system, because, as he phrased it, \"The truth of \nChrist and ministry of Christ as it is his will be in bondage unto no \nantichristian power. If it be, it is antichrist's truth and \nministry.\" Because of such outspoken views, and his stern warnings to \nthe queen and her bishops, Penry had to flee at times. Eventually he \nwould be hanged, making him a hero and martyr in Wales.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat sealed his doom was The Marprelate Tracts. These were satirical \nexposs larded with heavy-handed taunts at English bishops (\"petty \npopes\"), coarse talk (\"Printed overseas, in Europe, within two \nfurlongs of a bouncing priest\") and silly sneers (\"Ha, ha, Dr. \nCopycat!\"). Their theme can be summed up in the words of the first \ntract: \"Leave you your wickedness and I'll leave the revealing of \nyour knaveries.\" An example of the knavery was confiscation of stolen \ncloth by one bishop for his own use. \"Well, one or two of the thieves \nwere executed and at their deaths confessed that to be the cloth \nwhich the bishop had, but the dyers could not get their cloth, nor \ncannot unto this day...\" Penry was thought to have a hand in \npreparing the popular pamphlets although he denied it. While it is \ntrue that they were printed on the same press as his books, the \ngeneral consensus today is that he did not write them. They weren't \nhis style.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptured, he was treated to a travesty of justice. Some strong words \nof warning against Elizabeth in his notebook were interpreted as \ntreason. Archbishop Whitgift was the first to sign his death warrant. \nPenry was hauled off to be hanged on this day, May 29, 1593.

    "title": "JEWS, LIES AND NAZIS",
    "words": "Set fire to their synagogues or schools, Martin Luther wrote in On \nthe Jews and Their Lies (1543). Jewish houses should be razed and \ndestroyed, and prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such \nidolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, [should] be taken \nfrom them. In addition their rabbis [should] be forbidden to teach \non pain of loss of life and limb. Luther also urged that \nsafe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews, \nthat all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them, \nand that a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade be put into their hands so \nyoung, strong Jews and Jewesses could earn their bread in the \nsweat of their brow. These fierce comments have puzzled and \nembarrassed many Christians and led to charges that Luther paved the \nway for Hitler. \u0014\n\u0014\n(20 YEARS EARLIER)\u0014\nIn 1523 Luther had accused Catholics of treating Jews as if they \nwere dogs. He added,\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we really want to help them, we must be guided in our dealings \nwith them not by papal law but by the law of Christian love. We must \nreceive them cordially, and permit them to trade and work with us, \nhear our Christian teaching, and witness our Christian life. If some \nof them should prove stiff-necked, what of it? After all, we \nourselves are not all good Christians either.\u0014\nDeserted by God?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as time went on, rumors of Jewish efforts to convert Christians \nupset Luther, and he vented his frustration. He concluded that \nconverting Jews had become hopeless: A Jewish heart is as hard as a \nstick, a stone, as iron, as a devil. Luther accepted the common \nbelief that God had turned his attention to the new Israel, the \nChristian Church. He did not hold Jews responsible for the death of \nChrist, writing in a hymn, We dare not blame . . . the band of Jews; \nours is the shame. And he felt that at least a few Jews might be won \nfor Christ. Yet he did not want fellowship or patience with \nobstinate [Jewish] blasphemers and those who defame this dear \nSavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nBlasphemy was a civil crime. To allow it to continue, Luther feared, \nmeant Christians would share in the guilt for it. Thus he proposed \nseven measures of sharp mercy for German princes to take against \nJews and advised clergy, congregations, and government officials to \nhelp carry them out. Most Jews had already been expelled from Germany \nbefore 1536; yet a harsh anti-Jewish measure in 1543 mentioned his \ntreatise. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth friends and foes criticized Luthers anti-Semitic statements, \nbut he persisted. He repeated as true the worst charges from medieval \nliterature: Jews killed Christian babies; they murdered Christ over \nand over again by stabbing Eucharistic hosts; they poisoned wells. \nThe aging, cantankerous Luther declared in the 1540s the very thing \nhe had denounced Catholics for saying in 1523: Jews were dogs. We \nare at fault for not slaying them, he fumed shortly before his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther had taught his students that one cannot and should not \nspeculate about the will of the hidden God, for what God has not \nrevealed cannot be known. But many believe that here he violated his \nown theological method and fell victim to what his friend Melanchthon \ncalled the rabies of theologians. His arguments against Jews were \ntheological, not biological. But they became more treacherous when \nFrench cultural anthropologist Arthur de Gobineau (18161882) \nproposed that humankind consists of inferior Semites and superior \nAryans. European intellectuals and politicians adopted de \nGobineaus views and read them back into Luthers. Nazis would call \nLuther a genuine German who had hated non-Nordic races.\u0014",

    "title": "JULIAN THE APOSTATE COULDN'T DEFEAT CHRIST",
    "words": "Julian the Apostate Couldn't Defeat Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, \nif a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, \nJune 27, 363. Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just two \nyears of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he bled, the dying emperor groaned, \"You have conquered, O \nGalilean\"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later \nreports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had \nassassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they \nhad reason to. Julian had struggled to end the power of Christians in \nthe Roman Empire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine \nwon a key victory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had \nsteadily grown.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had \nbeen brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader \n(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led \nChristians to call him \"Julian the Apostate.\" (An apostate is one who \nfalls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?\u0014\n\u0014\nA gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic \ncivilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who \nused magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason that may have influenced Julian was that a \"Christian\" \nemperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although \nJulian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed \nall Christians for the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, \nJulian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to \nsupremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He \ndeveloped a pagan priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions \n(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his \nrejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not \naccept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another \nmove apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their \nJewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in \nJerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true \nheritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged \nthe pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, \nnoting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for \nthe pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral \nadvantage among their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had \njudged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the \nabrupt end of their perks and plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Historians disagree on this date.

    "title": "JAMES STEPHEN AND THE BATTLE OF SLAVERY",
    "words": "James Stephen and Battle to Abolish Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Stephen had a law practice in the West Indies. One day, he \nwitnessed two black slaves accused of rape and condemned on the \nflimsiest evidence. They were burned alive. This so horrified Stephen \nthat he began a correspondence with the famed slavery abolitionist \nWilliam Wilberforce. Secretly he provided Wilberforce with \ninformation about slavery in the islands. In time, Stephen would \nbecome a leader in the Clapham sect, a group of mostly evangelical \nChristians working with Wilberforce. He wrote several influential \nbooks against the slave trade.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day June 30, 1758, Stephen struggled through financial \ndifficulties to get an education. As a young man he did not seem a \nlikely candidate for leadership in any evangelical group; engaged to \nbe married to one woman, he betrayed both her and his closest friend, \nfathering an illegitimate child with his friend's fianc. His manners \nwere coarse, his language rough, and he flew into sudden rages.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, after meeting with Wilberforce, he became a true follower of \nChrist. When his his first wife died, he married Wilberforce's \nsister, Sally. Wilberforce wrote, \"Stephen is an improved and \nimproving character, one of those whom religion has transformed and \nin whom it has triumphed by conquering some natural infirmities.\" \nMeanwhile, Stephen had been elected to Parliament and was a close \nally of Wilberforce in the fight against slavery. (At a crucial \nmoment in the abolition battle, his beloved wife Sally slipped on ice \nand broke her leg; it grieved James Stephen that he had to leave her \nill-attended rather than let the cause down in Parliament.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Stephen's fertile mind which came up with two ideas that \nhelped break the deadlock over ending the slave trade. The first of \nthese was during the struggle with Napoleon. He suggested extending \nanti-slavery language to a bill which was certain of support because \nit was viewed as a war measure, designed to stop neutral ships from \ndelivering cargoes to France. (This bill so infuriated the United \nStates that it led to the War of 1812.) His second proposal was a \nbill to require registration of all slaves in British possessions. \nThis never passed, but it brought to light so many abuses that it \nswung public opinion against slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nStephen became Master-in-Chancery, a lawyer for the government. \nEnemies sneered that this was a pay-off for his support of abolition. \nIn 1815 Stephen resigned his Parliamentary position when the \ngovernment would not support the registry bill. He died in 1832, and \nis now assessed as the most important member of the Clapham Sect \nsecond only to Wilberforce himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Ford K.

    "words": "Judsons Find a Cheerless Home in Rangoon\u0014\n \u0014\nTHE PROSPECT OF RANGOON as we approached was quite disheartening. I \nwent on shore just at night, to take a view of the place, and the \nmission house; but so dark, and cheerless, and unpromising did all \nthings appear, that the evening of that day, after my return to the \nship, we have marked as the most gloomy and distressing that we ever \npassed. That is how Adoniram Judson described his arrival in Burma, \non this day, 13 July 1813. \u0014\n\u0014\nRangoon was a miserable, dirty town built on a swamp in one of the \noutlets of the Irrawaddy River. All the sewage of the cityand the \nsmellaccumulated in the channels of the river until tides moved it \nout to sea. The vegetation was beautiful, but the people went hungry \nbecause they had no incentive to grow much. The government seized \nwhatever they produced. Food was costly. At the very least, the \nJudsons had a home an earlier missionary, who had abandoned the work \nin Rangoon, turned his house over to them. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch an arrival could only be a matter of wild chanceor of Gods \nextraordinary providence. The Judsons had fled Calcutta because the \nEast India Company was prepared to deport them to England. Escaping, \nthey made their way first to a French island and then to Madras. \nLearning that the East India Company had attempted to send fellow \nmissionaries to England as spies (the United States and Britain were \nat war), the Judsons determined to leave India at once. The only ship \nthey could get was bound for Burma. They boarded the Giorgianna, \nwhich Judson described as a crazy old vessel. \u0014\n\u0014\nJudson had hired a Portuguese woman to accompany his wife, Ann.  This \nmaid dropped dead the day they boarded the ship, and the shock of the \nincident weakened Anns health considerably.  Their vessel sailed \ninto a typhoon and Ann almost died. But by Gods mercy, she did not, \nand the credit for evangelizing Burma was as much hers as Adonirams. \nShe proved a better linguist than he, which greatly assisted his \nefforts to learn the language and translate the Bible. It was five \nyears before the pair baptized their first convert. By then, other \nmissionaries had joined them. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1824, Britain went to war with Burma and Judson was arrested. \nBurmas king made no distinction between Americans and British, as \nlong as they were white. Ann labored to free her husband and provide \nhim the bare necessities of life.  But in that hot climate, she \nsickened. The British defeated the Burmese and after twenty-one \nmonths, Judson was released. Joy turned to sorrow when Ann and their \nyoung daughter, Maria, died soon after. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdonirams own death came in 1850 at sea, but the Judsons lifelong \nlabor had not been in vain.  By then, there were seven thousand \nBurmese Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Joseph Gilmore's Memorable Hymn\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\nMay 3. 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Joseph Henry Gilmore died on July 23, 1918, he had taught for \nmany years at the University of Rochester in New York and authored \nseveral books on literature. He is remembered in educational circles \nfor these contributions and others. But in Christian circles he is \nremembered for a single hymn written over half a century before his \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1862, as a 28-year-old student who was about to become a pastor, \nHenry was invited to preach at the historic First Baptist Church of \nPhiladelphia. \"I set out to give the people an exposition of the \nTwenty-third Psalm. I had given this exposition on three or four \nother occasions; but this time I did not get beyond the words 'He \nleadeth me.' So greatly impressed was I with the blessedness of \ndivine guidance that I made this my theme.\" He later felt that the \ndark days of the Civil War may have subconsciously led him to focus \non God's leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the close of the meeting, Henry and some others went to the home \nof a deacon. \"There,\" he wrote, \"we continued our discussion of \ndivine guidance. While I was still talking and listening, I wrote on \na piece of my exposition manuscript the words to this hymn. I handed \nthe paper to my wife and more or less forgot the incident.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe words that Henry had written began with this famous stanza:\u0014\n\u0014\nHe leadeth me! O blessed tho't!\u0014\nO words with heav'nly comfort fraught!\u0014\nWhat-e'er I do, wher-e'er I be,\u0014\nStill 'tis God's hand that leadeth me!\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years later, having pastored for some time in New Hampshire, \nHenry was invited to preach a trial sermon at the Second Baptist \nChurch in Rochester. \"I picked up a church hymnal to see what songs \nthey sang and was surprised to have the book fall open to the very \nsong I had written three years earlier,\" he wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I returned home, I related this experience to my wife. 'I do \nnot understand it,' I said. 'My words had been set to music by Dr. \nWilliam B. Bradbury; yet I had not given the words to anybody.' My \nwife smiled and said, 'I can explain it, Joseph. I felt that the \nwords would bless the hearts of people in these troublesome times; so \nI sent the poem to The Watchman and Reflector. I am glad to know that \nthey have printed it.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe famous hymn composer William Bradbury had seen the lines and \nadded music and the last two lines of the chorus.

    "title": "JESUIT ORDER TEMPORARILY DISSOLVED",
    "words": "Jesuit Order Temporarily Dissolved\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\nMAY 3, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Society of Jesus (Jesuits) was founded during the Reformation era \nin 1534. St. Ignatius of Loyola became the society's first general \nwhen Pope Paul III approved it in 1540. Famed missionary, St. Francis \nXavier, was one of the original seven Jesuits.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove of Christ and the Roman Church animated these first Jesuits and \nmany who followed them. Among the Jesuits were a number martyrs in \nNorth America including Isaac Jogues and Jean Brebeuf, men of ardent \npassion for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jesuits were a driving force in the Counter-reformation. Their \nenergy and drive carried Catholicism beyond its pre-reformation \nbounds and regained much of the territory lost to Protestants. By \nemphasizing missions and education, the Jesuits from the first \nexerted influence beyond their numbers. Not that their numbers \nremained small. Even before Ignatius' death the Society had almost a \nthousand members. In time it became the largest Roman Catholic order. \nJesuits became known as the schoolmasters of Europe and were \nprominent as confessors to kings and emperors. They made advances in \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir influence was resented. Partly this was their own fault. The \nJesuits developed a system of logic and morality called casuistry \nwhich offered loopholes for all sorts of wrongdoing. In France, \nBlaise Pascal wrote his blistering Provincial Letters to expose \nalleged Jesuitical abuses. Elsewhere, Jesuitical controversies over \nrites, their theological disputes, and their close adherence to Rome \nmade them many foes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Jesuits took their orders from no local authority but only \nthe popes and their own generals, they were viewed with suspicion as \nforeign agents. Such was the case with the heroes Edmund Campion and \nRobert Southwell, Jesuit missionaries to England. Both were executed \nalthough there is no evidence either had committed treason, but had \nmerely administered the Catholic rites to congregations which had \nbeen driven underground.\u0014\n\u0014\nCries against the Jesuits rose louder and louder until July 21, 1773, \nPope Clement XIV dissolved the order completely. It had already been \nabolished in France and Spain. Clement refused to condemn the Society \nbut merely noted he was making an administrative move for the peace \nof the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effect of the suppression was hurtful for the Roman church, for \nit shut down much mission work and many schools. Some Jesuits were \nallowed to remain in existence. In 1814 the Society was restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday's Jesuits are sometimes as controversial as their forebears. In \nSouth America many are closely identified with \"liberation theology\" \nwhich many Catholics consider heretical because of its emphasis on \nworldly aims and a materialistic interpretation of doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Will and Ariel.

    "words": "JENNIE EVELYN HUSSEYS HYMN OF ASPIRATION\u0014\n \u0014\nJENNIE EVELYN HUSSEY wrote one of the churchs best-loved hymns of \naspiration. She began writing verses when she was eight and saw some \npublished when she was just thirteen. Three years later, she began \nfurnishing magazines with childrens stories, articles about flowers, \nand crochet designs. When she was twenty-four, the first of her many \nhymns was published. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Hussey wrote over one hundred and fifty hymns, several of \nwhich appeared in hymnbooks in her own day, the only one familiar to \nmost people today is King of my life, I crown thee now, with its \nhaunting refrain Lead me to Calvary. It was written during Passion \nWeek and, at the urging of church friends, submitted for publication, \nappearing in print in 1921. \u0014\n\u0014\nKing of my life I crown thee now \u0014\nThine shall the glory be;\u0014\nLest I forget thy thorn-crowned brow,\u0014\nLead me to Calvary.\u0014\n\u0014\nRefrain:\u0014\nLest I forget Gethsemane,\u0014\nLest I forget thine agony,\u0014\nLest I forget thy love for me,\u0014\n Lead me to Calvary.\u0014\n\u0014\nHussey was born 8 February 1874 in Henniker, N. H., in an old farm \nhome that had been occupied by four generations of Quaker ancestors. \nShe attended Quaker meetings from childhood. Much of her life was \nspent caring for an invalid sister, which she did cheerfully, often \nreferring visitors to Luke 9:23, which calls us to take up our \ncrosses daily. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe herself suffered debilitating rheumatism from middle age onward. \nA description written when she was in her mid-fifties described the \nfingers of her left hand as curled up while those of her right hand \nwould bend only at the knuckles.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer love of nature shone not only in verses but in letters to \nfriends: \u0014\n\u0014\n[Y]ou might find me in a wooded valley at the foot of Mount Hunger, \nfeeding a company of gray squirrels that come to the trees and \nscramble over my windows, while blue jays call their companions to \nshare the food I scatter for them. I am fond of and know by name the \nflowers in my range; I cultivate many house and out-of-door plants, \nwhile the trumpet vine, striped grass, old fashioned yellow lilies, \nelm and crab apple trees, lilac and syringa bushes surround our \nhouse, with its rockeries of ferns and columbine. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong her poems was The War Dog, verses telling the true story of \nSallie, a stray mutt who had attached herself to a Pennsylvania \nsoldier and remained beside him after he was killed in battle at \nGettysburgbecoming the mascot of the 11th Regiment of Pennsylvania \nVolunteers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTowards the end of her life Hussey asked to be baptized (Quakers did \nnot baptize). Her closing years were spent in a home for the aged in \nConcord, New Hampshire. On this day, 5 September, 1958, Jennie Evelyn \nHussey died in Concord. Her remains were returned to Henniker for \nburial in the Quaker graveyard.\u0014",

    "words": "NAZARETH\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a place of no history (being entirely unmentioned in the OT, \nJosephus, or the Talmud), no importance, and, possibly, of bad \nreputation (John 1:48). \u0014\n\u0014\nNazareth is not mentioned in the O. T. nor by any classical author, \nnor by any writer before the time of Christ. It was for some unknown \nreason held in disrepute among the Jews of Juda. John 1:47. It was \nsituated in a mountain, Luke 4:29, within the province of Galilee, \nMark 1:9, and near Cana, as John 2:1,2,11 seems to imply. There was a \nprecipice near the town, down which the people proposed to cast \nJesus. Luke 4:29. It is mentioned twenty-nine times in the N. T. At \nNazareth the angel appeared to Mary; the home of Joseph, Luke 1:26; \n2:39, and to that place Joseph and Mary returned after their flight \ninto Egypt. Matt 2:23. The hills and places about the town possess a \ndeep and hallowed interest to the Christian as the home of Jesus \nduring his childhood and youth, until he entered upon his ministry, \nand had preached in the synagogue, and was rejected by his own \ntownspeople. Even after Capernaum became his own city he was known \nas Jesus of Nazareth, Matt 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6; Acts 2:22; 3:6; \n4:10; 6:14, and his disciples were called Nazarenes. In the days of \nConstantine, Nazareth was peopled by Samaritan Jews, but in the sixth \ncentury Christian pilgrimages began to be made to the town. In 1109, \nTancred held Galilee, and Nazareth became the seat of a Christian \nbishopric. In 1160 a council was held at Nazareth which made \nAlexander III. pope of Rome. During the Middle Ages Christian \npilgrims frequently visited Nazareth. When the Turks conquered \nPalestine, in 1517, the Christians were driven from the town. In 1620 \nthe Franciscan monks gained a foothold there, and began to rebuild \nthe village. At the battle of Mount Tabor, in 1799, Napoleon with his \narmy encamped near Nazareth.\u0014\n\u0014\nfrom Schaff's Dictionary of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe origin of the disrepute in which Nazareth stood (John 1:47) is \nnot certainly known. All the inhabitants of Galilee were looked upon \nwith contempt by the people of Judaea because they spoke a ruder \ndialect, were less cultivated, and were more exposed by their \nposition to contact with the heathen. But Nazareth labored under a \nspecial opprobrium. Nathanael, who asked the reproachful question, \n\"Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" was himself a Galilean, \nnot a southern Jew.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term \"good\" (having more commonly an ethical sense), it has been \nsuggested that the inhabitants of Nazareth may have had a bad name \namong their neighbors for irreligion or some laxity of morals. The \nsupposition receives support from the disposition which they \nmanifested towards the person and ministry of our Lord. They \nattempted to kill him; they expelled him twice (for Luke 4:16-29 and \nMatt 13:54-58 relate probably to different occurrences) from their \nborders; they were so willful and unbelieving that he performed not \nmany miracles among them (Matt 13:58); and, finally, they compelled \nhim to turn his back upon them and reside at Capernaum (Matt 4:13).\u0014\n\u0014\n(from McClintock and Strong Encyclopedia, Electronic Database. \nCopyright  2000, 2003, 2005, 2006 by Biblesoft, Inc.

    "words": "Josh McDowell Steps Back from Ministry After Race Remarks\u0014\nI made comments about race, the Black family, and minorities that \nwere wrong and hurt many people.\u0014\nBOB SMIETANA - RELIGION NEWS SERVICE|  SEPTEMBER 23, 2021 \u0014\n\u0014\nBest-selling Christian author and speaker Josh McDowell is stepping \nback from ministry following comments he made at a recent meeting of \nthe American Association of Christian Counselors.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Saturday, he had denounced the idea of systemic racism at the \nnational gathering, saying Black Americans and other minorities were \nnot raised to value hard work or education.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe talk, entitled The Five Greatest Global Epidemics, identified a \nseries of threats McDowell claims face the Christian church. The \nfirst, he said, was critical race theory, an academic field of study \non the nature of systemic racism. Known by the acronym CRT, critical \nrace theory has become controversial among Christian conservatives \nand political conservatives alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcDowell told Christian counselors that CRT negates all the biblical \nteaching about racismbecause it focuses on systems rather than the \nsins of the human heart and said todays definition of social \njustice is not biblical.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no comparison to what is known today as social justice with \nwhat the Bible speaks of as justice, he said. With CRT they speak \nstructurally. The Bible speaks individually. Make sure you get that. \nThats a big difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe went on to say not all Americans have equal opportunities to \nsucceed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey dont, folks, he said in his speech. I do not believe Blacks, \nAfrican Americans, and many other minorities have equal opportunity. \nWhy? Most of them grew up in families where there is not a big \nemphasis on education, securityyou can do anything you want. You can \nchange the world. If you work hard, you will make it. So many African \nAmericans dont have those privileges like I was brought up with.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe added that the Bible only focuses on individual sin, not \nstructural sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcDowells comments were first noted on social media by Christian \ncollege professor Aaron New. After New drew attention to those \ncomments, a recording of McDowells speech was removed from the AACC \nwebsite, where all the speeches and presentations at the conference \nare offered for sale.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion News Service obtained a copy of the recording and verified \nMcDowells remarks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter being contacted by Religion News Service, McDowell issued a \nstatement on social media apologizing for his remarks, saying they do \nnot reflect his own beliefs. He said his comment about minority \nfamilies does not reflect reality.\u0014\n\u0014\n\nhttps://www.umcdiscipleship.org/?utm_source=CT&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=umbrand\u0014\nRacism has kept equality from being achieved in our nation, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcDowells ministry is affiliated with Cru, a national campus \nministry founded by the late Bill Bright, a legendary figure among \nevangelicals. Cru, formerly known as Campus Crusade for Christ, has \nfaced criticism by some long-term staff because of its recent focus \non issues of race and diversity. A group of staff has accused Cru of \nembracing a secular system of ideas that divides humans into victims \nand oppressors.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday, McDowell, 82, announced that he was stepping back from \nministry and speaking engagements in the aftermath of his comments at \nthe conference to enter a season of listening.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a recent conference, I made comments about race, the Black \nfamily, and minorities that were wrong and hurt many people, he \nsaid. It breaks my heart to know what deep pain I have caused.\u0014\n\u0014\nFierce debates over critical race theory and social justice have \nbecome commonplace among American evangelicals in recent years. The \npresidents of the Southern Baptist Conventions seminaries have \ndenounced CRT as incompatible with the denominations statement of \nfaitha claim that led a number of high-profile Black pastors to \nleave the denominationand the debate over CRT was a key topic at the \nSBCs 2021 annual meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\nA nonprofit founded by former Trump official and Wheaton College \ngraduate Russ Vought has published a handbook labeling CRT as \nunAmerican and outlining steps for barring its use in local schools.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN WYCLIFFE: THE MORNING STAR OF THE REFORMATION",
    "words": "John Wycliffe: The Morning Star of the Reformation \u0014\nPosted: 20 Oct 2021 03:00 PM PDT\u0014\n \u0014\nYou know about Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Ulrich Zwingli. You \nmay even know about Thomas Cranmer and John Knox. . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what do you know about the forerunners of the Protestant \nReformation?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn historical theology, we have a particular category of people that \nwe call pre-Reformersthat is, people who, before Luther and Calvin \nand other Protestant Reformers of the sixteenth centuryactually \nbelieved much the same things. [Earlier in the course] I already \nmentioned one of them, Peter Waldo of the thirteenth century, perhaps \nthe first Protestant and the founder of the first Protestant \ndenomination that still exists, the Waldensian Church of Italy.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe\u0014\n\u0014\nBut another pre-Reformer, someone who believed many of the same \nthings as Luther and Calvin, was John Wycliffe. We often know John \nWycliffes name today because of the Wycliffe Bible Translators, but \nJohn Wycliffe was not himself a Bible translator. He encouraged \ntranslation of the Bible into the language of the people in his own \ncountry, which is England. However, it was his followersthe \nLollards, as they were knownwho began to translate the Bible into \nthe vernacular, the language of the people.\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffes life\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe lived in the fourteenth century, dying in 1384. He was \nthe leading theologian at the University of Oxford and belongs to the \npre-Reformation Renaissance era, but he was not really a humanist as \nsuch. Some have called him the Morning Star of the Reformation \nbecause he openly taught many of the things that Luther himself \ntaught in the sixteenth century, 200300 years later. He was an \nEnglish Protestant Reformer.\u0014\n \u0014\nHis life and career is interesting. He taught theology at Oxford \nUniversity, but he was a strong critic of the papacy. And, of course, \nlater, King Henry VIII broke away from the papacy and established an \nindependent Catholic Church in England, and then, later, the \nReformation reached England.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut . . . John Wycliffes ministry a couple of hundred years before . \n. . sets the stage for the Reformation in England. He talked Catholic \ntheology but was also a harsh critic of many of the teachings of the \npope in Rome and of the general practices of most Catholic priests \nand bishops. But he was protected by the English because he argued \nthat the ruler of a country should have authority over the church in \nhis country, and the English king of his time liked that idea and so \nprotected him from the Inquisition.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffes teaching\u0014\n\u0014\nPapal supremacy\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffe rejected papal supremacy. He did not believe that the bishop \nof Rome was infallible or had supremacy over other bishops or should \nhave supreme authority over the Church of England. He also denied \ntransubstantiation, which at that time could get you killed by the \nInquisition. He was also against purgatory. He believed that true \nChristians went immediately into heaven and bypassed any such thing \nas purgatory, which he did not believe even existed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost importantly, perhaps, like Peter Waldo before him and Luther \nafter him, he denied the salvific merit of good works.\u0014\n\u0014\nSalvation by grace alone\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Catholic Church, of course, taught that salvation is by faith and \nworks of love. Wycliffe disagreed and believed that salvationour \njustification by God, our reconciliation and forgivenessis on the \nbasis of Gods grace alone and through faith alone and not on account \nof good works that we do, although he didnt denigrate good works.\u0014\n \u0014\nAuthority of Scripture over tradition\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffe advocated the unique authority of Scripture. He believed \nthat Scripture stands above tradition, and anything not found in \nScripture cannot be dogma of the church, cannot be necessary for \nsalvation, and should not be enforced upon Christians. Later in the \nReformation, this principle becomes sola ScripturaScripture alone, \nabove tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPriesthood of all believers\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffe also believed in the priesthood of all believers. He \nbelieved that every true Christianevery person of a genuine \nChristian faithshould be able to go directly to God in prayer for \nthemselves and for others and did not need priests as such. Though he \nbelieved that priests are important, their main job should be \npreaching the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nPredestination\u0014\n\u0014\nHe believed in salvation by grace alone through faith but also \nbelieved in predestination. Those who have faith are predestined by \nGod, and faith is a gift of God to them. So he prefigures Calvin in \nhis belief about predestination.\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslations\u0014\n\u0014\nHe believed that the Scriptures should be translated into the \nlanguage of the peoplethe vernacularand his followers began to do \nthat with his encouragement, which was not looked favorably upon by \nthe Catholic Church of his time.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidered an enemy of the Catholic Church\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways, Wycliffe was a Calvinist before Calvin and a Lutheran \nbefore Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe founded a group of lay preachers whose job was to go around \nEngland translating the Bible into the language of the people and \npreaching the gospel outside the confines of the churchoften in \npeoples homes, and secretly, because they could be persecuted for \nwhat they were doing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey came to be known as the Lollards, and we dont even know exactly \nwhat that word means. But they traveled around England preaching and \norganizing small congregations mostly in homes, but sometimes meeting \nin forests outside the authority of the Catholic Church. Many of them \nwere arrested and killed. Wycliffe himself was protected during his \nlifetime by the king of England, but when he died he was declared a \nheretic by the Church, and eventually, his body was dug up and burned \nand his ashes scattered in a river 25 years after his death as a \nsymbol of how much the Church hated him because of his reforming \nideas.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS BEFORE CHRSTMAS",
    "words": "JESUS BEFORE CHRISTMAS\u0014\nNovember 14th, 2021\u0014\n By Rebekah Simon-Peter\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas wasnt always part of the Christian experience. Theres no \nrecord that Jesus or his disciples or the early church celebrated \nChristmas at all, as they did all the Jewish holy days and holidays. \nIn fact, the first Christmas or Christ Mass wasnt celebrated until \nthe 4th century.  Its likely Jesus wasnt even born in the winter. \nRather, its thought that December 25 was chosen as a day to \ncelebrate his birth because it coincided with a pre-existing pagan \nfestival. That would make it easy for non-Christians to add a new \nlayer of meaning to their old celebrations. Stuff happens in the \nhistory of religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nDecember 25, however, wasnt merely the date of a pagan festival. It \nalso overlaps with a festival that Jesus did actually celebrate.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Jews of his time, Jesus celebrated the Feast of Dedication, \nwhich occurs on the 25th of Kislev, a month in the Jewish calendar \nthat most closely approximates December.  At that time, John's \nGospel relates, the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem; it \nwas winter. Jesus was walking in the Temple in the portico of \nSolomon. Tell us, the Jews said, if you are the Messiah.  Their \ncomments were fitting, because the Feast of Dedication remembered the \nlast time a deliverer had arisen to save them from oppression. It was \npast time for another; the Roman experience was a cruel one indeed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Feast of Dedication commemorates the rededication of the second \nTemple in Jerusalem, after its utter desecration at the brutal hands \nof Antiochus Epiphanes in 167 or 168 BCE. Today, that feast is known \nby its Hebrew name, Chanukah. Although Hanukkah (Feast of Dedication) \nonly gets a line or two in the New Testament, it actually plays a \nsignficant role in the birth of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Peek into History\u0014\n\u0014\nTo explain, we look back in history over three hundred years before \nthe birth of Christ. Alexander the Great ruled the ancient world \naround the Eastern Mediterranean. After conquering the Persian \nEmpire, Greek culture, or Hellenism, spread like wildfire. The Jews \nliving in Israel quickly found themselves surrounded by it, and then \nalmost swallowed up by it. Hellenism was to the ancient world what \nWestern culture is to the modern world. Just as you can find a \nMcDonalds in nearly every corner of the world, not to mention \nAmerican pop music, blue jeans, TV re-runs, Western style \nChristianity, and the English language, so in that day, you could \nfind Greek culture, religion, and language permeating every other \nculture of the world. Needless to say, it wasnt all good, especially \nfor those in the minority, like the Jews. It put their entire \ndistinctive way of life at risk.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Alexander died, his empire was split into quarters and the \nregion including Israel and Syria was eventually inherited by \nAntiochus IV Epiphanes.\u0014\n\u0014\nEpiphanes means face of God, but a more apt description was the \nmoniker the Jews gave him: Epimanes or crazy man.  He was the \nHitler of the intertestamental period. He was obsessed with wiping \nout the Jewish people. He began with the slaughter of the citizens of \nJerusalem and the desecration of the Temple.  Alfred Edersheim \nexplains what happened in his book, The Life and Times of Jesus the \nMessiah:\u0014\n\u0014\nAll sacrifices, the service of the Temple, and the observance of the \nSabbath and of feast days were prohibited; the Temple at Jerusalem \nwas dedicated to Jupiter Olympus (a Greek god); the Torah was \nsearched for and destroyed; the Jews forced to take part in heathen \nrites; in short, every insult was heaped on the religion of the Jews, \nand its every trace was to be swept away.\u0014\n\u0014\nAntiochus was bent on genocide. The final straw was the slaughter of \na pig on the sacrificial altar in the Temple. Definitely not kosher. \nThis occurred on the 25th of Kislev, the month that generally \ncorresponds to our December.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Jewish deliverer rose up, whose name was Mattathias. Even though \nthey were outnumbered and overpowered, under his leadership the \nJewish people began a campaign of guerilla warfare against Antiochus \nand his Syrian armies to reclaim the Temple. Mattathias died \nfighting, but his five sons carried on, including one whose name you \nmight know: Judah Maccabee. He led the fighting till the Temple could \nbe purified and its services restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristmas without Hanukkah\u0014\n\u0014\nExactly three years after its desecration, the Temple was \nrededicated. This took place on the 25th of Kislev, approximatey 165 \nyears before the nativity of Christ. If Antiochus had carried out his \nplan for genocide of all the Jews, there would have been no Mary, no \nJoseph, and no Jesus. There would have been no Messiah of Israel, no \nSavior of the World.  Bottom line: without Hanukkah, there would \nprobably be no Christmas.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we prepare for Advent, let us remember the minor Jewish holiday \nthat celebrates freedom of religion and which makes possible the \nmajor Christian one. Lets do like Jesus did and rededicate ourselves \nto freedom of religious expression, to the freedom that allows our \ndevotion to God, to the freedom that motivates us truly love each \nother.\u0014",

    "words": "John Bunyan\u0014\nCurtis, Lang, Peterson\u0014\n2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bunyan was born in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England on this day, \nNovember 28, 1628. His home was a small thatched cottage, and his \nfather was a tinker, who spent his days pushing a cart along the \nroads, stopping at homes to fix metal pots and pans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung John received a grammar-school education, but like most sons of \nhis day, he learned his father's trade. During the English Civil War \nhe served as a soldier-- probably on the Puritan side. At nineteen he \nmarried, and his Christian wife led him to try to reform his life. \nBut John found himself constantly slipping back into old habits. \nThough he lived well enough to impress his neighbors, he described \nhimself as a \"painted hypocrite.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1651, John began attending an independent meeting at Bedford and \nwas moved by the pastor's intense biblical preaching. He began to \npore over the Scriptures, until the conflict within him ended in the \nassurance of God's grace in his life. Salvation had come to John \nBunyan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe joined the Bedford congregation and began to preach there, amazing \npeople at the abilities of a \"mere\" tinker. Though King Charles II \nhad at first promised freedom of religion, increasingly the Anglican \nchurch became England's only accepted church. Dissent was not \nencouraged, and in 1661 the authorities sent John to Bedford jail for \nhis preaching. His times in prison were hard on his family and his \nblind daughter. He remained there until 1672, when Charles issued the \nDeclaration of Indulgence, extending leniency to non-Anglicans.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his release, the Independent meeting house called him as their \npastor. He received a license to preach and became known as Bishop \nBunyan-- perhaps becoming the organizing genius of Independents in \nthe area, But the toleration was not to last.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1675 Bunyan again found himself in prison, and began his greatest \nwork: The Pilgrim's Progress. This allegory of salvation and the \nChristian walk has given us such colorful phrases as \"Vanity Fair,\" \n\"the Slough of Despond,\" \"House Beautiful,\" \"Muckraking,\" and, \n\"Hanging is too good for him.\" Drawing only on his own experience and \nthe Bible, this largely unlettered preacher created a captivating \npiece of literature that appeals to those who travel - or would \ntravel - on the spiritual pilgrimage from the City of Destruction to \nthe Celestial City.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps because so many readers experienced the same sort of \npilgrimage in their lives, The Pilgrim's Progress, became the world's \nbest-selling devotional book. Bunyan describes the most intimate \nstates of the Christian soul. His realization of the depth of God's \ngrace in his own life gave Bunyan an ability to speak to many people, \neven generations, of their own spiritual state. Bunyan's other works, \nGrace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, The Life and Death of Mr. \nBadman, and The Holy War, never achieved the popularity of The \nPilgrim's Progress. This one humbly written work touched thousands of \nlive sand became a classic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's book Dates With Destiny by \nCurtis, Lang and Petersen.

    "title": "JOHN OF DAMASCUS",
    "words": "John of Damascus\u0014\n\"I do not worship matter, I worship the God of matter, who became \nmatter for my sake and deigned to inhabit matter, who worked out my \nsalvation through matter. I will not cease from honoring that matter \nwhich works for my salvation. I venerate it, though not as God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nVisitors to an Orthodox Church are confronted with many unfamiliar \nelements of worship: for example, the use of incense and Byzantine \nchant and the custom of standing throughout the service. But perhaps \nthe most perplexing element is the icons, especially when Orthodox \nworshipers bow before and kiss them. Isn't this idolatry?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis very question raged through the Christian world in the eighth \nand ninth centuries, and it occupied the attention of two of the \nseven ecumenical (worldwide) church councils. The strongest defense \nof the practice came from a Christian living in the heart of the \nIslamic empire, John of Damascus.\u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to the imperial volcano\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was born John Monsur, into a wealthy Arab-Christian family of \nDamascus. Like his father, he held a position high in the court of \nthe caliph. About 725 he resigned his office and became a monk at Mar \nSaba near Bethlehem, where he became a priest. In this secluded place \nat the relatively advanced age of 51, John's lasting legacy began to \nunfold. It began when Emperor Leo III, in 726, outlawed the \nveneration of icons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conflict had been brewing for decades. It wasn't a question of \nbowing and kissing icons; this was a culturally acceptable way to \nshow respect. The basic question went deeper: are Christians allowed \nto paint pictures of Jesus, or other biblical figures, at all? As \nIslam spread through the Mediterranean region, bringing its absolute \ninterdiction of images, Christianity was feeling pressure to rid \nitself of images.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main threat to icons came not from the Islamic caliph but from \nthe heart of the Byzantine Empire. A few bishops from Asia Minor (now \nTurkey) believed the Bible, particularly the second commandment, \nforbade such images:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in \nheaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You \nshall not bow down to them or worship them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishops' argument convinced Byzantine Emperor Leo III, who set \nabout to convince his subjects to abandon iconography. But a natural \ndisaster changed his approach. In 726 a violent volcano erupted in \nthe middle of the Aegean Sea and terrorized Constantinople, the \ncapital. Afterward, tidal waves buffeted the shores and volcanic ash \nextinguished the sunlight. Leo reasoned that God was angry about \nicons. That's when he outlawed their use.\u0014\n\u0014\nGive Love, Joy, Hope, Peace\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 730 Leo commanded the destruction of all religious likenesses, \nwhether icons, mosaics, or statues, and iconoclasts (\"image smashers\" \nin Greek) went on a spree, demolishing nearly all icons in the Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his distant post in the Holy Land, John challenged this policy \nin three works. He argued that icons should not be worshiped, but \nthey could be venerated. (The distinction is crucial: a Western \nparallel might be the way a favorite Bible is read, cherished, and \ntreated with honorbut certainly not worshiped.)\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn explained it like this: \"Often, doubtless, when we have not the \nLord's passion in mind and see the image of Christ's crucifixion, his \nsaving passion is brought back to remembrance, and we fall down and \nworship not the material but that which is imaged: just as we do not \nworship the material of which the Gospels are made, nor the material \nof the Cross, but that which these typify.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, John drew support from the writings of the early fathers like \nBasil the Great, who wrote, \"The honor paid to an icon is transferred \nto its prototype.\" That is, the actual icon was but a point of \ndeparture for the expressed devotion; the recipient was in the unseen \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, John claimed that, with the birth of the Son of God in the \nflesh, the depiction of Christ in paint and wood demonstrated faith \nin the Incarnation. Since the unseen God had become visible, there \nwas no blasphemy in painting visible representations of Jesus or \nother historical figures. To paint an icon of him was, in fact, a \nprofession of faith, deniable only by a heretic!\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do not worship matter, I worship the God of matter, who became \nmatter for my sake and deigned to inhabit matter, who worked out my \nsalvation through matter,\" he wrote. \"I will not cease from honoring \nthat matter which works for my salvation. I venerate it, though not \nas God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEastern theologian for the whole church\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the controversy continued to rage, John spent his days at Mar \nSaba monastery in the hills 18 miles southeast of Jerusalem. There he \nwrote both theological treatises and hymns; he is recognized as one \nof the principal hymnographers of Eastern Orthodoxy. His most \nimportant theological work, The Fount of Wisdom, is a summary of \nEastern theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nTradition says that his fellow monks grumbled that such elegant \nwriting was a distraction and prideful; so John was sometimes sent to \nsell baskets humbly in the streets of Damascus, where he had once \nbeen among the elite.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter more dissension and bloodshed over icons (the decade after \nJohn's death, over 100,000 Christians were injured or killed), the \nissue was finally settled, and icons are an integral part of Orthodox \nworship to this day. His other writings were major influences on \nWestern theologians such as Thomas Aquinas. In 1890 he was named a \ndoctor of the church by the Vatican, and in this century, his \nwritings have become a fresh source of theological insight, \nespecially for Eastern theologians.\u0014",

    "title": "JOSEPH, A VERY ORDINARY MAN",
    "words": "Josephs Simplicity Was Actually Spiritual Maturity\u0014\nGod entrusted his only Son to a man who could not provide as his \nculture expected.\u0014\nACHER NIYONIZIGIYE\u0014\n|\u0014\nNOVEMBER 22, 2021  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring Burundis civil war in the 1990s, I spent several months in a \ncrowded camp for internally displaced peoplepeople like me who had \nfled home but could not flee the country. One of my most painful \nexperiences was to see fathers healthy masculinity shattered by the \nchange in their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the providers for their families, they now had to rely on relief \nfood. They were deprived of their freedom of movement, unable to do \nwhat they had been doing all their lives (farming or business). Some \nbegan drinking heavily to deal with their depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have since thought of Joseph, Marys husband, who also had to flee \nand deal with the frustrations of providing without stability. He \ncould have become like those men. He could have resented his local \nand colonial governments for the ways they deprived him of good \nchoices and made him move all over the region. He could have resented \nGod for telling him to marry a woman whohis fellows might have \nsaiddeserved divorce and not his support. He could have tried to \nmake up for his threatened masculinity with a lack of cooperation or \nwith domineering legalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that is not how the Scriptures portray Joseph. Instead, we see \nthe man God selected to parent his son accepting Gods unexpected \ndirection at each delicate step, not characterized by resentment but \nby wholehearted cooperation with God. Ive seen how difficult that \nis. How did Joseph do it?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont know a lot about Joseph. He is one of the biblical \ncharacters of whom very little is said. Not a political leader or a \ngreat prophet, his name would be absent from the Bible had he not \nbeen the guardian of the Messiah. Still, his lineage could have been \na matter of pride and a basis for him to strive for a position of \nhonor. In Lukes account of the angelic visitation of Mary, Gabriel \naffirmed that Jesus was the promised descendant of David and that he \nwould be given the throne of David and a kingdom that would have no \nend (Luke 1:3133).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Matthew, a Jewish gospel writer and a disciple of \nJesus, introduces Joseph as a descendant of David is significant \n(1:20). It puts Joseph in the spotlight of the divine plan for \nhumanity as the adoptive father of the Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nApocryphal writings supply an unreliable, sometimes even angry, image \nof Joseph. Both the Protoevangelium of James and the History of \nJoseph the Carpenter assert that Joseph was a widower with children \nfrom a previous marriage. Those details about Joseph prop up the idea \nthat Mary was a perpetual virgin, but theres no reason from the \nScriptures to think Joseph had previous children: The nativity \naccounts dont list anyone besides Mary as traveling to Bethlehem \nwith Joseph, and Joseph was asked to flee to Egypt with just Mary and \nJesus (Matt. 2:1315).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is most likely that the real, nonapocryphal Joseph was an average \nJewish young man, with some religious education. Rabbinic writings \nsuggest that the expected age for marriage in Josephs time was the \nlate teens. So Joseph was probably living with his parents or \nrelatives when the angel told him to marry Mary. After Jesus was \nborn, Joseph had four boys and an unknown number of girls with Mary \n(Matt. 13:5556).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible implies Joseph was a very ordinary man from an ordinary \nplace, a village man who was known through his profession. People \nthought of him as the carpenter (13:55). His days were likely \nfilled with hard work.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Jewish culture valued menial labor, the reality was totally \ndifferent with the Romans, the colonizing power that ruled Palestine \nduring Josephs life. From a Roman perspective, carpentry was a \nslaves profession. So Joseph was far from being among the people \nwith high status.\u0014",

    "words": "John and Betty Stam Died as Martyrs in China\u0014\n \u0014\nIN 1925, when Betty Alden Scott was nineteen years old, she wrote a \ncovenant before the Lord, giving up all her purposes, plans, desires, \nhopes, and ambitions. Fill me and seal me with Thy Holy Spirit. Work \nout Thy whole will in my life, at any cost, now and forever. Two \nyears later, she entered Moody Bible Institute to train for mission \nwork. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Stam began his studies at Moody in 1929. He too had recorded a \ncovenant in his journal. An earnest Christian, he joined a weekly \nprayer meeting for China. Through that group, he met Scott and they \nfell in love. However, both realized they could not marry yetthe \nChina Inland Mission had appealed for single men to itinerate in \nsections where it would be impossible to take a woman. They committed \ntheir hopes to the Lord. When the China Inland Mission accepted \nScott, she and Stam said their goodbyes in a private picnic. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1932 the China Inland Mission accepted Stam. Now began a series of \ncoincidences which forced the couple back together. Stam sailed to \nChina on the Empress of Japan, turning down a luxury cabin, which he \nfelt would be self-indulgent while other missionaries were suffering \nhardship. When he arrived in China, mission authorities changed their \nplans, sending him to Shanghai. Scott was already there because a \nkidnapping had led the mission to suspend work where she had planned \nto go. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs it turned out, there was nothing to prevent the two from marrying. \nIn 1934 their daughter Helen Priscilla Stam was born. Shortly after \nher birth, Communists seized the safe town in which the Stams were \nworking. The Communists would not listen to the pleas of Chinese \nassociates, threatening them with immediate death. They had John \nwrite a ransom note, but it reached mission authorities too late to \nhelp. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to one account, the baby cried, and the Communists \ndiscussed aloud whether to kill her. An old farmer pleaded for the \nchilds life. Its your life for hers, then, said the Communists, \nand killed him on the spot. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 8 December 1934 the Communists marched John and Betty \nStam through the streets of neighboring Miaosheo. A Chinese merchant, \nChang Hsiu-sheng, fell to his knees and pleaded for their lives. \nFinding a Bible and Christian literature in his house, the Communists \nseized him, too, and marched him to the hill where the missionaries \nwere to be executed. John pleaded for Changs life. However, a \nCommunist cut his pleas short by slashing his throat. Betty fell to \nher knees, shuddering once before the blade severed her neck. The \nCommunists executed Chang the next day. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, Mr. Lo, a local pastor, found Helen Priscilla Stam \nhidden in a sleeping bag. Pinned to her clothes were a few dollars \nthat Betty had somehow managed to hide from the Communists. Mr. and \nMrs. Lo carried Priscilla many miles and delivered her safely into \nthe hands of other missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

But did John the Baptist \nmisunderstand Jesus?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this excerpt adapted from the September/October 2021 issue of \nBible Study Magazine, Joseph R.

Because Jesus neighbors relegated him to the boy next door, \nthey failed to recognize him as the long-awaited prophet of God (Matt \n13:5458).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn contrast to the Lords neighbors who declined to give him any \nrespect, Herod got the wrong Jesus because he was so terrified.1 His \nextreme superstition drove him to think Jesus was John the Baptist \nwhom Herod had recently beheadednow risen from the grave (Matt \n14:12). Like Herod, others wrongly identified Jesus as John the \nBaptist, and some mistook him for Elijah, Jeremiah, or some other Old \nTestament prophet (Matt 14:14).\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter, of course, goes on to give the right answer: You are the \nMessiah, the Son of the living God (Matt 16:16). But as the \nnarrative unfolds, we see that although Peter may have had the right \ntitles for Jesus, he didnt have the right theology behind them. Not \nfully understanding who the Lord is led Peter, the son of Jonah, to \nbrazenly rebuke the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matt 16:22).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Magdalene also got the wrong guy. She initially mistook the \nResurrection and the Life for a cemetery gardener, who for some \ncurious reason must have decided to move Jesus corpse from its tomb \n(John 20:14). And it wasnt just at the tomb that one of his \nfollowers thought Jesus was someone else. 2On the road to Emmaus, \nCleopas deduced that Jesus must be a visitor to Jerusalem who \nremarkably had missed the trending news of their Lords death (Luke \n24:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, it is unsurprising that Herod and other outsiders got the \nwrong guy. As for Peter, when we take into account his shaky theology \nthroughout the Gospels, its also not too shocking that he thinks \nJesus should be someone else. And we can surely excuse Marys wrong \nassumption at the tomb since she was so grief-stricken. Trauma is a \npowerful lens. We can pardon Cleopas, too, because, in addition to \nhis grief, he was divinely prevented from recognizing Jesus (Luke \n24:16 NASB).\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn the Baptists crisis of faith\u0014\n\u0014\nYet of all the people who mistook the Lord for someone hes not, the \nmost incredible example is John the Baptist. John was Jesus hype \nman. He was Gods very instrument, born to prepare the way for the \nLord, to make straight his paths, and to announce him to the world. \nSet apart in the womb and filled with the Spirit, John the Baptist \nsurely would get it right. Right? But at least at one point in his \nlife, even John seemed to think Jesus was someone hes not. Sitting \nin prison and facing execution, John had his own doubts about the \nLord and sent his disciples to make sure he didnt have the wrong \nguy. To clarify, he instructed his followers to ask Jesus: Are you \nthe one who is to come, or should we expect someone else? (Matt \n11:3).\u0014\n\u0014\nIve always taken Johns apparent crisis of faith here as stemming \nfrom his imprisonment and imminent execution. I figured Matthew \nincluded this story in his Gospel to remind us that, like Elijah who \ncame before him, even the likes of John the Baptist can lose heart \nand falter in their faith.3But if John had studied the Jewish \nScriptures correctly, he would have had good reasons for these \ndoubts. From Isaiah, John would infer that the Coming One was \nsupposed to proclaim liberty to prisoners such as himself (Isa 61:1). \nDidnt Jesus even promise to set the captives free (Luke 4:18)? Yet \nhere John wasGods faithful servant, the promised Elijah, the \ngreatest man ever born from a womanstill in chains (Matt 11:1011). \nAs Craig Blomberg asks, Why would one who had promised to free the \nprisoners (Luke 4:18) not get John out of jail?4\u0014\n\u0014\nBut perhaps theres more to the story. John the Baptist was a \nno-nonsense, hellfire-and-brimstone, wrath-preaching prophet. To the \nunrepentant, he thundered threats in the wilderness:\u0014\n\u0014\nGods ax is already at the root of your tree and Christ is coming \nsoon to cut you down. With winnowing fork in hand, the Messiah is \ngoing to arrive to clear the threshing floor and to toss the wicked \nlike chaff into unquenchable fire. (Matt 3:12, my paraphrase)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Lord came, however, he didntas John seemingly \nexpectedbaptize folks with damning fire. Likely for John, Jesus \nshould have promptly exacted vengeance. How long had Israel already \nwaited for him to come and judge the wicked? Instead of throwing his \nenemies into a fiery furnace, however, the Lord let his own cousin be \ntossed onto death row.5\u0014\n\u0014\nIn support of this notion, according to Matthews Gospel, what spurs \non Johns quest is that he had heard of Jesus deeds (Matt 11:2). \nEven though the deeds John heard about likely encompass the Lords \nwhole ministry, they probably center on his miracles, like those \nrecorded in Matthew 89.6One would think that such wonderful deeds \nwould reinforce Johns convictionunless, that is, John was expecting \nanother type of works.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, rather than baptizing people with divine wrath as \nIsaiah 61:2 prophesied, the Lord was immersing them in compassion. \nAlthough Jesus delivered his own blistering warnings of coming \njudgment, he did not cast multitudes of sinners into outer darkness \nto weep and gnash their teeth.7\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the contrary, he led out with unmerited love and unimaginable \nmercy. In other words, instead of anger, judgment, and condemnation, \nthe hallmarks of Jesus ministry were gentleness, goodness, and grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nA different kind of Messiah?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Im right about this, even John the Baptistthe person who knew \nJesus the mostmisunderstood him. Hence Johns burning question: Are \nwe to expect a different kind of Messiah?8\u0014\n\u0014\nA Coming One who will castigate my enemies?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be fair, John certainly didnt have the wrong guy, but he seemed \nto have the wrong emphasis. Or, as Craig Keener puts it, Johns \nexpectations of Jesus were correct but incomplete.9The major thrust \nof the Lords gospel was not turn or burn butto borrow from \nPaulthe kindness of God leading to repentance (Rom 2:4). Also, what \nJohn the Baptist may have missed is that Jesus didnt come to pour \nout wrath as much as to absorb iton a cross. Rather than cutting \ndown Israels tree at the roots, Jesus was nailed upon a Roman one, \nso that his atoning blood would cover the very people and their \nchildren who cried, Crucify him! (Matt 27:25).\u0014\n\u0014\nMonthly Sale | Footer\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is what makes the final beatitude Jesus gives to John so \nbeautiful: Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me \n(Matt 11:6). Notice that the Lord makes the blessing general for all \npeople, rather than personal to John. That is, he does not say, \nBlessed are you, John, if you dont stumble on account of me, but \nBlessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.10\u0014\n\u0014\nI wonder if Jesus might have Jonah in mind when he says this.11\u0014\n\u0014\nJonah was a prophet who thoroughly tripped over the mercy of God. \nHidden in Jesus beatitude is a warning: John and all the followers \nof Jesus should not (as Jonah did) stumble over the abounding truth \nthat even to our enemies, our God is a gracious and compassionate \nGod, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from \nsending calamity (Jonah 4:2).12\u0014\n\u0014\nBut its easy to trip up. We often want John the Baptists Jesus for \npeople who disagree with us. Like John, we want the Lord to escort \nthem out. We expect Christ to cut down their tree, not to be \ncrucified for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts funny, though. We often want Johns Jesus for our enemies, but \nwe want Jesus Jesus for ourselves. When it comes to our conceptions \nof the Messiah, maybe weve got the wrong guy.\u0014",

    "words": "Jail Officer Who Led Others to Safety Is Among the 74 Killed in \nTornadoes\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Edgar Sandoval, Tariro Mzezewa and Christine Hauser\u0014\nDec. 13, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nMAYFIELD, Ky.  Robert Daniel, a veteran corrections officer at the \ncounty jail, was keeping a watchful eye on seven inmates assigned to \nwork at a Kentucky candle factory when the sirens went off, warning \nof an oncoming tornado.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Daniel moved quickly to direct the inmates in his care, along \nwith other workers, to a room with a heavy door designated as a \nsafety area. Then he went back to look for others who might need \nhelp.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tornado hit. They turned around and he was gone, said Pete \nJackson, chief deputy at the Graves County Jail. Long after the storm \nhad passed, he said, Mr. Daniels body was found under the shattered \nbuilding. The workers he had ushered to safety survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe put his life in danger to help others. There is no other way to \nput it, Mr. Jackson said on Monday, as the authorities across six \nstates began to identify dozens of people killed over the weekend in \nthe powerful tornadoes that leveled the candle factory and destroyed \nneighborhoods as far away as Arkansas and Illinois.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least 74 people were confirmed dead in Kentucky alone, the \nyoungest 5 months old, the oldest 86 years. So severe were the \ninjuries and so remote some of the areas damaged that officials in \nKentucky have not been able to identify 18 of those who died. Among \nthe dead were a district judge in Bremen, Ky., a dispatcher at an \nAmazon warehouse in Illinois and at least 15 people who were killed \non a single street in the town of Bowling Green, Ky.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the family of Mr. Daniel, the Mayfield corrections officer, \nMonday was a day for gathering at the Brown Funeral Home  one of the \nfew structures in town unscathed by the widespread destruction  to \nmake preparations for a final goodbye.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe died helping people until the very end, said a younger brother, \nAlonzo Daniel, 43. Thats who he was.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn officer for the Graves County Jail for eight years, Mr. Daniel had \nstarted a new job supervising inmates assigned to work at the candle \nfactory last week  just days before the tornado struck.\u0014\n\u0014\nInmates and others who worked at the factory told county officials \nthat after the sirens blasted, signaling that a tornado was on its \nway, Mr. Daniel quickly set to work getting people to the designated \nshelter area.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe led many people to safety, the younger Mr. Daniel said. When \nthey turned around, they did not see him anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\nHearing that the tornado had struck, Alonzo Daniel and one of his \nbrothers seven children, Zach Daniel, rushed to the factory hoping \nfor any signs of life. They found the building a shambles. Cars were \npiled on top of one another, others were on the remains of the \nbuilding, and heavy equipment from a nearby John Deere store was \nscattered about.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was chaos, Zach said. I kept yelling: Pops! Pops!\u0014\n\u0014\nAlonzo Daniel said he also called out his brothers name, hoping to \nhear his voice from the ruins. But nothing, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHours later, he was asked to identify the remains of a man whose body \nhad been found at the site. His throat tightened when he recognized \nhis brother, who was six feet tall and about 280 pounds, inside a \nbody bag.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy brother was a big man; I knew it was him before they unzipped the \nbag, he said.\u0014",

    "title": "JOSEPH'S SIMPLICITY WAS ACTUALLY SPIRITUAL MATURITY",
    "words": "Josephs Simplicity Was Actually Spiritual Maturity\u0014\nGod entrusted his only Son to a man who could not provide as his \nculture expected.\u0014\nACHER NIYONIZIGIYE   NOVEMBER 22, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring Burundis civil war in the 1990s, I spent several months in a \ncrowded camp for internally displaced peoplepeople like me who had \nfled home but could not flee the country. One of my most painful \nexperiences was to see fathers healthy masculinity shattered by the \nchange in their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce the providers for their families, they now had to rely on relief \nfood. They were deprived of their freedom of movement, unable to do \nwhat they had been doing all their lives (farming or business). Some \nbegan drinking heavily to deal with their depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have since thought of Joseph, Marys husband, who also had to flee \nand deal with the frustrations of providing without stability. He \ncould have become like those men. He could have resented his local \nand colonial governments for the ways they deprived him of good \nchoices and made him move all over the region. He could have resented \nGod for telling him to marry a woman whohis fellows might have \nsaiddeserved divorce and not his support. He could have tried to \nmake up for his threatened masculinity with a lack of cooperation or \nwith domineering legalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that is not how the Scriptures portray Joseph. Instead, we see \nthe man God selected to parent his son accepting Gods unexpected \ndirection at each delicate step, not characterized by resentment but \nby wholehearted cooperation with God. Ive seen how difficult that \nis. How did Joseph do it?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont know a lot about Joseph. He is one of the biblical \ncharacters of whom very little is said. Not a political leader or a \ngreat prophet, his name would be absent from the Bible had he not \nbeen the guardian of the Messiah. Still, his lineage could have been \na matter of pride and a basis for him to strive for a position of \nhonor. In Lukes account of the angelic visitation of Mary, Gabriel \naffirmed that Jesus was the promised descendant of David and that he \nwould be given the throne of David and a kingdom that would have no \nend (Luke 1:3133).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact that Matthew, a Jewish gospel writer and a disciple of \nJesus, introduces Joseph as a descendant of David is significant \n(1:20). It puts Joseph in the spotlight of the divine plan for \nhumanity as the adoptive father of the Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nApocryphal writings supply an unreliable, sometimes even angry, image \nof Joseph. Both the Protoevangelium of James and the History of \nJoseph the Carpenter assert that Joseph was a widower with children \nfrom a previous marriage. Those details about Joseph prop up the idea \nthat Mary was a perpetual virgin, but theres no reason from the \nScriptures to think Joseph had previous children: The nativity \naccounts dont list anyone besides Mary as traveling to Bethlehem \nwith Joseph, and Joseph was asked to flee to Egypt with just Mary and \nJesus (Matt. 2:1315).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is most likely that the real, nonapocryphal Joseph was an average \nJewish young man, with some religious education. Rabbinic writings \nsuggest that the expected age for marriage in Josephs time was the \nlate teens. So Joseph was probably living with his parents or \nrelatives when the angel told him to marry Mary. After Jesus was \nborn, Joseph had four boys and an unknown number of girls with Mary \n(Matt. 13:5556).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible implies Joseph was a very ordinary man from an ordinary \nplace, a village man who was known through his profession. People \nthought of him as the carpenter (13:55). His days were likely \nfilled with hard work.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Jewish culture valued menial labor, the reality was totally \ndifferent with the Romans, the colonizing power that ruled Palestine \nduring Josephs life. From a Roman perspective, carpentry was a \nslaves profession. So Joseph was far from being among the people \nwith high status.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of that status he may have been born into, but some of it he may \nhave chosen. Joseph lived during rough times, when opportunists could \ncollaborate with the Romans and enjoy a materially comfortable life. \nHe did not take the path that Matthew, the former tax collector, \nchose. Matthew, the writer of the Gospel that says most about Joseph, \nmight have seen the temptation of collaboration most clearly. And \nyet, Joseph wasnt needlessly uncooperative with the Romans. He went \nto the city of his ancestors for the government census, for example.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this simple and useful lifestyle, he was confronted with the \npowers that bethe powers that werewho thrived on injustice, \nviolence, and corruption. In that confrontation, Josephs \nspirituality becomes more evident, and God clearly stands with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, God is close to those who, like Joseph, are humble and \ncontrite and who tremble at his word (Isa. 66:2). Simplicity, as a \nspiritual discipline, helps us avoid the enticement of materialism \nand enables us to focus on things that really matter. Those who \npractice simplicity can be wealthy without materialism and be \ndescendants of the line of kings without competing with Herod. For \nthem, righteousness is better than the glory of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems clear to me Joseph was able to guide his family well because \nhe was open to God and his messengers in a way that defied legalism. \nJosephs spirituality prepared him for the unexpected.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn strongly patriarchal cultures, men usually expect to be able to \nprovide well for their families, sometimes with a good dose of \nemotional detachment from their wives, and they often expect their \nown plans to be the plans that direct their families. Heads of \nfamilies can be rigid and resist unconventional behavior. In my \nculture, for example, though the winds of human rights have been \nblowing for more than two decades now, most Christian men still \nstruggle to get rid of rigid patriarchal attitudes and behaviors, and \nsome distort the Bible to justify those behaviors in themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph wasnt like that. We see that most clearly in his treatment of \nMary. As a Jewish man, Joseph understood what could happen to a girl \nwho had sex before marriage (Deut. 22:1321). Pregnancy was the most \nconvincing proof of sexual misconduct. Legally, he would have been \nright to denounce Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut to Joseph, Marys perceived sin did not make her an outcast. He \nknew she deserved love and protection. The NIV beautifully combines \nJosephs Jewish religious culture and his personal spirituality in \none sentence: Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, \nand yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind \nto divorce her quietly (Matt. 1:19).\u0014\n\u0014\nHere, we see that Joseph isnt the grumpy, emasculated husband of \nChristmas legend. Even before he received Gods message about Jesus, \nJosephs demonstrated love for Mary and his commitment to protect her \ndignity overpowered any legalism. Josephs behavior portrays genuine \nmasculinity and Bible-certified righteousness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe situation, of course, isnt what he had first imagined. In a \ndream, an angel told him Marys pregnancy was of divine origin. \nJoseph dismissed his previous plans and agreed to obey just as \nquickly and simply as Mary had accepted that she was pregnant before \nmarriage (Matt. 1:24; Luke 1:38).\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a positive response to such a difficult and risky circumstance \nwould have been impossible in a spiritually dull, legalistic mind. A \nlegalistic man might have quickly dismissed the angels message as \nhallucination, as it seemed to contradict the law. Josephs \nspirituality was of such a kind that he was able to value the will of \nthe lawgiver more than the law, something that eluded many \nsophisticated theologians and religious leaders (Matt. 15:39), not \nto mention Jesus disciples.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen, in another dream, an angel ordered Joseph to flee to Egypt with \nMary and the baby, Joseph obeyed and fled (Matt. 2:1314). For many \nin Josephs position, the command would have seemed nonsensical. They \nexpected a powerful, conquering Messiah, not a baby refugee (Acts \n1:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Joseph was able to set aside the common mindset because of a \ndream shows that his spirituality was deeper than the prevailing \nreligious thought of the people of his time. He could tell when God \nhad spoken to him directly. We see the simple village man cooperating \nwith God to preserve the life of the Messiah.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe often see the Nativity as a celebration of comfort and innocence. \nIn Europe and the United States, Christmas is often a time to think \nof coziness. In my country, its sort of a childrens holiday among \nevangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nCould Joseph ever fit in with these modern Christmases? Certainly, we \ncan say Joseph had the childlike humility that Jesus later praised \n(Matt. 18:4), and his simplicity and righteousness are a form of \ninnocence. But Joseph parented Jesus in turbulent times. Perhaps our \nChristmases would be better if we remembered that innocence and \nresponsiveness characterized the father God chose to guide a family \nthrough danger, not just children cuddled up in safety. Joseph surely \nknew how violent Roman rulers could be. On the roads, he may have \npassed by agonizing crucified people who, like his family, were a \nthreat to the regime.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of a political decision of an emperor thousands of miles \naway, Jesus was born in overcrowded Bethlehema logistical headache \nfor Joseph. It is possible that the couple traveled with relatives \nwho were by their side when Jesus was born. But no mention is made of \nrelatives helping Joseph tend Mary and the baby. When there wasnt \nspace for them in the guest room, Joseph didnt have the wherewithal \nto do better (Luke 2:47). Later on, another political decision and \nanother message in a dream caused Joseph to flee to Egypt with Mary \nand Jesus. Herod could not allow a child who could potentially \nchallenge him on the throne to grow, and he targeted the baby for \nassassination.\u0014\n\u0014\nFear, anguish, and a sense of powerlessness must have plagued \nJosephs tender heart when he became aware of the threat. Anyone who \nhas lived through massive violence (as in the case of a civil war) \nknows the agony of the possibility of losing loved ones accompanied \nby the incapacity to protect them.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnybody in Josephs place would have asked themselves existential \nquestions and questioned their faith. Was he tempted to take his \nlife, as some are when confronted with a similar situation? Did he \nthink of migrating to a safer place and never returning to Palestine? \nWas he tempted to become passive or fatalistic? The combination of \ndanger, grief, boredom, lack of meaningful work, heavy \nresponsibility, and even heavier burdens have led many forcibly \ndisplaced people to react in these ways.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the spirituality of Joseph, beautifully mingling with the \nhardships he faced, that makes his story one of hope. He surely \npondered the words of the angel: So get up, take the child and his \nmother and escape to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you to leave \n(Matt. 2:13, GNT). Part of this was an order; the other part was a \npromise. God was in control. One day, Joseph and his family would go \nback. The selfish and cruel rulers did not have the last word in the \nlife of Josephs family.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, Joseph and his family were in a delicate situation where he \nneeded to depend on God to make the most basic decisions. One wrong \ndecision could be fatal. When the time to go back came, the angel \ninstructed Joseph to return (Matt. 2:1920).\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain, Joseph was divinely guided to make a decision that was very \ndangerous. Anyone who has been a refugee recognizes this. In the camp \nfor displaced people where I lived, some men left to resume their \nnormal lives before the area was safe; their impatience cost them \ntheir lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world was still the worldeven at a moment of reprieve. God \nadvised Joseph not to live in Judea, but in Galilee. There was no \ncomplete safety, no complete relief. Herod was dead, but his son was \nin power (vv. 2123). God did not destroy all the wicked right then, \nbut neither did he allow his plans to be thwarted by them.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, the world is in some ways better than it was during Josephs \ntime. Human rights organizations can speak for the weak and help \nprotect their lives. However, humanity is still fallen and, \ntherefore, far less than perfect. The number of forcibly displaced \npeople in the world has risen to a 40-year high. Wars, earthquakes, \nvolcanic eruptions, hurricanes, pandemics, and the decisions of \nrulers can destroy our sense of safety and stability.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat said, we should never forget that God is at work and that he is \nwith us even at our darkest hour (Ps. 23:45). Besides, he has \npromised to instruct us in the way we should go (Ps. 32:8) as \ninstruments of his will on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs God used Joseph, so does he intend to use us to carry out his \npurposes for our generation. But this requires of us the kind of \nspirituality that transcends denominational traditions and legalistic \nmindsets. We must also carefully avoid the snares of the flesh to \nremain sensitive to God moving in our time.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as God does not allow these things to separate us from him, we \nshould not allow danger, insecurity, or even death to stop us from \ncooperating with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we do that? Not through complicated strategies, but with a \nfaith like Josephs: a simple, childlike faith, ready to depend on \nGod for the decisions we make, to do what he instructs us to do, and \nto go where he leads us without grumbling, whether it is comfortable \nor dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAcher Niyonizigiye is a pastor at Bujumbura International Community \nChurch\u0014",

She \nrushed to the staircase to greet her parents--and lost her footing. \nIn front of her mother's horrified eyes, she fell over the bannister \nonto the hard tile floor to her death. Josephine would never erase \nthat haunting sight from her memory. \"It was pitiful to see her, \nhelpless in her father's arms, her little drooping head resting on \nhis shoulder and her beautiful golden hair all stained with blood, \nfalling over his arm!\" But rather than retire into a half-mad world \nof grief and nostalgia, she turned her attention outward. \"[I] became \npossessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain \nkeener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe started to work with the prostitutes of Liverpool. Many had \nbecome street women out of desperation. Josephine was a beautiful \nupper-class woman, well-to-do with many connections. She opened a \nhome to reclaim lost women. As she learned more about their \ncondition, she became increasingly indignant at the unfair laws of a \nsystem that refused women the right to vote. Women should not be \ndenied the vote because they are different than men, she argued. They \nshould be given the vote precisely for that reason, because their \nneeds are different. She became a champion for women.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosephine, who had undergone a strong conversion experience as a \nteenager, needed the strength of faith in her lifelong battle for \nlaws favorable to women. She took on the Contagious Diseases Acts \nthat aimed to stop the spread of venereal disease. Under these laws, \nany woman in designated military towns could be forcibly inspected \nfor venereal disease. The law was completely unfair. Men were not \nexamined. Any woman, however pure, could be denounced to the \nauthorities and forced to get a certificate. Her reputation ruined, \nthe woman might actually be forced into the sex trade. \"This \nlegalization of vice, which is the endorsement of the 'necessity' of \nimpurity for man and the institution of slavery of woman, is the most \nopen denial which modern times have seen of the principle of the \nsacredness of the individual being,\" Josephine declared. She warned \nthat if a woman's rights could be stolen, so could anyone's.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she stood up to speak against outrageous practices, Josephine \nwas slandered. Her enemies heckled and harassed her. They smeared her \nwith dung. A mob smashed the windows of a hotel where she was \nstaying, trying to get at her and threatening to set it on fire. She \nfled through unfamiliar streets and hid behind piles of soap and \ncandles in a shop. Another time, she hid in a hayloft while her \nopponents lit a fire to smoke her out. Her husband's college job was \nthreatened but he encouraged her on. When his wife sheltered fallen \nwomen in their home, he treated them like high society ladies.\u0014\n\u0014\nFar from retreating, Josephine expanded her activities. \"...I felt \nvery weak and lonely,\" she admitted. \"But there was One who stood by \nme.\" She fought similar laws in Europe. In an age that tried to cover \nup sexual problems, she had the courage to address them openly. She \nfought against forced prostitution and appealed to governments not to \nlicense whorehouses. A government should never be in the sin \nbusiness, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile fighting government-sponsored prostitution, she always stood \nbeside the prostitutes. If Christ forgave such women, so should we, \nshe argued. Josephine succeeded in getting some hateful laws repealed \nand helped rouse public sentiment to pass a bill that raised the age \nof consent from thirteen to sixteen. However, she was largely \nforgotten when she died on this day, December 30, 1906.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Josephine. \"Some Thoughts on the Present Aspect of the \nCrusade Against the State Regulation of Vice.\" \nhttp://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/butler/ thoughts.html\u0014\nFisher, Trevor. \"Josephine Butler, Feminism's Neglected Pioneer.\" \nhttp://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m1373/n6_v46/ \n18381679/p1/article.jhtml?term=w.t.stead\u0014\nHay-Cooper, L.

Spurrier and his \nwife Ruby, one of five children. The family suffered due to the Great \nDepression, moving frequently, and ended up in Bluefield, West \nVirginia, where the younger Spurrier found work in a Civilian \nConservation Corps camp.[4] His mother died in the summer of 1940, \nand he decided to enlist in the Army.[5]\u0014\n\u0014\nCareer\u0014\nBy the fall of 1940, Spurrier was living in Wise County, Virginia. On \nSeptember 25, 1940, he voluntarily enlisted into the United States \nArmy from Richmond, Virginia.[1] Spurrier filled his name in the \nwrong blanks in his enlistment paperwork, and became known to the \nArmy throughout his time in service as \"Junior J. Spurrier.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent overseas on April 20, 1942, he first served in the infantry in \nthe Pacific Theater.[2] Injured in New Guinea in late 1943, he was \nreturned to the United States for medical treatment, first to Camp \nCarson, Colorado, then to San Francisco, California.[6][7] Deemed fit \nfor duty, Spurrier was sent overseas again in June 1944 at his own \nrequest. He was eventually assigned to Company G of the 134th \nInfantry Regiment, 35th Infantry Division, as a replacement private \non July 19, 1944. On July 26, 1944, he was promoted to staff sergeant \nand became a messenger and scout. On September 16, 1944, near \nLay-Saint-Christophe, France, he earned the Distinguished Service \nCross for spearheading an assault on a stubbornly-defended hill \nposition. While twice positioning himself on an American tank \ndestroyer, Spurrier used its .50 caliber machine gun to kill over a \ndozen German soldiers and force the surrender of twenty-two others. \nWhile fighting on the ground, he personally destroyed two enemy \ndugouts with hand grenades. Spurrier was awarded a Purple Heart for \nbeing wounded in action on September 21, 1944.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedal of Honor actions\u0014\n\u0014\nOn November 13, 1944, Spurrier singlehandedly attacked and fought \nGermans in the village of Achain, France. Spurrier repeatedly \nreturned to his company's command post with prisoners, and \nreplenished his ammunition from both American and enemy weapons to \ncontinue his attack on the occupied village. Spurrier earned the \nMedal of Honor for nearly single-handedly capturing the village of \nAchain that day; the medal was presented to Spurrier by Lieutenant \nGeneral William Hood Simpson, commander of the Ninth United States \nArmy, during a ceremony on March 6, 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\nStaff Sergeant Junior J. Spurrier's official Medal of Honor citation \nreads:\u0014\n\u0014\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of his life above \nand beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy at Achain, \nFrance, on 13 November 1944. At 2 p.m., Company G attacked the \nvillage of Achain from the east. S/Sgt. Spurrier armed with a BAR \npassed around the village and advanced alone. Attacking from the \nwest, he immediately killed 3 Germans. From this time until dark, \nS/Sgt. Spurrier, using at different times his BAR and M1 rifle, \nAmerican and German rocket launchers, a German automatic pistol, and \nhand grenades, continued his solitary attack against the enemy \nregardless of all types of small-arms and automatic-weapons fire. As \na result of his heroic actions he killed an officer and 24 enlisted \nmen and captured 2 officers and 2 enlisted men. His valor has shed \nfresh honor on the U.S. Armed Forces.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurrier was wounded again on December 9, 1944, receiving a second \nPurple Heart. He was transferred to Company K of the 134th Infantry \nRegiment on April 24, 1945, and returned to the United States soon \nafter. He was discharged from the U.S. Army on June 19, 1945. \nSpurrier had a younger brother, George, who also served in the Army \nand was killed in action in France on July 28, 1944 while with the \n314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater life and death\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurrier was noted as an extraordinarily brave and independent \nprankster who often clashed with his commanders, and went absent \nwithout leave several times during his service. Discharged after \nWorld War II, he attempted to go into business and had a brief stint \nas a pitcher with the Galax Leafs of the Class D Blue Ridge League \nbefore re-enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1947. He was elevated to the \nrank of technical sergeant and placed on recruiting duty.[8][9] He \nhad a severe problem with alcohol, and was demoted to the rank of \nprivate in 1950; Spurrier deserted his post during the Korean War and \nthe Army gave him a general discharge in 1951 rather than \ncourt-martial him. Spurrier had a turbulent and remarkable life after \nthe military. He had a difficult time adjusting to civilian life, \npossibly due to posttraumatic stress disorder, and had several \nrun-ins with the law in Virginia and Maryland. He eventually served \nthree jail sentences, including one for attempted murder, being \nreleased for the last time in 1969. Spurrier became a teetotaler, ran \na radio and television repair business, and retired to a cabin in \neastern Tennessee, where he died in relative obscurity on February \n25, 1984, at the age of 61. He is buried in Mountain Home National \nCemetery (Section HH, Row 15, Grave 8), in Johnson City, \nTennessee.[10]\u0014\n\u0014\nA memorial to Spurrier was dedicated at the Mercer County War Museum \non July 2, 2006. Several of Spurrier's original awards were believed \nlost, but were located in November 2011 by Granville, West Virginia, \npolice chief Craig Corkrean, in a safe belonging to his late father. \nSpurrier's Medal of Honor and other medals were presented to his two \nsurviving sisters in a ceremony held on December 2, 2011.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN ROBERTS PIONEERED FOR CHURCH IN WYOMING",
    "words": "FEARLESS JOHN ROBERTS PIONEERED FOR THE CHURCH IN WYOMING\u0014\n \u0014\nRev. John Roberts was a tough priest, not to be cowed by anyone or \nanything. In 1883, the winter he arrived in Wyoming to work as an \nEpiscopal priest among the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians, the \ntemperature plunged sixty degrees below zero and several travelers \nand stage drivers died or lost limbs to frostbite. Undeterred, \nRoberts traveled with a mail carrier for eight days through the \nintense cold and snow to reach the location to which his bishop had \nassigned him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWelsh-born, Roberts had already served in the Bahamas and in Colorado \nbefore coming to Wyoming. During a smallpox outbreak at Pueblo, he \nshowed his courage, working in the infirmary. When Robert's \napprenticeship was done, Bishop Spalding appointed the \nthirty-year-old priest to the Shoshone and Bannock Indian Agency in \nWyoming Territory (later renamed the Wind River Indian Reservation). \nThere he worked himself relentlessly to establish churches and \nconduct baptisms, weddings, and funerals. He buried a woman he was \nconvinced was Sacajawea, famed for accompanying the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition of 18031806. He also preached at the burial of Chief \nWashakie in 1900. Much of Roberts work was educational, however, and \nhe taught at the government school and opened a girls school.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe worked almost until his death at ninety-six-years of age on this \nday, 22 January 1949. In that time, he never lost his boldness. In \n1885, when Chief Washakies son became intoxicated and was killed \nwhen he would not leave a tavern, Washakie threatened retaliation \nagainst whites. Roberts went over and talked with him, winning a \nlife-long friend. According to Sarah Emilia Olden, who interviewed \nRoberts, the missionary offered his life in exchange for Washakies \nson, so impressing the Indian chief that he was baptized that night. \nHowever, Roberts family disputed the account, saying that Washakies \nresponse was The white man did not kill my son. Whiskey killed him. \nHowever, Washakie did grant lands to the Episcopal mission and \nreceived baptism around that time.\u0014\nAnother time, rather than allow a man to bleed to death because of \nthe butcher work of a quack surgeon, Roberts drove two half-tamed \nbroncos through the dark and cold sixteen miles to the nearest \ngarrison to fetch a military doctor. The mans life was savedjust \nbarely.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his desire to preserve Native American culture, Roberts worked \nwith Michael White Hawk to translate parts of the Bible into \nArapahoe. Luke 9:2526 (For what does it profit a man if he gains the \nwhole world, and loses or forfeits his own self? For whoever will be \nashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, \nwhen he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the \nholy angels.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Roberts later years, a congressional commission stated: He has \ndone more toward advancing these Indians in education, farming, and \nmechanical pursuits than all other agencies combined. Before his \ndeath, Roberts became blind. Married on Christmas Day, 1884, Roberts \nand his wife Laura Brown raised five children.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Jeopardy! Hasnt Had a Player Like Amy Schneider\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most successful woman to compete on the show can finally \ncelebrate her 40-day winning streak. And the money.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Shane ONeill    Jan. 26, 2022     New York Times\u0014\nOAKLAND, Calif.  When Amy Schneiders 40-day Jeopardy! winning \nstreak ended, she said she handed out thank you notes to the crew, \nbriefly chatted with other contestants, then excused herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nI went in the bathroom, cried for about 30 or 40 seconds, pulled \nmyself together and headed out, Ms. Schneider said from her sunny \napartment in Oakland on Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way she recounted her defeat mirrored the way she played on \nJeopardy!: quickly, efficiently and with matter-of-fact warmth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasnt just a feeling of sadness, there was a sense of relief, \nshe added. It was so exhausting.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schneiders continued success on the show meant that once her \nepisodes started taping at the end of September, she was competing in \nfive games a day, twice a week for several consecutive weeks, \ncommuting from Oakland to Los Angeles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time she filmed her last episode on Nov. 9, she had taken a \ndemotion at work, used all her paid time off and taken several unpaid \ndays in order to keep her job as a software engineer.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe left the show having won $1,382,800. But as of this week, her \ncheck hadnt arrived yet and Ms. Schneider was still working full \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt started airing when I knew that I had done this kind of historic \nthing and nobody else knew anything about it, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schneider watched her games from a bar in \nOakland.Credit...Carolyn Fong for The New York Times\u0014\nNow, people know. Ms. Schneider surpassed Matt Amodios 38-day \nstreak, leaving her behind only Ken Jennings, who won 74 consecutive \ngames in 2004.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a virtuoso in terms of accuracy and speed, but unlike Mr. \nAmodio, her style of play was traditional. Ms. Schneider favored \nplaying a single category vertically from the lowest to highest score \nrather than playing across the lucrative bottom row, a style \npopularized by James Holzhauer, who won $2,464,216 during his 32-game \nstreak in 2019. Ms. Schneider didnt bounce around the board looking \nfor Daily Doubles in the style of previous contestants like Chuck \nForrest and Arthur Chu. And her wagers tended to be conservative.\u0014\n\u0014\nA New Legend: Her dazzling 40-game run is over, but Amy Schneider \nreached historic milestones for money won and consecutive victories.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer strategy paid off. Ms. Schneider left the show as the \nhighest-winning woman in the shows history. Shes already a legend \namong both Jeopardy! fans and former contestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe depth and breadth of her knowledge are remarkable, said Terry \nWolfisch Cole, one of the 82 contestants who competed against Ms. \nSchneider during her run on the show.\u0014\n\u0014\nIll Give Anything a Shot Now\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the day I met Ms. Schneider, she had already given three \ninterviews. If she was tired of speaking to reporters, she didnt let \nit show.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe greeted me wearing an oxblood dress with big white polka dots \nfrom Anthropologie that revealed a large tattoo on her left arm of \nthe titular character from L. Frank Baums novel Ozma of Oz. Ozma \nhas special significance for Ms. Schneider. When she was an infant, \nshe was kidnapped and enchanted by an evil sorceress and raised as a \nboy, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then the enchantment was lifted and she was revealed to be the \nbeautiful princess she was all along, Ms. Schneider said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn lieu of her signature pearls, she wore a necklace that depicted \nthe Star, one of her favorite tarot cards. The necklace was a gift \nfrom her girlfriend, Genevieve Davis, 25, who is from Oakland and \nworks as a nanny. The night they met, Ms. Schneider gave Ms. Davis a \ntarot reading. Ms. Schneider describes herself as an atheist who \ndoesnt believe in the occult or the supernatural but, as she said, \nIts not a queer meet cute if theres not tarot.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schneider came to tarot via her ex-wife, who introduced her to \nRachel Pollacks book 78 Degrees of Wisdom. Tarot would have been \nout of the question when she was growing up in Dayton, Ohio. \nCatholicism was very important to her family, and Ms. Schneider \nstruggled with her faith when she was younger.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schneider has become somewhat of a style icon herself, posting \nimages of her outfits on Instagram.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe recounted one moment in 2002 when she had driven with her brother \nand two cousins to Toronto to see Pope John Paul II for World Youth \nDay. Ms. Schneider agreed to the trip in part to avoid telling her \nmother that she no longer considered herself Catholic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey waited in a field the night before to secure their spots but had \nneglected to bring tents or camping gear. As they tried to sleep, it \nstarted to rain. Then liturgical music started blaring over the sound \nsystem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time became a benchmark for Ms. Schneider. Whenever it gets \nbad, I think, Im not lying in a field in the rain, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince her transition in 2017, Ms. Schneider said that shes made a \npoint to say yes to new experiences. Because there was so much that \nI denied myself for so long, Ill give anything a shot now.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat included dabbling in stand-up comedy, piercing her nose and \nentering a new relationship, her first since she separated from her \nwife in 2016.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow 42, Ms. Schneider is enamored of her new girlfriend. The two \nwomen openly gush about each other, share inside jokes and dote on \ntheir black longhaired cat, Meep, whose toys were scattered across \ntheir living room floor. (In case you needed further proof that Ms. \nSchneider is a cat person, she scrubs her dishes with cat-shaped \nsponges and cuts her vegetables on a cat-shaped cutting board.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIve had two serious relationships in my life, and this is the \nsecond, Ms. Schneider said. When I met the woman who became my \nwife, I had never even kissed anyone and I was 25.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Is Public?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is an unfortunate pattern of Jeopardy! alums  particularly \nwomen  being targeted online after their appearances. Former \ncontestants have recounted incidents that included insults, creepy \nmessages and outright threats.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo prepare for this, Ms. Schneider followed the guidance offered to \nall new contestants by the shows producers, including locking down \nher social media accounts. She also created the public-facing \n@Jeopardamy Instagram and Twitter accounts. Still, these precautions \ndidnt prevent harassment online.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo far, she has mostly ignored the vitriol directed at her, or \nresponded with sarcasm, as she did in a thank you tweet she posted \non New Years Eve.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral weeks ago, Ms. Schneider was robbed at gunpoint in the lobby \nof her apartment building. She was not physically harmed and stressed \nthat she doesnt think the incident was related to her appearance on \nJeopardy! Still, its not her favorite thing to talk about.\u0014\n\u0014\nI tweeted about it, and so it was public, and thats on me, she \nsaid. But to have people in my life find out about this thing that \nhappened to me by seeing a news article was a slightly unsettling \nthing to happen.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she was preparing to compete, Ms. Schneider had to decide how \nshe wanted to look. She brought along a favorite pink blazer and made \na few trips to Target and Nordstrom Rack. She said she overpacked \njewelry, but after she won a few games in the pearls she thought \naudiences might like it if she continued with a signature accessory.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrans women watching can see me with my voice as it is and see me \nbeing OK with it, Ms. Schneider said.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe also considered how she wanted to sound.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve got a more feminine voice when I really want to, and Id sort \nof been planning on using that voice on TV, she said. But she \nultimately decided that consciously altering her voice could affect \nher gameplay and chose to speak in her usual register. Shes proud of \nthat decision.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrans women watching can see me with my voice as it is and see me \nbeing OK with it, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer voice had once been a source of dysphoria for Ms. Schneider, but \nnow she is considering turning it into a career. She recently signed \nwith the talent agency CAA and said that shes interested in voice \nacting.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe is also weighing a return to podcasting. She and her ex-wife used \nto co-host a Downton Abbey podcast, and she hosted a show about \nMoby-Dick and a tarot podcast called These Are Just Cards.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeopardy! forbids contestants to appear on other game shows for six \nmonths after they are on the show, but after that Ms. Schneider is \nalso open to more game show appearances, which could be well suited \nto her preternatural response time.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe practiced for Jeopardy! using click pens and said she didnt \nknow she had a gift for buzzing in until she was on the show. This \nfact will no doubt frustrate many contestants, some of whom train \nwith special buzzers, designed to mimic those used in the Jeopardy! \nstudios, to shave milliseconds from their buzzes.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Friday, Ms. Schneider went to the Heart and Dagger Saloon in \nOakland to watch herself play. She settled onto a bar stool to order \na sauvignon blanc and a pack of Parliament Lights.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother customer asked a bartender if the TV would be tuned to the \nWarriors game. No, were watching Jeopardy! the bartender \nreplied, nodding to Ms. Schneider. The man lit up when he recognized \nthe champion sitting next to him. Unbelievable! Cheers! he said, \ntoasting her. Moments later, a bearded man sitting next to him leaned \nover and asked, You got robbed?\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schneider smiled and nodded. Yeah, I got robbed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of the shows 30 minutes, two patrons sent free \ndrinks, which were happily accepted by Ms. Schneider.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter watching herself win $25,000 in Final Jeopardy, Ms. Schneider \nwent to the bars patio with Ms. Davis and their friend Hilary Hays.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Hays manages the @Jeopardamy Instagram account. I was like, \nLets get you on Instagram and get you some free stuff! Ms. Hays \nsaid, using an expletive.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Instagram account features a collection of portraits courtesy of \nthe show that are remarkably similar. Ms. Schneider is almost always \nframed identically, smiling in front of the shows blue set, head \ntilted, pearls around her neck. Her clothing is conservative, and the \ncaptions are direct: ??Day 32: Ive worn this blouse a few times now \nand who doesnt enjoy a good find from @target?\u0014\n\u0014\nI would have no interest if anyone else did it, but apparently \npeople like it, Ms. Schneider said of the account, which has more \nthan 25,000 followers. Ms. Hays said celebrities, including Kelly \nOsbourne, Molly Shannon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Amy Schumer, have \nsent her DMs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the goal was to get free stuff, it seemed to be working. The \nfollowing day, Ms. Schneider went to Nordstrom in San Francisco to \nshop for clothes with a stylist courtesy of the store. She was on the \nlookout for something to wear to Aprils GLAAD Media Awards, at which \nshe would be honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter settling on a haul that included a navy Alex Evenings gown, a \nblue and tan floral print dress by Maggy London, Marc Fisher pumps \nwith a chunky heel and some jewelry, Ms. Schneiders tab exceeded the \n$2,000 she had been given.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the cashier ran her credit card, her bank flagged the \ntransaction as potentially fraudulent. The irony of having a credit \ncard problem after having won more than a million dollars was not \nlost on Ms. Schneider, but there was little time to dwell on the \nmatter.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was already late for a free hair coloring appointment across town.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN CALVIN'S LAST SERMON",
    "words": "The Last Sermon of John Calvin\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 6, 1564, an era came to an end. The man who had \ndone as much as any other to forge the theology of the Reformation, \npreached his last sermon. Unable to walk, John Calvin was carried to \nchurch in a chair. His mouth filled with blood as he spoke and he had \nto leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin's mouth filled with blood as he preached his last sermon.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a significant moment. For twenty-three years he had led \nGeneva. In the process he planted the seeds of modern democracy and \nconstructed a logical framework on which to interpret Reformation \ndoctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin first came to Geneva in July 1536, planning to spend only \none night. He had already published the first edition of his famous \ntheology, Institutes of the Christian Religion. Having received some \ntraining as a priest and then his BA as a lawyer, Calvin was equipped \nto write on the subject of moral law. William Farel, Geneva's most \nprominent preacher and the man most eager to improve the city's \nmorals, saw in Calvin the helper he needed. He tried to persuade \nyoung Calvin to stay in Geneva. Calvin made excuses. Farel issued \nCalvin a stern warning which he said was from the Lord. Calvin gave \nin. That was the beginning of the partnership between Farel, Calvin \nand the people of Geneva.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeneva was a fun-loving city. Like the other Protestants, Calvin \ntaught that salvation is by the merit of Christ alone. At the same \ntime, he insisted that the man who hopes for salvation must show a \nchanged life. Farel and Calvin cracked down on the immorality of the \ncity. Within a year, Geneva expelled them. When told he must leave, \nCalvin calmly replied, \"If we had sought to please men, we should \nhave been badly rewarded, but we serve a higher Master, who will not \nwithhold from us our reward.\" He became the Professor of Theology at \nStrasburg.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the two outspoken pastors gone, Geneva slipped into moral and \npolitical deterioration. The citizens changed their minds. They \ninvited Calvin back. He hesitated to return, knowing that he might be \nin for years of tough opposition. In the end, his conscience made him \ngo back. He proposed a new form of rule. As biographer Richard Taylor \nStevenson writes: \"Catholicism is a religion of priests, Lutheranism \nof theologians, Calvinism of the believing congregation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIdeas of government created by Calvin found wider expression in \nScotland and the United States when Calvinists brought them to those \ncountries. Calvin's model of church government became the model for \nnational governments. Thus millions of individuals, Christian and \nnon-Christian alike, felt the influence of Calvin's theology even \nwhere his name was little known.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMorgan, Robert J.

    "title": "JOHN'S MOUTH MADE HIM FAMOUS AND CAUSED HIS DEATH",
    "words": "JOHNS GOLDEN MOUTH MADE HIM FAMOUS AND CAUSED HIS EXILE\u0014\n \u0014\nJohn was such a brilliant and forceful preacher that an admirer gave \nhim a nickname that stuck: Chrysostom, golden mouthed. But the same \nattributes that raised him to fame brought about his exile and death.\u0014\n\u0014\nReared in Antioch, Syria, by his mother, a Christian widow, \nChrysostom studied rhetoric under Libanius, a pagan master of the \nart. However, he found himself attracted to Christianity and switched \nto theology. Becoming a hermit, he ruined his health in ascetic \npractices. Returning to Antioch he reluctantly accepted a church \nposition. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe rose to fame in 387 after rioters defaced imperial statues in \nAntioch. While old bishop Flavian hurried to Constantinople to plead \nfor mercy, terrified townsfolk crowded to hear Chrysostom preach the \nhomilies on the statues. Typical of his admonitions were his words, \n[We have] a fear of death, which is a mask that might well be \ndespised; but have no fear of sin, which is truly dreadful; and, even \nas fire, devours the conscience. . . . Sorrow not for the dying man; \nbut sorrow for him who is living in sin!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the patriarch of Constantinople died, Theophilus, patriarch of \nAlexandria, wanted to place his own candidate in the vacant post. But \nEutropius, the powerful court chamberlain, did not want Theophilus to \nhave that much influence. He determined to obtain Chrysostom for the \npost because of his impressive rhetoric, and he threatened the \ndespicable Theophilus with well-deserved criminal charges unless he \nsupported Chrysostom. Theophilus caved.\u0014\n\u0014\nEutropius then persuaded Emperor Arcadius to agree to Chrysostom. \nWith imperial backing, he quietly kidnapped the priest, whose people \nwould not otherwise permit him to leave Antioch. Once Chrysostom \nrealized what was happening, he protested, but to no avail. Off to \nConstantinople he must go. On this day, 26 February 398, Theophilus \nhimself consecrated Chrysostom.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first, both nobles and commoners were pleased with their new \npatriarch. Theophilus, however, retained intense hatred of him. And \nbecause Chrysostom preached with scathing satire against the sins of \nhis age, he roused opposition. He especially angered those who lived \nin excessive luxury and who abused their wealthsins of which Empress \nEudoxia, most courtiers, and many churchmen were guilty. It did not \nhelp that slanderers accused him of comparing Eudoxia to Jezebel, the \nwicked queen of the Old Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 403, Theodosius and the empress colluded with Chrysostoms \necclesiastical enemies to call a council to condemn him. The Bishop \nof neighboring Chalcedon readily hosted the council. The hostile \nprelates ordered Chrysostom to appear, but he refused, saying a \ncouncil of his enemies was no proper venue to try him. Rather, a \ncouncil of the whole church ought to determine his fate. The council \nsaid that his refusal to appear was sufficient cause for \ncondemnation. Eudoxia prevailed on weak-willed Arcadius to \nimmediately exile Chrysostom.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, some event soon frightened her and in superstitious terror \nshe demanded the archbishops recall. Mobs threatened Theophilus, who \nfled. After three days of pleas and promises, Chrysostom returned. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few months later the city dedicated a silver statue of Eudoxia. The \nfestivities included indecent and pagan entertainment. Chrysostom \nthundered against the depravity. In fury, Eudoxia called for his \nexile. Chrysostom compared her to Herodias, the wicked Bible queen, \nwho had demanded the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe breach was irrevocable. At Easter 404, soldiers drove catechumens \nfrom Chrysostoms cathedral. When the people regrouped for baptism at \nthe public baths, soldiers set upon them with swords. Chrysostom was \na prisoner in his own home. Finally, shortly after Pentecost, the \nemperor forced him out of Constantinople. The Church of St. Sophia \nburned that night, each side accusing the other of setting the fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn exile, Chrysostom continued to correspond with faithful friends. \nTo end even this influence, the emperor ordered him transferred to a \ndistant post on the Black Sea. He appointed two guards known for \nferocity to march the sick man without mercy until he dropped. They \nobeyed. Chrysostom died 14 September 407.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "March 12, 2022y \u0014\nJESUIT FOUNDER HELPED REVIVE CATHOLICISM\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1922, Pope Pius XI declared Iigo Ignatius Loyola the patron \nsaint of all spiritual retreats. This was largely because of the \nSpiritual Exercises which Loyola had developed in the sixteenth \ncentury. The Exercises were a systematic series of prayerful \nreflections focused on Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man, Basque-born Loyola was a courtier and soldier. In \n1521, the twenty-nine year old Loyola was in command of a Spanish \ncitadel when a French cannonball struck him in the legs, ending his \nmilitary career. While recovering from operations to break and reset \nhis right leg and to saw off a protruding bone, he asked for works of \nfiction to divert himself. None were available, so he settled for a \nlife of Christ and a collection of the lives of saints. He began to \nenvision himself in the role of a spiritual hero.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe found that after he daydreamed about worldly pleasures, he felt \ndepressed and dry, but when he contemplated fasts and penances, he \nwas uplifted. And so, while the Protestant reformers were rejecting \nfasts, pilgrimages, self-flagellation, and other austerities as the \nmeans to find God, Loyola embraced all these methods. He wanted to do \nsomething great for Gods glory. Shortly after adopting his plan to \nimitate the saints, he had a vision of Mary with the baby Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy degrees he overcame scruples and even a temptation to kill \nhimself, calling on God for relief from his thoughts. Once relief \ncame only after he had fasted from food and drink for a week of \nprayer. His autobiography tells that another time, when he was sick, \nit came to his mind that he was already justified before God. Calling \nto mind his sins, he tried to combat the thought, but could not \novercome it, and this struggle to overcome temptation caused him much \nmore suffering than the fever. In 1523, he begged his way to \nJerusalem, returning to Spain the following year. He had many more \nvisions of Christ, Mary, and the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his return from the Holy Land, Loyola entered school to fill \ngaps in his education and to prepare for the priesthood. Meanwhile, \nhe taught others using his Spiritual Exercises.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the Reformation spreading throughout Europe, Catholic \nauthorities regarded any new teaching with suspicion. Consequently, \nLoyola was often questioned by the Inquisition and religious leaders. \nHe was even imprisoned twice. Always he affirmed his Catholic \northodoxy. Despite opposition, he persisted in preaching and teaching \nuntil, in Salmanaca, he was ordered to teach no more until he became \na priest. He did not say his first Mass until almost a dozen years \nlater, in 1538.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring 1534, he and several friends had organized themselves into a \nfraternity for doing good. In 1540, they sought papal recognition as \nan order of the church. Pope Paul III approved the Society of Jesus \n(the Jesuits) but was reluctant to grant it much power because its \nmembers considered themselves soldiers of Christ to go where needed, \nand were not bound to convents, set times of prayer, priestly garb, \nor the austerities that had dominated Loyolas early efforts to \nplease God. Therefore the pope limited the Jesuits to sixty members. \nHowever, they soon proved so useful in the Catholic \nCounter-Reformation as diplomats, missionaries, educators, preachers, \nagitators, and martyrs, that the restriction was lifted. By Loyolas \ndeath in 1556, there were already a thousand Jesuits.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoyola spent his last years overseeing the fast-growing society and \ndirecting its energies worldwide. Over the years, he wrote its \nConstitutions (guides for daily operations). Pope Paul V beatified \nLoyola in 1609, and on this day, 12 March 1622, Pope Gregory XV \ndeclared him a saint.\u0014",

    "words": "John Newton Converted by Amazing Grace\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010  3 May\u0014\n \u0014\nTo be at sea in a storm on an ocean liner can be thrilling. To face a \nstorm in a sailing vessel that is not seaworthy can be terrifying. \nThe boat in which John Newton sailed was in disrepair and its sails \nand rigging worn. A hard man who had often mocked God, John was \nconsidered impious even by his godless mates.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne night he was wakened by a violent wave crashing against the \nvessel. Water filled his cabin. Hurrying above, he found that timbers \nhad been ripped away. All were in terrible danger as the ship plunged \nthrough a furious storm. Men pumped desperately. Clothes and bedding \nwere stuffed into holes and boards nailed over them. John joined \nthose who were manning the pumps.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo exhausted to pump any longer, he was lashed to the wheel to try \nand steer the ship. The storm raged on and on. It was bitterly cold, \nthe more so since the men had few clothes left. In this desperate \nmoment John turned his eyes back over his life. Raised to the age of \nseven by a Christian mother, he had sought the Lord with fasts and \nprayers, but failing to find God he had become embittered. Despite \nthis, the Lord preserved him through many dangers. Once he was even \nmade a servant to slaves on the West coast of Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his heart he believed Christianity to be true. This brought him no \nconsolation. \"I concluded my sins were too great to be forgiven. I \nwaited with fear and impatience to receive my doom.\" But soon he \nheard the glad news that the ship was freed of water. \"I began to \npray...to think of that Jesus that I had so often derided; I \nrecollected his death: a death for sins not his own, but, as I \nremembered, for the sake of those who should put their trust in him.\" \nOn this day, March 21, 1747 (new calendar) a day he ever after \nobserved, John realized he needed a Savior to intercede for him with \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe snatched a free moment to open the Bible and begin to read. Though \nthe storm raged on for days, John spent every free moment in the \nScripture and praying for guidance. Hungry, cold, exhausted, the men \nkept the ship afloat. Only one died of exhaustion but the Captain \nmuttered that John ought to be thrown overboard like Jonah; his \nwickedness was the cause of all their misery, he claimed. Finally \nthey reached Ireland.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy then John was convinced the Lord had reached down and delivered \nhis soul. The story of the Prodigal Son seemed to exactly fit his \ncase. He never turned back from that day of salvation, although, not \nrealizing slavery was a sin, he worked six years as a slaver. He \nshowed kindness to the slaves he transported, held worship services \nfor his men and wrote hymns for them. Later he saw that slavery was \nwrong and became an abolitionist and a minister. Reflecting on his \nhard life, he wrote one of the world's most loved hymns: \"Amazing \ngrace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's Glimpses #28.\u0014\nDemaray, Donald E.

    "words": "JESUITS: FROM POST-REFORMATION RENEWAL TO SUPPRESSION TO THE PAPACY\u0014\n \u0014\nDuring the seventeenth century, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) spread \nthroughout Europe. Founded in 1540, the order vowed to do the bidding \nof popes. It became famous for its far-flung missions and its \ninnovative educational methods. On the good side, Jesuits founded \nhundreds of schools and protected the rights of indigenous people in \nLatin America. But many Jesuits also subverted governments and \nincited persecution of Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome universities, cities, and states resisted the society. They \ncomplained about it to parliaments, kings, and popes. In 1565, an \nAustrian assembly demanded its banishment from Germany and Hungary. \nAntwerp expelled the society in 1578 because it refused to abide by a \ntreaty. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Jesuits plotted to assassinate her, Elizabeth I of England \nissued an order against them in 1591. In 1597, Henry IV of France \nrestricted them because they tried to take his life and to undermine \npeace with Protestants. Elizabeths successor, James I, laid out a \ndetailed case against the society in 1604. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1603, the Parliament of Paris noted that Jesuits were \ntroublemakers. When the King of Spain usurped the government of \nPortugal, all the Religious Orders adhered firmly to their King, the \nJesuits excepted, who deserted him, and were the cause of two \nthousand deaths, for which they obtained a special Bull of \nAbsolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe uneasy relationship between Jesuits and Catholic nations \ncontinued into the following century. Portugal expelled the Jesuits \nin 1759 and France in 1764. On this day, 2 April 1767, authorities \nthroughout Spain opened sealed copies of a letter from their \nsovereign, Charles III. The next morning, they arrested six thousand \nJesuits, loaded them on ships, and sent them to Italy. Charles had \ngrown alarmed at Jesuit wealth and power. He may have believed they \nwere preparing to overthrow his government. He also expelled the \nsociety from his South American territories and from Naples.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Jesuits had always returned after banishment, European \nleaders demanded a permanent solution. Pope Clement XIV abolished the \nsociety in 1773. Jesuits went undercover or took refuge in Prussia \nand in Russia.\u0014\n \u0014\nPope Pius VII restored the society in 1814. He needed help against \nNapoleon who had humiliated and imprisoned him. The restored Jesuits \nlobbied for the 1870 decree of papal infallibility. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the twentieth century, many Jesuits incorporated secular humanism \nor Marxism into their theologies.  They ignored or defied popes who \nresisted the trend. They butted heads with John Paul II who opposed \ncommunism. Yet in 2013 an Argentine Jesuit, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, \nbecame Pope Francis I. The society had come a long way since its \nsuppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "JOHN CLARKE IS THE TRUE FOUNDER OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1620, the Pilgrims left England to practice their Puritan faith in \nthe New World. Boston soon became their leading city. By 1637, Boston \nseethed with disagreements over grace versus worksliving faith \nversus formal orthodoxy. More was at stake than theology. The quarrel \ninvolved toleration versus conformity, organization of civil society, \nand womens rights. The works faction forced the grace faction out of \npublic office, silenced them, confiscated their weapons, and banished \nmany.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. John Clarke arrived in Boston in 1637. He was well-educated and a \nstrong believer in the religious liberty he had experienced in \nHolland. At once he got into trouble for defending Anne Hutchinson, \nwho argued for the covenant of grace. Clarke asked permission for the \npersecuted families to seek a new place to live. Massachusetts \ngranted his request. The banished folk settled in Rhode Island. Roger \nWilliams, an earlier exile from Massachusetts, welcomed them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe exiles bought land from the Narragansett at the price the Indians \nnamed. Payment was in beads. But the settlers added gifts of \nclothing, hoes, and wampum (strings or sashes of polished shells). \nClarke had a hand in founding both Portsmouth and Newport. In 1644, \nhe became the founder and pastor of First Baptist Church at Newport.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1651, Massachusetts arrested Clarke because he preached in its \nterritory while on business. Seized with him were John Crandall and \nObadiah Holmes. Judges commanded each to pay a fine or be whipped. \nClarke won his freedom on appeal; Crandall paid his fine; but Holmes \nrefused to pay, saying to do so would be to admit he had done wrong. \nHe was given thirty lashes and was in such pain he had to crouch on \nhands and knees, unable to rest against any other part of his body.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbuse of that sort was unknown in Rhode Island which practiced \nself-government and soul liberty (the right of individual \nconscience). The colony even accepted Quakers, whose doctrines other \nProtestants considered unorthodox. Civil authority was weak, however, \nand the place was close to anarchy. William Coddington gained power, \noverturning a charter Roger Williams had obtained in 1644. In 1652, \nClarke and Williams sailed to England and got the charter restored. \nClarke remained in London to defend Rhode Islands interests. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Restoration ended the Commonwealth in 1660, Rhode Islands \n1644 charter was void. Clarke recognized that Rhode Island needed a \nlaw that would secure its liberties. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor the next three years he lobbied for a comprehensive charter. King \nCharles II granted it in 1663. The charter codified the separation of \ncivil and religious power and the freedom of individuals to believe \nas they chose. It defined Rhode Islands boundaries and recognized \nIndian land sales. The charter established a legislature, executive, \nand judiciary, and provided for military defense.\u0014\nDuring his years in London, Clarke practiced medicine. As he had used \nup all his own resources in Rhode Islands cause, an admirer had to \npay his passage back to New England. He served as an administrator \nand pastor there until he died on this day, 20 April 1676.\u0014\nHistorian Thomas W. Bicknell summed up Clarkes profound contribution \nto freedom with these words: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Prior to the English Revolution of the Seventeenth Century, however, \nnowhere on the face of the earth and among civilized men, did civil \nand soul-liberty jointly exist. Its first clear, full, deliberate, \norganized and permanent establishment in the world can now be \ndistinctly traced to the Colony of Rhode Island, on the island of \nAquidneck, in Narragansett Bay, under the leadership and inspiration \nof Dr. John Clarke, the true Founder.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Joan of Arc Relieved Orleans\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout much of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the \nEnglish fought the French, claiming France. The English had the upper \nhand of it until Joan of Arc appeared. In fact, the dauphin (who \nbecame Charles VII) had not even been crowned at Reims, the \ntraditional site of French coronations, when Joan came to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nA simple and pious peasant girl who wove and spun, Joan saw heavenly \nbeings and heard their voices. She understood that deliverance would \ncome to France through her. The voices sent her to the nearest French \nbastion, but her pleas were ignored. Eventually, Joan convinced local \nauthorities. One thing led to another. She picked the disguised \ndauphin out of a crowd of courtiers and made prophecies (which were \nrecorded in a letter written from Lyons on April 22, 1429). These \ncame true.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of her predictions was that she would save Orleans. Orleans, \ncrucial to the defense of France, was besieged by the English. Joan \nsent letters of defiance to them. On this day, April 29, 1429, a \nrapid march brought Joan of Arc with her French forces to the city. \nIt was the turning point of the One Hundred Year's War. The English \nretreated the next day, but as it was Sunday, Joan forbid the French \nto pursue them. Within a few days, the English garrisons around \nOrleans had all been captured. Joan was wounded in the fighting, \nwhich was also as she had predicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe irresolute dauphin had to be coaxed into action. Joan convinced \nhim to undertake various moves, which he did half-heartedly. A \ndramatic French victory at Pasay opened the way for Charles to retake \nReims. Again Joan had difficulty convincing him to carry through with \nthe logical step of having himself crowned, but he finally did. Then \nshe knelt before him and called him king.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe voices told her she had less than a year left for her work. \nFrustrating months they proved to be, too. The king and his advisors \nlacked the boldness to pursue the advantages Joan had gained. A \nfeeble attempt to retake Paris failed. Not long afterward, Joan was \ncaptured by the English, who brought charges of witchcraft against \nher. Determined to find grounds for executing her, they did not allow \nher any legal counsel and loosed a pack of high-powered theologians \non her (although some Englishmen, to their credit, urged mercy).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs could be expected with such a stacked trial, she was convicted. In \na terrified moment she recanted with the caveat that she did so only \nas far as it was God's will. Quickly she regained her courage and did \nnot waver again, even when brought to the stake. She asked that a \ncrucifix be held before her face, and called upon the name of Jesus \nas long as breath remained in her. Subsequent inquiries exonerated \nher and the pope officially canonized her as a saint in 1920.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nFuller, Thomas. \"The Life of Joan of Arc.\" The Holy State and the \nProfane State, volume II.

    "title": "JOHN FLAVEL, CONSCIENTIOUS PURITAN",
    "words": "\u0014\nJOHN FLAVEL, CONSCIENTIOUS PURITAN\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 27 April 1650, a church committee appointed John Flavel \nto assist Mr. Walplate, the dying minister of Diptford, Devon, \nEngland. This marked the beginning of Flavels long association with \nDevon. Realizing that his university education had done little to \nprepare him for a pastorate, he studied hard on his own. To avoid any \nbias owing to unpaid tithes, he commissioned an honest and kindly man \nto handle them for him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe accepted a call to Dartmouth although it meant a loss of income. \nHe was unsparing in his efforts to live close to Christ and to draw \nothers to a similar closeness. As a nonconformist (a pastor outside \nthe Church of England), he suffered persecution and was often forced \nto preach secretly in woods and in private homes. Once he disguised \nhimself as a woman to get to a baptism without discovery by his \nenemies. His closeness to his people was so strong, they walked miles \nto hear him during those years when he was banned from his pulpit. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis life was representative of the best of Englands seventeenth \ncentury nonconformists. He was known for his passion at prayer. For \ninstance, learning that a sea battle was in progress, and knowing \nthat many Dartmouth boys were in the navy, he led his people in \nprayer and fasting. Not one of Dartmouths many sailors perished. \nWhen opponents burned him in effigy, he fell to his knees to pray for \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlavels books sought to impress readers with the need for true \nrepentance, holy living, and full commitment to Christ. A few of his \nstatements about Christ will illustrate the tenor of his thought: No \ndoctrine is more excellent, or necessary to be preached and studied, \nthan Jesus Christ, and him crucified; The law sends us to Christ to \nbe justified, and Christ sends us to the law to be regulated; Did \nChrist finish His work for us? Then there can be no doubt but He will \nalso finish His work in us; Christ is so in love with holiness, \nthat at the price of His blood He will buy it for us.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlavel married four times. His first wife, Jane Randal, died in \nchildbirth (the baby died, too). His second wife, Elizabeth Morries, \ndied after about five years of marriage. The third wife, Ann Downe, \nbore him two sons during eleven years of marriage. The fourth, a \nwidow named Dorothy (daughter of George Jeffries), outlived him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of his life, Flavel wrote of himself and \nfellow-ministers, We have long borne the burden and heat of the day; \nwe are veteran soldiers almost worn out. He preached his last sermon \non 21 June 1691, taking 1 Corinthians 10: 12 for its text, Wherefore \nlet him that stands take heed lest he fall, urging those who were \ncareless about their Christian profession to show a deeper concern \nfor their souls. Over the next few days he was engaged with other \nministers in forging a union of Presbyterians and Independents. \nFlavel died unexpectedly of a severe stroke on 26 June 1691, having \njust completed a letter to a London preacher describing the \nproceedings for union. Among his last words were, It will go well \nwith me. Faithful to the end, he had kept his own advice: Oh, study \nyour hearts, watch your hearts, keep your hearts.\u0014",

Spurrier and his \nwife Ruby, one of five children. The family suffered due to the Great \nDepression, moving frequently, and ended up in Bluefield, West \nVirginia, where the younger Spurrier found work in a Civilian \nConservation Corps camp. His mother died in the summer of 1940, and \nhe decided to enlist in the Army. \u0014\nCareer\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the fall of 1940, Spurrier was living in Wise County, Virginia. On \nSeptember 25, 1940, he voluntarily enlisted into the United States \nArmy from Richmond, Virginia. Spurrier filled his name in the wrong \nblanks in his enlistment paperwork, and became known to the Army \nthroughout his time in service as \"Junior J. Spurrier.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSent overseas on April 20, 1942, he first served in the infantry in \nthe Pacific Theater. Injured in New Guinea in late 1943, he was \nreturned to the United States for medical treatment, first to Camp \nCarson, Colorado, then to San Francisco, California. Deemed fit for \nduty, Spurrier was sent overseas again in June 1944 at his own \nrequest. He was eventually assigned to Company G of the 134th \nInfantry Regiment, 35th Infantry Division, as a replacement private \non July 19, 1944. On July 26, 1944, he was promoted to staff sergeant \nand became a messenger and scout. On September 16, 1944, near \nLay-Saint-Christophe, France, he earned the Distinguished Service \nCross for spearheading an assault on a stubbornly-defended hill \nposition. While twice positioning himself on an American tank \ndestroyer, Spurrier used its .50 caliber machine gun to kill over a \ndozen German soldiers and force the surrender of twenty-two others. \nWhile fighting on the ground, he personally destroyed two enemy \ndugouts with hand grenades. Spurrier was awarded a Purple Heart for \nbeing wounded in action on September 21, 1944.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedal of Honor actions\u0014\n\u0014\nOn November 13, 1944, Spurrier singlehandedly attacked and fought \nGermans in the village of Achain, France. Spurrier repeatedly \nreturned to his company's command post with prisoners, and \nreplenished his ammunition from both American and enemy weapons to \ncontinue his attack on the occupied village. Spurrier earned the \nMedal of Honor for nearly single-handedly capturing the village of \nAchain that day; the medal was presented to Spurrier by Lieutenant \nGeneral William Hood Simpson, commander of the Ninth United States \nArmy, during a ceremony on March 6, 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\nStaff Sergeant Junior J.

At 2 p.m., Company G attacked the \nvillage of Achain from the east. S/Sgt. Spurrier armed with a BAR \npassed around the village and advanced alone. Attacking from the \nwest, he immediately killed 3 Germans. From this time until dark, \nS/Sgt. Spurrier, using at different times his BAR and M1 rifle, \nAmerican and German rocket launchers, a German automatic pistol, and \nhand grenades, continued his solitary attack against the enemy \nregardless of all types of small-arms and automatic-weapons fire. As \na result of his heroic actions he killed an officer and 24 enlisted \nmen and captured 2 officers and 2 enlisted men. His valor has shed \nfresh honor on the U.S. Armed Forces.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurrier was wounded again on December 9, 1944, receiving a second \nPurple Heart. He was transferred to Company K of the 134th Infantry \nRegiment on April 24, 1945, and returned to the United States soon \nafter. He was discharged from the U.S. Army on June 19, 1945. \nSpurrier had a younger brother, George, who also served in the Army \nand was killed in action in France on July 28, 1944, while with the \n314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater life and death\u0014\n\u0014\nSpurrier was noted as an extraordinarily brave and independent \nprankster who often clashed with his commanders, and went absent \nwithout leave several times during his service. Discharged after \nWorld War II, he attempted to go into business and had a brief stint \nas a pitcher with the Galax Leafs of the Class D Blue Ridge League \nbefore re-enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1947. He was elevated to the \nrank of technical sergeant and placed on recruiting duty.[ He had a \nsevere problem with alcohol, and was demoted to the rank of private \nin 1950; Spurrier deserted his post during the Korean War and the \nArmy gave him a general discharge in 1951 rather than court-martial \nhim. Spurrier had a turbulent and remarkable life after the military. \nHe had a difficult time adjusting to civilian life, possibly due to \nposttraumatic stress disorder, and had several run-ins with the law \nin Virginia and Maryland. He eventually served three jail sentences, \nincluding one for attempted murder, being released for the last time \nin 1969. Spurrier became a teetotaler, ran a radio and television \nrepair business, and retired to a cabin in eastern Tennessee, where \nhe died in relative obscurity on February 25, 1984, at the age of 61. \nHe is buried in Mountain Home National Cemetery (Section HH, Row 15, \nGrave 8), in Johnson City, Tennessee. \u0014\nA memorial to Spurrier was dedicated at the Mercer County War Museum \non July 2, 2006. Several of Spurrier's original awards were believed \nlost, but were located in November 2011 by Granville, West Virginia, \npolice chief Craig Corkrean, in a safe belonging to his late father. \nSpurrier's Medal of Honor and other medals were presented to his two \nsurviving sisters in a ceremony held on December 2, 2011. \u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: My mother was Osalene Spurrier. I don't know the exact \nconnection, but Junior Spurrier was, I think, a third cousin to her. \nHe visited in our home when he was in Richmond in 1946 to be \nrecognized by Virginia, and a guest of a parade sposored by the \nstate. I was 13 at the time, but we had an excellent sharing time, \nallowing me to ask him many questions about his experience in \n\"capturing several towns in Germany.\" The story was slightly \ndifferent from the one reported in the paper.\u0014",

    "title": "JUDGE THOMAS JEFFERSON BY HIS IDEALS OR HIS ACTIONS",
    "words": "Should We Judge Thomas Jefferson by His Ideals or His Actions?\u0014\nA new biography maps out the moral tensions that tormented his mind \nand tainted his legacy.\u0014\nDANIEL N. GULLOTTA\u0014\n|\u0014\nThomas Jefferson continues to inspire and divide Americans. Even \nthough he still ranks in the top 10 in C-SPANs Presidential \nHistorians Survey, recent years have witnessed Jeffersons name and \nimage removed from schools, libraries, and the halls of government. \nJeffersons statue at his own University of Virginia served as a \nrallying point for white supremacists during the summer of 2017. All \nthe while, Daveed Diggss flamboyant portrayal of him in the musical \nHamilton was winning acclaim on Broadway.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of this controversy stems from Jeffersons dual identity as the \nauthor of the Declaration of Independence and his status as one of \nthe nations most prominent slaveholders. Add to this the unsettling \nreality that Jefferson fathered at least six children with an \nenslaved woman, Sally Hemings, and its little wonder that many \nAmericans find themselves wondering how such a man could have penned \nthe words All men are created equal. With the 250th anniversary of \nthe American Revolution looming, it is difficult to predict if and \nhow Jeffersons name will be invoked.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many, Jeffersons life is nothing but a testimony to his own \nhypocrisy, while others see Jefferson as a visionary bound to the \nconditions of his time. The latest book from historian Thomas Kidd, \nThomas Jefferson: A Biography of Spirit and Flesh, attempts to shed \nlight on Jeffersons puzzling philosophy and problematic past.\u0014\n\u0014\nDilemmas and dramas\u0014\n\u0014\nKidds goal is not to write a new life story of Jefferson, but rather \nto illuminate and grapple with his ethical and moral universe. \nBecause of this, Kidds biography is amazingly (and mercifully) \nsuccinct, at least compared to the mammoth accounts produced by other \nhistorians. Whereas political battles frame most Jefferson \nbiographies, moral tensions and intellectual conflicts dominate \nKidds telling.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing a loose chronology of Jeffersons life and times, Kidd situates \nreaders to the dilemmas and dramas defining his thought at any given \ntime, from Christian orthodoxy to romantic pursuits to slavery. \nMapping out the main influencers on Jeffersons thoughtsuch as John \nLocke and Algernon Sidney on the Declaration of Independence, \nMontesquieu on colonization and racial separation, and the trappings \nof the Souths honor cultureKidd helps readers understand the makeup \nof Jeffersons brain on any given subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, A Biography of Spirit and Flesh is devoted to following \nJeffersons intellectual and religious development, both in terms of \nits sources as well as its evolution in different spaces and \nsituations.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven Kidds status as one of todays most popular and preeminent \nChristian historians, his take on Jeffersons religious profile also \nserves as a vital corrective to the pseudohistory produced by figures \nlike David Barton, who promote an uncomplicated synthesis between \nChristianity and the American founding. Granted, Kidds Jefferson is \nno secularist champion, and this book rejects the easy pigeonholing \nof Jefferson as a mere deist. Though he was surely heterodox in \nrejecting doctrines like the Trinity, he truly saw himself as a \nfollower of Jesus and was devoted to a naturalistic vision of \nChristianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, Kidd pushes back against the idea that the Declaration was \nintended as a purely secular document and that its references to God \nwere added later by the Continental Congress. As he highlights, \nNatures God was already in Jeffersons draft of the document, a \nreference to his belief in a creator god. Kidd is at his best when \nprobing Jeffersons soul searching, illustrating his doubts, and \nmapping his beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf one word has haunted (and been hurled at) Jefferson more than any \nother, it would be hypocrite, a word Kidd is not afraid to employ \nwhen appropriate. Naturally, Jeffersons status as an enslaver with \nantislavery sentiments is the most perplexing paradox, but as Kidd \ndemonstrates, Jefferson was capable of a multitude of ambiguities and \ncontradictions. For example, despite his antipathy towards many \nconventional forms of religious devotion, Jefferson maintained that \ntraditional religion had its benefits for society. And \nnotwithstanding his disregard for the Bibles miracle accounts, \nJefferson was deeply conversant with its stories and even attempted \nto produce his own version of the Gospels, known today as the \nJefferson Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother area of hypocrisy was the financial realm, where Jefferson \nwas truly duplicitous. He indulged in lavish wines, a steady supply \nof new books, and ambitious architecture, all while advocating the \nvirtue of frugality to family and friends. Though he neared financial \nruin on several occasions, Jefferson seemed incapable of heeding his \nown wisdom. Acknowledging this shortcoming, Jefferson confessed to \nJames Monroe that I had rather be ruined in my fortune than in their \nesteem.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it is precisely this financial recklessness that further \nentrenched Jefferson into slavery. Although he called slavery a \nmoral depravity, his mounting debts and his genteel pride made \nescaping it improbable. Kidd compares Jeffersons attitudes on \nslavery to a high-wire act, rightly pointing out that even by the \nstandards of his own time and in the eyes of many of his \ncontemporaries, his views on slavery were often strained and \nfrequently contradictory. George Washington, who bore financial \nburdens of his own, took at least modest acts against slavery within \nhis own estate. Measured against them, Jeffersons inaction appears \nall the more indefensible.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, as Kidd chronicles, Jeffersons language in the Declaration was \nused almost instantly to denounce Black bondage by figures like James \nOtis and Lemuel Haynes, and by various antislavery societies. There \nis even evidence that Jeffersons message of liberty may have \ninspired Gabriels Rebellion, a slave uprising planned for Richmond, \nVirginia, in 1800. Nevertheless, while he could sympathize with \nenslaved people who sought their freedom by any means necessary, \nJefferson viewed the Haitian Revolution with horror, not as a \ncontinuation of his own revolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilling spirit, weak flesh\u0014\n\u0014\nNo doubt accusations of hypocrisy will continue to hound Jefferson, \nand rightly so. After reading Kidds biography, another epithet that \ncomes to mind is cowardly. In another display of contradictions and \ntensions, the revolutionary Jefferson was mindful of his peers and \ncautious of unknowable outcomes. His spirit may have been willing, \nbut his flesh was abominably weak.\u0014\n\u0014\nKidds Jefferson isnt a moral monster, but hes certainly no saint \neither. He emerges from this biography not as a confident but flawed \nstatesman, but rather a conflicted, uncertain, and sometimes craven \nworldling. Many of the issues that tormented Jeffersons mind were \nleft unresolved, often in part through his own inaction or aversion \nto conflict. Abraham Lincoln may have declared all honor to \nJefferson, but in the case of slavery, it would take a civil war, \nfought by men braver than Jefferson, to settle the matter once and \nfor all.\u0014\n\u0014\nCompared to the ocean of Jefferson biographies written by figures \nranging from Christopher Hitchens to Jon Meacham, Kidds volume shies \naway from treating his subject as an exemplary leader. He admits that \nhis take on Jefferson is more ambivalent than most, a position that \nwill likely upset readers eager for iconoclasm or hagiography. After \nall, as Kidd warns, The Founders, including Jefferson, were hardly \npristine saints. But maybe were not either. Or, as Jefferson \nremarked to his daughter Martha, referencing Romans 3, For none of \nus, no not one, is perfect.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel N. Gullotta is the Archer Fellow in Residence at the Ashbrook \nCenter at Ashland University, and a PhD candidate at Stanford \nUniversity specializing in American religious history.

    "title": "JOHN NEWMAN ONE OF ENGLAND'S FAMOUS CATHOLICS",
    "words": "HOW JOHN HENRY NEWMAN BECAME ONE OF ENGLANDS MOST FAMOUS CATHOLICS\u0014\n \u0014\nLeaving his traveling companions in Italy, John Henry Newman, a \nChurch of England vicar, headed home by way of Sicily. However, he \nbecame ill while on the Mediterranean island. Out of his head with \nfever, he told his servant, I shall not die, for I have not sinned \nagainst the light. When his condition improved enough to travel \nagain, he declared he had a work to do in England, although just what \nit was he did not know.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeeks passed but he was stuck on Sicily owing to his weakness and the \nunavailability of a ship. He ached to get home. When finally he was \nagain at sea, he was becalmed for a week in the Strait of Bonifacio \n(between S\u0014\nardinia and Corsica).  \u0014\n\u0014\nThere, on this day 16 June 1833, he drafted his famous hymn, Lead \nKindly Light.\u0014\n\u0014\nLead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\u0014\nLead Thou me on;\u0014\nThe night is dark, and I am far from home,\u0014\nLead Thou me on.\u0014\nKeep Thou my feet;\u0014\nI do not ask to see the distant scene;\u0014\none step enough for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing more delays, he made it home. His task became clearer on \nhis first Sunday back at Oxford. On 14 July, John Keble preached the \nsermon National Apostasy. This electrified Newman and brought into \nbeing The Oxford Movement. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time the British government declared that it had absolute \nauthority over the church. Newman threw himself into countering this \nclaim. He edited Tracts for the Times, publications that sought to \ndefine the ground of the churchs authority and doctrines to free \nthem from political whims.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next decade, Newmans studies of early theological disputes \nand the writings of church fathers drew him toward Roman Catholicism. \nIf the Church of England had legitimate authority at all, he argued, \nit was as a branch of the universal visible church. I ever kept \nbefore me that there was something greater than the Established \nChurch, and that that was the Church Catholic and Apostolic, set up \nfrom the beginning, of which she was but the local presence and the \norgan. She was nothing, unless she was this.\u0014\nHad he been an evangelical, he might have defined the church as the \ninvisible body of all genuine Christians connected by faith to \nChrist. However, he thought little of the Evangelicals as a class. I \nthought they played into the hands of the Liberals. They had no \nintellectual basis; no internal idea, no principle of unity, no \ntheology, and, at no time [have] been conspicuous, as a party, for \ntalent or learning. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to remain with the Church of England, he needed to show that \nits doctrine was faithful to the doctrine of the larger church. In \nTract 90 (1841), he interpreted the Thirty-Nine Articles (the Church \nof Englands fundamental teachings) in light of Roman Catholic \ndoctrine. This created such a furor that Newman resigned positions \nand moved to his retreat at Littlemore. \u0014\n\u0014\nA key Protestant objection against Roman Catholicism was that its \ndogmas had changed since the apostolic age. Newman himself had made \nthis argument. Until he could satisfy his conscience on this score, \nhe remained with the Church of England. He studied the development of \ndoctrine and concluded it could evolve. His last barrier to \nsubmitting to Rome was gone. In 1845 he joined the Catholic Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he became a Catholic, he penned two notable books. The first \nwas The Idea of a University (1852) prompted by his role developing a \nRoman Catholic college in Ireland. The second was a long-winded \nself-defense when Anglican author Charles Kingsley accused him of \nlying. In Apologia pro Vita Sua (A Defense of His Life, 1864), Newman \nexplained how the light of reason and of conscience led him to leave \nthe Church of England. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor many years, Catholics were suspicious of Newman. He had, after \nall, written against them in the past. He spent decades overcoming \nprejudice, but in 1879 Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES STEPHEN AND THE BATTLE TO ABOLISH SLAVERY",
    "words": "James Stephen and Battle to Abolish Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Stephen had a law practice in the West Indies. One day, he \nwitnessed two black slaves accused of rape and condemned on the \nflimsiest evidence. They were burned alive. This so horrified Stephen \nthat he began a correspondence with the famed slavery abolitionist \nWilliam Wilberforce. Secretly he provided Wilberforce with \ninformation about slavery in the islands. In time, Stephen would \nbecome a leader in the Clapham sect, a group of mostly evangelical \nChristians working with Wilberforce. He wrote several influential \nbooks against the slave trade.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day June 30, 1758, Stephen struggled through financial \ndifficulties to get an education. As a young man he did not seem a \nlikely candidate for leadership in any evangelical group; engaged to \nbe married to one woman, he betrayed both her and his closest friend, \nfathering an illegitimate child with his friend's fianc. His manners \nwere coarse, his language rough, and he flew into sudden rages.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, after meeting with Wilberforce, he became a true follower of \nChrist. When his his first wife died, he married Wilberforce's \nsister, Sally. Wilberforce wrote, \"Stephen is an improved and \nimproving character, one of those whom religion has transformed and \nin whom it has triumphed by conquering some natural infirmities.\" \nMeanwhile, Stephen had been elected to Parliament and was a close \nally of Wilberforce in the fight against slavery. (At a crucial \nmoment in the abolition battle, his beloved wife Sally slipped on ice \nand broke her leg; it grieved James Stephen that he had to leave her \nill-attended rather than let the cause down in Parliament.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Stephen's fertile mind which came up with two ideas that \nhelped break the deadlock over ending the slave trade. The first of \nthese was during the struggle with Napoleon. He suggested extending \nanti-slavery language to a bill which was certain of support because \nit was viewed as a war measure, designed to stop neutral ships from \ndelivering cargoes to France. (This bill so infuriated the United \nStates that it led to the War of 1812.) His second proposal was a \nbill to require registration of all slaves in British possessions. \nThis never passed, but it brought to light so many abuses that it \nswung public opinion against slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nStephen became Master-in-Chancery, a lawyer for the government. \nEnemies sneered that this was a pay-off for his support of abolition. \nIn 1815 Stephen resigned his Parliamentary position when the \ngovernment would not support the registry bill. He died in 1832, and \nis now assessed as the most important member of the Clapham Sect \nsecond only to Wilberforce himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Ford K.

    "words": "Javouhey To Africa\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nAt thirteen Anne Marie \"Nanette\" Javouhey rescued priests from French \nrevolutionaries. She hid them and helped them escape across the River \nSaone. She organized secret worship services. When the \nrevolutionaries set the local chapel on fire, it was she who ran in \nand rescued the holy vessels.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer father, afraid of losing her to the church, tried to marry her \noff. She talked her prospective bridegroom into becoming a Trappist \nmonk. Her own determination to become a nun was from childhood. While \npraying, she had heard a voice within her saying, \"Thou wilt belong \nto Me. Thou wilt be consecrated to Me. Thou wilt serve the poor and \ncare for the orphans.\" In the end she convinced her three sisters and \ntwo brothers to take holy orders also. But her own life was to \nblossom into far more.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the revolutionary years, she educated the local children. \nLater she founded the Religious Society of St. Joseph. Its nuns wore \na habit designed to mimic a grape-pickers' dress. Her special \ninterest was to teach black children. In her mind a missionary vision \nwas developing. She longed to reach Africa for Christ. She felt \nassured the Lord would open doors in his time.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs always, where he has a willing heart, the Lord did. The governor \nof Reunion Island asked for help educating the native populace. \nNanette was summoned. Soon four of her society sailed to the island.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrance then owned Senegal. Mother Javouhey began her African work \nthere. A born problem-solver, she broke through every administrative \nbarrier to bring faith to the Senegalese. She renovated the hospital, \ntreated all in need, black or white, as absolute equals, trained \nnative clergy to spread the gospel to their own people, and started \nher own agricultural communities. She even founded a seminary in \nFrance where blacks could be trained.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was an indefatigable traveler on behalf of the various mission \nworks she started. Altogether she traveled over 75,000 miles by land \nand sea. Her success led the English to plead for her help in Sierra \nLeone. But her greatest work was in French Giana, South America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe French government asked her to establish a foundation for the \ndesperate inhabitants. She never hesitated although conditions were \ndeplorable. Where governments had failed, she succeeded. On this day \nJune 26, 1828, Mother Javouhey sailed with 100 people to bring \ncivilization to the outcast colony, which also included Devil's \nIsland. Her experiment brought a measure of prosperity to the region. \nShe was especially notable for imparting faith and education to \nex-slaves.

    "title": "JULIAN THE APOSTATE COULDN'T DEFEAT CHRIST",
    "words": "Julian the Apostate Couldn't Defeat Christ\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, \nif a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, \nJune 27, 363.* Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just \ntwo years of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he bled, the dying emperor groaned, \"You have conquered, O \nGalilean\"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later \nreports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had \nassassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they \nhad reason to. Julian had struggled to end the power of Christians in \nthe Roman Empire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine \nwon a key victory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had \nsteadily grown.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had \nbeen brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader \n(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led \nChristians to call him \"Julian the Apostate.\" (An apostate is one who \nfalls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?\u0014\n\u0014\nA gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic \ncivilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who \nused magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason that may have influenced Julian was that a \"Christian\" \nemperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although \nJulian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed \nall Christians for the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, \nJulian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to \nsupremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He \ndeveloped a pagan priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions \n(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his \nrejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not \naccept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another \nmove apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their \nJewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in \nJerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true \nheritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged \nthe pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, \nnoting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for \nthe pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral \nadvantage among their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had \njudged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the \nabrupt end of their perks and plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Historians disagree on this date.

    "words": "Junia, the Female Apostle Imprisoned for the Gospel\u0014\nWhat Scripture tells us about the story of this outstanding Jewish \nwoman in chains.\u0014\nNIJAY K. GUPTA\u0014\n|\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout a decade ago, when my family was on vacation in Rome, Italy, we \nvisited the Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli (Saint Peter in \nchains)where tourists and Christian pilgrims come to see \nMichelangelos famous statue of Moses and a set of prison chains that \ntradition claims belonged to the apostle Simon Peter during his \nimprisonment (Acts 12:319).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it wasnt just male apostles who were privileged with the \nunwanted gift of shackles. Paul tells us in Romans 16:7 that \nAndronicus and his wife, Junia, were both imprisoned for the sake of \nJesus: Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in \nprison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they \nwere in Christ before I was.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo elements of this verse have been the subject of deep scrutiny and \nvigorous debate: Was Junia a woman? And was she really an apostle?\u0014\n\u0014\nWith respect to the first question, there was a span of several \nhundred years where Bible translations treated this person as a man \n(with the name Juniasnotice the s), mostly because it was \nunthinkable that Paul could call a woman an apostle. But biblical \nscholars have rediscovered her female identity in the last few \ndecades for several reasons, including the fact that Junia was a \npopular female name in the Roman period, while the name Junias is not \nattested at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in regard to the second question, Paul acknowledges the married \ncouple were Jewish like him and followed Jesus before he did. Since \nwe know Paul came to believe in Jesus not long after the Resurrection \n(lets say, around A.D. 33), Andronicus and Junia were among the \nfirst generation of Christian apostolic leaders.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, most early church fathers and theologians in the second, \nthird, and fourth centuries took it for granted that (1) Junia was a \nwoman and (2) Junia was an apostle.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the fourth century theologian and preacher John Chrysostom wrote, \nTo be an apostle is something great. But to be outstanding among the \napostlesjust think what a wonderful song of praise that is!  \nIndeed, how great the wisdom of this woman must have been that she \nwas even deemed worthy of the title of apostle.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrigen, another early church father, wondered whether this couple was \namong the 72 disciples sent out by Jesus himself (Luke 10:1; apostle \nmeans one who is sent out).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what often gets sidelined in the discussion of Junia is her \nimprisonment and what it tells us about her. Pauls mention of Junia \nand Andronicus in Romans is much more than a simple greeting from \nafar. Paul was intentionally highlighting this married couple, whom \nhe considered model Christians of intrepid faith as exemplary for the \nchurch in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman culture promoted an ideal of the quiet, obedient, charming, and \nsweet domestic woman who works wool, tends to children, and maintains \nthe home. And while the early Christians likewise believed in a warm \nand stable home, leaders like Paul enthusiastically commended Junia, \nalong with her husband, for her service and sacrifice on the \nfrontlines of gospel ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul also celebrates another married couple, Priscilla and \nAquilahouse-church leaders who risked their lives for the gospelas \nwell as Phoebe, a female deacon in the church. He also names and \npraises Epenetus as the first Asian convert. Paul elevates these and \nother figures for their courageous faithand for some, he applauds \ntheir faithfulness in chains.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking at Pauls own experiences, we see that he acknowledges \nnumerous incarcerations and mentions torture in the same breath (2 \nCor. 6:5; 11:23). Prisons were some of the darkest and ugliest places \nin Roman societyso what is a woman like Junia doing there?\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the many thousands of ancient Greek and Romans texts we have \nfrom antiquity, we have almost no record of women in Roman prisons, \nwhich were designed to hold alleged lawbreakers accused of serious \ncrimes such as murder and treason. For petty crimes, a man would be \ngiven a fine or beaten. A woman would often be sent home and punished \nby her family.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the very few women who were sent to prison, the conditions were \nhorrific: overcrowding, no fresh air, darkness, heavy and sharp metal \nshackles that often cut into the skin. On top of that, sounds of \ntorture echoed through the hallways, and the reality of sexual \nviolence would have been a constant fear for the few incarcerated \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\nRome treated prisons as holding places until trial and sentencing, \nbut their prisons were notoriously brutal. Prisoners had no rights \nand protections like there are today. Many died before ever seeing a \njudge, some by their own hand.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Paul talks about Junias incarceration as a badge of honor, \ndescribing her and Andronicus as fellow prisoners. In this text, he \nuses a specific term for prisoner: synaichmalotos, which technically \nmeans prisoner of war or war captive. And since Christians were \nnot politically at war with Rome in a literal sense, this is a \nmetaphor. Paul is saying these Christians are in chains because of \nthe gospelbecause of their public testimony about Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nRome wasnt the real foe in this warPaul tends to focus on sin, \ndeath, and Satan as the archenemies of the gospel. Paul understood \nsuch imprisonments as a form of spiritual warfare. But why exactly \nwere Andronicus and Junia in prison in the first place? What crimes \nwere they accused of?\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven Pauls commendation of them as heroes of the faith, we can \nassume it wasnt for something like murder or violence. The most \nlikely option is that this apostolic duo was put in custody for \ninciting a public disturbance while preaching the gospel in a public \nsetting. My mind goes to the Ephesus incident in Acts, where Pauls \nministry provoked a riot. A local leader, Alexander, calmed the crowd \ndown, warning them of Roman intervention (Acts 19:2141).\u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise, I imagine apostles like Andronicus and Junia went from city \nto city preaching to people in public and private settings, working \nmiracles, setting captives free, and facing the consequences of \nturning the world upside down, as Acts 17:6 says. Along with this \ncouple, Paul also called Aristarchus and Epaphras fellow prisoners \nof war (Col. 4:10; Phm. 23). What they all share is the illustrious \nbadge of bondage for the sake of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his famous biblical homilies, John Chrysostom made the case that \nthe letters from apostles written while they were imprisoned are more \nprecious than those written when they were free. He writes, Oh! \nThose blessed bonds! Oh! Those blessed hands which that chain \nadorned! He goes on to say no miracle of healing in Scripture \ncompares with the glory of these chains.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is there so much reverence for metal shackles of bondage?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, believers who are imprisoned for their faith are forced to \nthink more deeply and clearly about life and death and about the \nimportance of eternal things. But Philippians 3:10 takes us even \ndeeper, where Paul writes, I want to know Christyes, to know the \npower of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, \nbecoming like him in his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Christian leaders like Junia had the distinct privilege of \nliving out this fellowship of suffering in their gospel \nincarcerations. Those who suffered such degradations with and for \nJesus proved the potency of their faith, the truth of their \nconviction, and the extent of their love for Christ who first laid \ndown his life for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Paul, there was no greater outcome than new faith in the gospel \nand no greater mark of perseverance than being a gospel captive in \nchains. Chrysostom was right: Those chains are preciousnot as holy \nrelics but as evidence of counting and paying the cost of obeying the \ncommission of public witness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNijay K. Gupta is professor of New Testament at Northern Seminary and \nauthor of Tell Her Story: How Women Led, Taught, and Ministered in \nthe Early Church.\u0014",

    "title": "JOSEPH MOHR WROTE SILENT NIGHT, DIED PENNILESS",
    "words": "Joseph Mohr Penned the Popular Carol \"Silent Night\"\u0014\n \u0014\nJoseph Mohr was born in Salzburg on this day, 11 December 1792. He is \nremembered for his beautiful carol, Silent Night. However, during \nhis childhood, his name was associated with shame. Not only was he \nhis mothers third illegitimate child, he was godson to the towns \nhated executioner. This came about because Mohrs father, a soldier \nnamed Franz Jospeh Mohr, deserted the army and fled when he learned \nAnn Schoiber was pregnant by him. Ann had to face the consequences \nalone. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the consequences she faced was a fine. She earned little from \nher boarding house and knitting, so it would have taken her a years \nwages to pay it off. To spruce up his reputation, the town \nexecutioner said he would pay the fine and stand as godfather to the \nchild. Unfortunately, this only meant more humiliation for the boy. \nHe was ostracized and no school would accept him, nor would any \nemployer hire him or teach him a trade. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the boy could sing. Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, a Benedictine \nmonk and choirmaster, overheard Mohr singing as he played games on \nthe steps of a Capuchin monastery. Heirnle obtained Ann Schoibers \npermission to train the lad. Mohr blossomed under this care. By \ntwelve he was well on his way to mastering the organ, guitar, and \nviolin. He held his own among elite students, always placing near the \ntop of the class. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe continued his training until he was twenty-three and was ordained \na priest. Because he was illegitimate, he needed a special \ndispensation from the pope to enter the priesthood. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1816, he was stationed at the pilgrimage church in Mariapfarr, \nAustria. There he wrote the words to Silent Night. The next year, \nchurch authorities sent him to Oberndorf, where he met Hans Gruber, \nthe organist of a neighboring church who set the words to music. The \ncarol was first sung at a midnight mass on Christmas Eve, 1818. \nGradually it made its way into the larger world, where others \nmodified a few notes. Today it is the most popular Christmas carol of \nall time, translated into over two hundred languages. \u0014\nSilent Night expresses the wonder of the light Christ brought at \nhis incarnation, which was announced by angels to shepherds, and \ninspired wise men to follow a star and find the incarnate king. Early \nEnglish translations differ from the familiar words we sing: \u0014\n\u0014\nHoly night! Peaceful night!\u0014\nThrough the darkness beams a light\u0014\nYonder, where they sweet vigils keep\u0014\nOer the babe, who, in silent sleep,\u0014\nRests in heavenly peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoseph Mohr had a tender heart toward the needy and outcast. When he \ndied at his last postin Wagrainhe was penniless. For years he had \ngiven almost everything he earned to charities, among which was a \nschool he had started for poor children.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

A year or two before \nHonest Abes death, in fact, Edwin Booth  the older brother of John \nand a prominent actor  saved the life of Lincolns son Robert Todd \nLincoln, who was then in his early 20s. (The precise date is unknown, \nbut the event is believed to have taken place in either 1863 or 1864.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe younger Lincoln found himself on a crowded train platform in \nJersey City, New Jersey, and was accidentally pushed off the platform \nas a train departed. In this situation the train began to move, and \nby the motion I was twisted off my feet, and had dropped somewhat, \nwith feet downward, into the open space, and was personally \nhelpless, Robert Todd Lincoln later wrote of the event that put him \nin the path of the oncoming train. It was then that Booth grabbed him \nby the coat collar, saving him. Booth was well known enough as an \nactor for Lincoln to recognize his rescuer and even thank him by \nname. In April 1865, the day after his brother assassinated Lincoln, \nEdwin vowed never to return to the stage  a short-lived promise, as \nhe gave an acclaimed performance in the title role of Hamlet the \nfollowing year.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wilkes Booth originally planned to kidnap Lincoln.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll plots tend to move deathward, wrote Don DeLillo in the 1985 \nnovel White Noise, and so it was with Booth and Lincoln. Booth, a \ndisgruntled actor and fierce Confederate sympathizer, originally had \na less violent plan  to kidnap the President, hold him in Richmond, \nVirginia (the capital of the Confederacy), and exchange him for a \nnumber of Confederate prisoners. He came close to carrying out this \nplan on March 17, 1865, before Lincolns schedule changed at the last \nminute and he did not attend the play where the kidnapping was to \ntake place. My love (as things stand to-day) is for the South \nalone, Booth wrote to his brother-in-law in 1864. Nor do I deem it \na dishonor in attempting to make for her a prisoner of this man to \nwhom she owes so much misery. The plot was forever scuttled when the \nConfederacy surrendered less than a month later on April 9. Just five \ndays later, Booth executed the more extreme version of his plan.\u0014",

    "words": "JAMES, SON OF ZEBEDEE (died c. 44)\u0014\nOne of the twelve apostles; the first of them to be martyred\u0014\n\u0014\nJames was a Galilean fisherman whose circumstances we can suppose to \nhave been comfortable (Mark 1:1920) and who was called to be one of \nthe twelve apostles at the same time as his brother John (Matt. 4:21; \nMark 1:1920). It is reasonable to assume that he was older than \nJohn, both because he is nearly always mentioned first, and because \nJohn is sometimes identified as the brother of James (Mark 3:17; \n5:37; Matt. 10:2; 17:1).\u0014\n\u0014\nJames, John, and Simon Peter, who were part of a fishing partnership \nthat included Andrew, Simons brother (Luke 5:10), were a trio who \nattained in some sense a place of primacy among the disciples. They \nare found at the center of things-for example, when Jairuss daughter \nwas raised (Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51), at the Transfiguration (Matt. \n17:1; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28), on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3), and \nin the Garden of Gethsemane (Matt. 26:37; Mark 14:33). It was James \nand John, moreover, who had earlier accompanied Jesus to the home of \nSimon and Andrew (Mark 1:29).\u0014\n\u0014\nJames and John were given by Jesus the nickname Boanerges or sons \nof thunder (Mark 3:17) when they were rebuked by the Lord for \nimpetuous speech and for having totally misconceived the purpose of \nhis coming. This may have been the consequence of the suggestion made \nby them that they should pray for the destruction of the Samaritan \nvillage, the inhabitants of which had repulsed the Lords messengers \n(Luke 9:54; cf. Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe presumptuous and ill-considered thinking of the two brothers was \nobvious also when, after asking with his brother a place of honor in \nthe kingdom, James was corecipient of the prophecy that they would \ndrink the cup their Master was to drink (Mark 10:3540; cf. Matt. \n20:2023). The two sons of Zebedee are also assumed to have been \npresent with the other disciples when the risen Christ appeared by \nthe Sea of Tiberias (John 21:1), though curiously Jamess name is \nnowhere mentioned in the fourth Gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe know nothing about Jamess career subsequently until about the \nyear 44 when Jesus prophecy was fulfilled: James was slain with the \nsword by Herod Agrippa I, and thus became the first of the Twelve \nwhose martyrdom was referred to in the New Testament (Acts 12:12).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wife of Zebedee was Salome (Matthew 27:56), who may have been a \nsister of the Lords mother (John 19:25). If this were so, it would \nmean that James and John were first cousins of Jesus and that they \nmay have considered themselves to have been in a privileged position.\u0014\n\u0014\nJ.D.DOUGLAS\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDouglas, J.

    "words": "JEROMES INCREDIBLE TALE OF THE HERMIT PAUL\u0014\n \u0014\n[ABOVEGirolamo Savoldo (14801548), Anthony the Great and Paul of \nThebesDidier Descouens / public domain, Wikimedia File:Savoldo, \nsanti antonio abate e paolo.jpg]\u0014\n\u0014\nIncredible tales are told of saints in tradition. Vying for a place \namong the most improbable is the story of St. Paul of Thebes. Jerome \nwrote his life around 375. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Jerome, Paul was a young man with a sister living in the \nThebiad, a region in southern Egypt. Their parents died when Paul was \nfifteen, leaving him a substantial inheritance. When persecution \nbroke out against Christians, he made his way to a secluded house. \nHowever, his brother-in-law, coveting Pauls inheritance, planned to \nbetray him to imperial persecutors. Learning of this, Paul fled into \nthe desert. In his wanderings, he discovered an abandoned silver mint \nwith a small stream of water and a palm tree. He made the place his \nhome. Sustained by the fruit of the tree and making his clothes from \nits fiber, he resided ninety-seven years.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Paul was one-hundred-and-thirteen years old, a ninety-year-old \nmonk named Anthony received a vision that a hermit more venerable and \nholy than himself was living in the Egyptian desert. He was commanded \nto seek him out.\u0014\n\u0014\nDirected by a centaur and assisted by a satyr and other fabulous \ncreatures, Anthony found his way to Paul. Paul requested news of the \nworld from which he had so long been absent. While they talked a \nraven flew down with a whole loaf of bread. Paul explained that God \nsent a raven with half a loaf each day but, seeing he had company, \nhad sent a whole loaf this time. The two argued for hours who should \nbreak the bread, each insisting on the priority of the other. \nFinally, they agreed to each seize an end and pull it apart.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul declared that he must soon die. Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria \nhad given Anthony a cloak. Paul asked his visitor to fetch that cloak \nto wrap his body in. This was a ruse so that he could send Anthony \naway and allow himself to die alone. Anthony undertook the four-day \nround trip.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked by two of his disciples where he had been gone so long, Anthony \nreplied, Woe to me a sinner! I do not deserve the name of monk. I \nhave seen Elias, I have seen John in the desert, and I have really \nseen Paul in Paradise. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Jerome: \u0014\n\u0014\nHe then closed his lips, beat upon his breast, and brought out the \ncloak from his cell. When his disciples asked him to explain the \nmatter somewhat more fully he said, There is a time to keep silence, \nand a time to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile still some distance from Pauls dwelling, Anthony saw him \nascend among bands of angels, choirs of prophets, and apostles. He \nhurried to the hermits shelter and found him dead. The traditional \ndate given for this event is today, 15 January 341.\u0014\n\u0014\nChanting Christian words, Anthony carried the old saints body out to \nbury it. However, he had no implement with which to dig the grave. He \ndid not wish to leave Pauls corpse for the four days it would take \nhim to travel to his own abode to fetch a tool and return. He \ntherefore made up his mind to die beside Paul. However, two lions \narrived, dug the grave, knelt for Anthonys blessing, and returned \ninto the wild. Anthony supposedly reported these things to his \ndisciples, and twice a year, on holy days, donned a tunic Paul had \nwoven from palm leaves. \u0014\n\u0014\nJerome urged his wealthy readers to compare their condition with \nPauls. He, though naked, yet kept the robe of Christ; you, clad in \nyour silks, have lost the vesture of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nApart from Jerome, no author of the period mentioned Paul. \nAthanasius, who wrote the life of Anthony fifteen years before \nJeromes tall tale appeared, mentioned nothing of Anthonys alleged \ninteraction with a prior saint named Paul. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn light of the mythical creatures with which Jerome populated his \ntale, and the improbable events he stitched through it, we can be \npardoned for taking the whole with a grain of salt. Yet the tale \ngives a peep into the trauma persecution caused, and it captures the \nimpression that early monastics made on the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

But years would pass \nbefore the lines took their place in worship services around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1861, a publisher rediscovered the words. He asked John Bacchus \nDykes to furnish him with a tune. It made sense for him to turn to \nJohn who had a natural aptitude for music (he graduated with a music \nmaster that same year). John had been a church organist since he was \nten-years-old and was co-founder and president of the Cambridge \nUniversity Musical Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn accepted the words. Within thirty minutes he wrote the tune \n\"Nicea,\" which carried the praise of the Trinity to Christians \neverywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty\u0014\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;\u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty!\u0014\nGod in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he composed this famous tune, John was appointed vicar \nof St. Oswald. This put him in charge of a parish. He was thirty-nine \nand had already held several lesser church posts. John's people came \nto love him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis bishop, however, did not care for John's views. John was \n\"high-church.\" This meant that he stressed the continuity of the \nChurch of England with the Roman Catholic church from which it had \nsprung. He believed that church and monarchy had divine rights which \nwere being washed away by modern changes. There was long-lasting \ndisagreement between John and his bishop because of this.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Baring, his bishop, refused to give John any help with his \nlarge parish unless he would agree to conduct his services in a more \n\"low-church\" style. He had to get rid of colorful collars, stop \nburning incense and not turn his back on his congregation at times \nduring the service. John wouldn't agree and so he had to handle the \nwhole parish himself, a job which exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, in addition to his regular duties, he managed to write \nover 300 hymn tunes. These included some for our favorite hymns, such \nas \"Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee\" and less familiar songs such as \n\"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand\" and \"Lead, Kindly Light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWorn out with his labors and constant friction with his bishop, John \ndied on this day, January 22, 1876.

    "title": "JAKOB HUTTER DIED IN A TEST OF FAITH",
    "words": "GENTLE JAKOB HUTTER DIED IN A TEST OF FAITH\u0014\n \u0014\n[Jakob Hutter, founder of the Hutterites]\u0014\n\u0014\nJAKOB HUTTER was defiant at the stake on this day, 25 February 1536. \nCome closer, those of you who contradict me! he cried out. Let us \ntest our faith in the fire. This fire will harm my soul as little as \nthe fiery furnace harmed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\u0014\n\u0014\nExecutioners in Tyrol (a region of Austria) had doused him with \nbrandy and set him alight as a warning to anyone who dared to adopt \nAnabaptist teaching. From the governments perspective, the action \nwas justified. A Peasants war (15241525), inspired in part by \ncommon people acquiring ideas from newly-accessible Scriptures, \nalarmed European powers. Then when a group calling themselves \nAnabaptist seized Mnster, Germany (15341535), the revolt was \nsuppressed after a lengthy siege, and thereafter anyone who held \nAnabaptist views, however peaceful, became a target of state terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt did not matter to rulers that the majority of Anabaptists were \nquiet and hardworking. Their principle tenet, that only individuals \nwho had reached the age of understanding and believed the gospel \nshould be baptized, was commonly held in the early church and is \naccepted world-wide by many Christians today. However, in the \nReformation era the idea was met with fury by Catholics and \nProtestants alike. For centuries the church had baptized infants. \nThose believers who insisted on adult immersion had themselves been \nbaptized as infants. Therefore, their opponents named them \nAnabaptists, meaning re-baptizers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnabaptists such as Hutter also taught that oath-taking and fighting \nin wars were wrong. They preached that anyone who did not reform his \nor her behavior was no true Christian, leading to accusations they \nwere legalists. Hutters group also believed Christians should hold \nall their goods in common. (Sharing was essential because so many of \nthe groups providers had been imprisoned or killed.) As these ideas \nwere antithetical to most theologians and rulers, persecution poured \nupon Anabaptists from every side. \u0014\n\u0014\nHutter, a hat maker in the Tyrol, had converted to Anabaptist \nteaching sometime between 1525 and 1529. He quickly proved to be a \npowerful evangelist, winning hundreds of new adherents despite the \npersecution they knew they would face. And he had a knack for \norganizing and managing the suffering victims. When the situation in \nthe Tyrol became impossible in 1529, he arranged for hundreds of his \nfollowers to escape to Moravia which had more tolerance for religious \ndifferences; and he moved there himself in 1533. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll too soon, persecution followed the Anabaptists to Moravia. Driven \nout in 1535, the inoffensive Christians had nowhere to go and found \nthemselves hiding in forests or caves, or huddling together on the \nopen heath. Hutter said plaintively, We cannot be prohibited from \nthe earth, for the earth is the heavenly Fathers; may He do with us \nwhat He will.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote Emperor Ferdinands Vice-Regent a letter of warning that God \nwould avenge the hounding and murdering of innocent people. The Most \nHigh will lift his hand against you, now and eternally. This we \nannounce to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . and \nshortly you will see that we have told you nothing but the truth of \nGod. . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nHutter ventured back to Tyrol where he was captured, along with his \npregnant wife. Tortured for weeks, whipped, and immersed in freezing \nwater (to mock baptismal practices) Hutter died in fire, but his wife \nescaped. Recaptured a couple years later in Italy, she too was put to \ndeath. Hans Amon, the man Jakob had left in charge of the Moravian \ncongregation, said that Jakob gave a great sermon through his death, \nfor God was with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN'S GOLDENMOUTH CAUSED HIS EXILE",
    "words": "JOHNS GOLDEN MOUTH MADE HIM FAMOUS AND CAUSED HIS EXILE\u0014\n \u0014\nJOHN WAS such a brilliant and forceful preacher that an admirer gave \nhim a nickname that stuck: Chrysostom, golden mouthed. But the same \nattributes that raised him to fame brought about his exile and death.\u0014\n\u0014\nReared in Antioch, Syria, by his mother, a Christian widow, \nChrysostom studied rhetoric under Libanius, a pagan master of the \nart. However, he found himself attracted to Christianity and switched \nhis concentration to theology. Becoming a hermit, he ruined his \nhealth in ascetic practices. Returning to Antioch he reluctantly \naccepted a church position. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe rose to fame in 387 after rioters defaced imperial statues in \nAntioch. While old bishop Flavian hurried to Constantinople to plead \nfor mercy, terrified townsfolk crowded to hear Chrysostom preach the \nhomilies on the statues. Typical of his admonitions were his words, \n[We have] a fear of death, which is a mask that might well be \ndespised; but have no fear of sin, which is truly dreadful; and, even \nas fire, devours the conscience. . . . Sorrow not for the dying man; \nbut sorrow for him who is living in sin!\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the patriarch of Constantinople died, Theophilus, patriarch of \nAlexandria, wanted to place his own candidate in the vacant post. But \nEutropius, the powerful court chamberlain, did not want Theophilus to \nhave that much influence. He determined to obtain Chrysostom for the \npost because of his impressive rhetoric, and he threatened the \ndespicable Theophilus with well-deserved criminal charges unless he \nsupported Chrysostom. Theophilus caved.\u0014\n\u0014\nEutropius then persuaded Emperor Arcadius to agree to accept \nChrysostom. With imperial backing, he quietly kidnapped the priest, \nwhose people would not otherwise permit him to leave Antioch. Once \nChrysostom realized what was happening, he protested, but to no \navail. Off to Constantinople he must go. On this day, 26 February \n398, Theophilus himself consecrated Chrysostom.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt first, both nobles and commoners were pleased with their new \npatriarch. Theophilus, however, retained intense hatred of him. And \nbecause Chrysostom preached with scathing satire against the sins of \nhis age, he roused opposition. He especially angered those who lived \nin excessive luxury and who abused their wealthsins of which Empress \nEudoxia, most courtiers, and many churchmen were guilty. It did not \nhelp that slanderers accused him of comparing Eudoxia to Jezebel, the \nwicked queen of the Old Testament. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 403, Theodosius and the empress colluded with Chrysostoms \necclesiastical enemies to call a council to condemn him. The Bishop \nof neighboring Chalcedon readily hosted the council. The hostile \nprelates ordered Chrysostom to appear, but he refused, saying a \ncouncil of his enemies was no proper venue to try him. Rather, a \ncouncil of the whole church ought to determine his fate. The council \nsaid that his refusal to appear was sufficient cause for \ncondemnation. Eudoxia prevailed on weak-willed Arcadius to \nimmediately exile Chrysostom.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, some event soon frightened her and in superstitious terror \nshe demanded the archbishops recall. Mobs threatened Theophilus, who \nfled. After three days of pleas and promises, Chrysostom returned. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few months later the city dedicated a silver statue of Eudoxia. The \nfestivities included indecent and pagan entertainment. Chrysostom \nthundered against the depravity. In fury, Eudoxia called for his \nexile. Chrysostom compared her to Herodias, the wicked Bible queen, \nwho had demanded the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe breach was irrevocable. At Easter 404, soldiers drove catechumens \nfrom Chrysostoms cathedral. When the people regrouped for baptism at \nthe public baths, soldiers set upon them with swords. Chrysostom was \na prisoner in his own home. Finally, shortly after Pentecost, the \nemperor forced him out of Constantinople. The Church of St. Sophia \nburned that night, each side accusing the other of setting the fire.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn exile, Chrysostom continued to correspond with faithful friends. \nTo end even this influence, the emperor ordered him transferred to a \ndistant post on the Black Sea. He appointed two guards known for \nferocity to march the sick man without mercy until he dropped. They \nobeyed. Chrysostom died 14 September 407.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "JULIAN THE APOSTATE COULDN'T DEFEAT CHRIST",
    "words": "Julian the Apostate Couldn't Defeat Christ\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |     APR 28, 2010\u0014\n \u0014\nEmperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, \nif a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, \nJune 27, 363.* Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just \ntwo years of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\As he bled, the dying emperor groaned, \"You have conquered, O \nGalilean\"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later \nreports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had \nassassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they \nhad reason to. Julian had struggled to end the power of Christians in \nthe Roman Empire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine \nwon a key victory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had \nsteadily grown.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had \nbeen brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader \n(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led \nChristians to call him \"Julian the Apostate.\" (An apostate is one who \nfalls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?\u0014\n\u0014\nA gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic \ncivilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who \nused magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother reason that may have influenced Julian was that a \"Christian\" \nemperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although \nJulian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed \nall Christians for the massacre.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, \nJulian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to \nsupremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He \ndeveloped a pagan priesthood.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions \n(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his \nrejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not \naccept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another \nmove apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their \nJewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in \nJerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true \nheritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged \nthe pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, \nnoting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for \nthe pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral \nadvantage among their pagan neighbors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had \njudged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the \nabrupt end of their perks and plans.\u0014\n\u0014\n*Historians disagree on this date.

    "words": "John D. Rockefeller (July 8, 1839May 23, 1937), the founder of \nStandard Oil, was once the richest man in the world. He was the \nworlds first billionaire. He amassed a net worth of at least $1 \nbillion in 1916. When Rockefeller died in 1937, his net worth was \nestimated to be approximately $340 billion in today's dollars.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the age of 25, he had one of the largest oil refineries in the \nUnited States. He was 31 when he became the world's largest oil \nrefiner. At 38, he controlled 90% of the oil refined in the United \nStates. At fifty, John was America's richest man. As a young man, \nevery action, attitude, and connection was crafted to establish his \nwealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at the age of 53, he fell unwell. His entire body became wracked \nwith pain, and he lost all his hair. In total anguish, the world's \nlone millionaire could buy anything he wanted but could only eat soup \nand crackers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to an associate, \"He couldn't sleep, wouldn't smile, and \nnothing in life meant anything to him\". His personal, highly trained \nphysicians indicated that he would die within the year. That year \npassed painfully slowly. As he approached death, he awoke one morning \nwith the faint understanding that he would not be able to bring any \nof his fortune with him to the next world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe man who could dominate the commercial world suddenly realised he \nhad no control over his personal life. He informed his solicitors, \naccountants, and management that he intended to devote his assets to \nhospitals, research, and charity work. John D. Rockefeller started \nhis foundation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rockefeller Foundation financed Howard Florey and his colleague \nNorman Heatley's penicillin research in 1941. But arguably the most \nastounding aspect of Rockefeller's narrative is that when he began to \ngive back a fraction of all he had gained, his body's chemistry \nchanged dramatically, and he recovered.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was expected to die at the age of 53, but he survived to reach 98 \nyears old. Rockefeller learnt gratitude and returned the great bulk \nof his money. This made him whole. It's one thing to be healed. It is \nanother to become fit. He was a devout Baptist who attended the \nEuclid Avenue Baptist Church in Cleveland, Ohio.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore he died, he wrote in his diary: \"God taught me that everything \nbelongs to Him, and I am merely a conduit to carry out His will. My \nlife has been one long, happy holiday since then; full of work and \nplay, I let go of my worries along the road, and God was wonderful to \nme every day.\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES MADISON: DEFENDER OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY",
    "words": "James \nMadison: Defender of Religious Liberty\u0014\n\u0014\nPam Durso\u0014\n09-08-03 \u0014\n\u0014\nLast spring, my family drove to Charlottesville, Va., to tour \nMonticello, Thomas Jeffersons home. We also decided to visit \nMontpelier, the nearby home of James Madison.\u0014\n\u0014\nVisiting Monticello and seeing Jeffersons magnificent house and the \nimmaculate grounds was incredible. The tour of the house, however, \nwas rushed with no time for questions and no opportunity to \nappreciate the historical significance of all the sights. The tour of \nMontpelier, on the other hand, was more relaxed. The crowd was \nsmaller, and the tour guide had time for questions. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen our tour was finished, I hung back and asked our guide about \nMadisons religious preference. The answer the guide gave me was one \nwith which I did not agree. The guide stated that he thought Madison \nwas a Lutheran. On our drive home, I repeatedly voiced my doubts \nabout the correctness of this answer. An educated and affluent \nplanters son born in the mid-18th century in Virginia would \ncertainly have been an Anglican. After all, the Anglican Church had \nbeen the state church of Virginia since 1624, and as prominent \nlandowners, the Madisons would surely have been part of the \nestablished religion of their area. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow I had to know about Madisons religious preferences, and after \nsome research, I discovered much to my delight that I was right. \u0014\n\u0014\nJames Madison, the Father of our Constitution and fourth president \nof the United States, was baptized on March 31, 1751, by Rev. William \nDavid, an Anglican rector from King George County. As a child, \nMadison weekly attended the Brick Church, an Anglican Church about \nsix miles from his familys plantation. His father, a vestryman at \nthe church, helped manage church affairs and collected the tax money, \nwhich was used to support the state church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMadison not only attended the Anglican Church, but much of his early \neducation was provided by local Anglican clergymen. At 16, Madison \nwent to live for two years at the home of his tutor, Rev. Thomas \nMartin, rector of the Brick Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut then Madisons life took an odd turn. Instead of attending a \nnearby Anglican school, the College of William and Mary in \nWilliamsburg, he attended the College of New Jersey, a school founded \nby New Light Presbyterians who embraced revivalism. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe College of New Jersey, which later became known as Princeton \nUniversity, was primarily a training school for ministers, and there \nare some indications that Madison considered entering the ministry. \nInstead he chose to study law, and in 1774, he entered politics and \nwas elected as a member of the Orange County Committee of Safety \nPublic.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven his upbringing and his education, one might conclude that \nMadison was a committed man of faith, and that may have been true. \nYet, Madison kept his religious views private. There is no mention in \nhis writings of Jesus Christ, nor did he give any direct indications \nthat he was a practicing Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Madison offered few clues about his personal religious \nbeliefs, scholars disagree about his views. Some biographers have \npresented Madison as a pious and devout Christian, while other \nbiographers have labeled him as a deist. Still other scholars believe \nMadison was indifferent to religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we do know is that Madison did attend religious services. \nWilliam Meade, an Episcopal Bishop of Virginia and acquaintance of \nMadison, claimed that the president attended public worship in Orange \nCounty, invited ministers of religion to his house, and had family \nprayers on some occasions. As president, Madison supposedly was a pew \nholder at the First Presbyterian Church in Washington, and he also \nattended worship services held in the House of Representatives. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Madison never articulated his personal religious \nconvictions, he did clearly and forcefully articulate his beliefs \nconcerning religious liberty. In 1785, two years before he served as \nthe principal architect of the federal Constitution and 24 years \nbefore he became president, Madison wrote Memorial and Remonstrance, \na document praised by Madison biographer Irving Brant as the most \npowerful defense of religious liberty ever written in America. \u0014\n\u0014\nThus, while we may never know Madisons thoughts on his own faith, we \ndo know that of all the men who have served as president, none were \nas passionate or committed to the separation of church and state and \nto religious liberty as was James Madison. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Edwin Gaustad says, What captured Madisons energies, abilities, \nand time was not what truths lay at the end of the religious quest \nbut the right of all humankind to seek those truths without penalty \nor burden or any civil disability whatsoever. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor further reading on James Madison, see Ralph Ketcham, James \nMadison: A Biography (Charlottesville and London: University Press of \nVirginia, 1990), and Edwin S. Gaustad, Faith of Our Fathers: Religion \nand the New Nation (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1987).\u0014\n\u0014\nPam Durso is associate director of the Baptist History & Heritage \nSociety in Brentwood, Tenn.\u0014",

As they continued, sometimes accompanied by \nvisions, she became convinced that they belonged to St. Michael and \nto the early martyrs St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Margaret. \nEarly in 1429, during the Hundred Years' War, when the English were \nabout to capture Orlans, the voices exhorted her to help the \nDauphin, later Charles VII, king of France. Charles, because of both \ninternal strife and the English claim to the throne of France, had \nnot yet been crowned king. Joan succeeded in convincing him that she \nhad a divine mission to save France. A board of theologians approved \nher claims, and she was given troops to command. Dressed in armor and \ncarrying a white banner that represented God blessing the French \nroyal emblem, the fleur-de-lis, she led the French to a decisive \nvictory over the English. At the subsequent coronation of the Dauphin \nin the cathedral at Reims, she was given the place of honor beside \nthe king.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Joan had united the French behind Charles and had put an end \nto English dreams of hegemony over France, Charles opposed any \nfurther campaigns against the English. Therefore, it was without \nroyal support that Joan conducted (1430) a military operation against \nthe English at Compigne, near Paris. She was captured by Burgundian \nsoldiers, who sold her to their English allies. The English then \nturned her over to an ecclesiastical court at Rouen to be tried for \nheresy and sorcery. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter 14 months of interrogation, she was accused of wrongdoing in \nwearing masculine dress and of heresy for believing she was directly \nresponsible to God rather than to the Roman Catholic church. The \ncourt condemned her to death, but she penitently confessed her \nerrors, and the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Because \nshe resumed masculine dress after returning to jail, she was \ncondemned againthis time by a secular courtand, on May 30, 1431, \nJoan was burned at the stake in the Old Market Square at Rouen as a \nrelapsed heretic.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty-five years after her death, the church retried her case, and \nshe was pronounced innocent. In 1920 she was canonized by Pope \nBenedict XV; her traditional feast day is May 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan of Arc has been widely depicted in literature and art. Notable \nexamples include the statue by the French sculptor Franois Rude, in \nthe Luxembourg Museum, Paris, and that by the American sculptor Anna \nVaughn Hyatt (also known as Anna Huntington, 1876-1973), on Riverside \nDrive, New York City. A painting of Joan by the French painter Jules \nBastien-Lepageis in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. \nShe has been the subject of such plays as Die Jungfrau von Orleans \n(1801) by the German dramatist Friedrich von Schiller; Saint Joan \n(1923) by the British playwright George Bernard Shaw; and Joan of \nLorraine (1946) by the American playwright Maxwell Anderson. The \nSwiss composer Arthur Honegger wrote of her in his oratorio Joan of \nArc at the Stake, which was first performed in 1938. The American \nwriter Mark Twain wrote the biography The Personal Recollections of \nJoan of Arc (1896); she was the major figure in a notable chapter of \nthe History of England (1754-1762) by the Scottish philosopher David \nHume; and the French philosopher Voltaire commemorated her in his \nnarrative poem La pucelle d'Orlans (The Maid of Orlans, 1756).\u0014\n\u0002\u0014",

    "title": "JUDGE FINDS HIS TEST CASE AT HOME",
    "words": "June 1, 2004\u0014\nA Las Vegas Juvenile Judge Finds His Test Case at Home\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLIE LeDUFF\u0014\n\u0014\nAS VEGAS, May 27  Judge Gerald W. Hardcastle is a community pillar, \nan upright, modest man. He is a family court judge, the final arbiter \nfor children who are neglected or abused, addicted or delinquent, \nlost to their parents or heading there.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn endless stream of teenagers passes through the judge's courtroom, \nall with the same glum 10-mile stare. The judge will dispense \ndecisions in 100 lives before lunch. He will do this with a brisk \nefficiency that is not the same as coldness. Sometimes, looking down \nat the pitiful one before him, the judge will be struck with an \nalmost overwhelming sense of melancholy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing physically impressive about the judge and nothing \nunimpressive. He is 58, fleshy and balding, with a hard blue gaze. He \nwrites academic papers that people do not read. He is a regular at \npolitical fund-raisers. He reads philosophy. He has Wednesday-night \ncocktails with the regularity of a churchgoer. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge is a stickler for protocol and punctuality. Above all, he \ncommands order, with a sternness that colleagues say detracts from \nhis many good qualities. Some deduce that his sourness comes from the \ndisorder in his personal life, from his own troubled daughter. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the paperwork is in order and the files are as they should be, \nthe judge drives home. His neighborhood is hidden behind concrete \nwalls and surrounded by scrub lots and half-built subdivisions. The \nhouses, with their unnecessary green lawns, are all the same. The \njudge does not know his neighbors, most of them recent arrivals from \nsomeplace else. He waits for his garage door to close before getting \nout of his car.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe walls keep strangers out, but they were also built to keep \nchildren in, shielded from the neon hypnotism of the Strip. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We like to pretend what goes on downtown doesn't affect what's going \non up here,\" the judge says. \"But the town is growing so fast, life \nhere tends toward chaos.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times, the judge stands at his door, unsure of what he may find \ninside. Will there be a nude young man in there? A half-dressed girl? \nPersonal property gone missing? Someone unconscious in the bathroom?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge can tell you about the horror of standing in the emergency \nroom above his daughter, her painted lips dull red, her skin light \nblue. He can tell you about the fear he felt, wondering where it all \nfell apart. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe blames himself for his daughter's problems  his insatiable career \ndrive, the pressure he placed on her to maintain appearances. But he \nalso blames the corrupting influence of Las Vegas, a city grown \nbeyond belief and control. He followed a dream here 30 years ago, \nwhen this was a small town. Now, he says, his dream is dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I wouldn't come here again,\" he said. \"I won't retire here. There's \na lack of social control. The kids don't have dreams. I ask them, \nWhat do you want to be? They tell me nothing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the house is quiet, the judge retires upstairs, to a table where \nhe builds little boats from sticks, dreaming about a future on an \nisland somewhere. In his closet, he keeps neatly stacked shoeboxes \ncontaining mementos of his daughter's childhood: ribbons, toys and \nphotos from the days, not long ago, when she was a good girl.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you want to know Whitney,\" he says. \"Here she is in these boxes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitney Hardcastle came late to the judge's life, 20 years after he \nand his wife arrived here from Ogden, Utah. That marriage, which \nyielded three children, did not last. The judge married another \nwoman, Kathy, a lawyer and now the chief district judge of Clark \nCounty.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this second family, there would be no more mistakes. Whitney, \nthe chestnut-haired little one, would be perfect. And she loved her \nDaddy, stood by his desk as he worked, chirping incessant questions, \nsparrowlike. She took up horses to please Daddy, joined the riding \ncouncil to please Daddy. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then one day, the milk of her youth turned sour. She got sick of \nDaddy. And Daddy walked in from work one day into his perfect home \nwith the high ceilings, green lawn and pool out back, and saw a \nstranger, a world-weary sloucher with black hair and nails and a bull \nring through her nose.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis person sneers at his advice, thinks his life is rigid and \nuninspiring, his Wednesday-evening cocktails the stuff of dopes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He has patience for those boats, but not his child,\" she says as she \nlies on the couch in front of the afternoon television. \"He wants to \ncollect my childhood in those boxes. He wants me to be in those \nboxes.\" She knows she is the world to him, and tortures him for it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My dad has been trying to make me happy,\" she says. She stares \nblankly at the television, then says in a hollow voice. \"But it's not \nworking.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge likes to think that children do better in adversity, that \nwealth and beauty can damage children in the long run. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's not it, Whitney says. She knows the root of her problem: It's \nbad to be a good kid. How can you be good, she asks, when everybody \naround you is bad? She tried, the horses and the teen council, being \nthe perfect daughter of two judges. But she couldn't do it forever, \nfending off the bad kids and their parties and grown-up stories about \nthree-way sex. Then a friend, a 14-year-old boy, killed himself. \nAfter that she joined the crowd, pulled in like a ball in the ocean. \nThe horse was eventually sold.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When you have a problem you want the attention, so you keep your \nproblem to make people notice you,\" Whitney says as she drives across \ntown to a party. \"Before drugs, I felt like no one. After my best \nfriend killed himself when I was 13, I took out my betrayal through \ndrugs. I became the girl who did all the hard stuff. People began to \nknow me. I was out there doing stuff no one ever heard of. I was \npretty crazy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I wish I had that horse, though.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge noticed the change about four years ago. The school called, \nsaying Whitney had been caught with marijuana. The judge gave his \ndaughter a pat lecture, the same one he gives in his courtroom. The \nstuff about responsibility and health, the future and whatnot. She \nasked him what would he know about it, and he realized he knew almost \nnothing at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge says he is a generation removed from how people feel about \nthings today. \"I'm not a touchy-feely guy,\" he said over a Wednesday \nevening cocktail.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was ill-prepared when the spiral down began. The Hardcastles \nremoved their daughter from private school at her request. Gone were \nthe uniform and structure and watchful eyes for the judges' daughter. \nWhitney got lost in the Las Vegas wash and the influences inside the \nchaotic schools, the father believes. She was drowning while he was \nat work, spending all those hours trying to help other kids swim.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not embarrassed; that's why I'm talking about it,\" he says. \"Las \nVegas is a difficult place to raise a child. Go home or bad. You've \ngot women's butts on billboards. Your kids are on their own while \nyou're busy earning a living. If you bring your children here, be \nwarned.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n`I'm Not Anything'\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is hard to know if Whitney has turned a corner. She wants to ride \nhorses again. She has passed some high school proficiency exams, but \nher work habits are spotty. It is an improvement, though, from when \nshe was a teenage runaway on the streets of Hollywood. Asked what she \nwants to be, she says a lawyer. Just like Daddy, as though this will \nhappen by osmosis or something.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe is a thin girl, waifish with long, angular face, a tongue stud \nand nose ring. She is frenetic, unable to focus on a topic for more \nthan a few sentences, calm one minute, ripping through a string of \ninvective in the next. At 17, she has a poor self-image. She \ndescribes herself as ugly, small-chested and big-hipped. \"I'm not \ngood looking. I'm not an adult. I'm not anything. I'm spoiled,\" she \nsays and laughs at the absurdity of herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hardcastles indulge their daughter with money, cars, a cellphone, \nnice clothing. They are waiting for her moment of clarity, the day \nshe wakes up and they all laugh about this. Kathy Hardcastle has \ndrinks with the girls on Saturdays. It seems that her friends' \nchildren struggle, too.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You don't give up,\" she says. \"You just try to be consistent and \nhope something sticks. At least we haven't lost a child.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nKathy Hardcastle, 52, is the inscrutable presence in this family; at \nonce dominant and indulgent, driven and plain-spoken yet aware that \nconstantly talking about one's problems will not reduce them. She \nmakes her living in judgment of sadists and hoodlums, and is \npractical-minded about human infirmity. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm a realist,\" she says. \"She's going to do what she's going to do. \nLove her and she'll find her way home.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThey spoil their daughter, the Hardcastles know. In defense of \nthemselves, they recite that old saying: No matter how much you give \nyour kids, it never feels like enough. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsider that Whitney brought a runaway boy home last year and the \nHardcastles let him stay. His name is Steven Matthews, a moptop \n17-year-old who mumbles when trying to express himself. Kathy \nHardcastle took him in thinking he might be a steadying influence on \ntheir daughter. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe situation is anathema to the judge. A boy sleeping in his \ndaughter's bed. One high school credit, unable to carry a \nconversation, no interest in books, no hobbies. He stays out late and \ndoes drugs. And when the judge asks the boy-man what he wants to be, \nhe shrugs and mumbles \"I dunno.\" This goes counter to everything the \njudge believes, another example of the influences destroying his Las \nVegas dream, living right there across the hall from his bedroom. Yet \nhe goes along, grasping at straws. \"I'm not an expert in raising \nkids. But I love my daughter. She's my biggest heartache and my \nbiggest pride. Above all, we're a family.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, this reprobate can make his blood boil. The judge once gave \nthe ultimatum. \"I go or he goes!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHis Honor, the man of order and discipline, washes the reprobate's \nunderpants on Saturday afternoons. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He's our family now,\" Kathy Hardcastle says as a matter beyond \ndiscussion. And to this end, she bought her husband a new washer and \ndryer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe washing gives Judge Hardcastle a modicum of control. \"Some colors \nneed warm. Some need cold. Heavy material needs warm, no matter what \nthe label says. Reds bleed. Jeans go in cold.\" The judge folds them \non his pool table. The kids don't bother to carry them upstairs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I've done nothing to earn his respect,\" Steven admits. \"But he \nhasn't given me any. I think he's shrinking my clothes. I wish I knew \nsome way to show him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung, Restless and Stoned\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven talks little about the catastrophe of his young life, except \nto say that no one abuses him at the Hardcastle home. He does not use \nthe word love, cannot manage to say it except to say, \"They're good \nto me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a recent rock concert with Whitney in a park on the edge of town, \nSteven asked to borrow a pencil and wrote a list of the drugs young \npeople do. It read like a periodic table: E, O, H, K, GHB, 2CB, 2C1, \nmethamphetamine, methadone, CCC, cocaine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I haven't tried heroin yet,\" he says. \"And I never tried speed until \nI got to Las Vegas.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll day long teenagers came to the show, emerging from the back seats \nof luxury sedans. The parents stopped down the street to spare their \nchildren the embarrassment of being seen with Mom. Moms hand them \nbills, money that will most likely go up their noses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe drugs and beat and budding sexuality of thousands of teenagers \nmake an intoxicating and volatile combination. A young girl convulses \nin a drug overdose while paramedics work on her. Another group of \ngirls, no more than 14, wearing low-cut tops and panties above their \nwaistbands, their eyes moist and glistening, laugh at the girl's \nmisfortune and kiss one another with tongues. \u0014\n\u0014\nPunk music grinds from the stage and ranging gangs of boys run \nthrough the crowd, trying to initiate a stampede. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhitney is distracted, more distracted than usual, her eyes wide \nunderneath her glasses. She mills around with a group of homosexual \nboys who are her closest friends, her merry band of misfits.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven keeps a distance. He has broken it off with Whitney today, \nsays he has been treating her badly, feeling kind of weird about \nhaving a girlfriend who is now sort of a sister. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhitney grows more irritated as the afternoon dissipates into \nevening. The desert sun sets a riotous red. Whitney is bumped hard by \nanother girl running through the crowd. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fight lasts only a few seconds, with Whitney landing a punch to \nher face. The girl wriggles away.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn adult standing back by the pizza truck surveys the dissolution \nwith a frightened expression.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People come to Las Vegas for the opportunity to do better for their \nfamilies,\" says the woman, Linda Skipp, whose 13-year-old has been \nswallowed in the crowd. \"But you can't have sex and drugs and \ngambling and then expect to raise a healthy family. Look around.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBack home, Whitney's mother reads a book by lamplight. Whitney's \nfather, guilty of nothing more perhaps than loving his daughter too \nmuch, has retired to his corner upstairs, building his little boats \nfrom sticks, wondering if the kids will be home tonight.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS' MOTHER IS MAKING MORE THAN A CAMEO APPEARANCE",
    "words": "By Kim Lawton\u0014\n\u0014\nIts Christmasand for Protestants, that means its time for the \nVirgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, to make her annual cameo appearance \nin creche sets, carols and childrens bathrobed Christmas pageants.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for some Protestant theologians and activists, the season also \npresents a time to take a fresh look at the role of Mary in the life \nof the church and to recover her presence for a more vital faith and \nspirituality. A host of books, essays and magazines are doing just \nthat.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese Protestant thinkers and writers see a recovery of Mary as in \nkeeping with historic Reformation views.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther had a very high view of Mary, says Southern Baptist \nTimothy George, dean of the evangelical Beeson Divinity School in \nBirmingham, Ala., and a loving devotion to Mary, in a way.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe [Luther] refers to her as the place where God did his handiwork \non earth, George adds.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge made his comments in an interview for the PBS show, Religion & \nEthics NewsWeekly.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and again in \nthe middle of the 19th century when the Roman Catholic Church \npromulgated the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (the \nnotion Mary was born without original sin) there was a strong \nreaction against Marian piety and devotion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was seen to be competitive with Christ, and in some ways, even \nidolatrous, George said. Mary was exalted so high that she \ndisplaced Christ. And so, Protestants have generally reacted against \nthat. Perhaps we [Protestants] have gone to the other extreme.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants arent likely to embrace some beliefs about Mary held by \nsome Catholics who consider her an intermediary with God. Nor are \nthey likely to adopt the notion of the immaculate conception or the \nbelief that she was bodily assumed into heaven at the end of her \nlife. And while Catholics call her the queen of heaven, Protestants \nare emphasizing a more human Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut George and others say it is possible to recover a Protestant and \nScriptural understanding of Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if some of the language that some other Christian traditions \nuse to talk about Mary is uncomfortable for us, we can still do what \nProtestants like to think we do well, which is stay with the biblical \nstories, said Beverly Roberts Gaventa of Princeton Theological \nSeminary, Princeton, N.J.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Gaventa sees the new focus on Mary connected to a number of \nrecent trends, including a renewed interest in biblical characters \nwho are women and a new interest by people in traditions other than \ntheir own.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Gaventa, Mary is deeply connected with some of the major \nthemes in the Gospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary first appears in the Gospel of Luke, when the angel Gabriel \nappears to her and tells her that through the power of the Holy \nSpirit she will give birth to the Son of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nReally, Luke tells us nothing about her, Gaventa said. He doesnt \ngive us any credentials to make us think Mary is worthy of being \nchosen by God. What happens in the story is that Mary is chosen \nentirely by Gods own initiative.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a primary example, she said, of what Protestants emphasize \nas Gods divine grace, Gods initiative.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge said that when Mary responds to the angel, let it be \naccording to your will, she is responding with an act of \nsubmission and with an act of humility.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts an act of surrender to the will of God. And thats a wonderful \nline of discipleship for any Christian that wants to take seriously \nthe call of God on our lives, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother biblical theme associated with Mary that Protestants can \nembrace, Gaventa said, is in Marys song of praise, known as the \nMagnificat, also recorded by Luke, which takes its name from Marys \nwords, My soul magnifies the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Magnificat is really an example of biblical prophecy, Gaventa \nsaid. Mary takes on a very strong role there of declaring Gods \nfavor upon the poor and oppressed, and Gods warning about the \ndownfall of the mighty and the powerful and the wealthy. And we have \nnot given due regard to Mary as the one who utters the words.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Nativity, George said, Mary plays a special role in the \nincarnationthe Christian teaching that in Jesus God became human.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a very humble, homely event, he said. But the angels are \nlistening in, and the angels are singing and celebrating as well. So \nit brings together the heavenly and the earthly, the divine and the \nhuman, which is what the incarnation is about. The word became \nflesh, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus mother was also present at other key \npoints in Jesus ministry, including the wedding at Cana, where Jesus \nperforms his first miracle, and at the crucifixion, where Mary \nremains at the foot of the cross after many of his followers have \nfled.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor some Protestant professional church workers, Mary can be a role \nmodel for young women. Shannon Kubiak, an evangelical youth worker \nand author of the forthcoming God Called a Girl, said it is the very \nhuman Mary that can serve as a spiritual role model. So many of us \ngirls think, you know, Im no one. What can I do? Im not a beauty \nqueen like Esther. Im not someone phenomenal. What can God really do \nwith me? And thats the type of life Mary lived, Kubiak said.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was a nobody from the middle of nowhere. ... and its what \ncountless teenage girls across the nation feel like, and God chose to \nuse her for the most incredible task of a lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Princetons Gaventa and others seeking to recover Mary, to \nunderstand the Gospels, which is so much of what Protestants prize, \nmore attention has to be paid to Mary. We cant just bring her out \nfor Christmas Eve and put her back away on the 26th, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion News Service\u0014\n\u0014\nKim Lawton is managing editor of Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, a \nweekly PBS television show.\u0014",

She spun wool and gathered the harvest, a typical \nlife interrupted only by occasional encounters with soldiers from the \nHundred Years' War (1337-1453), the lingering conflict between France \nand England. Once English soldiers burned the village church; two \nother times Joan herded the livestock to safety from their marauding \ninvasions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne summer when Joan was about 13, she was working in her father's \ngarden at noon. Suddenly she saw a bright light and heard a voice. \nThe voice called her \"Joan the Maid\" and told her to live a virtuous \nlife. Voices came more often and gave instructions: Joan was to save \nFrance and help the dauphin (France's rightful heir) be crowned. Joan \nquestioned how she could possibly accomplish these astounding feats. \nThe voices said God would be with her.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan later identified the voices as belonging to the archangel \nMichael and the saints Margaret of Antioch and Catherine of \nAlexandria. At any rate, Joan's voices impelled her to attempt \nunthinkable tasks; she would rather die than deny them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith her cousin's help, Joan gained access to Robert de Baudricourt, \nthe local lord. He flatly ordered, \"Give her a good slapping and take \nher back to her father.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan would not relent, and nearly nine months later, she convinced \nher hearers that she was divinely chosen to help France. With knights \nat her side, she rode over 300 milesacross enemy territory, at \nnightto tell the dauphin, Charles, of her plans.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles was unsure whether to receive her, so when Joan entered the \n70-foot-long hall, filled with dozens of courtiers, the dauphin was \nnot on his throne. Instead, dressed like the others, he mingled with \nthe crowd. Somehow Joan walked directly to him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But I am not the dauphin,\" he protested when she addressed him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In God's name, gentle sire, you are,\" Joan responded.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles turned her over to churchmen from the University of Poitiers. \nWeeks of doubt and indecision followed while she was questioned, but \nfinally her examiners found \"only humility, purity, honesty, and \nsimplicity.\" Soon she was helping 4,000 troops to relieve the \nbesieged city of Orleans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough not the commander of the troops, she led troops in taking a \nnumber of forts that surrounded Orleans. During the battle for the \nfort of Les Tourelles, Joan was wounded (an arrow through the \nshoulder) but quickly returned to the fight, and her fortitude \ninspired many French commanders to maintain the attack until the \nEnglish capitulated. The next day the English were seen retreating, \nbut, because it was Sunday, Joan refused to allow any pursuit. It \ndidn't matter; Orleans was back in French hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a few months, the town of Reims was recaptured, and the dauphin \nwas officially crowned king of France (Reims was the traditional city \nfor coronation). But Charles suddenly lost his nerve. Joan's \ninsistent pleas to drive the English out of Paris went unheeded. On a \nsortie the next year, the 18-year-old soldier was captured by the \nEnglish, who put her on an ecclesiastical trial in Rouen.\u0014\n\u0014\nReverse decision\u0014\n\u0014\nJoan was imprisoned for nearly five months, repeatedly questioned \nabout her views, and finally charged on 70 counts of heresy. \nAuthorities were troubled that she claimed for her pronouncements the \nauthority of divine revelation, prophesied the future, endorsed her \nletters with the names of Jesus and Mary (thereby identifying herself \nwith a novel and suspect cult called the Name of Jesus), professed to \nbe assured of salvation, and wore men's clothing. She was finally \nconvicted of being a schismatic (she said she felt accountable first \nto God and her saints rather than the church). When her sentence was \nreadexecution by the secular authoritiesJoan quailed and declared \nshe would do all that the church required of her. Her sentence was \nchanged to life imprisonment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree days later, however, she was found wearing men's clothing \nagain, and when asked about it, she said the voices of Catherine and \nMargaret had censured her for her \"treason.\" She was handed over to \nsecular authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 9 a.m. on May 30, 1431, 19-year-old Joan walked toward the market \nsquare. She knelt and prayed for her enemies, then mounted the \nprepared pyre. As the flames leapt upward, Joan asked for a cross to \nbe held before her. Gazing upon it, her final word was \"Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be 25 years before a church commission overturned the \ncharges brought against her and declared her innocent. In 1920 \nJoanremembered for her heroism and devotion far more than her \nmilitary and political conquestswas canonized a saint by the Roman \nCatholic Church.\u0014",

    "words": "MOVERS AND SHAKERS\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe\u0014\nMedieval \"protestant\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Trust wholly in Christ; rely altogether on his sufferings; beware of \nseeking to be justified in any other way than by his righteousness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe left quite an impression on the church: 43 years after \nhis death, officials dug up his body, burned his remains, and threw \nthe ashes into the river Swift. Still, they couldn't get rid of him. \nWycliffe's teachings, though suppressed, continued to spread. As a \nlater chronicler observed, \"Thus the brook hath conveyed his ashes \ninto Avon; Avon into Severn; Severn into the narrow seas; and they \ninto the main ocean. And thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblem of \nhis doctrine which now is dispersed the world over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Master of errors\"\u0014\nWycliffe had been born in the hinterlands, on a sheep farm 200 miles \nfrom London. He left for Oxford University in 1346, but because of \nperiodic eruptions of the Black Death, he was not able to earn his \ndoctorate until 1372. Nonetheless, by then he was already considered \nOxford's leading philosopher and theologian.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1374 he became rector of the parish in Lutterworth, but a year \nlater he was disappointed to learn he was not granted a position at \nLincoln nor the bishopric of Worcestersetbacks that some have seized \nupon as motives for his subsequent attacks on the papacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, Rome had demanded financial support from England, a \nnation struggling to raise money to resist a possible French attack. \nWycliffe advised his local lord, John of Gaunt, to tell Parliament \nnot to comply. He argued that the church was already too wealthy and \nthat Christ called his disciples to poverty, not wealth. If anyone \nshould keep such taxes, it should be local English authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch opinions got Wycliffe into trouble, and he was brought to London \nto answer charges of heresy. The hearing had hardly gotten underway \nwhen recriminations on both sides filled the air. Soon they erupted \ninto an open brawl, ending the meeting. Three months later, Pope \nGregory XI issued five bulls (church edicts) against Wycliffe, in \nwhich Wycliffe was accused on 18 counts and was called \"the master of \nerrors.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a subsequent hearing before the archbishop at Lambeth Palace, \nWycliffe replied, \"I am ready to defend my convictions even unto \ndeath. I have followed the Sacred Scriptures and the holy doctors.\" \nHe went on to say that the pope and the church were second in \nauthority to Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis didn't sit well with Rome, but because of Wycliffe's popularity \nin England and a subsequent split in the papacy (the Great Schism of \n1378, when rival popes were elected), Wycliffe was put under \"house \narrest\" and left to pastor his Lutterworth parish.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisputing the church\u0014\nHe deepened his study of Scripture and wrote more about his conflicts \nwith official church teaching. He wrote against the doctrine of \ntransubstantiation: \"The bread while becoming by virtue of Christ's \nwords the body of Christ does not cease to be bread.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe challenged indulgences: \"It is plain to me that our prelates in \ngranting indulgences do commonly blaspheme the wisdom of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe repudiated the confessional: \"Private confession  was not ordered \nby Christ and was not used by the apostles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe reiterated the biblical teaching on faith: \"Trust wholly in \nChrist; rely altogether on his sufferings; beware of seeking to be \njustified in any other way than by his righteousness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving that every Christian should have access to Scripture (only \nLatin translations were available at the time), he began translating \nthe Bible into English, with the help of his good friend John Purvey.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church bitterly opposed it: \"By this translation, the Scriptures \nhave become vulgar, and they are more available to lay, and even to \nwomen who can read, than they were to learned scholars, who have a \nhigh intelligence. So the pearl of the gospel is scattered and \ntrodden underfoot by swine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffe replied, \"Englishmen learn Christ's law best in English. \nMoses heard God's law in his own tongue; so did Christ's apostles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffe died before the translation was complete (and before \nauthorities could convict him of heresy); his friend Purvey is \nconsidered responsible for the version of the \"Wycliffe\" Bible we \nhave today. Though Wycliffe's followers (who came to be called \n\"Lollards\"referring to the region of their original strength) were \ndriven underground, they remained a persistent irritant to English \nCatholic authorities until the English Reformation made their views \nthe norm.\u0014",

All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Newton wrote the hymn \"Amazing Grace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be at sea in a storm on an ocean liner can be thrilling. To face a \nstorm in a sailing vessel that was not seaworthy could be terrifying. \nThe boat in which John Newton sailed was in disrepair and its sails \nand rigging worn. A hard man who had often mocked God, John was \nconsidered impious even by his godless mates.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne night he was wakened by a violent wave crashing against the \nvessel. Water filled his cabin. Hurrying above, he found that timbers \nhad been ripped away. All were in terrible danger as the ship plunged \nthrough a furious storm. Men pumped desperately. Clothes and bedding \nwere stuffed into holes and boards nailed over them. John joined \nthose at the pumps.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo exhausted to pump any longer, he was lashed to the wheel to try \nand steer the ship. The storm raged on and on. It was bitterly cold, \nthe more so since the men had few clothes left. In this desperate \nmoment John turned his eyes back over his life. Raised to the age of \nseven by a Christian mother, he had sought the Lord with fasts and \nprayers, but failing to find God he had become embittered. Despite \nthis, the Lord preserved him through many dangers. Once he was even \nmade a servant to slaves on the West coast of Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his heart he believed Christianity to be true. This brought him no \nconsolation. \"I concluded my sins were too great to be forgiven. I \nwaited with fear and impatience to receive my doom.\" But soon he \nheard the glad news that the ship was freed of water. \"I began to \npray...to think of that Jesus that I had so often derided; I \nrecollected his death: a death for sins not his own, but, as I \nremembered, for the sake of those who should put their trust in him.\" \nOn this day, March 21, 1747 (new calendar) a day he ever after \nobserved, John realized he needed a Savior to intercede for him with \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe snatched a free moment to open the Bible and begin to read. Though \nthe storm raged on for days, John spent every free moment in the \nScripture and praying for guidance. Hungry, cold, exhausted, the men \nkept the ship afloat. Only one died of exhaustion but the Captain \nmuttered that John ought to be thrown overboard like Jonah; his \nwickedness was the cause of all their misery, he claimed. Finally \nthey reached Ireland.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy then John was convinced the Lord had reached down and delivered \nhis soul. The story of the Prodigal Son seemed to exactly fit his \ncase. He never turned back from that day of salvation, although, not \nrealizing slavery was a sin, he worked six years as a slaver. He \nshowed kindness to the slaves he transported, held worship services \nfor his men and wrote hymns for them. Later he saw that slavery was \nwrong and became an abolitionist and a minister. Reflecting on his \nhard life, he wrote one of the world's most loved hymns: \"Amazing \ngrace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.\"\u0014",

Both landed at the same instant. \nThe power of belief was so strong, however, that the professors \ndenied their eyesight. They continued to say Aristotle was right.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am reminded that when Galileo did that no one believed him. Even \nwith the authority of obvious visible proof, i.e. the two weights \nreached the ground at the same time, the professors did not believe. \nThe problem here is obvious. Most people are going to believe what \nthey have always believed regardless of the facts.\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that this illustrates perfectly what is going on in the \nworld today. You could show the terrible ravaging effects of AIDS and \npeople will have promiscuous sex anyway. You can show someone a \ndiseased liver and cancerous lungs and people are going to abuse \nalcohol and smoke regardless of the facts.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHNNY CARSON CAUSES A PANIC ABOUT TOILET PAPER",
    "words": "In 1973, the comedian Johnny Carson nearly caused a national crisis \nwith a single wisecrack. That was the year North America's long \nflight of postwar prosperity fell to earth like a shot goose in one \nungainly plummet. There was runaway inflation. There were oil and \nfood shortages. All the abundance that Americans had come to see as \ntheir due, their birthright, suddenly seemed in jeopardy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so, on December 19, 1973, at 11:35 p.m., when Johnny Carson \nwalked on the live studio set of The Tonight Show and quipped, \n\"There's an acute shortage of toilet paper in the United States,\" it \nwasn't funny. The joke had a toehold in reality: Earlier in the day, \nCongressman Harold Froehlich from Wisconsin had warned that if the \nfederal bureaucracy didn't catch up on its supply bids, government \nagencies would run out of toilet tissue within a month or two. Carson \ntook this shard of trivia and played it for a laugh. Then, as was his \ntrademark, he swung at an invisible golf ball, took a commercial \nbreak, and got on with the show.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot so the nation. Twenty million viewers flew into panic. The next \nmorning, hundreds of thousands of frantic shoppers lined up outside \nthe supermarkets of America, poised to dash to the paper aisles and \nstockpile rolls, fighting over bundles of two-ply and four-ply. There \nwere brawls in the aisles and scrums at the checkout. Some store \nmanagers tried to limit sales to four rolls per customer, but they \nhad no way of monitoring how many times a customer came back, and \nmost came back repeatedly. By noon on December 20mere hours after \nJohnny's flippant remarkAmerica was sold out.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnny Carson's offhand gag line had sparked a national run (no pun \nintended) on toilet tissue.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're generally gullible about news of scarcity. We have, it seems, \nan inbuilt skittishness about shortfall. This has been with us a long \nwhile, since the garden, by my reckoning.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of us live afraid that we're almost out of time. But you and I, \nwe're heirs of eternity. We're not short of days.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe just need to number them aright.\u0014\nMark Buchanan's book, from which this article is excerpted, is The \nRest of God: Restoring Your Soul by Restoring the Sabbath (Word, \n2005).\u0014",

    "title": "JOSEPH SMITH: ROUGH ROLLING STONE",
    "words": "From Publishers Weekly\u0014\nStarred Review. How should a historian depict a man's life when that \nman, and his religion, remain a mystery to so many 200 years after \nhis birth? Bushman, an emeritus professor at Columbia University and \nauthor of Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, greatly \nexpands on that previous work, filling in many details of the \nfounding prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \nand carrying the story through to the end of Smith's life. Many \ncontinue to view Smith as an enigmatic and controversial figure. \nBushman locates him in his historical and cultural context, fleshing \nout the many nuances of 19th-century American life that produced such \na fertile ground for emerging religions. The author, a practicing \nMormon, is aware that his book stands in the intersection of faith \nand scholarship, but does not avoid the problematic aspects of \nSmith's life and work, such as his practice of polygamy, his early \nattempts at treasure-seeking and his later political aspirations. In \nthe end, Smith emerges as a genuine American phenomenon, a man driven \nby inspiration but not unaffected by his cultural context. This is a \nremarkable book, wonderfully readable and supported by exhaustive \nresearch. For anyone interested in the Mormon experience, it will be \nrequired reading for years to come.

All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\n*Starred Review* Peter Burnett, California's first governor, never \nconverted to Mormonism, but he came away from his encounter with the \nMormon prophet Joseph Smith convinced that he had met \"much more than \nan ordinary man\" teaching \"strange and striking\" doctrines. Both the \nextraordinary man and his highly distinctive doctrines receive \nilluminating attention in this landmark biography, published to mark \nthe bicentennial of the American prophet's birth. A distinguished \nColumbia historian, Bushman stresses the boy seer's thoroughly \nordinary origins--born to a hard-pressed New England farm family and \ndenied all but the rudiments of a formal education--to emphasize the \nmarvel of the religious revolution he brought about. Beginning with \nthe publication of a new volume of scripture--the Book of \nMormon--recounting the resurrected Christ's ministry in ancient \nAmerica, that revolution eventually produced a dynamic church run by \na complex lay ministry and committed to spreading its message \nworldwide. Though himself a practicing Latter-day Saint (Mormon), \nBushman steers clear of hagiography by permitting readers to hear the \nvoices not only of the prophet's loyal followers but also of various \nskeptics and adversaries. Readers see in particular detail the views \nof those who rose against Smith during the turbulent final years of \nhis life, when the practice of plural marriage helped stoke a \nfirestorm of religious conflict. Though that storm ended with the \nprophet's death at the hands of an angry mob, Bushman gives the slain \nrevelator credit for the remarkable durability of the church he left \nbehind. A deft portrait of a deeply controversial figure. Bryce \nChristensen\u0014\nCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved\u0014\n\u0014\nReview\u0014\nOnce again, Richard Bushman, one of our finest historians, delivers \na superior performance. The book is\u0014\nprodigiously researched, carefully argued, and elegantly written. In \nits pages Joseph Smith emerges as\u0014\nneither hero nor charlatan, but as a strangely gifted yet thoroughly \nbelievable product of his time and place.\u0014\n--Grant Wacker, author of Heaven Below: Early Pentecostals and \nAmerican Culture\u0014\n\u0014\nHands down, this is the most balanced and informed study of \nAmerican's larger-than-life Prophet and Seer,\u0014\nJoseph Smith. It is also an important history of the founding era of \nMormonism's founding era. Rough Stone\u0014\nRolling is for insiders and outsiders alike, a landmark in Mormon \nwriting and a contribution to American religious\u0014\nstudies. It has grace, style, and intelligence-and quiet piety and \nfrank honesty, too.\u0014\n--Ronald W. Walker, author of Mormon History\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly the definitive biography for generations to come. Most \nbalanced, thorough, and insightful treatment\u0014\nto date--truly a masterful work. Wonderfully grounded in its \ninterpretations. Wise in its judgments, penetrating\u0014\nin its analysis, and rich in historical and cultural detail without \never losing sight of its subject. Bushman does\u0014\nfull justice to this most complex and influential of all American \nreligious innovators.\u0014\n--Terryl Givens, author of The Latter-Day Saint Experience in America\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This biography recasts the study of Joseph Smith for the next \ngeneration. Bushman, a distinguished historian\u0014\nand faithful believer, legitimizes Smith as a modern prophet and \nseeks the measure of this enigmatic man.\u0014\nThe volume challenges readers to reconcile Smith's remarkable \nreligious accomplishments with his often\u0014\nseemingly self-serving personal actions.\"\u0014\n--Stephen Stein, author of The Shaker Experience in America\u0014\n\u0014\n\"At last a Joseph Smith to which Mormons and non-Mormons alike can \nrelate. Meticulously researched,\u0014\nbeautifully written, and gripping in its narrative detail, this is \nRichard Bushman at his vintage best. There\u0014\nis no question that this biography is the best book ever written \nabout Mormonism's founding father, and\u0014\nAmerica's greatest home-grown prophet.\"\u0014\n--Harry Stout, author of The Divine Dramatist: George Whitefield and \nthe Rise of Modern Evangelicalism\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Bushmans profound scholarly knowledge of American society \nand culture shapes and suffuses this\u0014\nmagisterial product of his life-long quest to interpret the early \nMormon movement for skeptics and believers alike.\u0014\nHis definitive biography of the Mormon prophet supersedes all \nprevious studieshagiographic and criticalof this\u0014\nAmerican original.\u0014\n--John F. Wilson, author of Religion and the American Nation\u0014\n\u0014\nBook Description\u0014\nJoseph Smith, Americas preeminent visionary and prophet, rose from a \nmodest background to found the largest indigenous Christian church in \nAmerican history. Without the benefit of wealth, education, or social \nposition, he published the 584-page Book of Mormon when he was \ntwenty-three; organized a church when he was twenty-four; and founded \ncities, built temples, and attracted thousands of followers before \nhis violent death at age thirty-eight. Rather than perishing with \nhim, Mormonism migrated to the Rocky Mountains, flourished there, and \nnow claims millions of followers worldwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, Richard Bushman, an esteemed \nAmerican cultural historian and a practicing Mormon, tells how Smith \nformed a new religion from the ground up. Moving beyond the popular \nstereotype of Smith as a colorful fraud, the book explores the inner \nworkings of his personalityhis personal piety, his temper, his \naffection for family and friends, and his incredible determination. \nIt describes how he received revelations and why his followers \nbelieved them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith was a builder of cities. He sought to form egalitarian, just, \nand open communities under God and laid out a plan for ideal cities, \nwhich he hoped would fill the world. Adopted as the model for \nhundreds of Mormon settlements in the West, Smiths urban vision may \nhave left a more lasting imprint on the landscape than that of any \nother American.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was controversial from his earliest years. His followers honored \nhim as a man who spoke for God and restored biblical religion. His \nenemies maligned him as a dangerous religious fanatic, an American \nMohammad, and drove the Mormons from every place in which they \nsettled. Smiths ultimate assassination by an armed mob raises the \nquestion of whether American democracy can tolerate visionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book gives more attention to Joseph Smiths innovative religious \nthought than any previous biography. As Bushman writes, His \nfollowers derived their energy and purpose from the religious world \nhe brought into being. Some of the teachings were controversial, \nsuch as property redistribution and plural marriage, but Smiths \nrevelations also delved into cosmology and the history of God. They \nspoke of the origins of the human personality and the purpose of \nlife. While thoroughly Christian, Smith radically reconceived the \nrelationship between humans and God. The book evaluates the Mormon \nprophets bold contributions to Christian theology and situates him \nculturally in the modern world.\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished on the two hundredth anniversary of Smiths birth, Joseph \nSmith: Rough Stone Rolling is an in-depth portrayal of the mysterious \nfigure behind one of the worlds fastest growing faiths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author\u0014\nRichard Lyman Bushman, Gouverneur Morris Professor of History, \nEmeritus, at Columbia University, grew up in Portland, Oregon, and \nearned his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Harvard \nUniversity.

But \ntoday John of the Cross, as he came to be called, is remembered as \none of history's most influential spiritual guides.\u0014\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nTimeline\u0014\n1534\tAct of Supremacy; Henry VIII heads English church\u0014\n1536\tMenno Simons baptized as Anabaptist\u0014\n1540\tIgnatius Loyola gains approval for Society of Jesus\u0014\n1542\tJohn of the Cross born\u0014\n1591\tJohn of the Cross dies\u0014\n1598\tEdict of Nantes (revoked 1685)\u0014\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nTaking the harder road\u0014\nJuan de Yepes, his name at birth, failed at a variety of trades \nbefore entering first the local Jesuit school and then the University \nof Salamanca, where he pursued holy orders. There he met Teresa of \nAvila, who persuaded him to join her to reform the Carmelite order.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelieving that struggle and suffering, which such reform would likely \nentail, were necessary for spiritual growth, Juan entered the \nCarmelite Order in 1568 as Fray Juan de la Cruz, Friar John of the \nCross. And a life of the cross it was, as John intended: \"Turn not to \nthe easiest, but to the most difficult  not to the more, but to the \nless; not towards what is high and precious, but to what is low and \ndespised; not towards desiring anything, but to desiring nothing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn allowed himself no respite from suffering, but heaped it upon \nhimself with long fasting and whippings. If that were not enough, he \nwas also severely criticized and ignored when he exhorted his fellow \nfriars to give up their comforts, freedoms, and pleasures.\u0014\n\u0014\nImprisonment and creativity\u0014\nIn 1577 church authorities, resentful of John, had him kidnapped, and \nhe was imprisoned for nine months in a windowless six-by-ten-foot \ncell, with a ceiling so low he couldn't stand up. The stone cell was \nunheated in winter, unventilated in summer. Malnourished and flogged \nweekly, John was constantly ill.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet it was during this dark time that, by the light of a three-inch \nhole high in the wall, John wrote his two greatest poems, \"Cantico \nEspiritual\" (Spiritual Canticle, 1578) and \"Noche Oscura del Alma\" \n(Dark Night of the Soul). These two extraordinary pieces illumined \nboth his own darkness and the mystery of his path, which many people \nsince have followed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter escaping, John spent eight months recuperating and writing \nAscent of Mt. Carmel, the prose commentaries on his poetry that \nexplained the mystic way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAscending to God\u0014\nFor John, the mystic path meant living with an all-consuming desire \nmore fully to know and love God, abandoning everything that did not \ncontribute to that communion. God illuminates the individual who, in \nconsequence, has the desire and power to shed the illusions of this \nworld. These illusions include the messages of the senses, which \ndistort the reality of union with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his poem \"Dark Night,\" John extols the value of extinguishing \neverything but the desire for God:\u0014\n\u0014\n    One dark night, fired with love's urgent longingsah, the sheer \ngrace!\u0014\n    I went out unseen, my house being now all stilled.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In darkness, and secure, by the secret ladder, disguisedah, the \nsheer grace!\u0014\n    in darkness and concealment, my house being now all stilled.\u0014\n\u0014\n    On that glad night, in secret, for no one saw me,\u0014\n    Nor did I look at anything, with no other light or guide than the \none that burned in my heart\u0014\n\u0014\n    This guided me more surely than the light of noon\u0014\n    To where he was awaiting mehim I knew so wellthere in a place \nwhere no one appeared\u0014\n\u0014\n    O guiding night! O night more lovely than the dawn!\u0014\n    O night that has united the Lover with his beloved, transforming \nthe beloved in her Lover.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Upon my flowering breast, which I kept wholly for him alone,\u0014\n    There he lay sleeping, and I caressing him there in a breeze from \nthe fanning cedars.\u0014\n    When the breeze blew from the turret, as I parted his hair,\u0014\n    It wounded my neck with its gentle hand, suspending all my senses.\u0014\n    I abandoned and forgot myself, laying my face on my Beloved.\u0014\n    All things ceased; I went out from myself, leaving my cares \nforgotten among the lilies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis first step in knowing God is called purification: the speaker \nslips away from the silenced housethe passionate flesh. The soul is \nthen readied for the second stage, illumination, a blissful state \ncharacterized by a heightened awareness of the presence of God and an \nenjoyment of his gifts. Nevertheless, as delightful as God's gifts \nare, they are not God himself, and anything short of the fullness of \nGod is not enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo go further on the way requires another purification, one of the \nspirit; this process is what is called the \"Dark Night of the Soul,\" \nor the \"wounded neck\" and \"suspended senses.\" The mystic feels an \nabsolute loss of God, a sense that the sun has been completely \nobliterated. Desolation and despair are the usual emotions. Yet no \nmatter how long the emptiness continues, the soul clings to God, for \nthis \"spiritual crucifixion\" is necessary: one must learn to seek God \nfor God's sake, not for the sake of the happiness God brings. Only \nthen can one enjoy perfect union with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn spent another decade championing reform before retiring to a \nsmall village whose prior disliked John and who treated him \nshamefully (it seems John chose this particular village \ndeliberately). He finally succumbed to a severe infection in his \nright foot.\u0014",

    "words": "John Calvin\u0014\nFather of the Reformed faith\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I labored at the task [writing The Institutes] especially for our \nFrenchmen, for I saw that many were hungering and thirsting after \nChrist and yet that only a few had any real knowledge of him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith his brother and sister and two friends, John Calvin fled \nCatholic France and headed to the free city of Strasbourg. It was the \nsummer of 1536; Calvin had recently converted to the \"evangelical\" \nfaith and had just published The Institutes of the Christian \nReligion, which articulated his Protestant views. He was a wanted man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe party put up at an inn in Geneva, and word quickly passed to \nlocal church leader William Farel that the author of The Institutes \nwas in town. Farel was ecstatic. He was desperate for help as he \nstrove to organize a newly formed Protestant church in town. He \nrushed to the inn and pleaded with Calvin, arguing it was God's will \nhe remain in the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin said he was staying only one night. Besides, he was a scholar \nnot a pastor. Farel, baffled and frustrated, swore a great oath that \nGod would curse all Calvin's studies unless he stayed in Geneva.\u0014\n\u0014\nTimeline\u0014\n1488\tFirst complete Hebrew Old Testament\u0014\n1497\tSavonarola excommunicated\u0014\n1506\tWork begins on new St. Peter's in Rome\u0014\n1509\tJohn Calvin born\u0014\n1564\tJohn Calvin dies\u0014\n1611\tKing James Version of Bible published\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin, a man of tender conscience, later reflected on this moment: \n\"I felt as if God from heaven had laid his mighty hand upon me to \nstop me in my courseand I was so terror stricken that I did not \ncontinue my journey.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo this day, Calvin's name is associated, for good and for ill, with \nthe city of Geneva. And Calvin's belief in God's election is his \ntheological legacy to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"whole sum of godliness\"\u0014\nCalvin was born in 1509 in Noyon, France. His father, a lawyer, \nplanned a career in the church for his son, and by the mid-1520s, \nCalvin had become a fine scholar. He spoke proficient Latin, excelled \nat philosophy, and qualified to take up the intensive study of \ntheology in Paris.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, though, his father changed his mind and decided John should \nachieve greatness in law. John acquiesced, and the next five or six \nyears saw him at the University of Orleans, attaining distinction in \na subject he did not love. During these years, he dipped into \nRenaissance humanism. He learned Greek, read widely in the classics, \nand added Plato to the Aristotle he already knew. He developed a \ntaste for writing so that by age 22, he had published a commentary on \nSeneca's De Clementia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen word of Luther's teaching reached France, and his life made an \nabrupt turn, though his own account is reticent and vague:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He [God] tamed to teachableness a mind too stubborn for its \nyearsfor I was strongly devoted to the superstitions of the papacy \nthat nothing less could draw me from such depths of mire. And so this \nmere taste of true godliness that I received set me on fire with such \na desire to progress that I pursued the rest of my studies more \ncoolly, although I did not give them up altogether.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe became marked out as a \"Lutheran,\" and, when persecution arose in \nParis (where he had returned to teach), he sought refuge in Basel. \nThere he penned the first edition of a book that was to affect \nWestern history as much as any other.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Institutes of the Christian Religion was intended as an \nelementary manual for those who wanted to know something about the \nevangelical faith\"the whole sum of godliness and whatever it is \nnecessary to know about saving doctrine.\" Calvin later wrote, \"I \nlabored at the task especially for our own Frenchmen, for I saw that \nmany were hungering and thirsting after Christ and yet that only a \nvery few had any real knowledge of him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn The Institutes, Calvin outlined his views on the church, the \nsacraments, justification, Christian liberty, and political \ngovernment. His unique and overarching theme is God's sovereignty. He \ntaught that original sin eradicated free will in people. Only by \nGod's initiative can anyone begin to have faith and thus experience \nassurance of salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this and later editions, Calvin developed the doctrines of \npredestination, or election. More importantly, he argued for the \nindefectability of gracethat is, grace will never be withdrawn from \nthe elect. This was Calvin's pastoral attempt to comfort new \nbelievers. In medieval Catholicism, believers remained anxious about \ntheir spiritual destinies and were required to perform more and more \ngood works to guarantee their salvation. Calvin taught that once a \nbeliever understands he is chosen by Christ to eternal life, he will \nnever have to suffer doubt again about salvation: \"He will obtain an \nunwavering hope of final perseverance (as it is called), if he \nreckons himself a member of him who is beyond hazard of falling away.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's city\u0014\nAfter fleeing France to escape persecution, Calvin settled in Geneva \nat Farel's bidding. But after a mere 18 months, he and Farel were \nbanished from the city for disagreeing with the city council. Calvin \nheaded again for Strasbourg, where he pastored for three years and \nmarried Idellete de Bure, the widow of an Anabaptist, who brought \nwith her two children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1541 Calvin's reputation had spread: he wrote three other books \nand revised his Institutes. (Still more revisions came in 1550 and \n1559, eventually amounting to 80 chapters.) He had become close \nfriends with leading Reformers like Martin Bucer and Philip \nMelanchthon. He was asked to return to Geneva by city authorities, \nand he spent the rest of his life trying to help establish a \ntheocratic society.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin believed the church should faithfully mirror the principles \nlaid down in Holy Scripture. In his Ecclesiastical Ordinances he \nargued that the New Testament taught four orders of ministry: \npastors, doctors, elders, and deacons. Around these, the city was \norganized.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastors conducted the services, preached, administered the \nSacraments, and cared for the spiritual welfare of parishioners. In \neach of the three parish churches, two Sunday services and a \ncatechism class were offered. Every other weekday, a service was \nheldlater on, every day. The Lord's Supper was celebrated quarterly.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe doctors, or teachers, lectured in Latin on the Old and New \nTestaments usually on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The audience \nconsisted mainly of the older schoolboys and ministers, but anyone \ncould attend.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn every district, elders kept an eye on spiritual affairs. If they \nsaw that so-and-so was frequently the worse for drink, or that Mr. X \nbeat his wife, or that Mr. Y and Mrs. Z were seeing too much of each \nother, they admonished them in a brotherly manner. If the behavior \ndidn't cease, they reported the matter to the Consistory, the \nchurch's governing body, which would summon the offender. \nExcommunication was a last resort and would remain in force until the \noffender repented.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, social welfare was the charge of the deacons. They were the \nhospital management board, social security executives, and alms-house \nsupervisors. The deacons were so effective, Geneva had no beggars.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe system worked so well for so many years that when John Knox \nvisited Geneva in 1554, he wrote a friend that the city \"is the most \nperfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth since the days of \nthe apostles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUnofficial authoritarian\u0014\nCalvin, for his part, preached twice every Sunday and every day of \nalternate weeks. When not preaching, he lectured as the Old Testament \nprofessor three times a week. He took his place regularly on the \nConsistory, which met every Thursday. And he was either on committees \nor incessantly being asked for advice about matters relating to the \ndeacons.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was in no way the ruler or dictator of Geneva. He was appointed by \nthe city council and paid by them. He could at any time have been \ndismissed by them (as he had been in 1538). He was a foreigner in \nGeneva, not even a naturalized citizen, until near the end of his \nlife. His was a moral authority, stemming from his belief that, \nbecause he proclaimed the message of the Bible, he was God's \nambassador, with divine authority behind him. As such, he was \ninvolved in much that went on in Geneva, from the city constitution \nto drains and heating appliances.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis role in the infamous execution of Michael Servetus in 1553, then, \nwas not an official one. Servetus fled to Geneva to escape Catholic \nauthorities: he had denied the Trinity, a blasphemy that merited \ndeath in the 1500s all over Europe. Geneva authorities didn't have \nany more patience with heresy than did Catholics, and with the full \napproval of Calvin, they put Servetus to the stake.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin drove himself beyond his body's limits. When he could not walk \nthe couple of hundred yards to church, he was carried in a chair to \npreach. When the doctor forbade him to go out in the winter air to \nthe lecture room, he crowded the audience into his bedroom and gave \nlectures there. To those who would urge him to rest, he asked, \"What? \nWould you have the Lord find me idle when he comes?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis afflictions were intensified by opposition he sometimes faced. \nPeople tried to drown his voice by loud coughing while he preached; \nothers fired guns outside the church. Men set their dogs on him. \nThere were even anonymous threats against his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin's patience gradually wore away. Even when he was patient, he \nwas too unsympathetic sometimes. He showed little understanding, \nlittle kindness, and certainly little humor.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin finally wore out in 1564. But his influence has not. Outside \nthe church, his ideas have been blamed for and credited with \n(depending on your view) the rise of capitalism, individualism, and \ndemocracy. In the church, he has been a major influence on leading \nfigures such as evangelist George Whitefield and theologian Karl \nBarth, as well as entire movements, such as Puritanism.\u0014\n\u0014\nDay to day, church bodies with the names \"Presbyterian\" or \"Reformed\" \n(and even some Baptist groups) carry forward his legacy in local \nparishes all over the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History & Biography\u0014",

    "words": "How important is YOUR vote? Consider these examples, and please ... \ndon't just read them: think about them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1645, one little vote gave control of England to Oliver Cromwell! \nIn 1649, King Charles I of England was beheaded on a vote of 67-68: \none vote cost him his life! In 1776, one vote gave Americans the \nEnglish language, instead of the German -according to the folklore of \nthe time. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson was elected as the third \nPresident by one vote! In 1824, John Quincy Adams became our 6th \nPresident on one vote! In 1844, a desperately ill man had his sons \ncarry him to the county seat so that he could vote for a certain man \nfor State Senator. The sick man died on his way back home, but the \nman he voted for won the election by -you guessed it- one vote! In \nthat same year, the newly elected State Senator insisted upon \nsupporting a certain man for Indiana's United States Senator -that \nman won the election by one vote! \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1845, Texas was admitted to the Union by one vote -that of the \nUnited States Senator from Indiana who had been elected by one vote, \nwho had been elected by the one vote of the State Senator who was \nelected by one vote in his home County!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1846, the U.S. Senate approved of a Declaration of War against \nMexico -by one vote. In 1850, California was admitted to the Union by \none vote which -today- seems like a mistake! The same thing happened \nto Oregon in 1859. In 1867, the Alaska Purchase was approved by one \nvote. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson escaped impeachment by one \nvote. In 1875, one vote removed the monarchy from France, making it a \nrepublic: maybe that's where France went wrong? In that same year, \nCharles W. Jones was elected as Florida's United States Senator by \none vote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes won election as President by one vote in \nthe House of Representatives. The vote was challenged and given to a \ncommission to recount the electoral votes. Hayes won again -by one \nvote! In 1885, Robert Davis won election to the Florida State House \nof Representatives by one vote. In 1889, Washington was admitted to \nthe Union by one vote. A year later, Idaho became a State by one \nvote. In 1916, Charles Hughes would have defeated Woodrow Wilson, if \nhe had gotten one more vote in each of California's precincts!\u0014\n\u0014\nOn November 8, 1923 -by one vote- a man named Adolph Hitler became \nthe leader of the German Nazi party!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1940, France lost its status as a republic by one vote. In 1941, \nthe draft act -known as the Selective Service Act- was enabled by one \nvote -just weeks before December 7th, 1941, the Day of Infamy, when \nPearl Harbor was attacked by the cowardly Japanese! In 1948, Lyndon \nJohnson won a seat in the U.S.Senate by one vote. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1948, most Republicans refused to vote because it was expected \nthat Republican Thomas Dewey would be elected by a landslide, but \nDemocrat Harry Truman won, with only about 51 1/2% of eligible voters \ncasting a ballot.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1955, in Huron, Ohio, the mayor was elected by one vote. In 1959, \ntwo mayors in Minnesota were elected on the strength of one vote \neach. Richard Nixon could have become President 8 years before he did \n-if he had gotten just one more vote per precinct in Texas, Illinois; \nNew Jersey and Missouri in 1960: it would have been him in office in \n1961, and not John Kennedy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Governors of Maine; North Dakota, and Rhode Island were all \nelected by one vote -in 1962. A County Commissioner in Florida was \nelected by one vote, in 1984. Ten years later, in 1994, a Bill \nClinton law banning certain kinds of guns as assault weapons was \nenacted by the House of Representatives after one member changed his \nvote, approving the ban. The Senate's Balanced Budget Amendment bill \nfailed by one vote when Republican Mark Hatfield failed to vote with \nother Republicans.

    "title": "JESUS AND THE SINNER'S PRAYER",
    "words": "Jesus and the Sinners Prayer\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Jesus says doesnt match what we usually say.\u0014\nDavid P. Gushee |\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it permissible to reopen the question of salvation? If we do, how \nwill Jesus' teachings stand up to our inherited traditions?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese questions came to me acutely not long ago. I was getting ready \nto preach. As the worship leader was finishing the music set, he \noffered some unscripted theological reflections. He said something \nlike: \"The only thing required of us is to believe that Jesus' blood \nsaves us. Nothing more. It's nothing but the blood of Jesus.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my Baptist context, we've heard these thoughts a thousand times. \nThe problem was that I had in my pocket a message in which Jesus \nhimself had a very different answer to the question of salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Big Question\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reading through Luke, I had discovered that twice (10:25, 18:18) \nJesus is asked, \"What must I do to inherit eternal life?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first passage, Jesus turns the question back on the lawyer who \nasks it. The lawyer replies with the Old Testament commands to love \nGod with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and to love your \nneighbor as yourself (cf. Mt. 22:34-40). Jesus affirms his answer: \n\"You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.\" The lawyer \nthen tries to narrow the meaning of neighbor. So Jesus tells the \nunforgettable parable of the compassionate Samaritan, who proved to \nbe a neighbor to a bleeding roadside victim.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Luke 18, Jesus responds to the same question, this time from the \nman we know as the rich young ruler, by quoting the second table of \nthe Decalogue, forbidding adultery, murder, theft, and false witness, \nand mandating honor towards parents. His questioner says that he has \nkept these commandments, and Jesus proceeds to call on him to \"sell \nall  and distribute to the poor.\" Jesus assures him, \"You will have \ntreasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" The \"extremely rich\" ruler \nwon't do this, and Jesus goes on to teach his disciples about how \nhard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrying to be an honest expositor of the texts in front of me, I told \nthe chapel students that morning that on the two occasions in Luke \nwhen Jesus was asked about the criteria for admission to eternity, he \noffered a fourfold answer: love God with all that you are, love your \nneighbor (like the Samaritan loved his neighbor), do God's will by \nobeying his moral commands, and be willing, if he asks, to drop \neverything and leave it behind in order to follow him.\u0014\n\u0014\nI concluded by suggesting that the contrast between how Jesus answers \nthis question and how we usually do is stark and awfully inconvenient.\u0014\nGetting Radical\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my Baptist tradition, especially, we direct people to \"invite \nJesus into your heart as your personal Savior,\" an act undertaken \nusing a formula called the \"sinner's prayer.\" Or we simply say, \n\"Believe in Jesus, and you will be saved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jesus never taught easy believism. Whether he was telling the \nrich young ruler to sell all and follow him or telling a \nmiracle-hungry crowd near Capernaum that to do the work of God was, \nyes, to believe on him (John 6:28-29), he called people to abandon \ntheir own agenda and trust him radically. Radical trust calls for \nboth belief and action.\u0014\n\u0014\nI suggest that we tend to confuse the beginning of the faith journey \nwith its entirety. Yes, believe in Jesusthat's the first step. Yes, \ninvite Jesus into your heart as your personal Savior. Then, empowered \nby God's grace, embark on the journey of discipleship, in which you \nseek to love God with every fiber of your being, to love your \nneighbor as yourself, to live out God's moral will, and to follow \nJesus where he leads you, whatever the cost.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus is to be believed, inheriting eternal life involves a \ncomprehensive divine assessment at every step along our journey, not \njust at its inception.\u0014\n\u0014\nMediocrity and hypocrisy characterize the lives of many avowed \nChristians, at least in part because of our default answer to the \nsalvation question. Anyone can, and most Americans do, \"believe\" in \nJesus rather than some alternative savior. Anyone can, and many \nAmericans sometimes do, say a prayer asking Jesus to save them. But \nnot many embark on a life fully devoted to the love of God, the love \nof neighbor, the moral practice of God's will, and radical, costly \ndiscipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf it comes down to a choice between our habitual, ingrained ways of \ntalking about salvation and what Jesus himself said when asked the \nquestion, I know what I must choose.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christianity Today\u0014",

But a full \n150 years earlier, Puritan John Eliot was evangelizing Native \nAmericansthough the long-range impact of his work was destroyed by \ncolonists' fears.\u0014\n\u0014\nImpressed with the vigor of godliness\u0014\n\u0014\nEliot was born to a wealthy family in Herfordshire, England. After \ngraduating from Cambridge in 1622, he came under the influence of \nPuritan pastor Thomas Hooker, the man chiefly responsible for his \nconversion: \"When I came to this blessed family,\" Eliot later wrote, \n\"I then saw, and never before, the power of godliness in its lively \nvigor and efficacy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1631, as Anglican leaders applied heat to Puritans, Eliot \nemigrated to Roxbury, Massachusetts. There he became pastor of a \nchurch composed of many of his English friends. The following year, \nhe married Ann (Hannah) Mumford.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main legacy of Eliot's early years was producing the first book \npublished in America: the Bay Psalm Book (1640), which put the psalms \nin metrical verse.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliot was a quintessential Puritan: he was frugal, eating just one \nplain dish for dinner. He also rejected tobacco, wigs, and long hair \nfor men. But he was unique in this: he cared deeply for the Indians \nwho populated New England. At Roxbury, he began learning Algonkian \nand by 1647 was preaching in the native tongue. He began translating \nand in 1663 published the entire Algonkian Biblethe first Bible \nprinted in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, he was a product of his age: he confused Christianity \nwith English culture. He delayed many Indian baptisms \"until they \nwere come up unto civil cohabitation, government, and labor, which a \nfixed condition of life will put them upon.\" In other words, until \nthey began living like Englishmen, \"they were not so capable to be \ntrusted with that treasure of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis meant, among other things, haircuts for the men, English \nclothing for all, and moving Indians into villages patterned after \nEnglish towns. By 1674, there were 14 such towns with a total of \n1,100 \"praying Indians,\" as they were called.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinistering to broken bands\u0014\nThe system gave some Indians the rudiments of the Christian faith and \nsome training for the ministry. But it also isolated them, both from \ntheir own people (whose culture they were required to reject) and \nfrom their English sponsors (they were not even permitted to join \nPuritan churches).\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the bloody King Philip's War (167576) between Wampanoags and \nthe English, the \"praying Indians\" were caught in the middle. Though \nthey supported the English, the English colonists distrusted their \nloyalty, rounded them up, and confined them to concentration camps. \nThe war not only destroyed the trust of the Indians, but also nearly \nall copies of Eliot's Algonkian Bible and all but four of the Indian \nvillages.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliot refused to be discouraged, and he continued to minister to \nbroken bands of Indians until his death. Villages of \"praying \nIndians\" continued into the early eighteenth century.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS AND THE CONSUMERIST CULTURE",
    "words": "Jesus and the Consumerist Culture\u0014\n\u0014\nTyler Wigg Stevenson is a preacher and writer. He graduated from \nSwarthmore College and received his M.Div. summa cum laude from Yale \nDivinity School.\u0014\n\u0014\nTyler served in the chapel at Yale and as Associate Minister at \nChristian Tabernacle Baptist Church in Hamden, Connecticut, where he \nwas licensed and ordained. He also spent a year in London, England, \nas Study Assistant to the Rev. Dr. John Stott. Since 2001 he has \nserved on the Board of Directors of the Global Security Institute, an \norganization he helped establish under the late U.S. Senator Alan \nCranston. He and his wife live in Nashville, Tennessee.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis book, Brand Jesus: Christianity in a Consumerist Age, was \npublished only months ago (May 2007). In it, Wigg Stevenson argues \nthat American Christianity, especially evangelicalism, has been \ncorrupted by the dominance of consumerism in modern life. The \nchurchs mostly uncritical adoption of this secular condition has \nresulted in an idolatrous morphing of the message of Christ into just \nanother brand. With Brand Jesus, the author names the growing concern \nfelt by many Christians at the commodification of their faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe met with Wigg Stevenson at Yale Divinity School where he was \npresiding at Holy Communion, Marquand Chapel, and his wife was the \npreacher. After a lunch at the Refectory, we repaired to a small \noffice where we started the conversation with a discussion about \nclothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: After reading Brand Jesus, I must say I was very nervous \nabout what I should wear today for this interview because my Oleg \nCassini white shirt with the jade cuff links and Versace jacket, \nimported Italian shoes, Prada  thought it might be a bit over the \ntop, so instead I went with this off-the-rack T-shirt and jacket. \n[laughter all around]\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Its just fine.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: I bring this up because in your book consumerism takes a \nhuge hit. Its like the old saw about the weather: Everyone complains \nabout it, but no one does anything about it. Is this book your \nattempt to do something about it?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: To continue to the metaphor: Honestly, I think we can \ndo about as much with consumerism as we can do with the weather. Its \nraining. The question is whether or not were going to go indoors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book began with the idea that I would conclude with some sort of \none, two practical punch. Heres the consumerist culture, heres what \nthe church looks like in it, so therefore we need to take these \nsteps. And I had some initial ideas about where we could go with that.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I did the research for the book and continued to think about this \nfor almost two years, I came to the conclusion that we couldnt do \nanything about consumerism. Its not a force to be combated, for \nexample. The most significant question for the church in a \nconsumerist age is to ask what our situation means. What does it mean \nto be the church in an era thats so saturated by consumerism that it \ndefines itself by consumption: We buy to be; we are what we buy; we \nare what we consume.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most important thing that the church can do is to recognize this \nabout our society so as not to follow the consumerist impulse.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: To be a consumer cant be an inherently bad thing because \nwe all have to be consumers to survive. So where is the line which \nwhen crossed means were not only consumers but sinful consumers, or \nbad consumers?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: I guess I wouldnt think there is such a line. Its \nmore about ones disposition. The premise of the book is that the \nmodern West, in particular the United States, responded to an \nexistential crisis during the postwar era. There was this huge void \nof meaning; people had no idea of what their place was in the world \nbecause the old order had passed away, to poach a biblical text. \nThe culture is not going to tell you who you are, where you come from \nand where youre going, so the burden is passed on to the individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy thesis, then, is that we responded by defining ourselves in terms \nof the consumer goods we purchased. So the question is not so much \nabout not being consumers. This is not about Christians boycotting \nbrand-name goods, and so on. Its impossible. You cannot do it. \nTheres nothing thats sold thats unbranded. Theres no way to get \naround it. But the question is, how much are we going to buy into the \nidea that what we consume defines who we are? How much attention are \nwe going to pay to that? How much energy are we going to give it?\u0014\n\u0014\nThats the question thats facing all of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: I get the sense that when you and Ron Sider, author of \nThe Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience, look at the religious \nlandscape and particularly those who self-identify as Christians, you \ndont see how their Christian faith makes any real difference in the \nway they live their lives. Is that a fair statement?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Id back away from making a statement like that about \nindividuals. Its not my place to judge. But I do think its safe to \nspeak about the church; that its hard in many places to see how the \nchurch is making any difference in the way disciples are living. And \nagain, this ties into the notion that weve essentially made a \ncommodity of belief. You go to church and get a spiritual service, a \nservice is rendered to you instead of to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: Yet the church is comprised of individuals. Youve got to \nwonder, how does their faith make them any different from people who \ndont identify as Christians? As consumers they look alike. Should \ntheir faith make a difference in the way they are consumers in the \nculture?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: It absolutely should.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: But you dont think it does?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: This raises theological issues I dont discuss in the \nbook because it would have been off-point to do so. But its clear \nthat were missing the connection between what it means to be a \nChristian and what it means to live as a Christian in the culture. \nWere not doing an adequate job teaching this in the local church. \nAnd theres an eschatological dimension here as well. What does it \nmean that the kingdom of God is breaking in upon us, and that were \nmoving toward this, that theres a new creation coming? How are we \ncalled to live in light of this reality? So our ethics ought to have \nan eschatological underpinning: I am living in tune with the kingdom \nof God not the principalities and powers. And if I am living in \nthat former reality, I am going to look rather strange to people who \nare living in the latter reality. In the kingdom of God, there is no \nreason to seek my own gain; there is no reason for me to be defined \nby any rule or system other than that kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts this vision that I dont see in the church, and the result is \nthat weve been corrupted by consumerism.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: The book is Brand Jesus: Christianity in a Consumerist \nAge. Obviously, youre not in favor of whats been called the \nprosperity gospel. Are you advocating a sort of poverty gospel? Let \nme add on to that question: Jesus said that its easier for a camel \nto go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to get \ninto the kingdom of heaven. It sounds a little bit like Tyler Wigg \nStevenson is saying, Its impossible for a rich man to inherit the \nkingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: No, Im not saying that. Not advocating a poverty \ngospel. I have dear friends who are relatively wealthy and also \nimmensely generous with their wealth. Any time I feel Im getting on \na high horse, I remind myself that Im not better, just poorer! \n[laughter] But it does seem to me that we havent been obedient to \nwhat Jesus says about money. His teachings are unequivocal. In the \nSermon on the Plain in Luke and the corresponding blessings and woes, \ntheres nothing metaphorical or spiritual about it. Its Woe to you \nwho are rich! And I have to count myself in that group. I dont feel \nrich, but I have a very comfortable life.\u0014\n\u0014\nLook, Im just not willing to edit Jesus on this point. If he uses \nthe comparative form, I wont use the superlative. Im not going to \nsay impossible when Jesus clearly allows some wiggle room, however \nminiscule. But I do think we tend to delude ourselves about the money \nquestion.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: Well, theres not much in this book I disagree with, but \nof course it applies to everyone else. Not me.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Right. Well, I had to laugh at myself when I was \nwriting this. I cant think of anyone who really says consumerism is \na good thing, yet were all so subject to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: Most of us say, Yeah, consumerism is a bad thing; we \nshould own our possessions and not let our possessions own us, and \nso forth, and we see the problem everyone else is having with \nconsumerism, and its all a way of saying that Im not willing to \ngive up what I think is important to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Thats right. Its probably a version of the speck in \nsomeones eye and the plank in our own. James Twitchell is an author \nwhom I cite frequently in the book. Hes a secular writer, professor \nof English Literature and Advertising at Florida State. He wrote an \nexcellent book. Hes a very clear-eyed analyst of consumerism, and if \none isnt coming from a certain religious perspective, his analysis \nis dead on. Whats wrong with consumerism? We call these things \ngoods and thats not an accident. Whats wrong with having things?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Twitchell says is that most of our contempt of consumerism is \nabout someone elses consumption. Its usually based on social class. \nFor example, Twitchell points out that many think nothing of spending \nthousands of dollars to go hiking in Provence, but would look down on \nsomeone going to Vegas to gamble even if the expenditure was less.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: I appreciate your insight about our love of choice. We \nlove to have choice and options in our culture. We can have \nindividualized jackets for our Razr phones, for example. You talk \nabout what choices we werent able to make.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Most of the important things in our lives were not \nable to choose at all. Our parents, the year of our birth, where \nwere born, what kind of family were born into, how we spend the \nfirst 20 years of our lives  having decisions made for us, we dont \nchoose how were going to grow old, we dont choose medically whats \ngoing to go wrong with us, we dont choose where were going to die \nand when.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut theres this total preoccupation with choice in a consumer \nsociety. It makes sense. The underlying principle of a consumer \nsociety is You are what you buy, and you need to make choices for \nthat. So our understanding of self is totally wedded to choice, which \nis a distortion of a true theological anthropology. We are not \nchoosers, but we are chosen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: So, being able to consume things, and to make choices \nallows us to personalize our self-hood in the same way that we can \npersonalize our cell phones. Theres a sense then that were able to \npurchase our identity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: By personalizing your cell phone you personalize your \nself, because your self is tied up with what you consume. The cell \nphone is an interesting case. Its the first item or commodity thats \nmass produced and which is also utterly unique to each owner, \nproviding a unique digital identity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe direction that were going is one where customization and \npersonalization and the ability to manipulate our environment are \ngoing to increasingly affect our view of the world. The result is a \ndistortion of our humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: You take us back to Genesis to the Eden story where you \nsuggest that this idea of wanting to define ourselves first surfaces.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Adam and Eve wanted to be autonomous beings; they \nwanted to be judgers. They wanted to be able to choose between good \nand evil. They wanted to have the world spread before them, rather \nthan remain recipients of Gods gift. The tragedy or perhaps irony of \nthis move is that God sustained them in it: God made the fruit on the \ntree, God supported the ground under their feet, gave them the air in \ntheir lungs. Theyre totally dependent upon God, but their actions \nmoved in a direction away from God and toward greater independence. \nBut even this attempt to be independent from God was utterly \ndependent upon God. And thats the great lie of sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: So if I read this story right, the serpent is the seller, \nEve is the buyer, and Adam pays the bills.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: [Laughs] I think Id need a little extra time to \nparse that one out!\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: Okay. Hope we dont get too many letters! Jesus isnt any \neasier on this topic, as you point out, when he talks about not being \nable to serve two masters, God and Mammon. Thats an intriguing word.\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: The interesting thing is that usually the word is \ntranslated, in the NRSV and NIV, for example, as wealth or riches. \nMammon is an Aramaicism. Luke leaves it untranslated. Hes writing \nin Greek and then suddenly theres this Aramaic word, Mammon. He \nleaves it alone. This is a clue to me that Luke thought that Jesus \nwas saying something that was fundamentally untranslatable. So it \nwasnt simply a generic term for money; if that was what he wanted to \nsay, there are plenty of Greek words he could have used. The fact \nthat he leaves in the Aramaic Mammon says to me that Luke and \nMatthew both believe that Jesus is teaching something very, very \nspecific. It has the connotation of a proper noun, a meta-idol. There \nis a force, the force that is in opposition to God, that seeks to \noppose God. I see Mammon as the lord of the fallen order.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm not trying to sent up a dualism here. Im not speaking of cosmic \nwarfare or that God has any viable opponents. Thats not what I am \ntrying to say. I am saying that when we sinned, we established an \norder in the world that was patterned after our own sin, and the \nidol that lords over that order is Mammon. When we think about \nwealth, its not about how much money we have; its that we possess \nsomething of value. The very fact that I can distinguish between a \ngold nugget and an apple in terms of its value is telling. One makes \nme wealthy, the other makes me healthy, but push comes to shove, I \nwant what makes me wealthy. They are both the gifts of God  wheres \nthe intrinsic value of the gold over the apple? But we have put in \nplace an order governed by wealth where some are rich and some are \nnot.\u0014\n\u0014\nHOMILETICS: How do we know when were worshiping consumer goods? How \ndo we know when weve fallen into idolatry?\u0014\n\u0014\nWIGG STEVENSON: Its a continuum, marked by ones disposition rather \nthan a line drawn between the idolaters and non-idolaters. I think we \nare all subject to it; and we can be complicit and guilty for things \nthat we dont personally choose. So to simply exist in our culture \nmeans that one is participating to some extent in the idolatry of \nconsumerism. It has such a total grasp of the space in which we live; \nthere is no real way to step outside of it, there is no pure space to \noccupy, theres no righteous place to go. Theres no cultural group \nthats going to be pure in this regard.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not to say its this or that but rather: Whats your \nrelationship to the thing youre buying? My experience with \nChristians has been that theres often very little consciousness \nabout this. We dont place car-shopping within the context of our \nfaith. But even if we want to rebel against the consumerist system we \nare still caught in the same game. Even our way out is commodified. \nI dont care what kind of car I buy, so I am going to buy a car that \nshows that I dont care what kind of car I drive. Our purchase is \nstill defining who we are.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one level this is quite banal: This is the world we live in. It is \nwhat it is, and were all in it, so what can we do? I dont want to \ndemonize people. But on a religious/cultural scale, the collective \nexercise of our choices which follow this pattern that what I buy \ndefines who I am, has created a reality that is idolatrous.\u0014",

According to his Web bio, Phelps was ordained as a Southern \nBaptist minister in 1947, but the church isn't affiliated with the \nSouthern Baptist Convention.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church's \"outreach\" ministry consists of more than 22,000 \npicketing demonstrations across America and in foreign countries \nduring the past 12 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nStarting with a 1991 demonstration at a Topeka park allegedly \nfrequented by homosexuals, the church reached national prominence in \n1998, when it picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard. A \"memorial\" \non the Westboro Baptist Church Web site says Shepard, a gay college \nstudent murdered near Laramie, Wyo., is in hell. Shepard is \naccompanied there, according to other church fliers, by public \nfigures including Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and Martin Luther \nKing's widow Coretta Scott King.\u0014\n\u0014\nProtests have included less-than-obvious targets like Focus on the \nFamily, the Southern Baptist Convention and the funeral of Jerry \nFalwell. While those groups are also anti-gay, Westboro protesters \naccuse them of watering down the Bible's message of condemnation \nagainst homosexuals by telling gays God loves them, making them less \nlikely to repent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttention to the group exploded in June 2005, when it moved beyond \nhomosexual events to funerals of fallen soldiers carrying placards \nlike \"God Hates America,\" \"Thank God for IEDs\" (improvised explosive \ndevices) and with slogans like \"They turned America over to fags; \nthey're coming home in body bags.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThose demonstrations, met by taunts from passersby and counter \nprotests, prompted at least 22 states to propose or enact laws to \nlimit protests and funerals. The Phelpses, a family of lawyers, do \nnot practice civil obedience but carefully abide by ordinances such \nas maintaining proper distance from churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to media reports, Phelps vowed to appeal the judgment, \nwhich is about 10 times what Westboro's lawyer said is the net worth \nof the church and three of its members on trial.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's going to be reversed in five minutes,\" Phelps said, according \nto the Baltimore Sun, adding the case \"will elevate me to something \nmore important\" as it draws more publicity to his cause.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defendants said it was their religious beliefs that were really \non trial. Constitutional experts said the case could have a chilling \neffect on free speech.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his instructions to jurors, according to the Sun, U.S. District \nJudge Richard D. Bennett said they must balance the church's right to \nreligious expression with the family's right to privacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nArguing for punitive damages, the attorney for Snyder's family called \nthe Phelpses \"malicious people\" who celebrated a soldier's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nShirley Phelps-Roper told EthicsDaily.com at a funeral protest in \n2005 the group's intent was not meanness but rather to \"let America \nknow of this abomination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We have to be timely.

    "words": "JOHN WESLEY\u0014\n                                                                   \nMethodical Pietist\u0014\n\u0014\n\"About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change \nwhich God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart \nstrangely warmed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn late 1735, a ship made its way to the New World from England. On \nboard was a young Anglican minister, John Wesley, who had been \ninvited to serve as a pastor to British colonists in Savannah, \nGeorgia. When the weather went sour, the ship found itself in serious \ntrouble. Wesley, also chaplain of the vessel, feared for his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he noticed that the group of German Moravians, who were on their \nway to preach to American Indians, were not afraid at all. In fact, \nthroughout the storm, they sang calmly. When the trip ended, he asked \nthe Moravian leader about his serenity, and the Moravian responded \nwith a question: Did he, Wesley, have faith in Christ? Wesley said he \ndid, but later reflected, \"I fear they were vain words.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, Wesley was confused by the experience, but his perplexity \nwas to lead to a period of soul searching and finally to one of the \nmost famous and consequential conversions in church history.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious upbringing\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley was born into a strong Anglican home: his father, Samuel, was \npriest, and his mother, Susanna, taught religion and morals \nfaithfully to her 19 children.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley attended Oxford, proved to be a fine scholar, and was soon \nordained into the Anglican ministry. At Oxford, he joined a society \n(founded by his brother Charles) whose members took vows to lead holy \nlives, take Communion once a week, pray daily, and visit prisons \nregularly. In addition, they spent three hours every afternoon \nstudying the Bible and other devotional material.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom this \"holy club\" (as fellow students mockingly called it), \nWesley sailed to Georgia to pastor. His experience proved to be a \nfailure. A woman he courted in Savannah married another man. When he \ntried to enforce the disciplines of the \"holy club\" on his church, \nthe congregation rebelled. A bitter Wesley returned to England.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeart strangely warmed\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter speaking with another Moravian, Peter Boehler, Wesley concluded \nthat he lacked saving faith. Though he continued to try to be good, \nhe remained frustrated. \"I was indeed fighting continually, but not \nconquering.  I fell and rose, and fell again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 24, 1783, he had an experience that changed everything. He \ndescribed the event in his journal:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the evening, I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate \nStreet, where one was reading Luther's preface to the Epistle to the \nRomans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the \nchange which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt \nmy heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone \nfor salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away \nmy sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, another former member of the \"holy club,\" George \nWhitefield, was having remarkable success as a preacher, especially \nin the industrial city of Bristol. Hundreds of working-class poor, \noppressed by industrializing England and neglected by the church, \nwere experiencing emotional conversions under his fiery preaching. So \nmany were responding that Whitefield desperately needed help.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley accepted Whitefield's plea hesitantly. He distrusted \nWhitefield's dramatic style; he questioned the propriety of \nWhitefield's outdoor preaching (a radical innovation for the day); he \nfelt uncomfortable with the emotional reactions even his own \npreaching elicited. But the orderly Wesley soon warmed to the new \nmethod of ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith his organizational skills, Wesley quickly became the new leader \nof the movement. But Whitefield was a firm Calvinist, whereas Wesley \ncouldn't swallow the doctrine of predestination. Furthermore, Wesley \nargued (against Reformed doctrine) that Christians could enjoy entire \nsanctification in this life: loving God and their neighbors, meekness \nand lowliness of heart, abstaining from all appearance of evil, and \ndoing all for the glory of God. In the end, the two preachers parted \nways.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom \"methodists\" to Methodism\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley did not intend to found a new denomination, but historical \ncircumstances and his organizational genius conspired against his \ndesire to remain in the Church of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley's followers first met in private home \"societies.\" When these \nsocieties became too large for members to care for one another, \nWesley organized \"classes,\" each with 11 members and a leader. \nClasses met weekly to pray, read the Bible, discuss their spiritual \nlives, and to collect money for charity. Men and women met \nseparately, but anyone could become a class leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe moral and spiritual fervor of the meetings is expressed in one of \nWesley's most famous aphorisms: \"Do all the good you can, by all the \nmeans you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at \nall the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you \ncan.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe movement grew rapidly, as did its critics, who called Wesley and \nhis followers \"methodists,\" a label they wore proudly. It got worse \nthan name calling at times: methodists were frequently met with \nviolence as paid ruffians broke up meetings and threatened Wesley's \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Wesley scheduled his itinerant preaching so it wouldn't \ndisrupt local Anglican services, the bishop of Bristol still \nobjected. Wesley responded, \"The world is my parish\"a phrase that \nlater became a slogan of Methodist missionaries. Wesley, in fact, \nnever slowed down, and during his ministry he traveled over 4,000 \nmiles annually, preaching some 40,000 sermons in his lifetime.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few Anglican priests, such as his hymn-writing brother Charles, \njoined these Methodists, but the bulk of the preaching burden rested \non John. He was eventually forced to employ lay preachers, who were \nnot allowed to serve Communion but merely served to complement the \nordained ministry of the Church of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesley then organized his followers into a \"connection,\" and a number \nof societies into a \"circuit\" under the leadership of a \n\"superintendent.\" Periodic meetings of methodist clergy and lay \npreachers eventually evolved into the \"annual conference,\" where \nthose who were to serve each circuit were appointed, usually for \nthree-year terms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1787, Wesley was required to register his lay preachers as \nnon-Anglicans. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the \nAmerican Revolution isolated Yankee methodists from their Anglican \nconnections. To support the American movement, Wesley independently \nordained two lay preachers and appointed Thomas Coke as \nsuperintendent. With these and other actions, Methodism gradually \nmoved out of the Church of Englandthough Wesley himself remained an \nAnglican until his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn indication of his organizational genius, we know exactly how many \nfollowers Wesley had when he died: 294 preachers, 71,668 British \nmembers, 19 missionaries (5 in mission stations), and 43,265 American \nmembers with 198 preachers. Today Methodists number about 30 million \nworldwide.\u0014\n\t\u0014",

Justin \nreplied, \"No one who is rightly minded turns from true belief to \nfalse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTimeline\u0014\n30\tCrucifixion of Jesus; Pentecost\u0014\n65\tPeter and Paul executed\u0014\n70\tDestruction of Jerusalem by Titus\u0014\n100\tJustin Martyr born\u0014\n165\tJustin Martyr dies\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in one sense an easy answer for Justin because he had spent \nmost of his adult life discerning the true from the false.\u0014\n\u0014\nFire in the soul\u0014\nJustin was born in the Roman city of Flavia Neapolis (ancient Shechem \nin Samaria). Raised by pagan parents, he sought to find life's \nmeaning in the philosophies of his day. This only brought a series of \ndisappointments.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first teacher was a Stoic who \"knew nothing of God and did not \neven think knowledge of him to be necessary.\" There followed a \nPeripatetic (itinerant philosopher), who seemed most interested in \ngetting his fees. Then came a Pythagorean, but his required course of \nmusic, astronomy, and geometry seemed far too slow. Finally, \nPlatonism, though intellectually demanding, proved unfulfilling for \nJustin's hungry heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt last, about A.D. 130, after a conversation with an old man, his \nlife was transformed: \"A fire was suddenly kindled in my soul. I fell \nin love with the prophets and these men who had loved Christ; I \nreflected on all their words and found that this philosophy alone was \ntrue and profitable. That is how and why I became a philosopher. And \nI wish that everyone felt the same way that I do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJustin continued to wear his philosopher's cloak, seeking to \nreconcile faith and reason. His teaching ministry took him first to \nEphesus (c. 132), where he held a disputation with Trypho, a Jew, \nabout the true interpretation of Scripture. The Dialogue with Trypho \nteaches three main points: the Old Covenant is passing away to make \nplace for the New; the Logos is the God of the Old Testament; and the \nGentiles are the new Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater Justin moved to Rome, founded a Christian school, and wrote two \nbold apologies (i.e., defensesfrom the Greek apologia). Justin's \nFirst Apology, addressed to Emperor Antoninus Pius, was published in \n155 and attempted to explain the faith. Christianity was not a threat \nto the state, he asserted, and should be treated as a legal religion. \nHe wrote \"on behalf of men of every nation who are unjustly hated and \nreviled.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJustin argued that Christians are, in fact, the emperor's \"best \nhelpers and allies in securing good order, convinced as we are that \nno wicked man ... can be hidden from God, and that everyone goes to \neternal punishment or salvation in accordance with the character of \nhis actions.\" He further showed that Christianity is superior to \npaganism, that Christ is prophecy fulfilled, and that paganism is \nactually a poor imitation of the true religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nA picture of worship\u0014\nHowever, this apology has gained the most attention for modern \nreaders because in it Justin records detailed descriptions of early \nChristian worship (to show unbelievers that Christianity was not \nsubversive). The most famous passage is this:\u0014\n\u0014\n    On the day called Sunday there is a gathering together in the \nsame place of all who live in a given city or rural district. The \nmemoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as \nlong as time permits. Then when the reader ceases, the president in a \ndiscourse admonishes and urges the imitation of these good things. \nNext we all rise together and send up prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\n    When we cease from our prayer, bread is presented and wine and \nwater. The president in the same manner sends up prayers and \nthanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people sing out \ntheir assent, saying the 'Amen.' A distribution and participation of \nthe elements for which thanks have been given is made to each person, \nand to those who are not present they are sent by the deacons.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Those who have means and are willing, each according to his own \nchoice, gives what he wills, and what is collected is deposited with \nthe president. He provides for the orphans and widows, those who are \nin need on account of sickness or some other cause, those who are in \nbonds, strangers who are sojourning, and in a word he becomes the \nprotector of all who are in need.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustin's Second Apology was written soon after Marcus Aurelius became \nemperor in 161. In these writings, Justin tried to show that the \nChristian faith alone was truly rational. He taught that the Logos \n(Word) became incarnate to teach humanity truth and to redeem people \nfrom the power of the demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years later, Justin and his disciples were arrested for their \nfaith. When the prefect threatened them with death, Justin said, \"If \nwe are punished for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, we hope to be \nsaved.\" They were taken out and beheaded. Since he gave his life for \nthe \"true philosophy,\" Justin has been surnamed Martyr.\u0014",

    "words": "John Eliot\u0014\nApostle to Native Americans\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I came to this blessed family, I then saw, and never before, \nthe power of godliness in its lively vigor and efficacy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians customarily date the beginning of the modern missionary \nmovement in 1792, with William Carey's voyage to India. But a full \n150 years earlier, Puritan John Eliot was evangelizing Native \nAmericansthough the long-range impact of his work was destroyed by \ncolonists' fears.\u0014\n\u0014\nImpressed with the vigor of godliness\u0014\nEliot was born to a wealthy family in Herfordshire, England. After \ngraduating from Cambridge in 1622, he came under the influence of \nPuritan pastor Thomas Hooker, the man chiefly responsible for his \nconversion: \"When I came to this blessed family,\" Eliot later wrote, \n\"I then saw, and never before, the power of godliness in its lively \nvigor and efficacy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1631, as Anglican leaders applied heat to Puritans, Eliot \nemigrated to Roxbury, Massachusetts. There he became pastor of a \nchurch composed of many of his English friends. The following year, \nhe married Ann (Hannah) Mumford.\u0014\n\u0014\nbook published in America: the Bay Psalm Book (1640), which put the \npsalms in metrical verse.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliot was a quintessential Puritan: he was frugal, eating just one \nplain dish for dinner. He also rejected tobacco, wigs, and long hair \nfor men. But he was unique in this: he cared deeply for the Indians \nwho populated New England. At Roxbury, he began learning Algonkian \nand by 1647 was preaching in the native tongue. He began translating \nand in 1663 published the entire Algonkian Biblethe first Bible \nprinted in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, he was a product of his age: he confused Christianity \nwith English culture. He delayed many Indian baptisms \"until they \nwere come up unto civil cohabitation, government, and labor, which a \nfixed condition of life will put them upon.\" In other words, until \nthey began living like Englishmen, \"they were not so capable to be \ntrusted with that treasure of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis meant, among other things, haircuts for the men, English \nclothing for all, and moving Indians into villages patterned after \nEnglish towns. By 1674, there were 14 such towns with a total of \n1,100 \"praying Indians,\" as they were called.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinistering to broken bands\u0014\nThe system gave some Indians the rudiments of the Christian faith and \nsome training for the ministry. But it also isolated them, both from \ntheir own people (whose culture they were required to reject) and \nfrom their English sponsors (they were not even permitted to join \nPuritan churches).\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the bloody King Philip's War (167576) between Wampanoags and \nthe English, the \"praying Indians\" were caught in the middle. Though \nthey supported the English, the English colonists distrusted their \nloyalty, rounded them up, and confined them to concentration camps. \nThe war not only destroyed the trust of the Indians, but also nearly \nall copies of Eliot's Algonkian Bible and all but four of the Indian \nvillages.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliot refused to be discouraged, and he continued to minister to \nbroken bands of Indians until his death. Villages of \"praying \nIndians\" continued into the early eighteenth century.\u0014",

    "words": "A 2000 sermon by John MacArthur attempted to explain why women don't \nwant to be workers at home. \"Because Satan sells the system on that,\" \nhe said. \"Because it's anti-God, anti-Christ, anti-Bible and it \ndevastates the testimony of the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For a mother to get a job outside the home and send the children to \nsome kind of daycare place is to shirk her God-given responsibility,\" \nMacArthur said. \"It also is failure to understand that her husband is \nto be the provider, as Ephesians 5 makes very clear. Even if you \nwanted to work outside the home to pay for your children to go to a \nChristian school, you made a big mistake. Better that you should stay \nin the home and raise your own children to be godly then to pass it \non to somebody else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother sermon by MacArthur profiled the \"modern super-woman.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She works, builds her own career, demands equal pay, refuses to \nsubmit to her husband, demanding equality with him in everything, has \nan affair or two and a divorce or two. She exercises her \nindependence, relies on her own resources, doesn't want her husband \nor children to threaten her personal goals, has her own bank account. \nShe hires a maid or a cleaning service, eats out at least fifty \npercent of the time with her family or without them, makes cold \ncereal and coffee, the standard breakfast for her family, \nquick-frozen meals usual dinner fare, or she calls Domino's Pizza, \nexpects her husband to do his share of the housework. She is tanned, \ncoiffured, aerobicized, into body-building shape, shops to keep up \nwith the fashion trends, makes sure she can compete in the \nattention-getting contest, puts the kids in a day care center, makes \nsure each has a TV in his room, or a radio or a CD player so they can \nbe entertained. She is opinionated, demanding, wants to be heard, \neager to fulfill all of her personal goals.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That is the modern woman of the nineties that is applauded by the \nculture,\" MacArthur continued. \"She can't stay married, or for that \nmatter happy and her kids get into trouble, and sometimes drugs. \nShe's far from the woman God has called the excellent woman.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"God's standard is for the wife and mother to work inside the home \nand not outside,\" MacArthur explained. \"For a mother to get a job \noutside the home in order to send her children even to a Christian \nschool is to misunderstand her husband's role as a provider, as well \nas her own duty to the family.\"\u0014",

Though Smits \u0014\n         ran a forestry research station on the islands east coast, \nhe had never come face-to-face \u0014\n         with one of the creatures. As he moved on, he couldnt shake \nthe feeling that a red-haired \u0014\n         child, ill and abused, needed his help.\u0014\n\u0014\n          That night, he returned to look for her. He found the \nlittle orangutan\u0014\n         dying of dehydration on a garbage heap, where the vendor had \ntossed her\u0014\n         after failing to find a buyer. Back home, he spent 24 hours \nfeeding her diluted\u0014\n         milk and cradling her in his lap. When she was out of \ndanger, Smits named\u0014\n         her Uce (pronounced oo-cheh), for the gasping sounds shed \nbeen mak-\u0014\n         ing when he rescued her.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Two decades later, Smits, 51, has saved more than 1,600 \norangutans,\u0014\n         gentle and highly intelligent great apes now classified as \nan endangered spe-\u0014\n         cies.

Smitss \norganization,\u0014\n         the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOS), takes in \norphaned or\u0014\n         displaced animals and resettles them in protected rain \nforests. This month\u0014\n         he will release 96 orangutanshis biggest graduating class \nyet.\u0014\n\u0014\n          One thing Smitss work has taught  him is that our fate is \ninextricably tied\u0014\n         to the orangutans. Certain varieties of wood sold at \nAmerican lumber-\u0014\n         yards are illegally harvested from the animals home turf; \nthe vegetable oil in\u0014\n         many processed foods comes from palm trees planted where \njungle once\u0014\n         grew The razing of the forests, in turn, contributes to \nglobal warming and\u0014\n         thus to droughts, floods, and other disasters from Alaska to \nAustralia.\u0014\n        \u0014\n         Protecting orangutans, Smits tells anyone who will listen, \nis the same\u0014\n         as protecting people.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Outside the perimeter, were working very hard, Smits \nsays, but were\u0014\n         not solving the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\n         When he grows weary, it helps to hike into the forest where \nhe released\u0014\n         Uce in 1992. She lives there with her  youngest male \noffspring, Matahari,\u0014\n         whose father is Dodoy, Smitss second rescuee. (An older \nmale, Bintang, has\u0014\n         grown up and left the nest.) When Smits calls Uces name, \nshe clambers\u0014\n         down from the treetops. She hands me her baby and hugs me, \nhe says.\u0014\n         Smits recently shot a video of mother and child playing on \nthe forest floor.\u0014\n         Though orangutans cant speak, they communicate eloquently \nby other means. \u0014\n         In the film, Uce stops for a moment and looks up at her \nhuman friend.\u0014\n         Her smile is broad and warm, and that tells Smits everything \nhe needs to know.\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS AND THE RULE MAKERS",
    "words": "\"Religions spawn rules and rule makers. The rules generally describe \nwhat God or the gods require of you if you want them to be on your \nside. On the one hand, you must obey the rules to keep the gods \nplacated so they don't destroy you. On the other hand, if you don't \nobey the rules, they won't give you what you want. There is one \ncharacteristic of rule makers: they are the ones living by the rules. \nOf course, many people do not live by the rules. They have often been \nspurned, punished, ostracized, or made to pay for their failures in \nother ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In the centuries prior to the birth of Jesus, the rule makers of \nJudaism formulated hundreds of rules that were essential for keeping \nGod on their side. They described in detail what people needed to do \nto keep the written law found in the first five books of the Hebrew \nBible. For example, if you became unclean by touching something or \nsomeone unclean, the rules prescribed what you should do to become \nclean again. One entire book of the Talmud was dedicated to \ndescribing what you needed to do and what you should refrain from \ndoing in order to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. The \nPharisees, whose center of authority was the synagogue, kept and \nenforced the rules in Jesus' day. Among Jewish people, the sect of \nthe Pharisees was the most admired.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rule Breakers\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Many Jews, however, did not keep the rules and were labeled sinners. \nA wide range of people was consigned to this group. Some of them were \nblatantly immoral: prostitutes, adulterers, murderers, blasphemers, \nand the like. Other sinners were guilty of what we would consider \ninsignificant infractions. For example, they failed to wash their \nhands before eating, walked a few steps too far on the Sabbath, or in \nother ways transgressed the oral law. Interestingly, people during my \nchildhood regarded Sunday as the Sabbath. They adopted a number of \ndos and don'ts to help people to avoid profaning this holy day. You \nwere not supposed to fish or play golf on Sunday. You were supposed \nto attend all the services of the church on Sunday. There were \nothers. Ironically, nothing in the Bible describes what we should do \non Sunday, the first day of the week.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In Jesus' day, a certain group was considered so evil that they were \nnot even classified as sinners. They were placed in their own group \nas tax collectors. These Jews had purchased the right to levy \ncustoms on goods flowing down a certain road. People thought the tax \ncollectors had exploited others so much that there was no possibility \nof their securing God's forgiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"One of Jesus' characteristics that most aroused the ire of the rule \nkeepers was exactly at this point. He simply did not respect the \nlines they had drawn. He associated with all kinds of people without \ndistinction. He did not shun the ones considered righteous, but, more \noften than not, his circle included the sinners and, most shocking of \nall, the tax collectors.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSee: My Documents\\Jesus and the Rule Makers for full article by \nMalcom Tolbert\u0014",

He was a soldier \nof the cross\u0014\n           who labored long and hard for the basic right of all \npersons freedom\u0014\n           of conscience.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           John WaIler was not always an advocate of soul freedom \nmuch less\u0014\n           Christian virtues. He got into fights in taverns. He \nearned the\u0014\n           nickname of Swearing Jack which betrays much of his \ncharacter. Like\u0014\n           Paul, he persecuted the troublesome dissenters known as \nBaptists.\u0014\n           And, like Paul, he had a dramatic change.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Waller was placed on the jury to try a Baptist preacher, \nLewis Craig, for\u0014\n           unlawful preaching. Craig looked at the jury and said: I \nthank you\u0014\n           gentlemen for the honor you have done me. While I was \nwicked, you\u0014\n           took no notice of me, but since I have altered my course \nof life and\u0014\n           endeavored to reform my neighbors, you concern yourselves \nriluch\u0014\n           about me. Craig manifested an inner peace and declared \nthat he\u0014\n           would take whatever punishment as a form of joy. The \ntestimony took\u0014\n           Waller by surprise and he actually was jealous of the \npreacher,\u0014\n           declaring that he desired to possess the same depth of \nfaith.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           Waller later dated his conversion to the scene in the \ncourtroom. But it\u0014\n           was a long and difficult struggle to surrender. He spent \nmaybe eight\u0014\n           months in a time of soul searching. From his experience \ncame a deep\u0014\n           conviction and a course of life which placed him on the \nroll of Baptist\u0014\n           heroes.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Eventually, Waller and the Baptists could rejoice in the \nsecuring of full\u0014\n           religious freedom in the laws of Virginia and in the \ndocuments of the\u0014\n           New Republic. They were freedom fighters who lived to see \nvictories\u0014\n           won. In Waller's long service as an evangelist it was \nestimated that he\u0014\n           had been the instrument that led some 5,000 persons into a \nsaving\u0014\n           knowledge of Jesus Christ. When he died on the Fourth of \nJuly of 1801,\u0014\n           Waller already had secured a lasting place in Baptist \nhistory.\u0014\n         \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFull article: My Documents\\John Waller, Freedom Fighter\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES AS SOCIAL GOSPEL",
    "words": "The majority of us have heard Luther's famous quote that the biblical \nbook of James is nothing more than an Epistle of straw. When \noriginally written by Luther, the quote was set in contrast to his \naffirmations of the Gospel of John, the first Epistle of John, St. \nPaul's Epistles and St. Peter's Epistles. Of the latter group, Luther \nis quoted as saying, \"[these] are the books that show you Christ and \nteach you all that is necessary and good for you to know, even though \nyou were never to see or hear any other book or doctrine.\" (Works of \nMartin Luther, Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1932, copyrighted by \nthe United Lutheran Church in America, vol. 6. pp. 443-444). In \ncontrast, Luther thought James had nothing of the nature of the \nGospel about it. These remarks appear in his 1522 preface to the New \nTestament, but were dropped in his 1545 revision. It seems Luther \neither had a change of heart or received so much flack about these \ncomments he felt the need to remove them in his later revision. But \nwhy did Luther hold such extreme negative attitudes about this \ncanonical book?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor entire article, see: Word/MyDocuments/James As Social Gospel\u0014",

    "words": "Jews Warn Catholic Bishops on Interfaith Talks\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Kevin Eckstrom and Kristen May\u0014\nAugust 24, 2009  \u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON (RNS) Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders \nwarned the nations Catholic bishops that a June statement on whether \nJews should convert to Christianity could make Jewish-Catholic \ndialogue untenable.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn June, the bishops resurrected a 2002 statement on Jewish-Christian \nrelations that they called insufficiently precise and potentially \nmisleading about whether Christians should share the gospel with \nJews.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 2002 statement had said targeting Jews for conversion was no \nlonger theologically acceptable because Jews already dwell in a \nsaving covenant with God. This summer, however, the bishops said \nthat document had raised many questions among U.S. Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn an attempt to clarify their own position, the bishops said the \nchurch is always giving witness to the following of Christ, to which \nall are implicitly invited. The bishops also said the fulfillment \nof the covenant God established with Israel is found only in Jesus \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter released Thursday (Aug. 20), a coalition of Jewish groups \nsaid they may have to withdraw from ongoing interfaith dialogue if \nthere is an explicit or implicit understanding that Jews must \nbecome Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nA declaration of this sort is antithetical to the very essence of \nJewish-Christian dialogue as we have understood it in the \npost-Vatican II era, said the letter from Orthodox, Conservative and \nReform rabbis, as well as the Anti-Defamation League and the American \nJewish Committee.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe letterthe first collective Jewish response to the bishops June \nstatementseemed to indicate particular angst over the idea that the \nJewish covenant with God is no longer valid.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis appears to posit that the Mosaic covenant is obsolete and \nJudaism no longer has a reason to exist, the Jewish leaders said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs part of their June statement, the bishops reaffirmed longstanding \nteaching that God does not regret, repent of, or change his mind \nabout the covenant he established with the Jews through Abraham and \nMoses, but said Jesus fulfills Gods revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, said the bishops are still examining the letter.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatholic-Jewish dialogue has been important to the U.S. bishops for \nalmost 50 years, she said. The bishops have just received the \nletter and currently are studying it.\u0014",

Some hold that in his preincarnate state Christ went \nand preached through Noah to the wicked generation of that time. 2. \nOthers argue that between his death and resurrection Christ went to \nthe prison where fallen angels are incarcerated and there preached to \nthe angels who are said to have left their proper state and married \nhuman women during Noah's time (cf. Ge 6:1-4; 2Pe 2:4; Jude 6). The \n\"sons of God\" in Ge 6:2, 4 are said to have been angels, as they are \nin Job 1:6; 2:1 (see NIV text note). The message he preached to these \nevil angels was probably a declaration of victory. 3. Still others \nsay that between death and resurrection Christ went to the place of \nthe dead and preached to the spirits of Noah's wicked contemporaries. \nWhat he proclaimed may have been the gospel, or it may have been a \ndeclaration of victory for Christ and doom for his hearers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe weakness of the first view is that it does not relate the event \nto Christ's death and resurrection, as the context seems to do. The \nmain problem with the second view is that it assumes sexual relations \nbetween angels and women, and such physical relations may not be \npossible for angels since they are spirits. A major difficulty with \nthe third view is that the term \"spirits\" is only used of human \nbeings when qualifying terms are added. Otherwise the term seems \nrestricted to supernatural beings.\u0014",

    "words": "Jeffrey Dahmer, 1991\u0014\n\u0014\nHis surname is now synonymous with \"monster.\" Yet at least 17 times, \nJeffrey Dahmer was able to get young men and boys to come home with \nhim. In one incident, on the night of May 27, 1991 in Milwaukee, a \n14-year-old managed to escape and wandered into the streets with \nDahmer in pursuit. When the cops started asking questions, Dahmer was \nable to convince the police that it was merely a lovers' quarrel. The \npolice conclusion: \"Intoxicated Asian, naked male. Was returned to \nhis sober boyfriend.\" Like the dozen before him and four after, the \nyoung man was eventually strangled and dismembered. Dahmer kept his \nskull as a souvenir. He stored parts of his victims in vats. He ate \nthem. Dahmer's crimes raised several inchoate fears and revulsions: \ncannibalism, sexuality, class and race  most of his victims were \npoor, African-American, Asian or Latino, while Dahmer was white. \nAfter his arrest on July 22, 1991, Dahmer was sentenced to nearly a \nthousand years in jail. He was killed by an inmate in November 1994.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor months residents sensed that all was not right at the Oxford \nApartments, a 49-unit low-rise building on Milwaukee's crime-infested \nwest side. A power saw buzzed at odd hours. The putrid odor of \nrotting meat flooded the corridors. Occasionally, a tenant would hear \na cry or the thump of a falling object on the second floor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen police entered Apartment 213 last week, they were shocked to \nfind a freezer covered with Polaroid photographs of mutilated men. \nInside they discovered two severed heads and one more stashed in the \nrefrigerator. A closet and filing cabinet yielded more human skulls \nand a kettle containing what are thought to be decomposing hands and \na male genital organ. Various body parts were strewn around the \napartment, as were bottles of acid and chemical preservatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Hannibal (\"the Cannibal\") Lecter, the brilliant mass-murdering \npsychiatrist in The Silence of the Lambs, the creature who apparently \nturned Apartment 213 into a private slaughterhouse is an unassuming \n31-year-old ne'er-do-well named Jeffrey L. Dahmer. The pale, \nsandy-haired Dahmer, who was recently fired from his job at a \nMilwaukee chocolate factory, immediately confessed to 11 murders. \nPolice believe he may have actually committed as many as 17 during \nthe past 10 years. Most of the apartment victims were black males, \nand some were homosexuals. One trait Dahmer seems to share with the \nfictional Lecter is an apparent penchant for cannibalism: he told \npolice he had saved a human heart \"to eat later.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout much of his life, there were warning signs that something \nwas terribly wrong with Jeffrey Dahmer. His stepmother, Shari Dahmer, \nwho was interviewed last week by the Cleveland Plain Dealer before \nclamming up to the press, said that \"when he was young, he liked to \nuse acid to scrape the meat off dead animals.\" At 18, Jeffrey \nwitnessed the bitter divorce of his parents and lived with his mother \nin Bath Township, Ohio. But one day, said Shari Dahmer, his mother \ndisappeared with his younger brother, leaving Jeffrey with nothing. \nOften Dahmer attempted to sedate himself with alcohol. \"He was a \ngentle person, but when he got drunk it would take four policemen to \nhold him down,\" said Shari Dahmer.\u0014",

Where he was going in \na few minutes, he would not need them--new and glorious garments \nwould be his. But here on earth, some poor folk might find his old \ngarments helpful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowd had come to see one of the burnings that were all too \ncommon in the sixteenth century. They would not be disappointed. And \nthey heard words of encouragement, too. As James moved toward the \nstake, he urged the bystanders to cling to the truth and to seal the \ncause of Christ with their blood if need be--just as he was now \ndoing. The young man seemed completely confident.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the sheriff's servants was cut to his heart by this talk. He \ncursed James' faith, calling it heresy and he mocked James as a \nmadman. To England's ruling elite as well as to the sheriff's \nservant, James was a heretic. He held Reformation views during the \nreign of Queen Mary Tudor of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier, when the bishop of Norwich learned of James' \"heresy,\" he \nordered him arrested. James wandered about to escape capture, but an \ninformant turned him in. The bishop of Norwich convinced James to \nrecant and gave him a piece of money to seal the bargain.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe money burned the young man's conscience. Although he knew it \nmeant a cruel death, he came back to the bishop and threw down the \ncoin, saying he had been wrong to accept it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop attempted to talk James out of the stand he was taking; \nbut this time, there was no swaying him. He was given a mock trial \nand condemned to be burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, August 2, 1555 the sheriff's men fastened James to a \nstake at Bury, England. As the fire was lit, he praised and glorified \nGod. The flame rose around his body.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that moment, according to John Foxe's account, the servant who had \nmocked James and called him mad went mad himself. Imitating James, he \nripped off his clothes and shoes in front of the people, exclaiming, \n\"Thus did James Abbes, the true servant of God, who is saved but I am \ndamned.\" He repeated this line again and again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, as Foxe tells it, \"The sheriff had him secured, and made him \nput his clothes on, but no sooner was he alone, than he tore them \noff, and exclaimed as before. Being tied in a cart, he was conveyed \nto his master's house, and in about half a year he died...\"\u0014",

    "title": "JESUS AND HIS VIEW TOWARD WOMEN",
    "words": "The Talmud said that a woman should address her husband as lord or \nmaster.  When they went somewhere together, she walked, and he \nrode.  When they both walked together, she trailed behind him.  She \nwas listed as his property, along with everything else he owned.  As \na matter of fact, all the regulations about relating to a wife or \ndivorcing her are listed in the property section of Leviticus and not \nthe moral law section.  The man could divorce his wife if she ruined \nhis breakfast or any other meal.  He could send her away with no \nexplanation as to why, but she could never leave him.  A woman had \nvalue only as she related to a husband and in her role as a mother  \nespecially a mother of sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rabbis tightened up the already rigid restrictions about women, \nand in Jesus' day four social norms were practiced with regard to \nthat.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. \tWomen were shunned in public social contact.  Engage not in too \nmuch conversation with women was the official word.  This applied to \none's own wife.  How much more did it apply to another woman?\u0014\n2. \tWomen were not to be publicly taught the Torah, the first five \nbooks of the Bible.  That was not true in the Old Testament period, \nbut it was in Jesus' day.  One passage from the Talmud said, May the \nwords of Torah be burned than that they should be handed over to \nwomen.  That sounds like some fundamentalist preachers in the \nSouthern Baptist Convention today, doesn't it?\u0014\n3. \tWomen were restricted from orally communicating the Torah to \nothers, even to children.  This restriction applied to publicly \nreading Scripture even in the synagogue and to pronouncing the \nbenediction after a meal at home.\u0014\n4. \tWomen did not have the right to bear public witness in judicial \ncases.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut just in case you think this was 2,000 years ago and is not \nrelevant to today, get Time magazine (May 11, 1998 issue) and look on \npage 34 where you will see that last June in Jerusalem, Orthodox \nJewish Rabbi Yosef warned that men should not walk between two \nwomen, just as they should not walk between two donkeys, lest they \ntake on the attributes of these lesser beasts.  Now please \nunderstand that this is not the attitude of most conservative Jews \ntoday, but it is the attitude of Orthodox Jews, and they are the ones \nJesus was dealing with.   \u0014\n\t\u0014\n\tWhen viewed against this background, I don't need to tell you, I \nwould assume, that Jesus was a rank liberal and a raunchy radical.  \nHis attitude and his behavior toward women comes as a breath of fresh \nair in an arid desert.\u0014",

A student at \nKnox College, Toronto, he offered himself for missionary service. \nOther Christian students found him too narrow and ragged him. \nConsequently, he vowed that he would go it alone and apart from his \nfamily; he remained a loner all his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Rosalind Bell-Smith became a Christian, she determined that she \nwould never marry a man who had anything less than her own complete \nzeal for the Lord. She was quite certain that she would recognize \nquickly the man for her. She met Jonathan Goforth and within a couple \ndays was quite sure. The two were married.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoforth's interest was in China. He attempted to join the China \nInland Mission, but decided that his Presbyterian thinking was \nincompatible with the Brethren ideas espoused by Hudson Taylor. And \nso, with the support of a newly-formed Presbyterian mission, he and \nhis wife set out for China in 1888 and settled temporarily in \nCheefoo. His appointed coworker, James Frazer Smith followed a few \nmonths behind. Two weeks after Smith arrived, on this day, September \n13, 1888, Goforth and Smith began a tour of the North Honan region of \nChina. This is where they intended to work, and they felt they must \nget a feel for the region.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorth Honan had flooded badly the year before and the damage was \nstill being addressed. Smith and Goforth observed first-hand the \nefforts to repair the breaches made by the Yellow River. Altogether \nthe two traveled over 1,200 miles, assessing the entire region. They \ngathered whatever data they could during their two and a half month \ntour and observed the Chinese in their home environment. In December \nmore missionaries arrived and soon four workers were busy translating \nand preaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoforth had success in planting churches and was associated with \nrevival among Korean Christians in the early 1900s and with revival \nin Manchuria in 1908. The Presbyterians, however, dismissed him; and \nGoforth, Rosalind and their five children became missionary gypsies, \npreaching across China with no fixed abode.\u0014\n\u0014\nHudson Taylor and Jonathan Goforth also clashed. Despite the great \nneed of all Chinese to hear of Christ, which no combination of \nmissions could hope to fully meet, Hudson Taylor issued a stiff \nprotest that Goforth was invading North Honan, a region he had \nearmarked for the China Inland Mission. Goforth respected Taylor's \nmethods and imitated them. However, neither he nor the Presbyterians \nsaw fit to comply with the great man's complaint. Thus Goforth indeed \nwent forth in the pages of Christian history as a great pioneer, but \nlike others also given unusual gifts, not always easy to get along \nwith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nAnderson, Gerald H.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions.

    "words": "September 12, 1805 \u0014\nJohn J. Herzog's Huge Church Encyclopedia\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of a church-historian's valuable resources is the Schaff-Herzog \nEncyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. John Jacob Herzog--the Herzog of \nthe encyclopedia title--was born on this day, September 12, 1805, \nprobably in Basel, Switzerland. The Herzog family had recently moved \nthere from Wurtemburg. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was left an orphan at a young age and relatives raised him. He \nshowed himself an apt pupil of the sciences and then of theology, \nstudying with such notable individuals as the mathematician Christoph \nBernoulli and with theologians Schleiermacher and Neander. He became \nan educator at Lausanne, specializing in historical theology. John \nissued works on several of the major reformers, including Zwingli, \nCalvin and Ocolampadius.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian thought often needs defenders because scholarly and \npseudo-scholarly attacks never cease. John stood for the faith \nagainst damaging influences, including attempts to rewrite Christ's \nlife so as to rob Him of his deity. When Plymouth Brethren began \nspreading their message in Germany, John opposed them because he \nconsidered their teaching as too individualistic for the good of the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the government made demands that overstepped the bounds of \nchurch and state, John refused to go along. He resigned his position \nat Lausanne and worked as a private scholar for much of 1846 and \n1847. He was glad to accept an invitation to teach at Halle, because \nhe had had little to live on during the previous months. At Halle, he \ndeveloped a close relationship with the well-known Protestant \ntheologian Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe same year that John resigned his job at Lausanne, Roman Catholic \nscholars issued the first volume of the Catholic Encyclopedia. \nProtestants immediately felt the need to produce an encyclopedia of \ntheir own to counterbalance the Catholic version. Political troubles \nslowed down the project and its editor died. Tholuck recommended \nHerzog for the vacant position.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was liked by all parties--in part because of his generous \ntreatment of Reformation figures. He got the job. His vast knowledge \nof church history made him the perfect editor. In fact, he wrote 500 \nof the articles that appeared in the first edition. Later, he was \nco-editor of a second edition.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhilip Schaff was well-acquainted with John, who asked him to adapt \nthe encyclopedia for American use. Schaff agreed to undertake the \nhuge project. And that is how we got the famous and useful \nSchaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Herzog died in \n1882.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nFreudenberg, Matthias. \"Herzog, Johann Jakob.\" Kirchenlexicon. \u0014\n\"Herzog, Johann Jakob.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch, edited by F.

    "words": "September 14, 407 \u0014\nJohn Chrysostom Died on Forced March\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause he spoke out boldly against the sins of Constantinople, John \nthe Patriarch of Constantinople found himself in exile in the Taurus \nmountains. Several of the elite had taken offense at his sermons \nwhich showed up their shame. Among them was the Empress Eudoxia, who \npulled strings to get him banished.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe winter before his death, John suffered dreadfully in the \nmountains. No amount of wood on the fire and no pile of blankets on \nhis bed kept his shivering body warm. Still he wrote strong letters \nto the people under his care. Trained as a lawyer, his letters and \nsermons were masterpieces of religious literature. Although he was \nabsent from them, church folk continued to take direction from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo John's enemies, his power still seemed to be too great, his \npresence still too close. Although he was old and frail, his health \nundermined by years of stern living, they decided to move him up by \nthe Euxine (Black) Sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey promised a reward to the guards who transferred him. The reward \nwould be increased according to how quickly they made the transfer. \nThere could not have been much doubt in the soldiers' minds that the \ncourt wanted John walked to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so his guards showed him little mercy. Relentlessly they hurried \nhis tottering legs forward. Movement was torture. Five miles beyond \nCamona in Pontus (now in Turkey) he spent his last night alive in a \nchurch dedicated to another martyr, Bishop Basiliscus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat night, Basiliscus supposedly appeared to John in a dream, \nassuring him that on the morrow they would meet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe soldiers refused permission for him to have his devotions at the \nshrine the next morning. They hurried him on his way. But they had \ngone only about three miles when it became apparent John was dying. \nThey took him back to the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere, he asked for a white robe, which was given him. He gave away \nhis old clothes and surrounded by monks and nuns, raised himself up, \nsaying, \"Glory be to God for all things. Amen.\" Those were his last \nwords. He died on this day, September 14, 407. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after his death, the title \"Chrysostom,\" (golden mouth) was \nadded to his name. Eventually his remains were brought back to \nConstantinople where they received honor. He is remembered as one of \nthe greatest orators of all history, a saint honored in many \nchurches.

But Warren did not appear live on Friday, saying that he \nmade three separate hospital visits to three separate family members. \nPiper said that he still has 13 pages of questions to ask him about \nThe Purpose Driven Life, and they will set up something on video \"so \nyou can see me go after Rick Warren.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There are people who love to think  There are others who don't like \nto think.

His words don't \ncontrol my response or attitude.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reformed blogosphere experienced a miniature eruption after \nPiper's invitation.

He tried to dash \nback to his ship, but he wasn't quick enough. Swift-footed natives \ncaptured him. The missionary who had hoped to feast them with the \nGospel became their feast instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the inhabitants of scattered islands of the South Pacific heard \nthe news, they wept. John was greatly loved. One of the most \nsuccessful missionaries of modern times, he had learned their \nlanguages and customs and labored to uplift them morally, spiritually \nand economically.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo some, his success was surprising. After all, he had little \neducation, although he was a skilled metal worker. However, he was \npractical; and his skills, vision and commonsense found solutions to \nthe challenges he met.\u0014\n\u0014\nReared in a Christian family, he grew indifferent to the faith for \nsome years as a youth, but a sermon he heard aroused him from his \nspiritual lethargy. He became an active Christian worker and soon \noffered himself to the London Missionary Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith his newly-wed bride, he sailed to Tahiti. Although the London \nboard did not want him to trade or to sail the South seas, he did so \nanyway. At one point, he even built his own boat, The Messenger of \nPeace although he had never seen one built before. He navigated it \nacross hundreds of miles of open sea. As a result of his initiative, \nhe planted churches not only in Tahiti, but in the Samoan Islands, \nRaratonga and numerous other islands of the Pacific. He was able to \naffirm that every known island along a 2,000 mile line had received \nthe Gospel. He left Polynesian ministers at several of these outposts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a visit back to England, he roused enormous interest wherever he \nspoke. A book he published about his work sold well. Fresh funds \npoured in to enable him to make further mission trips.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Hebrides was a new region for him. No other missionary had \nvisited those parts. Its inhabitants were in a mood of revenge \nbecause of cruelties perpetrated against them by a trading ship. \nUnaware of the good that John meant to do them, they chased him, as \nwe have seen, and killed and ate him.

After the delegation leaves, Jesus tells the \ncrowd his estimate of John - he is the greatest prophet because he, \nlike Elijah, was the messenger to prepare the way for the Messiah. \nHowever, the last person in the covenant is greater than John of the \nold covenant.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHANN VON STAUPITZ, LUTHER'S CONFESSOR",
    "words": "December 28, 1524 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohann von Staupitz, Luther's Confessor\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIf it had not been for Dr. Staupitz, I should have sunk in hell,\" \nsaid Martin Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann von Staupitz was the vicar of the Augustinian order at the \nUniversity of Wittenberg when Luther responded to an invitation by \nFrederick the Wise by coming there to teach. At the time Luther was \nstruggling with the need to confess completely everything he had ever \ndone wrong. He wore Johann von Staupitz out, trying to remember every \nsin that his mind would try to cover up. On at least one occasion, he \nconfessed for six hours straight.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann tried to explain God's grace to Luther. Surrender to the love \nof God, he counseled. Luther should lose himself in God, he said. He \nwas making religion too difficult. All he needed to do was love God. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Luther was tormented by fears and doubts. \"I was myself more than \nonce driven to the very abyss of despair so that I wished I had never \nbeen created. Love God? I hated him!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't understand it!\" replied the longsuffering Johann when Luther \nreported this latest line of reasoning to him. He reminded Luther \nthat Christ died to remit our sins. However, Luther was so afraid of \nChrist, the judge, that he could not turn to him for relief.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a daring move, Johann resigned as Bible teacher and appointed \nLuther in his place. Now Luther had to study the Bible for himself \nand counsel others from it. Luther had not dealt much with the Bible; \nthe theology courses he attended emphasized writings other than the \nscriptures. Lecturing on Romans and Galatians, Luther arrived at his \nworld-changing insights on faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Luther broke with the Roman confessional system which had \nbeen of no help to him. He renounced penances and indulgences. The \nteachings of the Bible became his guides in place of church fathers, \nconfessors, or popes.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann never left the Roman Church. However, he remained friendly \ntoward Luther. He was present when Cajetan ordered Luther to recant. \nShortly afterward, he released Luther from his Augustinian vows. \nStill, he wrote words of encouragement to Luther. \"The world hates \nthe truth. By such hate Christ was crucified, and what there is in \nstore for you today if not the cross I do not know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one point, Johann relayed Luther's position to Rome for the \nreformer. Pressure was put on Johann to shut Luther up. Johann \nresigned rather than attempt it. Rome ordered him to recant. He \nhesitated. He had never taught the things he was told to abjure \n(renounce). In the end, he accepted the pope as his judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his last letter to Luther, Johann told him he still loved him \ndearly. But he implored him to remember the weak. \"Do not denounce \npoints of indifference which can be held in sincerity,\" he advised, \nadding, \"We owe much to you, Martin.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann died at Salzburg on this day, December 28, 1524. He had \nwritten books on predestination, faith and love. Pope Paul IV placed \nthese on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1559.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland.

    "title": "JOHN WYCLIFFE ON HIS DEATH BED",
    "words": "December 30, 1384 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe on His Death Bed\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWord that John Wycliffe was dying whipped like storm winds across \nEngland. Now on this day, December 30, 1384, clerics--many of them \nhis enemies--crowded into his room at Lutterworth. If they hoped to \nhear some last word or a recantation from him, they were \ndisappointed. John could not speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days earlier, he had grown numb and collapsed while saying mass. \nWhen he came to from this, his second stroke, he was paralyzed and \nunable to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was the most famous priest of his day. His learning was immense. \nHe had been a leading scholar at Oxford and a chaplain to the King of \nEngland. More to the point, he spoke out boldly against the errors of \nthe popes, the organizational hierarchy of the Roman Church, and the \ncorruption of the clergy in his day. He criticized not only the \norganization of the medieval church but its theology as well and \nargued for a return to the Scriptures. Pastors should live lives of \nsimplicity and holiness, he taught, shepherding their flocks \n(people)--not plundering them.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the people in England were to know the truth, John reasoned that \nthey must have the Word of God in their own language. Under his \ndirection, the Bible was translated into English for the first time, \nalthough the job was not completed by his associates until 1395, \neleven years after his death. Repeatedly condemned and burned by \nchurch authorities, copies of Wycliffe's Bible continued in use for \nover a century, until printed Bibles took their place. This work \ngreatly influenced William Tyndale who made the first printed \ntranslation of the New Testament in English.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can still puzzle out the meaning of John Wycliffe's words. Here is \nhow he describes the transfiguration: \"And aftir sixe dayes Jhesus \ntook Petre, and James, and John and ledith [led] hem [them] by hem \nselve aloone in to an high hil ; and he is transfigurid before hem. \nAnd his clothis ben maad [were made] schynynge [shining] and white \nful moche [much] as snow, and which maner clothis a fullere [cloth \nworker], or walkere [worker] of cloth, may not make white on erthe. \nAnd Helye [Elijah] with Myses apperide [appeared] to hem, and thei \nweren [were] spekynge [speaking] with Jhesu.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wycliffe died of his stroke on the last day of the year. The \nreligious authorities had never excommunicated him because they \nfeared public opinion--the people loved John and his fame was \ninternational. So he was buried in consecrated soil. But about thirty \nyears later, the Council of Constance revenged itself on his \ncriticism by condemning his teachings and ordering his bones to be \ndug up and burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the burning of such a man's bones could not end his influence. As \nJohn Foxe said in his book of martyrs, \"though they digged up his \nbody, burnt his bones, and drowned his ashes, yet the Word of God and \nthe truth of his doctrine, with the fruit and success thereof, they \ncould not burn; which yet to this day...doth remain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from earlier Christian History Institute stories. \u0014\nBowie, Walter Russell.

But years would pass \nbefore the lines took their place in worship services around the \nworld.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1861, a publisher rediscovered the words. He asked John Bacchus \nDykes to furnish him with a tune. It made sense for him to turn to \nJohn who had a natural aptitude for music (he graduated with a music \nmaster that same year). John had been a church organist since he was \nten-years-old and was co-founder and president of the Cambridge \nUniversity Musical Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn accepted the words. Within thirty minutes he wrote the tune \n\"Nicea,\" which carried the praise of the Trinity to Christians \neverywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty\u0014\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; \u0014\nHoly, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty! \u0014\nGod in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year after he composed this famous tune, John was appointed vicar \nof St. Oswald. This put him in charge of a parish. He was thirty-nine \nand had already held several lesser church posts. John's people came \nto love him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis bishop, however, did not care for John's views. John was \n\"high-church.\" This meant that he stressed the continuity of the \nChurch of England with the Roman Catholic church from which it had \nsprung. He believed that church and monarchy had divine rights which \nwere being washed away by modern changes. There was long-lasting \ndisagreement between John and his bishop because of this.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Baring, his bishop, refused to give John any help with his \nlarge parish unless he would agree to conduct his services in a more \n\"low-church\" style. He had to get rid of colorful collars, stop \nburning incense and not turn his back on his congregation at times \nduring the service. John wouldn't agree and so he had to handle the \nwhole parish himself, a job which exhausted him.\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, in addition to his regular duties, he managed to write \nover 300 hymn tunes. These included some for our favorite hymns, such \nas \"Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee\" and less familiar songs such as \n\"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand\" and \"Lead, Kindly Light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWorn out with his labors and constant friction with his bishop, John \ndied on this day, January 22, 1876. He was just fifty-three years \nold. Those who loved and admired him, raised 10,000 to support his \nwidow and children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\"All Things Bright and Beautiful; the Authors.\" \nhttp://www.concerthall.ca/authors.html\u0014\n\"Dykes, John Bacchus.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nOxford University, 1997.\u0014\n\"Holy, Holy, Holy.\" http://www.camalott.com/~ckirk/holyholyholy.html\u0014\n\"Holy, Holy, Holy.\" Crusader Hymns and Hymn Stories.

    "words": "February 4, 1555 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Rogers, 1st of Many Martyrs\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Rogers burned to death at a stake at Smithfield, England on this \nMonday morning, February 4,1555. Among the onlookers who encouraged \nhim were his own children. What monstrous crime had earned him this \ncruel death?\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn about 1500, Rogers was educated at Cambridge. He became a \nCatholic priest and accepted a position in the church at the time \nthat the Protestant Reformation was in full swing. His conscience \ntold him that certain teachings of his established Church were wrong \nand he resigned, moving to Antwerp, Holland, where he ministered to \nEnglish merchants.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Holland, he became friends with William Tyndale, a reformer who \nwas translating the Bible into English. Tyndale converted Rogers to \nProtestant views and Rogers married. Nine months later, Tyndale went \nto prison; he would be executed as a heretic. But Tyndale left a \nprecious manuscript in John Rogers's keeping. This was his English \ntranslation of the books from Joshua to Chronicles which had not yet \nbeen printed.\u0014\n\u0014\nRogers was determined to see that Tyndale's valuable work was not \nlost. For the next twelve months he labored to put together a \ncomplete Bible. Its text was based on Tyndale and Coverdale, and its \ntwo thousand notes were borrowed from the writings of dozens of \ndifferent reformers who were active on the Continent.\u0014\n\u0014\nTyndale had been declared a heretic, and his name could not go on the \nBible. Rogers could not honestly claim the work as his own, and so he \nused a pseudonym--Thomas Matthews. When Bishop Cranmer saw a copy of \nthe new Bible, he was so excited that he asked Chancellor Thomas \nCromwell to see if the king would license it. Henry VIII did, and the \nMatthew Bible became the first officially authorized version in the \nEnglish language. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter sickly Edward VI became king of England, John Rogers returned \nfrom the continent, fetching his wife to England. He was given high \npositions in the Church of England. Regretably, he was one of those \nwho agreed to burn poor, insane Joan of Kent to death (some of her \nclaims were blasphemous). He was urged to show her mercy because some \nday he might need it himself, but did not listen.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdward VI died. Mary, a Roman Catholic, became queen. John Rogers \npreached a stirring message, urging his congregation to remain loyal \nto Reformation principles. Mary's Catholic bishops questioned him \nabout this sermon, but he answered well and was released.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when a Catholic was appointed to speak at Paul's Cross, \nchurchgoers rioted. The Mayor was present and could not restore \norder. The mob attacked Bishop Bonner, an eminent supporter of Queen \nMary. Rogers shouted to the crowd to calm down and helped hustle \nBonner to safety. Although no harm was done, the Queen's council was \nupset. They instructed the Mayor to prove he could keep order, or \nsaid he must give up his office. The Mayor arrested Rogers, the one \nwho had saved Bonner's life. Rogers spent over a year in prison, \nquestioned several times about his beliefs by Lord Chancellor Stephen \nGardiner.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Foxe's Book of Martyrs, when the sentence of death was \npassed, Rogers begged Gardiner to let him speak a few words to his \nwife. Gardiner refused, telling Rogers he was not legally married \nbecause he had once been a priest. However, as Rogers walked to the \nstake, singing psalms, he saw his wife at the roadside, holding their \nyoungest baby, whom he had never met.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the stake, Rogers was offered a pardon if only he would recant his \nbeliefs and return to the Catholic church. He refused. The fire was \nlit and Rogers washed his hands in the flames as though he did not \nfeel them. He was the first of many martyrs in Mary's reign.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nChester, Joseph Lemuel. John Rogers; the compiler of the first \nauthorized English Bible...

The three-story wallof water dissolved \ncoastal towns, dry-docked boats on the roofs of building and shuffled \nhouses like playing cards. There were so many aftershocks that people \nstopped diving under tables. Those who made it safely to higher \nground waited in the dark, in the cold, in lines that stretched for \nhours for water and food. In a society seen as the most stoic on \nearth, the closest thing to chaos was a man cutting in line.\"  \n3/11/11 earthquake and tsunami struck.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The 9.0 quake that hit Japan on March 11 was powerful enough to \nshift the earth on its axis and make it spin a little faster, \nshortening the day by 1.8 millionths of a second. It shoved the \nisland nation one parking space to the east. But what felt like the \nend was just the beginning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             Aftermath: How Japan \nWill Recover from the Quake \u0014\n                                                              By \nHannah Beech / Akaushi \u0014\n\n                                                                             \n3/21/11, Time\u0014\n\u0014\nA sense of order, moreover, is not confined just to government \nmanuals. In the wake of the disaster, there has been no looting, no \nrioting. Even as people hoping for food, water and fuel wait in \nkilometer-long lines in freezing weather  sometimes without success \n tempers have not flared. Rationing of basic supplies has been \naccepted with few complaints. The assumption is that everybody has to \nshare the pain equally. At Masuda Middle School, one of hundreds of \nemergency centers housing some 450,000 homeless people, the \nloudspeaker emitted a crescendo of friendly announcements. \"Please \ncome enjoy your piping hot rice now,\" went one. \"Please be alert to \nthe fact that the fish roe is a bit spicy, so it may not be suitable \nfor small children,\" went another. In the emergency shelter at \nKoizumi Middle School, people not used to wearing shoes indoors \nconstructed origami boxes made of newspaper in which to nestle their \nfootwear. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven the expressions of grief in Japan's worst affected zone have \nbeen restrained. For foreigners used to the keening anguish of \nnatural disasters, the hushed sorrow must be mystifying. In Japan, \ntears do fall, but less noisily. When Masahira Kasamatsu, 76, found \nout after three harrowing days that his missing daughter was safe, he \nmerely nodded and repeated slowly, \"She's O.K., she's O.K.\" That \nmight sound overly subdued, but I understand it. When I would see my \nJapanese grandmother after a long absence, we would never hug, merely \nexchange a quick squeeze of the hand. My affection for her was no \nless for the lack of an embrace. \u0014\n\u0014\nI thought of my grandmother as I walked the apocalyptic wastelands \nthat had been tidy seaports just days before. Wheelchairs were some \nof the few recognizable jumbles of metal in the miles upon miles of \ndetritus. Japan is the most rapidly aging society on earth. Because \nof a low fertility rate, the country's population is expected to \nshrink one-quarter by 2050. Many of those who perished in the quake \nand tsunami were simply too old to escape. Nursing homes are among \nthe places that most urgently require aid. Elderly Japanese who \nevacuated to emergency shelters relied on the younger generation for \nhelp. This is a nation where Confucian respect for the aged holds. \n\"If it wasn't for the young people in our family, we wouldn't have \nknown anything,\" says 84-year-old Kimi Sakawaki, whose son surfed the \nInternet at home to find the evacuation center at Yonezawa gymnasium.\u0014\n \u0014\nStill, the elderly who survived the March 11 catastrophe know better \nthan any other Japanese how quickly their homeland can revive itself. \nMy grandmother used to recall the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo during \nWorld War II, which reduced half the capital to rubble. The pictures \nof that era bear a haunting resemblance to the images coming out of \nnortheastern Japan today. Yet within two generations, Japan had \ntransformed itself from a defeated land into the world's second \nlargest economy. Incomes were spread relatively equally, with little \npoverty to speak of. Japan took on a contented, comfortable air. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps too much so. For while there are lessons to be learned by \nother nations from both Japan's postwar success and its resilience in \nthe face of disaster, rigid hewing to the rules and the suppression \nof individual creativity for the common good can go too far. They \nmay, indeed, have undermined Japan's economic miracle. (Just try to \norder a salad with the dressing on the side in Japan and watch the \nconsternation of the waiter at such an unorthodox request.) After the \nbubble economy of the 1980s collapsed in 1991, Japan entered a long \neconomic slumber, from which it has yet to fully wake. Last year, \nChina surpassed Japan to take the spot as the world's No. 2 economy.\u0014",

    "title": "JOHN BROADDUS TAUGHT SERMON MAKING",
    "words": "March 16, 1895\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Broadus Taught Sermon-Making\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn A. Broadus was famed as a preacher able to present the truths of \nthe Bible so simply that the simplest listeners could understand \nthem. In fact, the first person he led to Christ was a simple-minded \nman who ever afterward said to him, \"Thankee, John\" whenever he saw \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1827, John became a Christian at sixteen when a friend urged \nhim to claim Christ's promise \"All that the Father giveth me shall \ncome to me. And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\" \nJohn did. Thereafter he witnessed, taught Sunday school, lived out \nhis faith and gained what education he could.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe planned to become a doctor. However, a sermon on Christ's parable \nof the talents convinced him he should study to become a minister. He \nwas a minister who did not pastor a great deal, however, \nconcentrating more on seminary teaching, although at one church he \nbaptized 241 converts, including a girl who later became famous as a \nmissionary--Lottie Moon. Although he often filled pulpits, preached \nat conferences and to troops during the Civil War, his life's work \nwas as a professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in \nwhich he taught homiletics (the art of preaching). He often told his \nstudents, \"If you forget everything else I have told you, don't \nforget to treat the Scripture in a commonsense way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust how conscientious he was is shown by the fact that he once \nrevised his entire course notes for a single blind student. He \nstudied the sermons of the most effective preachers of all time to \nlearn how they should be put together. When it looked as if the \nseminary would go under because of the Civil War, John said to the \nother professors, \"...perhaps the seminary may die, but let us \nresolve to die first.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn stressed the importance of preaching: \"We know that preaching \ndeserves the highest excellence since it is the chosen instrument of \nthe Savior of the world, who himself came preaching.\" He worked hard \non his own sermons, wearing a path into the grass near the school, \npacing as he fixed key points in mind. He learned what many pastors \nnever learn, to preach so as to persuade listeners to take spiritual \naction based on the truths presented.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an example of his style, take these words from his sermon He Ever \nLiveth to Intercede: \"Here then is hope for us. 'If any man sin,' \nmuch as he ought to deplore it, he need not despair. Our advocate \nwith the Father ever liveth to make intercession for them that come \nunto God through him, and through him we may find mercy. And here is \nno encouragement to sin, but the very contrary. If we truly trust in, \ntruly love our interceding Lord, we shall be supremely anxious for \nhis dear sake to turn from sin, to live for him who died for us; yea \nwho ever lives as our Savior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day March 16, 1895 John Albert Broadus died. True to his \nword, he had done all in his power to keep the seminary alive and it \nlives today. His Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew is one of his \nbetter-known writings and his book On the Preparation and Delivery of \nSermons was widely used as a textbook for decades.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nArmitage, Thomas.

    "words": "March 21, 1747 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Newton Converted by Amazing Grace\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be at sea in a storm on an ocean liner can be thrilling. To face a \nstorm in a sailing vessel that is not seaworthy can be terrifying. \nThe boat in which John Newton sailed was in disrepair and its sails \nand rigging worn. A hard man who had often mocked God, John was \nconsidered impious even by his godless mates.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne night he was wakened by a violent wave crashing against the \nvessel. Water filled his cabin. Hurrying above, he found that timbers \nhad been ripped away. All were in terrible danger as the ship plunged \nthrough a furious storm. Men pumped desperately. Clothes and bedding \nwere stuffed into holes and boards nailed over them. John joined \nthose who were manning the pumps.\u0014\n\u0014\nToo exhausted to pump any longer, he was lashed to the wheel to try \nand steer the ship. The storm raged on and on. It was bitterly cold, \nthe more so since the men had few clothes left. In this desperate \nmoment John turned his eyes back over his life. Raised to the age of \nseven by a Christian mother, he had sought the Lord with fasts and \nprayers, but failing to find God he had become embittered. Despite \nthis, the Lord preserved him through many dangers. Once he was even \nmade a servant to slaves on the West coast of Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his heart he believed Christianity to be true. This brought him no \nconsolation. \"I concluded my sins were too great to be forgiven. I \nwaited with fear and impatience to receive my doom.\" But soon he \nheard the glad news that the ship was freed of water. \"I began to \npray...to think of that Jesus that I had so often derided; I \nrecollected his death: a death for sins not his own, but, as I \nremembered, for the sake of those who should put their trust in him.\" \nOn this day, March 21, 1747 (new calendar) a day he ever after \nobserved, John realized he needed a Savior to intercede for him with \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe snatched a free moment to open the Bible and begin to read. Though \nthe storm raged on for days, John spent every free moment in the \nScripture and praying for guidance. Hungry, cold, exhausted, the men \nkept the ship afloat. Only one died of exhaustion but the Captain \nmuttered that John ought to be thrown overboard like Jonah; his \nwickedness was the cause of all their misery, he claimed. Finally \nthey reached Ireland.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy then John was convinced the Lord had reached down and delivered \nhis soul. The story of the Prodigal Son seemed to exactly fit his \ncase. He never turned back from that day of salvation, although, not \nrealizing slavery was a sin, he worked six years as a slaver. He \nshowed kindness to the slaves he transported, held worship services \nfor his men and wrote hymns for them. Later he saw that slavery was \nwrong and became an abolitionist and a minister. Reflecting on his \nhard life, he wrote one of the world's most loved hymns: \"Amazing \ngrace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Christian History Institute's Glimpses #28.\u0014\nDemaray, Donald E.

    "words": "May 12, 1871 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Herschel Laid to Rest beside Newton\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Herschel was bullied at school so his parents had him tutored at \nhome. Born the only child of the astronomer William Herschel, who \ndiscovered Uranus and cataloged the objects of the northern sky, John \ngrew up knowing the most famous scientists of his day. The young man \nshot past his rivals in mathematics and science. At Cambridge, he \nplaced first in mathematics exams. At twenty-one, he became the \nyoungest person admitted to the Royal Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraveling the European continent, he met other great scientists. He \nwas so impressed with French mathematics that he translated three \nvolumes worth of papers into English. Abandoning Newton's clumsy \ncalculus, he adopted the clearer system created by Newton's German \nrival, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and convinced the English to do so, \ntoo. These were small potatoes for the man who became world-famous as \nan astronomer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Herschel had urged his son to enter the ministry, which he \nsaw as a safe civil service career. John balked. He tried his hand at \nlaw instead. When his father died, John used his inheritance to \nstrike out on his own. He sailed to South Africa with his wife, \nMargaret Stewart to scan the southern skies as William had scanned \nthe northern. The pair lived there for several years. The British \ngovernment offered John a salary, but he refused it, preferring to \nstick to his own researches.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith techniques learned from his father, John ground lenses and built \nsome of the largest telescopes in the world. Through these scopes, he \ncompared stellar magnitudes (true brightness) by contrasting them \nwith the moon's image which he reduced to a pinprick for contrast. \nJohn was fascinated with double stars. He logged over 1,200 new \nexamples. The importance of double stars (binaries) is that they \nrotate around each other. By observing their rotations, he could \ncalculate their masses and prove that Newton's laws applied to \ndistant stellar bodies.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn also cataloged many nebulae (gas clouds and galaxies) and showed \nthat most consisted of faint stars. He made calculations of the \ndensity of the Milky Way and tried to determine its structure. He \ntied together all of the day's astronomical knowledge in a popular \ntextbook. Space does not permit us to list all of his contributions \nto science and technology. For example, when he heard the first \nreport on daguerreotype photography, he was able to develop a similar \nprocess within a week and to create a completely new photographic \nprocesses afterwards.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was happy with his wife, Margaret Stewart. She was the daughter \nof a Scottish Presbyterian. Under Margaret's influence, John \nunderwent a genuine conversion experience. Men like John Herschel \ngive the lie to the notion that great scientists cannot be genuine \nChristians. His faith fired him with zeal for educational reforms in \nSouth Africa--zeal that spurred the development of public education \nin that nation. One reason that John wanted public education was \"to \nfit [students] for a higher state of existence, by teaching them \nthose [things] which connect them with their Maker and Redeemer.\" He \nsaid of the Bible, \"All human discoveries seem to be made only for \nthe purpose of confirming more and more strongly the truths that come \nfrom on high and are contained in the sacred writings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon his death, on this day, May 12, 1871, Sir John Herschel was laid \nto rest in Westminster Abbey alongside Sir Isaac Newton.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAsimov, Isaac.

    "words": "April 24, 1575 \u0014\n\u0014\nJacob Boehme's Influence Begins\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nImagine an untrained thinker who nevertheless had a major influence \non a host of notable philosophers and religious leaders. Jacob Boehme \nwas such a man. A shoemaker without college or university \ncredentials, he wrote twenty-nine books and tracts which set a lot of \nminds turning. Among them were thinkers, Pietists, and mystics not \nonly of his own age, but down to our own day. Henri Bergson's \nmetaphysics, George Fox's Quakerism, Hegel's dialectical theory, and \nHeidegger's existentialism each owe something to Boehme. Even mad \nNietzsche and gloomy Schopenhauer borrowed ideas from him. So did the \nliberal theologian Paul Tillich.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe aren't 100% sure, but the best information we have is that Jacob \nBoehme was born on this day, April 24, 1575 at Altseidenberg, near \nGoerlitz, Germany. The young man attended grade school. Then, because \nhe was too weak for heavier work, he was set to making shoes. He \nproved himself a sharp businessman who seems to have organized a \ncoalition that controlled the leather market.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoehme lived through the hardships of the terrible Thirty-Year's War \nthat decimated Germany. In 1600, a Lutheran pastor named Martin \nMoller came to Gorlitz where Boehme had married and was living. \nMoller sought to spur Christians to a deeper spiritual life and \nformed a group called \"Conventicle of God's Real Servants.\" Boehme \njoined. Soon afterward, he had a mystical experience in which he said \nhe understood all things to consist of either \"yes\" or \"no.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately he began writing. His first book, The Aurora was declared \nheretical by Lutheran authorities who joined with the local \ngovernment to ban him from producing anything else. For seven years \nhe obeyed this injunction. Then he began writing again. Eventually he \nwas asked to leave Gorlitz.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis most popular work was a collection of some of his devotional \ntracts, called The Way to Christ. In it he said, \"For what good does \nit do the soul to know the Way to God, if it will not walk in it, but \ngoes on in a contrary path? What good will it do the soul to comfort \nitself with the brotherhood of Christ, with His passion and death, \nand so flatter itself with the hopes of getting the inheritance \nthereby, if it will not enter into the brotherly birth, that it may \nbe a true child, born out of the Spirit of Christ, out of His \nsuffering, death and resurrection?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAt times, Boehme's adoration of Christ is very moving. \"...He \n[Christ] must get [his] form in us, or we shall not be in Heaven...\" \nBut at other times, his thought does not appear to follow the plain \nteaching of Scripture. His influence has been felt most strongly on \nthose who are considered most \"liberal\" and who have veered furthest \nfrom the evangelical position.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBeach, Edward A.\"Jakob Boehme.\" \nhttp://users.erols.com/nbeach/boehme.html.\u0014\nBehmen, Jacob (Jakob Boehme) \"Of True Repentance.\" Christian Classics \nElectronic Library. http://www.ccel.org/b/boehme/way/repentence.html.\u0014\n\"Boehme, Jakob.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. \nEdited by F.

    "words": "May 15, 1556 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Knox's Friends Turn the Tables\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Knox first preached, his sermons consisted largely of \nfulminations against Roman Catholic practices. They gave his \nlisteners something to protest against, but nothing to put in place \nof that which they were asked to discard. In 1556, after a visit to \nGeneva, Knox began to preach a new kind of sermon, a sermon in which \nhe not only tore down the old but showed his listeners that as God's \nelect they must build a new kind of church in place of that which \nthey removed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany nobles came to hear him speak of the new nation he envisioned, a \nnation in which the true Kirk (church), with Christ at its head, \nwould triumph. The bishops of the old order trembled. Should Knox \nhave his way-- and his growing popularity indicated he might--they \nwould be robbed of their authority. Typical of the opposition he \nfaced was their summons to appear at the Church of the Blackfriars in \nEdinburgh and face legal proceedings. He appeared in Edinburgh on \nthis day May 15, 1556.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the bishops had hoped to humble him. Instead he turned the \ntables. Many men of high standing, including the noble William Keith, \nthe Earl Marischal, appeared with him. Regent Mary of Guise (mother \nof Mary, Queen of Scots) dismissed the summons, and Knox went on to \npreach to large crowds in Edinburgh. He also wrote her a letter of \nthanks, asking for toleration of all Protestants. She treated it with \ncontempt.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Scotland was not yet ready for the Knox brand of reform. The \nnobles wanted to revive feudalism; the government's advisors sought \nto put down the Scots with a mercenary army. Once again John Knox \nleft for Geneva where he ministered to fellow exiles. In Geneva he \nembarrassed Calvin by issuing over the Reformer's objections a \nnotorious \"blast\" against women rulers. When reform-minded Elizabeth \ncame to the throne of England, Knox had to find a way out of his \nwords because he needed her help.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Knox returned to Scotland, he thundered loudly for reform. Riots \nbroke out and the rioters smashed Roman Catholic images. These riots \nprovoked war. Several times the reformer and the Queen of Scotland \nmet face to face. Each found in the other a powerful opponent. Knox \ntold her solemnly, \"...I am sent to preach the evangel of Jesus \nChrist to such as please to hear it; and it hath two parts, \nrepentance and faith.\" Mary did not accept his brand of faith. In the \nend she abdicated after a scandal and the mysterious murder of her \nhusband. John Knox remained preeminent in the life of his nation. \nWhen the constitution of the Church of Scotland was formulated, he \nwas a key player.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnox is remembered as the \"Thundering Scot.\" More than any other \nmajor reformer, his teaching allowed room for revolution. He believed \nthat under some circumstances, duly constituted Christian leaders \nhave an obligation to revolt against tyranny.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBoreham, F.

Now, on this day, April 15th, 1597, \nhe was hoisted into the torturous position again. \". . .if I had any \nspirit left in me it was given by God and given to me, although most \nunworthy, because I shared the fellowship of the Society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGerard's crime was to be a Jesuit in an England which had embraced \nthe Reformation. As such he was suspected of complicity in various \nplots, imaginary or real. His torture was designed to force him to \nimplicate an innocent Catholic priest, Father Garnet.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis torment was made worse by the words of the torturers. \"You will \nbe a cripple all your life if you live. And you are going to be \ntortured every day until you confess.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Gerard prayed unceasingly. The pain was intense, especially in \nhis hands. He placed himself in the keeping of the Lord Jesus and \nMary. It was a long time before he fainted this day. Hot water was \npoured down his throat to revive him. The jailers had so much \ndifficulty bringing him around that they thought he had died. He came \nto himself seated on a bench, and supported by a man on either side. \n\"Submit to the Queen,\" they urged. Tell all you know. Why die \nmiserably? \"No I won't,\" he managed to reply. \"And I won't as long as \nthere is breath in my body.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was hung up again, and was promised another hanging after dinner. \nNonetheless he felt consoled in his soul. \"Whether it arose from a \ntrue love of suffering with Christ or from a selfish longing to be \nwith Christ, God knows best. But I thought then I was going to die. \nAnd my heart filled with great gladness as I abandoned myself to His \nwill and keeping. . .\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe governor of the tower was the first to lose stomach for the \nfight. John was taken down and returned to his cell. His warden \". . \n.assured me that his wife, whom I had never seen, had wept and prayed \nfor me the whole time.\" The governor resigned. He did not want to \ntorture any more good men, he said. A new man took his place. Six \nmonths later, John escaped.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was glad to have endured his torments without breaking, but deeply \nsaddened for another cause. God must have seen weakness in him to \nhave given him so short a fight, he wrote. \"To others stronger than \nme, to Father Walpole, Father Southwell and others, He offered a hard \nfight that they might conquer. . .but I was clearly unworthy of their \nprize and was left to fulfill the length of my days. . .\" Clearly the \nReformation in England had martyrs, heroes and villains on both \nsides--Catholic and Protestant.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGerard, John. \"A Jesuit is Tortured in the Tower, 14-15 April, 1597 \nJohn Gerard.\" In Eyewitness to History.

    "words": "May 29, 1593 \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Penry Pleaded for Welsh Soulwinners\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Penry wept for Wales. In Elizabeth's England, there were far too \nfew pastors assigned to teach the Welsh, and of those, many were \nabsentees from their flocks or little better than rogues. Penry wrote \nEquity of a Humble Supplication in Behalf of the Country of Wales \nthat Some Order May Be Taken for the Preaching of the Gospel Among \nThose People. He complained that thousands in Wales had almost never \nheard of Christ. \"O destitute and forlorn condition! Preaching itself \nin many parts is unknown. In some places a sermon is read once in \nthree months.\" He proposed a system of lay pastors supported in part \nwith voluntary gifts from the people. His attack on the neglectful \npractices of the Church of England won Penry the undying enmity of \nJohn Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving become a Puritan separatist in his thinking, Penry could not \naccept a state-run system, because, as he phrased it, \"The truth of \nChrist and ministry of Christ as it is his will be in bondage unto no \nantichristian power. If it be, it is antichrist's truth and \nministry.\" Because of such outspoken views, and his stern warnings to \nthe queen and her bishops, Penry had to flee at times. Eventually he \nwould be hanged, making him a hero and martyr in Wales.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat sealed his doom was The Marprelate Tracts. These were satirical \nexposs larded with heavy-handed taunts at English bishops (\"petty \npopes\"), coarse talk (\"Printed overseas, in Europe, within two \nfurlongs of a bouncing priest\") and silly sneers (\"Ha, ha, Dr. \nCopycat!\"). Their theme can be summed up in the words of the first \ntract: \"Leave you your wickedness and I'll leave the revealing of \nyour knaveries.\" An example of the knavery was confiscation of stolen \ncloth by one bishop for his own use. \"Well, one or two of the thieves \nwere executed and at their deaths confessed that to be the cloth \nwhich the bishop had, but the dyers could not get their cloth, nor \ncannot unto this day...\" Penry was thought to have a hand in \npreparing the popular pamphlets although he denied it. While it is \ntrue that they were printed on the same press as his books, the \ngeneral consensus today is that he did not write them. They weren't \nhis style.\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptured, he was treated to a travesty of justice. Some strong words \nof warning against Elizabeth in his notebook were interpreted as \ntreason. Archbishop Whitgift was the first to sign his death warrant. \nPenry was hauled off to be hanged on this day, May 29, 1593. A thin \nscattering of bystanders, none of them his friends, watched as the \n34-year old departed this world at the end of a rope about four in \nthe afternoon. He was not allowed to preach a final sermon.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had, however, written a lengthy letter to his four daughters \n(Deliverance, Comfort, Safety and Sure Hope), none of whom was old \nenough to really understand yet what was going on; the eldest was \nfour years, the youngest four months. In it he showed his deep \naffection for them: \"Wherefore, again, my daughters, even my tenderly \nbeloved daughters, regard not the world or anything that is \ntherein...\" He implored them to follow true faith: \"And I, your \nfather, now ready to give my life for the former testimony do charge \nyou, as you shall answer in the day of the Lord, to embrace this my \ncounsel given unto you in His name, and to bring up your posterity \nafter you (if the Lord vouchsafe you any) in this same true faith and \nway to the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Great Non-Conformist Preachers of Wales.\" V Wales. \nhttp://www.red4.co.uk/Folklore/trevelyan/glimpse/ noncomformists.htm\u0014\nMarprelate Tracts.

    "words": "Jerusalem Should Be City of Peace for All Faiths \u0014\nDrew Smith\u0014\nJune 21, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nGlenn Beck announced in May his next rally: Restoring Courage on Aug. \n24 in Jerusalem. \u0014\nBeck's announcement, which came two days after the 63rd anniversary \nof Israel's declaration of sovereignty on May 14, 1948, was in \nreaction to President Obama's remarks concerning the need to create a \ntwo-state solution based on the 1967 borders.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeck, like others, is angered by this decision and sees this as a \nmove away from U.S. support for Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe creation of the modern state of Israel as an independent state \nand a home for the Jewish people opened a floodgate of violence that \ncontinues to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt created a human catastrophe as nearly a million Palestinians were \nforced from their homes and became refugees  a number that, \naccording to the United Nations, increased exponentially.\u0014\nWhile attempts at establishing lasting peace have been made on \nseveral occasions, none has been successful.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is an authentic Christian response to the Middle East question?\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 122:6 commands us to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Clearly, \npeace is at the heart of Jesus' message that the rule of God has come \ninto the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet obstacles to peace for all inhabitants of the land called holy by \nJews, Christians and Muslims have prevented such long-term steps \ntoward peace. Nothing continues to threaten such peace like religious \nextremism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn extremist movement in an American version of Christianity has \nplayed a key role in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East  \nparticularly over the thorny issue of the historic land of Palestine.\u0014\nMany conservative and fundamentalist Christians hold stringently to \nthe belief that God has ordained the existence of the modern state of \nIsrael, and that Israel should hold onto confiscated land at any cost \nwithout regard for the humanity of the Palestinians.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone is more vocal than John Hagee and his movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians United for Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nHagee views history through apocalyptic and eschatological lenses. He \nsees human history as moving toward a predestined end, and he argues \nthat the modern state of Israel will play a key role in the end of \nthe world.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe seeks support for his view in the Book of Revelation and various \ntexts from the Hebrew Bible. But he is very selective in his \nreadings, and he reads only from his own apocalyptic position.\u0014\nHagee's interpretations of Scripture, however, are misguided and only \nfictitious expectations about the end times. More tragically, he sees \napocalyptic war as the inevitable end and seeks to push the region to \nthat end as quickly as possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spewing his religious extremist rhetoric, Hagee differs little \nfrom other religious extremists. They all base their understanding of \nthe Middle East conflict solely on religious terms, and they believe \nthe only solution is a great apocalyptic war in which the followers \nof God will be victorious over those who are evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem with these positions is that each claims to speak for \nGod, and each despises the other as evildoers.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians, and others, have rightly voiced disgust at the \nhateful rhetoric of extremists from other faiths, but rarely have we \nheard criticism about Hagee's rhetoric. Even some conservative \npoliticians have attended and spoken at his rallies.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Hagee fits the description of a false prophet whose intentions \nare not for peace in Israel, but for annihilation of an oppressed \nrace, the Palestinians. He is about as far away from the teachings of \nJesus as one could possibly get on this issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, many folks, including Jews, have questioned Hagee's support \nfor Israel as simply a means to an end.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 2009 segment of \"60 Minutes\" called \"\\Zion's Christian \nSoldiers,\" Gershom Gorenberg said of these kinds of Christians: \"They \ndon't love real Jewish people. They love us as characters in their \nstory, in their play, and that's not who we are, and we never \nauditioned for that part, and the play is not one that ends up good \nfor us. If you listen to the drama they're describing, essentially \nit's a five-act play in which the Jews disappear in the fourth act.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact of the matter is that since the founding of the modern state \nof Israel in 1948, the Palestinians, who had peacefully resided there \nfor generations, have been oppressed, ghettoized and killed by \nstate-sponsored acts of terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, extremist Palestinian terrorist groups who have acted in \nhorrible violence against innocent Israeli civilians must be held \naccountable for their horrendous acts. We must not gloss over these \natrocities.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Israel must also be held responsible for the illegal confiscation \nof land, the oppression of millions of Palestinians who have been \nforced from their homes, and the killing of many innocent \nPalestinians by Israeli armed forces.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am afraid that our religious, political and media-driven culture \nhas so clouded our understanding of the complex issues surrounding \nthe Middle East conflict that we have gravitated to fanciful beliefs \nand explanations about the region that have no real grounding in \nScripture and that completely ignore the teachings of Jesus that call \nus to be peacemakers.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians concerned about the peace of Jerusalem would do much \nbetter by being more broadly informed about the complex issues from \nexperts who have studied the history of the conflict, rather than \ngetting their information from the likes of Hagee and Beck.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay the God of peace bring shalom, salaam and peace to Jerusalem for \npeople from all faiths.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrew Smith, an ordained Baptist minister, is director of \ninternational programs at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, \nArk.

    "title": "JOHN BRADFORD (1510 - 1555)",
    "words": "On the morning of July 15th 1555 at 9am, two men were led to their \nexecution at Londons Smithfield in the reign of \"bloody Queen Mary\". \nThey were condemned to be burnt alive as heretics. One was a young \nman of 19 called John Leaf, the other was about 45 years old and his \nname was John Bradford.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong Bradfords final words at the stake were these \"O England, \nEngland, repent!\" Turning to the young man who was to suffer with him \nhe said, \"Be of good comfort, brother, for we shall have a happy \nsupper with the Lord tonight\". Then, embracing the wood of his \nexecution, he repeated our Saviours words, \"Strait is the gate, and \nnarrow is the way, that leads to life and few there be that find it\". \n\"Thus\", says Foxe in his Book of Martyrs, \"like two lambs, they both \nended their mortal lives ... being void of all fear\".\u0014\n\u0014\nSo long as Roman Catholic dogma exists, there remains a need to \ncontend for the truths Bradford stood for, and in the same godly \nmanner. But we live in a different age. England is essentially \nsecular, materialistic and hedonistic. As a nation we are lovers of \npleasure rather than lovers of God, a virtual Sodom ripening for \nGods judgment. Though the days are different, the need of the hour \nis the same as in Bradfords day. England must repent and we need men \nof Bradfords calibre to say so; men who know that the way is narrow, \nnot narrow-minded men - men as holy as John Bradford!\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bradford has been described as one of the holiest men since the \napostles, a wonder of his own age and among the most spiritual of the \nReformers. When we consider how godly the Reformers were, this must \nmake him a veritable giant among giants. And in an age of spiritual \npigmies such as our own, we have much that we can learn from this \ncolossal contender for The Faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Bradford was born at Manchester about the year 1510. He received \na good education and showed considerable ability in Latin and \narithmetic. He put his accounting proficiency to good use when, later \nin life, he managed the financial affairs of a certain Sir John \nHarrington before training as a law student at the Temple in London \nin the days of the Protestant king, Edward VI. Precisely when \nBradford was converted to Christ we do not know. But we do know that \nwhen God touched his heart, his former love of rings, chains and \njewellery gave place to a fervent devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ \nand His cause on earth. The transformation was so great that he gave \nup his study of law at the Temple and went to the University of \nCambridge in 1548, to give himself entirely to the study of the \nScriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford took Scripture earnestly to heart, as may be seen from his \nresponse to a sermon preached in London before young king Edward by \nthe well-known Reformer, Hugh Latimer. When Bradford heard that God \nrequired the restitution of dishonest gain, he was profoundly \ntroubled about a fraud respecting money owed to the king by Sir John \nHarrington whom he had served. Bradford hadnt benefited from the \nfraud, but he had concealed it. Bradfords spiritual convictions were \nsuch that he felt compelled to reveal the matter, and so forced Sir \nJohn to make restitution to the king!\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford is described as a ruddy, tall and slender man with an auburn \nbeard. He slept four hours in the night, ate sparingly, and never \nfelt an hour well spent unless he had done some good by writing, \nstudy, or instructing others. Indeed, he would reprove sin in such a \nsweet way, that those reproved knew he only did it for their good in \norder to draw them to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis personal walk with Christ was of a deep devotional nature. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Quotations tells us that it was Bradford who \noriginated the saying \"There but for the grace of God go I.\" Seeing a \ngroup of criminals led out to their execution he declared, \"But for \nthe grace of God there goes John Bradford\u0014",

    "title": "JAMES -- ADOPTION INTO THE CANNON",
    "words": "JAMES-ADOPTION INTO THE CANON\u0014\n\u0014\nThe letter of James appears to have influenced several \nlate-first-century works, among them the Shepherd of Hermas and 1 \nClement.\\46 Clement of Alexandria is said to have written a \ncommentary on James, but no such work has survived.\\47 Origen is the \nfirst to cite James as Scripture, and other third-century works show \nacquaintance with the letter. Eusebius cites James frequently and \naccords it canonical status. But by classifying it among the \ndisputed books (see \\H.E. 3.25.3), he also serves notice that some \nin his day questioned its status. He may be referring to some in the \nSyrian church who were slow to accept as canonical all the General \nEpistles. But James is included in the Syriac translation, the \nPeshitta, and is quoted approvingly by Chrysostom (\\d. 407) and \nTheodoret (d. 458). The Western part of the early church witnesses to \na similar situation, although acceptance of James came a bit later. \nJames is not found in either the Muratorian Canon or the Mommsen \ncatalogue (reflecting the African canon \\c. 360).\\48 The earliest \nclear references to James date from the fourth century (Hilary of \nPoitiers and Ambrosiaster). Decisive for the acceptance of James in \nthe Western church was Jeromes full acceptance of the book.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames thus came to be recognized as canonical in all parts of the \nancient church, and while there were hesitations on the part of some, \nno one rejected the book outright. Should these hesitations give us \npause about the status of James? No. They were probably the product \nof a combination of uncertainty about the identity of the author \n(which James?) and the relative neglect of the book. Being practical \nand Jewish in its flavor, James was not the sort of book that would \nhave been widely used in the doctrinal controversies of the early \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames came in for its most severe criticism at the hands of Luther. \nHis passionate embracing of Pauls teaching on justification by faith \nalone as the heart of Scripture made it difficult for him to accept \nJames. He therefore relegated it to a secondary status in the New \nTestament, along with Jude, Hebrews, and Revelation. Nevertheless, \nLuther did not exclude James from the canon, and despite his \ncriticisms, he quoted James approvingly many times.\\49 Compared with \nthose chief books that clearly taught justification by faith, James \nappeared to Luther to be an epistle of straw (i.e., one made of \nstraw; his allusion is to 1 Cor. 3:12). But he can also say, I would \nnot prevent anyone from including or extolling him as he pleases, for \nthere are otherwise many good sayings in him.\\50 We do not wish to \nminimize Luthers criticism of James: he clearly had difficulties \nwith it. But his difficulties arose from a somewhat imbalanced \nperspective induced by his polemical context. Considered in a more \nbalanced way, James can be seen to be making an important \ncontribution to our understanding of Christian theology and practice, \none that in no way conflicts with Paul or any other biblical author \n(see Contribution below). On both historical and theological \ngrounds, James fully deserves the canonical status that the church \nhas accorded it.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSome think, however, that the omission of James from the Muratorian \nCanon is accidental, since the text of the canon is damaged \n(Westcott, History of the Canon, 21920).

    "title": "JOSEPH'S EXAMPLE OF FORGIVENESS",
    "words": "GENESIS 50:15-21\u0014\n\u0014\n1In this short portion near the conclusion of the Joseph story we \nhave a beautiful gem of forgiveness. Joseph refuses to be vindictive \neven after his father's death, implying that only God has the right \nto judge Joseph's brothers. Joseph's brothers had intended evil to \ncome to Joseph, but God intended everything that happened to Joseph \nto be for the good of many people who survived the seven years of \nfamine because Joseph had been sent to Egypt. In the light of God's \naction in bringing good out of what the brothers of Joseph had \nintended for evil, not only does Joseph refuse to punish his \nbrothers, but he also provides for them and for their families. By \nmeans of this gracious act, Joseph demonstrates the nature of God and \nat the same time provides an excellent example and role model for \nyoung men and women to follow. This wisdom motif of an excellent role \nmodel for young people to follow is one of the primary purposes of \nthe Joseph story in its canonical form. Also contained within the \nJoseph story are large amounts of Israelite tribal history and life \nexperiences to which we have no other comparable access.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Joseph story, the hand of God is shown here in Genesis \n50:15-21 and in Genesis 45:5-15 in the repeated refrain, \"God sent me \nbefore you to preserve life.\" That refrain has provided a model of \nhope for Jewish leaders during conditions of extreme suffering for \nthem throughout their history, including the pogroms in Eastern \nEurope and in the Holocaust.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should not leave this text without the comment that this text -- \nas well as the Psalm 103 account chosen to be used with it -- has not \na trace of legalism regarding forgiveness. These Older Testament \ntexts are satisfied to provide exemplary models of forgiveness by \nJoseph (Genesis 50:15-21) and by the Lord (Psalm 103:1-13). In \ncontrast, the Matthew 18:21-35 text ends with a legalistic threat of \nGod-ordered imprisonment until the last coin of debt is paid for all \nof the followers of Jesus who do not forgive their fellow believers \nfrom their hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 103:(1-7) 8-13\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin this individual hymn of praise, the gracious forgiveness of \nthe Lord is acclaimed joyfully and repeatedly. The examples given are \ngeneral enough that they can be used basically as they are even \ntoday. An unrehearsed responsive reading of this psalm during the \nworship service is hardly adequate for this occasion when God's \nforgiveness of us and our forgiveness of others will be highlighted. \nHundreds of years prior to God's splendid act of forgiveness of sins \nby means of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Christ, \nthe often-repeated Israelite description of the Lord as \"merciful and \ngracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love\" was expanded \nwith line after line of acclamation and analogy in this Psalm 103. \nTherefore, we should use this psalm heavily within our worship \nservices this coming weekend in our message and in our songs.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew 18:21-35\u0014\nBecause this Matthew 18:23-35 parable of judgment is known so well by \nmost of the people within our worshiping congregations, perhaps we \ncould use the parable best as a basis for a children's sermon message \ntold in our own words. The \"gospel\" in the parable is seen in the \nmercy that the lord of the servant showed in 18:27 by releasing the \nservant and canceling the huge debt owed to the lord. The parenesis \nis seen in the requirement that we forgive the sins and debts other \npeople have incurred, just as God in Christ has forgiven our sins. \nBoth for the children and for the adults we should note the \nsimilarity between this parable and the petition in the Lord's \nPrayer, \"Forgive us our sins as we have forgiven the sins of those \nwho have sinned against us.\" Finally, the importance of forgiveness \ncan be summarized by a reference to the saying about how often we \nshould forgive that we have in Matthew 18:21-22.\u0014",

It is the story of a friendship between \ntwo remarkable people, Bashir \u0014\nKhairi, a Palestinian whose father built a house in alRamla, and \nDalia Eshkenazi, an Israeli woman whose family settled in that same \nhouse after the war. After reading the book, I began a journey \u0014\nto learn about the Israeli occupation and the effect of the founding \nof Israel on the Palestinian people. I began to question how and why \nIsrael treats an entire group of people in a way that is not in \u0014\nthe Jewish tradition of \"loving one's neighbor as thyself.\" I also \nlearned a great deal from \u0014\nIsraeli journalists and historians such as Gideon Levy and l1an \nPappe, who love their \u0014\ncountry but also have the courage and integrity to reveal that there \nis another side of the narrative. \u0014\n\u0014\nI encourage those who are open to further study to read books and \narticles by these two men.

    "title": "JESUIT ORDER TEMPORARILY DISSOLVED",
    "words": "Jesuit Order Temporarily Dissolved\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Society of Jesus (Jesuits) was founded during the Reformation era \nin 1534. St. Ignatius of Loyola became the society's first general \nwhen Pope Paul III approved it in 1540. Famed missionary, St. Francis \nXavier, was one of the original seven Jesuits.\u0014\n\u0014\nLove of Christ and the Roman Church animated these first Jesuits and \nmany who followed them. Among the Jesuits were a number martyrs in \nNorth America including Isaac Jogues and Jean Brebeuf, men of ardent \npassion for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jesuits were a driving force in the Counter-reformation. Their \nenergy and drive carried Catholicism beyond its pre-reformation \nbounds and regained much of the territory lost to Protestants. By \nemphasizing missions and education, the Jesuits from the first \nexerted influence beyond their numbers. Not that their numbers \nremained small. Even before Ignatius' death the Society had almost a \nthousand members. In time it became the largest Roman Catholic order. \nJesuits became known as the schoolmasters of Europe and were \nprominent as confessors to kings and emperors. They made advances in \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir influence was resented. Partly this was their own fault. The \nJesuits developed a system of logic and morality called casuistry \nwhich offered loopholes for all sorts of wrongdoing. In France, \nBlaise Pascal wrote his blistering Provincial Letters to expose \nalleged Jesuitical abuses. Elsewhere, Jesuitical controversies over \nrites, their theological disputes, and their close adherence to Rome \nmade them many foes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause Jesuits took their orders from no local authority but only \nthe popes and their own generals, they were viewed with suspicion as \nforeign agents. Such was the case with the heroes Edmund Campion and \nRobert Southwell, Jesuit missionaries to England. Both were executed \nalthough there is no evidence either had committed treason, but had \nmerely administered the Catholic rites to congregations which had \nbeen driven underground.\u0014\n\u0014\nCries against the Jesuits rose louder and louder until on this day \nJuly 21, 1773, Pope Clement XIV dissolved the order completely. It \nhad already been abolished in France and Spain. Clement refused to \ncondemn the Society but merely noted he was making an administrative \nmove for the peace of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effect of the suppression was hurtful for the Roman church, for \nit shut down much mission work and many schools. Some Jesuits were \nallowed to remain in existence. In 1814 the Society was restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday's Jesuits are sometimes as controversial as their forebears. In \nSouth America many are closely identified with \"liberation theology\" \nwhich many Catholics consider heretical because of its emphasis on \nworldly aims and a materialistic interpretation of doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Will and Ariel.

    "title": "JESUS BEFRIENDED PROSTITUTES; SO DID THIS WOMAN",
    "words": "Jesus Befriended Prostitutes. So This Victorian-Era Woman Did Too. \u0014\n\u0014\nJosephine Butlers faith prompted her to challenge the status quo of \nher day.\u0014\nKIMI HARRIS\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a strange sight. A well-dressed and respectable woman stood \noutside a brothel. She was beautiful, but her clothing marked her not \nas a prostitute but as the middle-class Victorian mother she was. She \nhad recently confronted the Paris police over their abusive treatment \nof prostitutes under their legal control. The chief officer wasnt \nconvinced by her arguments but was charmed by the woman in front of \nhim. This wasnt surprising as all who met her felt her impact. She \nleft with written permission to view the many government-controlled \nbrothels.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Josephine Butler stood, poised to enter the brothel, a place where \nno well-bred Victorian woman dared to go. With a glance toward her \nguide, she took the brave step forward. She would see padded rooms \nwhere prostitutes could be abused without the world hearing their \nscreams. Her small form would pass rooms full of children used as \nprostitutes, and she would shudder to hear her guide proudly announce \nhow wonderful it was that these children were under their care and \noff the streets. She wasnt persuaded. She knew what she saw. Hell \nhath opened her mouth, she would write. I stand in the near \npresence of the powers of evil. What I see and hear are the smoke of \nthe pit.\u0014\n\u0014\nA well-educated and cultured woman with a husband and children, her \ndecision to not only enter brothels but to advocate for prostitutes \nwas shocking to society. She viewed her war as a consecrated \nrebellion.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was this woman, and how can we understand her courage?\u0014\n\u0014\nA Faithful Home\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in England in 1828, just in time for the Victorian era, \nJosephine Butler appalled the world by speaking about unspeakable \ntopics. Victorians believed in separate spheres for men and women: \nWomen were to care for the home and children, and men were for the \npublic sphere. Yet she not only entered into public politics, but \nworse, she was speaking about uncomfortable realities such as \nprostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, and more.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo grasp why, we need to understand her values. These principles led \nher to visit brothels and jails. They are the reason she would face \ndown thugs, public ridicule, and slanderpersevering even when dung \nand mud were thrown at her in the streets. Her strength, \nfearlessness, and morals came from a deep Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nButler grew up in a comfortable and deeply religious family. Her \nfather, John Grey, was a public advocate for the abolition of \nslavery, who could not endure to see oppression or wrong of any kind \ninflicted on man, woman, or child. Victorian fathers often felt it \nwas their duty to keep their wives and daughters innocent of the \nevil of the world, but Grey treated his daughters as equals, speaking \nto them about the horrors of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosephine married George Butler, a scholar and clergyman, who also \ntreated her as an equal, fully supporting her campaigns. Her work \nforced her to speak against the mindset and actions common to men of \nher time. She would later say, It seems strange that I should have \nbeen engaged in taking up the cudgel against men when my father, \nbrothers, husband and sons have all been so good. Perhaps it was her \nknowledge that men could treat women with respect that spurred her \ndesire for change.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore importantly, Butler based her actions on Jesus himself. In his \ntender and respectful attitudes toward women, including prostitutes, \nshe saw a different way to view womanhood and redemption. When \nconfronting the idea that there were women not worth saving, she \nwrote that such an opinion was heathenism, and that this judgment \ncan only be seen in its true colours by setting it side by side with \nthe example and character of Christ.  Were any beings in human shape \nnot worth saving in his estimation? She was able to stand firm \nagainst a roar of opposition because her actions were rooted deeply \nin her faith in Christ and the redemptive worth he offered every \nperson.\u0014\n\u0014\nTempered by Suffering\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full articlem see My Documents/Jesus Befriended Prostitues\u0014",

    "title": "JERUSALEM: A CAPITAL DECISION",
    "words": "Jerusalem:  A Capital Decision\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Rhee      Liberty Magazine  July/August 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nOn December 6, 2017, President Donald Trump officially recognized \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. The decree fulfilled one of \nseveral campaign promises he made in an effort to woo evangelical \nvoters. That strategy paid off, as 81 percent of White evangelicals \ncast their votes for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe presidents edict on Jerusalem was geopolitically risky, as it \nhas been criticized by the Arab world, the European Union, and even \nsome prominent Christian leaders like Pope Francis. However, it has \nreceived a favorable response from Evangelicals in America. According \nto a poll conducted by the Brookings Institute, 53 percent of \nevangelicals support Trumps decision, whereas 63 percent of all \nAmericans oppose it. The approval from evangelicals is the result of \ntwo things: the inclination to interpret Scripture in a way that \nbestows Israel with divine favor, and the perception that Trumps \naction is a necessary step in fulfilling end- times prophecy.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Long Journey to a Decree\u0014\n\u0014\nJerusalem has political and religious significance to both Jews and \nArabs. Israel considers the city to be its capital, and Judaism \nbelieves it was the site on which the First and Second Temples stood. \nJerusalem is likewise a sacred place for Islam, as the Al-Aqsa Mosque \nis located there. Moreover, the State of Palestine claims East \nJerusalem as its capital. Jerusalem is also considered a holy place \nby many Christians, because the Bible says Jesus Christ was crucified \non a hill just outside the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was enacted in 1947. \nThe resolution recommended the creation of independent Arab and \nJewish states. It also mandated for Jerusalem to be a special \ninternational zone, in consideration of the fact that the city is \nsignificant to Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. However, Israel \noccupied the western half of Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli War of \n1948, and then proceeded to assume the eastern half of the city \nduring the next Arab-Israeli War in 1967.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith regard to American involvement in the dispute over Jerusalem, \nTrumps decision to recognize the city as Israels capital is the \nculmination of a series of executive and legislative decisions that \nbegan with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. This act of Congress \nacknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel, and it \nallocated funding for the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel \nAviv to Jerusalem. However, this law also included a provision that \nempowered the president to invoke renewable six-month waivers that \nwould defer its application. Citing national security interests, \nPresidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama repeatedly invoked these waivers \nto delay enforcement of this law. President Trump himself signed a \nwaiver in June 2017. Then on December 6, 2017, Trump officially \nrecognized Jerusalem as Israels capital and ordered the relocation \nof the American embassy to that city.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts All About the Bible\u0014\n\u0014\nThe strong evangelical support for Trumps decision is a consequence \nof a proclivity to take a literal interpretation of Scripture; most \nevangelicals consider the Bible to be either the actual Word of God, \nor the inspired Word of God. They believe God speaks to humankind \nthrough the Bible. They also believe Scripture is adamant that God \ndesires for Israel to have dominion over Jerusalem. Evangelicals \noften refer to such passages as Genesis 12:1, 2, where God says to \nAbram, Go from your country and your kindred and your fathers house \nto the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, \nand I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a \nblessing (NRSV).3\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother often-cited text is 2 Chronicles 6:5, 6. In this passage King \nSolomon quotes God as saying, Since the day that I brought my people \nout of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the \ntribes of Israel in which to build a house, so that my name might be \nthere, and I chose no one as ruler over my people Israel; but I have \nchosen Jerusalem in order that my name may be there, and I have \nchosen David to be over my people Israel (NRSV).\u0014\nA literal interpretation of these passages suggests that God has \nselected the Jews to be His chosen people, and He wishes for \nJerusalem to be the capital of His chosen nation. This is the opinion \nespoused by Laurie Cardoza-Moore, an evangelical who hosts a \ntelevision program called Focus on Israel. In an interview with \nNevada Public Radio, Ms. Cardoza-Moore says God established the \nboundaries of all nations, and He chose the city of Jerusalem for \nHimself.4\u0014\n\u0014\nEschatology is a second biblically based reason for evangelicals \nsupporting Trumps decision on Jerusalem. Many evangelicals believe \nin an end-of-times scenario that is divulged by Hal Lindsey in his \nbest-selling book The Late Great Planet Earth. Lindsey interprets \npassages from the books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation to \ntheorize that three events need to occur before Jesus can return. \nFirst, the Jews need to retake Palestine and reestablish Israel as a \nsovereign nation. Second, Israel needs to take full possession of \nJerusalem. Last, the Third Temple needs to be built on the site where \nthe first two temples stood. The first of these three steps happened \nin 1948, with the birth of the State of Israel. The second was \naccomplished in 1967 after Israel assumed full control over Jerusalem \nduring the Six-Day War. So the only thing left now is the \nconstruction of the Third Temple. Evangelicals like Pastor Paul \nBegley believe Trumps decision will make it easier for Israel to \nbuild the temple, and thus hasten the return of Jesus Christ.5\u0014\n\u0014\nA Recognition of Reality\u0014\n\u0014\nKen Harper is a retired pastor who served for 41 years in \ncongregations affiliated with The Presbyterian Church (USA). His \nfinal pastorate was an eight-year tenure at Green Valley Presbyterian \nChurch in Henderson, Nevada. Harper identifies himself as an \nEvangelical from a theological, but not political, perspective. He \nbelieves the Bible is the inspired and infallible Word of God, and \nthat it unequivocally validates Israels claim to Jerusalem. However, \nHarpers support for Israel goes beyond Scripture. Harper says \nTrumps actions show that the president recognizes the reality of the \nsituation in the Middle East, and the reality is that Israel is a \nsovereign nation, and as such, they have the right to choose where \ntheir own capital will be located. Moreover, Harper doesnt see how \nthe Palestinians, or anyone else, can argue that the Jews have no \nhistorical claim to Jerusalem. Harper also believes Israel has been a \nmuch better steward of Jerusalem. He notes that when the Palestinians \nhad full control of Jerusalem, there were all sorts of atrocities \ncommitted there, such as the destruction of synagogues and the \ndeposing of Jews from their homes. Moreover, in Harpers view, \nJerusalem was a desolate place prior to 1947, but the city is now \nadorned with trees planted by the Israelis, including some that were \ndonated by Harper himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nFulfilment of a Promise\u0014\nThere are two aspects to the evangelical support for Trumps decision \nto recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. One aspect is a look back \non the past, where God established a covenant with Israel and gave \nthem the land upon which Jerusalem sits. The other aspect is a glance \nat the future, where Jesus Christ will return to cast judgment on all \nof humanity and establish His eternal kingdom. This final scenario, \nas it is described in the book of Revelation, is something that \nChrists followers have yearned for since the Pentecost, when their \nLord ascended to heaven with the assurance that He would return. In \nthe eyes of evangelicals, Trumps recent actions on Jerusalem will \nhasten the realization of this final promise that Jesus Christ made \nto them.\u0014\nIt is worth noting that not all Christians see the same literal need \nto identify with the political fortunes of modern Israel. Most \nChristians agree with the apostle Paul that in Christ we are all \nchildren of the promise. And not all see end-times prophecies as \nIsrael-centric.

    "title": "JESUS ENDED THE OLD COVENANT ONCE AND FOR ALL",
    "words": "Andy Stanley: Jesus Ended the Old Covenant Once and for All \u0014\nA brief response to Robert Foster on my book, Irresistible.\u0014\nAndy Stanley| October 19, 2018   CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\nTo begin, Id like to clarify a few points.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, Id like to put to rest any fears that my truncated quotation \nof 2 Timothy 3:16 in the book was intentionally shortened. Foster \ncorrectly notes that I only quote the first half of that verse. My \npurpose was to point out the OT is God-breathed and inspired, useful \nfor many purposes, and I completely agree with the rest of that \nverse. In fact, thats one reason I wrote Irresistible, to show that \nthe fulfillment and end of the OT leads us to Jesus, and Jesus gives \nus a new ethic, one that calls us to sacrificial love and good works \nthat make our faith irresistible to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I agree that Gods Wordboth Old and Newis given to equip us for \nall sorts of good works, and I wish more Christians took that message \nto heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nFoster provides three points to help us understand the function of \nthe OT for Christians today:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe OT can help Christians understand the implications of the gospel \nfor our lives.\u0014\nThe OT can illuminate Christians understanding of Gods way in the \nworld.\u0014\nThe OT can provide a foundation for Christian moral conduct.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet me make it simple and clear. I fully agree with points 1 and 2 in \nthis list and have said as much elsewhere. The OT is useful for \nhelping us understand the implications of the gospel for our lives, \nbut it must be read in context and understood as Gods Word to \nIsrael. The OT provides us with examples, illustrations, and a rich \nhistory of Gods relationship with his people. All of this serves to \nilluminate the good news of the gospel. If we want an example of \nfaith, look at Moses or Joshua. Or look at how God was faithful to \nhis people and kept his promises despite their failure. We should \nalso learn from how the apostles used the Old Testament, especially \nhow they used the OT when speaking to a Jewish audience. But we must \nunderstand that God relates to people differently in the OT than he \ndoes in the NT. Something genuinely new happens with Jesus, and that \nchanges the course of historyand the way we relate to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there is one place Id push back, its point 3. Foster provides an \nexample (Deut. 35:32) of how the OT informs our moral conduct as \nChristians. But all this shows is how Paul used the OT. It doesnt \ntell us how we should apply much of the OT to our lives today. We can \ntake cues from the NT writers, especially the example in Acts 15, but \nthis does not mean that the OT law directly applies to Christians \ntoday. Should we stone rebellious children (Ex. 21:15-17)? Prohibit \ninterracial marriage (Deut. 7:3-4)? No. Because the old covenant has \nbeen fulfilled and ended and a new and better way of relating to God \nis now available to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a common way of dividing the OT law into three categories: \nceremonial, civil, and moral. While I dont use this division in my \nbook, it may clarify what Im saying. When I say that the Old \nTestament has ended, it means the ceremonial laws are fulfilled in \nthe death of Jesusno more sacrifices in the temple, no more priests. \nOT civil laws are no longer enforced, since they were given for the \nnation of Israel formed at Mt. Sinai. And while Gods moral laws have \nnot changed, they are transformed into something new. They are reset \nupon a new and better foundation, Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I explain in Irresistible, the OT asked us to base our love for \nothers upon our own standard of fairnesshow we want to be treated. \nJesus said this was the great commandment of the OT, to love your \nneighbor as yourselfthe golden rule. But then he takes us one step \nfurther. Jesus gives us a new and better command, one thats not \nbased on you or me, but on the standard of love Jesus has shown to \nus. I call this the platinum rule. Jesus Christ has ended the old \ncovenant once and for all, with all the Old Testament practices, \npromises, and expectations. We need to stop mixing the old with the \nnew, because God has given us something better in Jesus Christ and \nhis new command.\u0014\n\u0014\nI like how Wayne Grudem explains this in his recent book, Christian \nEthics:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important to realize that the author of Hebrews is not saying \nthat some old covenant laws are no longer binding on Christians (such \nas sacrificial laws or purity laws, for example), but that the old \ncovenant itself, that entire system of laws that defined the \nrelationship with God and his people, is no longer in effect.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew Testament scholar Thomas Schreiner makes it clear in 40 Questions \nAbout Christians and Biblical Law that the old has passed now that \nthe new has come, giving us a new basis for Christian behavior:\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul argues that the entirety of the law has been set aside now that \nChrist has come. To say that the moral elements of the law continue \nto be authoritative blunts the truth that the entire Mosaic covenant \nis no longer in force for believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, while I believe there is much we can learn from studying and \npreaching on the Old Testament, we must now take our cue from the \npromises fulfilled in Jesusthe new. The way we treat others is not \nbased on 10 Commandments, but on one command given by JesusLove one \nanother. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. (John \n13:34; 15:12). We need to ask: what does this love require of me? And \nthis informs our apologetic approach to reaching people. For me, it \nstarts by introducing them to Jesus and the miracle of his \nresurrection. Thats something weve never seen before in human \nhistory. Its brand new. And thats what makes Christianity \nirresistible.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommunicator, author, and pastor Andy Stanley is the founder of \nAtlanta-based North Point Ministries. His new book is entitled \nIrresistible: Reclaiming the New that Jesus Unleashed for the World.\u0014",

    "words": "An Interview With Author Bart D. Ehrman\u0014\nQ: What is it that drives your fascination with how Jesus has been \n\"remembered\" and \"misremembered\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: When most people today read the Gospels of the New Testament, they \nnearly always assume that these accounts were written soon after \nJesus' death by people who knew him and his disciples: these are \ntranscripts of the things Jesus said and did, down to the minute \ndetail. What people tend not to realize is that these accounts were \nwritten 4060 years after Jesus had died, by people who did not know \nhim, who did not live in his same country, who did not speak his same \nlanguage.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how did these authors (who are all four anonymous) acquire their \nstories about Jesus? The answer scholars have given for a very long \ntime is that these authors had heard stories about Jesus that had \nbeen in circulation for year after year, decade after decade, after \nhis life. I've long been intrigued by this phenomenon, and several \nyears ago realized that it is closely related to a field of study \npursued by psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists, all of \nwhom are interested in how human memory works. Is memory always \nreliable? Can eyewitnesses be trusted always to give an accurate \naccount of what happened? Do stories ever change when they are told? \nDo they ever not change? What happens to stories told and retold over \ndecades? In short, how does our knowledge of human memory help us \nunderstand what was happening to the accounts of Jesus' words and \ndeeds as they were circulating in the decades before any of our \nGospel authors wrote them down?\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: How have scholars traditionally explained the gap of time between \nwhen Jesus was alive and when the Gospels were written, and why is \nthat problematic?\u0014\n\u0014\nA: Many scholars have somewhat unreflectively maintained that the \nGospels ultimately go back to eyewitness testimonies to Jesus' life \nand that they are therefore reliable; or that oral cultures preserve \ntheir traditions with a high degree of accuracy. I realized several \nyears ago that these views can be tested by what we actually know, \nbased on modern detailed studies, about eyewitness testimony \n(psychologists and legal scholars have studied the subject \nrigorously), about the reliability of memory (psychologists have \ndelved into this question assiduously since the 1930s), and about the \nways traditions are preserved in oral cultures (as we now know based \non anthropological studies since the 1920s). As it turns out, what \nmany New Testament scholars have assumed about such matters, in many \ncases, is simply not right. Many of their assumptions are not only \nunsupported, they have been shown to be highly problematic in study \nafter study.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: What is the message you ultimately want people to take away from \nreading Jesus Before the Gospels?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospels we have are not stenographic accounts of the things Jesus \nsaid and did. They contain stories that had been passed along by word \nof mouth decades before anyone wrote them down. If we understand what \npsychologists have told us about memory and false memory, and about \nhow we sometimes actually invent stories in our heads about the past; \nif we understand what sociologists have told us about collective \nmemory and how our social groups affect and mold the ways we preserve \nour recollections of past events; and if we understand what \nanthropologists have learned about how oral cultures not just cherish \nand preserve but also alter, transform, and even invent their \ntraditions, we will have a much clearer sense of what the Gospels are \nand of how we should understand the stories they tell about the \nhistorical Jesus.\u0014",

    "words": "Michael L. Satlow \u0014\n\u0014\nIn antiquity, marriage was rarely seen as the formal rec- \u0014\nognition of the love between two people who wished to \u0014\nspend their lives together. Rather, its primary purpose was \u0014\nto create a household, the fundamental unit of economic \u0014\nproduction as well as family reproduction and preserva- \u0014\ntion. The upper classes (who had more of a vested inter- \u0014\nest in marriage and the household) widely assumed that \u0014\nthe new couple would manage the family landholdings \u0014\nand raise children and thus create a household. \u0014\n\u0014\nJewish marriages were little different from those of \u0014\nnon-Jews within the Greco-Roman world. In upper-class \u0014\nfamilies, Jewish men typically married around the age of \u0014\nthirty, when they would take control of the family land- \u0014\nholdings. (Firm demographic data for almost anything in \u0014\nantiquity is largely out of reach, so such reconstructions \u0014\nare based on comparisons to other pre-modern societies \u0014\nand a small number of scattered sources, such as inscrip- \u0014\ntions that mention ages, literary references, and Egyp- \u0014\ntian census returns.) They would marry women in their \u0014\nlate-teens or early twenties, although rabbinic sources \u0014\ntypically assume that women would marry (or at least be- \u0014\ntroth) close to puberty, which might reflect the practice in \u0014\nlimited circles (t.

    "words": "HALACHA = In the Jewish schools, the body of legal \u0014\ndecisions not directly enacted in the Mosaic law. \u0014\nIt arose from the pious wish to make the law apply \u0014\nto even the most trivial and unexpected situations \u0014\nin daily life. At first handed down by word of \u0014\nmouth, it was later collected and written down and \u0014\nthus gave rise to such treatises as the Mishnah. It \u0014\nforms the bulk of the Talmud. \u0014\n\u0014\nHAGGADAH = The term means \"exegesis\" in general but came \u0014\nto be limited to those portions of the traditional Jewish \u0014\ninterpretation of Scripture which were of a non-prescriptive \u0014\ntype, such as those not included in the Halacha. Generally \u0014\nconsisted of parables, legends, narrative, folklore and \u0014\nother subjects. \u0014\n\u0014\nMISHNAH = Oral teachings of the Jews about the meaning \u0014\nof scripture and its application. The Mishnah included \u0014\nHalacha (above) and Haggadah (above) BUT IS PRIMARILY \u0014\nHalachic. \u0014\n\u0014\nGEMARAH = A collection of discussions on the Mishnah (above.) \u0014\nThe Gemarah included Halacha (above) and Haggadah (above.) \u0014\n\u0014\nTHE TALMUD = The Jewish compilations which embody the Mishnah\u0014\n(above), the oral teaching of the Jews and the Gemarah(above), \u0014\na collection of discussions on the Mishnah. There are two \u0014\nforms of the Talmud -- the Palestinian and the Babylonian. \u0014\nBoth were formed during the 5th century BC, but the Palestinian \u0014\nwas a little earlier than the Babylonian. \u0014\n\u0014\nMIDRASH = A Jewish term referring primarily to exegesis of \u0014\nscripture. The word appears in 2 Chr. 13:22 and 24. Midrash \u0014\nis a technical term that refers to the way in which exegetical \u0014\nmaterial (both of Halacha and Haggadah) were attached to the \u0014\ntext of scripture, as opposed to the Mishnah which was simply \u0014\nan oral teaching about scripture but which was never made a \u0014\npart of scripture. MIDRASH IS THUS EXEGESIS AND EXPOSITION \u0014\nOF SCRIPTURE IN WHICH BOTH HALACHA AND HAGGADAH \u0014\nCAN OCCUR. \u0014\n\u0014\nNote: Scribes, in an effort to preserve much of the \u0014\ntraditional (approved, accepted )interpretation of scripture and \u0014\nmaterial that had been collected around it, began to collect \u0014\nthese Midrashim and put them in formal order. The earliest of \u0014\nthese collections came in the 2nd century A.D. A study of these \u0014\nMidrashim has illuminated many references in the Gospels to \u0014\nJewish beliefs and practices and tended to confirm the general \u0014\naccuracy of the Gospel picture of the then contemporary Judaism. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important for Bible students to understand \"Midrash.\" \u0014\nIt was the \"official\" interpretation of that scripture.

Among them was the Empress Eudoxia, who \npulled strings to get him banished.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe winter before his death, John suffered dreadfully in the \nmountains. No amount of wood on the fire and no pile of blankets on \nhis bed kept his shivering body warm. Still he wrote strong letters \nto the people under his care. Trained as a lawyer, his letters and \nsermons were masterpieces of religious literature. Although he was \nabsent from them, church folk continued to take direction from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo John's enemies, his power still seemed to be too great, his \npresence still too close. Although he was old and frail, his health \nundermined by years of stern living, they decided to move him up by \nthe Euxine (Black) Sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey promised a reward to the guards who transferred him.

I know that you think that the world would be a \nbetter place if women did as they were told and stayed home. But I \nneed to tell you that you are damaging my ministry with these \nnotions. The great gospel mission cannot impact the world in the ways \nGod has planned if you hold back the kingdoms servants. The fields \nare ripe and the work is great, Jesus used to say. Women have played \nsuch a crucial role in my apostolic mission, I could not operate \nwithout their wisdom, partnership and leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey cant go home, there is simply too much at stake, John.\u0014\n\u0014\nEuodia and Syntyche (Phil 4:2-3) cant go home. Sometimes these women \ndont get along, but they have been leaders in evangelism and \noutreach and have worked alongside me to fight for the faith. They \nhave to journey beyond their doorsteps to do this work.\u0014\n\u0014\nJunia cant go home, John. Sorry, she is in prison (again) because of \nher work for the gospel out there in the world (Rom 16:7). In fact, \nthe other apostles have some pretty amazing things to say about her \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nPhoebe cant go home, John. She went to Romeactually, I sent here \nthere (Rom 16:1-2). I sent her with my letter to the Romans and also \nto provide ministry support there. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt might provide a little comfort to you that I sent Nympha to her \nhome in Lycus Valley (Col 4:15); not to do domestic duties (she has \nservants for that), but to be the house church leader and patroness. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn, we must part with any sentimental or nostalgic notions of \nwomanhood where women sweep and cook while the men do the real work \nof ministry. I wish you could meet with the women who contend \nalongside me as co-workers of the gospel mission: they are gifted, \nwise, and brave (when was the last time you were in prison?). \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn, I know you care about the gospel, and we cant do the work with \none hand tied behind our backs. The gospel of Jesus Christ is just \ntoo important. Let the Phoebes, Junias, Euodias, Syntyches, and \nNymphas do their workand you do yours too.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrace to you, John, and let others also know you are a grace-filled \nbeliever as well (remember: grace is generosity mixed with love out \nof the compassion of Christ)\u0014",

In fact, the first President \nborn in a hospital was Jimmy Carter, on October 1, 1924. Americas \n39th President (who served as commander in chief from 1977 to 1981) \nwas born at the Wise Sanitarium in Plains, Georgia, where his mother, \nLillian Carter, worked as a nurse at the time. (The institution was \nlater renamed the Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center in her honor.) \nJimmy Carters upbringing was far from modern, however; when he left \nthe hospital as a baby, he went home to the family farm, which lacked \nplumbing and electricity.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly five other U.S. Presidents have been born in hospitals: Bill \nClinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. \nCarters successor, Ronald Reagan, was born in his parents apartment \nin Tampico, Illinois. George H.W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan, was \nborn at the family home in Milton, Massachusetts, and remains the \nlast U.S. President not born in a hospital.\u0014",

    "words": "The Lord has promised to bless the efforts of those who serve Him \nwith warm devotion and true zeal.  Jonathan Edwards, a preacher in \ncolonial New England, was a shining example of a man with these \nqualities.  Although his voice and pulpit manner were not commanding, \nmany of his sermons had an overwhelming impact upon the people who \nheard him.  His message \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" moved \nhundreds to repentance and salvation.  In fact, according to \nhistorians, that one address helped spark a revival known as \"The \nGreat Awakening.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   From a human standpoint it is hard to account for such \nfar-reaching results from a single discourse.  The speaker was not \ndynamic, nor did he use many gestures; yet he spoke with deep \nsincerity.  Few knew the spiritual preparation involved in that \nsermon.  John Chapman gives us the story: \"For 3 days Edwards had not \neaten a mouthful of food; for 3 nights he had not closed his eyes in \nsleep.  Over and over again he was heard to pray, 'O Lord, give me \nNew England!  Give me New England!'  When he arose from his knees and \nmade his way into the pulpit that Sunday, he looked as if he had been \ngazing straight into the face of God.  Even before he began to speak, \ntremendous conviction fell upon his audience.\"\u0014",
