    "title": "YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY KIDS",
    "words": "Where previous generations considered marriage without children \nunthinkable, ours makes the childless state, if not a positive good, \nat least a worthwhile alternative.\u0014\n\u0014\n This writer, who grew up in a family of seven children, finds it \namazing that people consider her current family large. She has three \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\n   She has discovered that having a lot of children, i.e. more than \none or two, is considered absolutely antisocial and environmentally \nirresponsible.  Living in India, she has seen \"overpopulation\" \nfirst-hand and believes that the real problem is not the huge, hungry \nfamilies of the poor but the small families of higher-class consumers \nwho consider cars, TVs, air- conditioning, and plastic bags as basic \nnecessities of life. People who are really serious about cleaning up \nthe environment should focus on eliminating the things that are \nruining the earth--not children.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The writer admits that child-rearing, like any great undertaking, \ninvolves a good deal of upheaval, but argues that the goal is worth \nit. In the past, choosing to not have children was unthinkable.  Our \ngeneration views childlessness as a viable option, if not a positive \ngood. However, she feels that the fact that most people do want \nchildren (albeit only one or two) indicates that our society does not \nwant to be anti- children.  Yet in today's world it is increasingly \neasy to tuck one child or two into the parents' lives right along \nwith careers, house payments, and adult activities.  A family of \nhalf-a-dozen or so kids is different.  There's always someone who \nneeds something (a nose wiped, a story read, a shoe tied), and the \nparents' needs come last.  Such parental selflessness, which was just \npart of life in the past, seems out of step with contemporary \npsychology ( \"You've got to take care of yourself \") but quite \nconsistent with the Gospel ( \"Whosoever shall lose his life shall \npreserve it \").\u0014\n\u0014\n   In the final analysis, having lots of children is a matter of \ntrust.  Do we have the faith the accept the gifts God sends without \nworrying about our own inadequacies?  Not everyone is capable of \nbeing a good father or mother to many children, \"but those who can \ndeserve our admiration and encouragement.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"You can't have too many kids\" by Jo McGowan.  U.S. Catholic, \nMar 1991.  Pages 34-36.\u0014",

Did you do it?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- I don't believe, if I understand the definition of \"scratch the\u0014\ncar\", that I can say, truthfully, that I scratched the car.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- Well, it wasn't there yesterday, and you drove the car last night,\u0014\nand no one else has driven it since.  How can you explain the scratch?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the\u0014\ncar. While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did \nnot\u0014\nscratch it.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car\u0014\nagainst the mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping \nsound, saw you get out to examine the car, and then drive away.  So \nagain I'll ask you, yes or no, did you scratch the car?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it.\u0014\nWell, you see, I understood you to mean did \"I\" scratch the car.  I \nstand by\u0014\nmy earlier statement, that I did not scratch the car.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- Are you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the \nmailbox?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I\u0014\nmishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact\u0014\nwith the mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent. \u0014\n\u0014\nD- So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- No sir, that's not my statement.  I'll refer you back to my \noriginal\u0014\nstatement that I did not scratch the car.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- But the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a\u0014\nresult of this contact?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- No.  No, that's not correct.  Your question was \"Did I scratch the\u0014\ncar?\" From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of \nthat\u0014\nsentence, I did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was \nmerely present\u0014\nwhen the scratching occurred. So my answer of \"No\" when you asked, \n\"Did\u0014\nI scratch the car\" was legally correct, although I did not volunteer\u0014\ninformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nD- Where did you learn to talk like a complete idiot?\u0014\n\u0014\nS- From The President of the United States.\u0014",

    "words": "I just realized that while children are dogs - loyal and affectionate \n-\u0014\nteenagers are cats. It's so easy to be a dog owner. You feed it, train\u0014\nit, boss it around. It puts it's head on your knee and gazes at you \nas if\u0014\nyou were a Rembrandt painting. It bounds indoors with enthusiasm when \nyou call it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns into a big old \ncat.\u0014\nWhen you tell it to come inside, it looks amazed, as if wondering who \ndied and made you emperor. Instead of dogging your doorsteps, it \ndisappears. You won't see it again until it gets hungry -- then it \npauses on its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn its nose \nup at whatever you're\u0014\nserving. When you reach out to ruffle its head, in that old \naffectionate gesture, it twists away from you, then gives you a blank \nstare, as if trying to remember where it has seen you before.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou, not realizing that the dog is now a cat, think something must be\u0014\ndesperately wrong with it. It seems so antisocial, so distant, sort of\u0014\ndepressed. It won't go on family outings. Since you're the one who\u0014\nraised it, taught it to fetch and stay and sit on command, you assume \nthat you\u0014\ndid something wrong. Flooded with guilt and fear, you redouble your \nefforts\u0014\nto make your pet behave.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly now you're dealing with a cat, so everything that worked before \nnow\u0014\nproduces the opposite of the desired result. Call it, and it runs \naway.\u0014\nTell it to sit, and it jumps on the counter. The more you go toward \nit,\u0014\nwringing your hands, the more it moves away.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of continuing to act like a dog owner, you can learn to behave\u0014\nlike a cat owner. Put a dish of food near the door, and let it come \nto you.\u0014\nBut remember that a cat needs your help and your affection too. Sit \nstill,\u0014\nand it will come, seeking that warm, comforting lap it has not \nentirely\u0014\nforgotten. Be there to open the door for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day your grown-up child will walk into the kitchen, give you a big\u0014\nkiss and say, \"You've been on your feet all day. Let me get those \ndishes for\u0014\nyou.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen you'll realize your cat is a dog again.\u0014",

    "title": "YOU'LL NEVER REACH A PERSON YOU WON'T TOUCH",
    "words": "Touch \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is saying two things I believe. There are two kinds of \u0014\ntouch, the First being physical touch. So often when Jesus wanted \u0014\nto transmit His power of love, he physically touched peoplethe \u0014\nman born blind and the children in Jerusalem being two examples. An \u0014\nembrace, a kiss, an arm on the shoulder, a pat on the backall of \u0014\nthese are ways of expressing a love which goes beyond words. \u0014\nIt is lamentable that we are so paranoid on this subject in \u0014\nAmerica. We have grown touchy about touching. In other parts of the \u0014\nworld they do not seem to have this hang-up. To me, the guideline \u0014\nthat we can use For this is From the 3rd chapter of Ecclesiastes. \u0014\nYou recall the Familiar verses that read: There is a time to live \u0014\nand a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up that \u0014\nwhich has been planted, a time for peace and a time for war, a time \u0014\nto touch and a time to refrain from touching. A sage person will \u0014\nappreciate the difference. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was on the teaching staff at Emory Divinity School a \u0014\npsychologist by the name of Dr. Charles Gerkin. He was quite \u0014\nrenowned within his field, having written several books. All \u0014\nstudents were required to take a course under Dr. Gerkin which \u0014\namounted to small group psychotherapy. Dr. Gerkin taught his \u0014\nstudents, he said: No minister will ever get close to a person who \u0014\nhe is unwilling to physically touch. If you are not willing to \u0014\ntouch a homeless person, or an alcoholic, or a terribly dirty \u0014\nperson, you physiologically are unwilling to minister to them. \u0014\n\u0014\nLarry Daniel, a student of Dr Gerkin and now minister of First \u0014\nUnited Methodist Church in Murray Kentucky, said this teaching \u0014\ncame home to me when I had my first church member with fullblown \u0014\naids back in 1988. I have had one other since then. He was in \u0014\nMethodist Hospital in Memphis and in rather a bad way. I was told \u0014\nby the nurse at the desk that I should put on rubber gloves to go \u0014\ninto his room. Are these necessary? I asked. The nurse replied: I \u0014\nwork with AIDS patients all day long and I would not think of going \u0014\ninto a patients room without wearing gloves. Well, I thought, she \u0014\nis the expert not me, so I put on this latex pair of gloves. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I entered his room he immediately extended his hand, and when \u0014\nI reciprocated that glove was very obvious. Frankly, I was \u0014\nembarrassed. I apologized for it. When I went home that day I \u0014\nreflected upon the words of Dr. Gerkin: you will never draw close \u0014\nto a person who you are unwilling to physically touch. In future \u0014\ntrips to the hospital, therefore, the gloves came off. I simply \u0014\nfelt that I could not be Christs representative in that situation \u0014\nunless there was direct touch contact.\u0014",

(Reuters) - A Florida man who said he was shocked by\u0014\n  13,000 volts of electricity after climbing up a transformer in a \n\"drunken\u0014\n  stupor\" has sued six bars and stores that allegedly sold him \nalcohol.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Ed O'Rourke also named Tampa Electric Co. as a defendant in the \nlawsuit\u0014\n  filed on Thursday in Hillsborough County Circuit Court in Tampa. He \nsaid the\u0014\n  utility did not do enough to prevent him from slipping into a \nfenced, gated and\u0014\n  locked substation and scaling the electrical transformer late one \nnight in May\u0014\n  1996.\u0014\n\u0014\n  O'Rourke said he was thrown more than 40 feet from the transformer \nand\u0014\n  burned over 60 percent of his body, leaving him with permanent \nimmobility in\u0014\n  his right arm and severe scarring. He is seeking unspecified \ncompensation for\u0014\n  emotional and other damages.\u0014\n\u0014\n  The lawsuit said O'Rourke is \"unable to control his urge to drink \nalcoholic\u0014\n  beverages\" and that the bars and stores negligently served or sold \nhim alcohol\u0014\n  despite his \"continual consumption.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  The owner of The Waterhole Sports Bar, one of those O'Rourke sued, \nsaid\u0014\n  he remembers the transformer incident but denied that O'Rourke \ndrank at his\u0014\n  bar the night it happened.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Because he was previously thrown out of here because he was \nwriting on the\u0014\n  bathroom walls,\" bar owner Bruce Martin told the Tampa Tribune.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"I think it's frivolous. I think it's ridiculous,\" he said of the \nlawsuit.\u0014",

I knew it was even \nharder for\u0014\n         my husband, Ken, for pastoring was his lifelong desire. To \nmake\u0014\n         matters worse, its death occurred within the church. Our own \nchurch. \u0014\n\u0014\n         How did we get to this point? Was it the power posturing \nwithin the leadership\u0014\n         of the church? Was it poor communication between the \nleadership and us?\u0014\n         Was it our own naivet, mistakes we made, signals we missed? \nWho knows?\u0014\n         All the reasons we were given, all the excuses that were \nmade couldn't change\u0014\n         the fact that our dream had been killed. Ken was so \ndisillusioned, he wanted\u0014\n         nothing to do with our churchor any church at all. I hurt \nso badly, too, that I\u0014\n         agreed. \u0014\n\u0014\n         The truth of why our original and wonderful plan to do God's \nwork was denied\u0014\n         we may never know until we reach heaven's gates. Now we \nrejoice in his will,\u0014\n         his timing, and his pathway, for we see his glorious \nhandiwork in our lives. Now\u0014\n         we can see that those first dreams were our own, not God's. \nBut at the time, it\u0014\n         wasn't enough to know that someday God would tell us his \nreasons. At that\u0014\n         moment it was heart breaking. It was life destroying. It was \nthick darkness that\u0014\n         nearly overcame us. \u0014\n\u0014\n         We possibly could've died spiritually if God hadn't \nintervened and sent three\u0014\n         angels into our midst. Their namesRod, Jon, and Del. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Most people in the church, both staff and lay, handled our \ntwo year climb out of\u0014\n         the mire of deep disappointment with passive avoidance or \nsugar-sweet\u0014\n         words. Their efforts seemed like nothing more than feeble \nattempts to make us\u0014\n         feel better. We weren't just going to feel better. Soft \nwords weren't going to\u0014\n         change anything. All they did was add to our doubts about \nourselves, our faith,\u0014\n         and our fears that somehow God had it in for us. \u0014\n\u0014\n         I know nowand I think I knew then to some extentthat these \npeople all\u0014\n         meant well. But sympathetic evasion or sugar coating does \nnothing but make\u0014\n         those in pain weaker and sicker. \u0014\n\u0014\n         I taught at the day school in our church, and we had chapel \ndaily. So I was\u0014\n         forced to go to church every day, and in the context of my \nschool and students,\u0014\n         it was a blessing. God provided a way for me to stay in \ntouch with him. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Then came our first angelmy headmaster, Rod. Immediately \nafter we\u0014\n         received our devastating news, and frequently afterward, he \nwould come down\u0014\n         to my classroom and see how I was doing. He often asked \nabout Ken. If I didn't\u0014\n         want to talk, he just let me know that he cared. If I needed \nto talk, he listened.\u0014\n         He didn't offer sweet words or rainbows, and didn't tell me \nto buck up and get\u0014\n         to church. He simply made himself available. He offered a \nhug and a listening\u0014\n         ear, promise of his prayers, and his unconditional support \nto Ken. Because of\u0014\n         his constant care and friendship, I became strong enough to \ngo home and be a\u0014\n         cheerleader for my precious husband who was still unemployed \nand bitter. Rod\u0014\n         kept me from going under, and subsequently, helped me save \nKen from\u0014\n         sinking deeper. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Then there was dear Jon, one of our pastors. Jon had known \npain and\u0014\n         rejection, and he understood because he'd experienced the \ndeath of a dream. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Jon's office was right above mine. So when things were \nparticularly bad, when\u0014\n         Ken was depressed and we were both fairly faithless, I would \ngo up to see Jon.\u0014\n         By his eyes that penetrated me with his intent gaze, I knew \nhe was listening. He\u0014\n         said little, and when he did, he didn't give me glib, soft \nsoap quips to make him\u0014\n         feel like he was ministering to me. Instead he would give me \npractical advice\u0014\n         from a man whose heart had once been broken by a church and \nwhose faith\u0014\n         had been saved by the strength of a praying and devoted \nwife. \u0014\n\u0014\n         \"This will take time,\" he would tell me. \"This will \neventually pass. But I don't\u0014\n         know how long it will take, and it won't be easy. Pray for \nhim and trust that God\u0014\n         will heal in his time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         After several months when Ken still refused to go to any \nchurch, Jon didn't tell\u0014\n         me to send the troops out after him or nag him into coming \nso that his soul\u0014\n         wouldn't wind up in hell. In his mind, Ken was experiencing \nhell. \u0014\n\u0014\n         \"You go to church,\" Jon said. \"Go regularly. It won't be \neasy, but you go.\u0014\n         Eventually Ken will come back.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         So I did go to church. Still unable to return to our own, my \nson and I visited\u0014\n         many churches around town. For months we went alone, just \nthe two of us. Ken\u0014\n         would still have nothing to do with any church at all. \u0014\n\u0014\n         But Jon was right. Out of the blue one Sunday morning, Ken \nsaid, \"I'm going to\u0014\n         go to church with you today.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         I rejoiced and I thanked Jon for his help. He listened, he \nspoke the truth, he\u0014\n         encouraged with honest and realistic words. And he was \nright. We just needed\u0014\n         to trust, to weather the storm, to be patient, and God would \nbe faithful. We still\u0014\n         didn't go to our old church, but nearly every Sunday, our \nfamily was worshiping\u0014\n         in a church as a family. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Ken finally got a job, and his outlook improved \ndramatically. But he was still\u0014\n         angry at our own church, and that grieved me. His anger and \npain were deep.\u0014\n         To him everyone from the church seemed at faulteither \ndirectly, indirectly, or\u0014\n         by association. \u0014\n\u0014\n         What made matters worse was our own church's apparent lack \nof concern at\u0014\n         our absence. A few dear friends stopped by or sent cards on \noccasion, but\u0014\n         mostly the church body stayed away, with no contact for \nmonths. That seeming\u0014\n         rejection added fuel to Ken's pain, and his bitterness \nremained. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Then summer came and I was away from school, so I didn't see \nthe church\u0014\n         building or its occupants for months as we continued to \nvisit other churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n         The next fall, I returned to school and ran into a woman at \nchurch whom I hadn't\u0014\n         seen in nearly a year. Instead of asking about us or how we \nwere doing, she\u0014\n         said, \"We haven't had a good musician in our praise service \nfor months. Can\u0014\n         Ken bring his guitar so we can have some decent music?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         Incensed that she didn't ask how Ken was, didn't mention \nthat she'd missed us,\u0014\n         or didn't even indicate that I was invited to this service, \nI felt my own anger rise.\u0014\n         Forget this stupid place, I thought. Forget all these \nhypocritical people! We\u0014\n         don't need any of them. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Then, not long afterward, I was walking down the hallway of \nthe church to go\u0014\n         downstairs to my classroom when I saw an old friend \napproaching me. He\u0014\n         looked up, saw me, then immediately turned and went the \nother way to avoid\u0014\n         me. Instantly my resentment was deepened. Ken was right! \nThis place isn't for\u0014\n         us! \u0014\n\u0014\n         In a moment of deep self-righteous anger, I visited Del's \noffice, which was on\u0014\n         the floor over my classroom. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Del, a retired pastor who mostly volunteered his time, \nlistened to my tearful\u0014\n         cries of rejection. Yet instead of telling me that it was \nokay to feel sorry for\u0014\n         myself and my family, Del looked at mekindly but firmlyand \nasked, \"Have\u0014\n         you ever thought about what those people are feeling?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         I left his office angrier than ever. I was the one in pain, \nnot them! We were the\u0014\n         ones who'd been hurt! Doesn't anyone care? \u0014\n\u0014\n         For weeks his words penetrated my thoughts. Had I ever \nthought about how\u0014\n         they were feeling? As I heard his words and listened to \nthem, I realized that\u0014\n         God was calling me to grow up and out of this mire. With \nDel's words, God\u0014\n         began to help me see beyond my own hurts. How did these \npeople feel? Was\u0014\n         their pain, although different from Kens and mine, indeed \ndeep in sorrow for\u0014\n         us? Was asking Ken to come the woman's only way to make us \nfeel welcomed\u0014\n         back? It may not have been very tactful, but was that her \nway? \u0014\n\u0014\n         Did my friend turn and walk away because my pain was so \nintense, and he\u0014\n         was hurting so badly himself that he didn't know what to \nsay? \u0014\n\u0014\n         I could honestly then tell myself, No, I admit that I didn't \nthink about what they\u0014\n         were feeling. Soon, Del's words became my prayer. Lord, help \nme to not focus\u0014\n         on me, but on others. \u0014\n\u0014\n         My outlook changed; my attitude changed; even my countenance \nchanged.\u0014\n         And so did that of those around me. By God's mercy, they \nfelt my warmth and\u0014\n         they began to relax and show their acceptance, too. Soon I \nfelt my anger\u0014\n         dissipating, my hurt healing, and my faith increasing. As \nour family continued to\u0014\n         visit other churches, we grew closer together and our hope \nand trust in God\u0014\n         returned mightily. Yet we still hungered for our own \nchurchwe felt that void. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Rod, Jon, and Del enabled me to grow spiritually and \nemotionally so that I\u0014\n         could find the strength and the faith to support Ken. All \nthree consistently sought\u0014\n         Ken out and greeted him with the same opened arms, listening \nears, and\u0014\n         strong supporteven if for a long time their efforts were \nreturned with angry\u0014\n         rejection from Ken. They always returned to visit with him. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Then Jon, only in his 40s, became ill and died. It was sad \nbecause we lost such\u0014\n         a blessed brother and precious friend. But it was wondrous \nfor we knew he\u0014\n         was with the Father in heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\n         On the way home from the funeral, Ken turned to me and said, \n\"It's time. Let's\u0014\n         go back to church. Our church.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         We were welcomed with relieved joy and complete acceptance. \nTears fell\u0014\n         down Ken's cheeks as he said, \"We're finally home.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         Nearly two years had passed. Two years of pain and anguish, \ntwo years of\u0014\n         isolation, two years of wonderful growth. But we were never \nalone. God was\u0014\n         with us the whole time. He didn't send us ministers of words \nthat would make\u0014\n         us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. He didn't cover us with \nsympathetic people\u0014\n         who would make us feel more self-righteous and deserving of \nself-pity. He\u0014\n         didn't send us people whose pie-in-the-sky words would rob \nus of the glorious\u0014\n         spiritual increase we gained through that experience. \nInstead, God made us\u0014\n         strong in him as we climbed back up the mountain with our \nthree heaven-sent\u0014\n         guides. Rod, Jon, and Del didn't make the road easier, but \nthey were our\u0014\n         lifelines to help us rely on the grace of God to come back \nto our church. Under\u0014\n         the loving guidance of our head pastor, Ron, Ken quickly \ngrew to become\u0014\n         active in worship, leadership, and the formation of small \ngroup ministries. \u0014\n\u0014\n         Because of our experiences, Ken and I vow that when we see \nanother in pain,\u0014\n         we'll make every attempt not to offer inane sugary words, \nnor will we\u0014\n         purposefully avoid contact with another in pain. We're not \nalways successful,\u0014\n         but we make every effort to return the favor that God gave \nus in our own\u0014\n         struggles up our mountain. For by the grace of God and the \ngift of his three\u0014\n         angels, he made us strong, able to stand back up on our own \ntwo feet, to climb\u0014\n         the mountains, and dream our dreams again. \"The Lord God is \nmy strength,\u0014\n         and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make \nme to walk upon\u0014\n         mine high place\" (Habakkuk 3:19). \u0014\n\u0014\n         Brenda Morrow is a free-lance writer, teacher, mother, and \ngrandmother. Ken is a\u0014\n         business consultant, and they're happily involved in their \nlocal church.\u0014",

    "title": "YOU WERE MY TEACHER",
    "words": "Her name was Mrs. Thompson. As she stood in front of her 5th grade \nclass\u0014\non the very first day of school, she told the children a lie. Like \nmost\u0014\nteachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all \nthe\u0014\nsame. But that was impossible, because there in the front row, \nslumped in\u0014\nhis seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard. Mrs. Thompson had \nwatched\u0014\nTeddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the \nother\u0014\nchildren, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a \nbath.\u0014\nAnd Teddy could be unpleasant.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in\u0014\nmarking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then\u0014\nputting a big \"F\" at the top of his papers. At the school where Mrs. \nThompson\u0014\ntaught, she was required to review each child's past records and she \nput\u0014\nTeddy's off until last.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise. \nTeddy's\u0014\nfirst grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is a bright child with a ready \nlaugh. He\u0014\ndoes his work neatly and has good manners...he is a joy to be around.\u0014\n\" His second grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is an excellent student, \nwell liked\u0014\nby his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a \nterminal\u0014\nillness and life at home must be a struggle.\" His third grade teacher \nwrote,\u0014\n\"His mother's death had been hard on him. He tries to do his best, \nbut his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon \naffect him if some steps aren't taken. \" \u0014\n\u0014\nTeddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't \nshow much interest in\u0014\nschool. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in \nclass.\" By\u0014\nnow, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of \nherself.\u0014\nShe felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents,\u0014\nwrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he \ngot from a\u0014\ngrocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the\u0014\nother presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a\u0014\nrhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that\u0014\nwas one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's \nlaughter\u0014\nwhen she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and \ndabbing\u0014\nsome of the perfume on her wrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nTeddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say,\u0014\n\"Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to.\" After the\u0014\nchildren left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day, she \nquit\u0014\nteaching reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to \nteach\u0014\nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with \nhim,\u0014\nhis mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the \nfaster he\u0014\nresponded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the \nsmartest\u0014\nchildren in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the\u0014\nchildren the same, Teddy became one of her \"teacher's pets.\" A year \nlater,\u0014\nshe found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that she was \nstill\u0014\nthe best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six years went by \nbefore\u0014\nshe got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished \nhigh\u0014\nschool, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he \never had\u0014\nin his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years after that, she got another letter, saying that while \nthings\u0014\nhad been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and\u0014\nwould soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He \nassured\u0014\nMrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he \never had\u0014\nin his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he \nexplained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a \nlittle further. The letter explained that she was still the best and \nfavorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer\u0014\nthe letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter \nthat spring. Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be \nmarried. He explained that his father had\u0014\ndied a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson \nmight agree\u0014\nto sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the \nmother\u0014\nof the groom. Of course, Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? She wore \nthat\u0014\nbracelet, the one with several rhinestones missing. And she made sure \nshe\u0014\nwas wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on \ntheir\u0014\nlast Christmas together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson \near,\u0014\n\"Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for \nmaking\u0014\nme feel important and showing me that I could make a difference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, \n\"Teddy,\u0014\nyou have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could \nmake a\u0014\ndifference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWherever you go, and whatever you do, you will have\u0014\nthe opportunity to touch and/or change a person's life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have \ntrouble\u0014\nremembering how to fly.\"\u0014",

Show me how much you give to the \nKingdom of\u0014\nGod and then compare that with how much you spend on your personnel \nhobbies.\u0014\nYou see, money is nothing more than congealed personality. It is a \nbarometer\u0014\nof our Christian discipleship. Oh, it's not the only barometer but it \nis a\u0014\nbarometer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWould you believe that there are Methodist ministers in this \nConference who\u0014\ngive little or not financial support to the church.

He said that when the ushers had \ntaken up\u0014\nthe offering one Sunday and brought the plates down to the alter \nrail, he\u0014\ntook the plates and held them up in the air and he gave a prayer: \n\"Lord,\u0014\nregardless of what we say about you, this is really what we say about \nyou,\u0014\nthis is really what we feel about you.

You get interested in something and you invest in it--both \nwith\u0014\ntime and money.

They were met at the Pearly \nGates by\u0014\nSt. Peter, who questioned them. \"What did you used to do back on \nEarth?\"\u0014\nhe asked the first nurse. \"Why do you think you should be allowed into\u0014\nHeaven?\" \u0014\n \u0014\nShe told him, \"I was a nurse at an inner city hospital. I worked to \nbring\u0014\nhealing and peace to many sufferers, especially poor children.\" \u0014\n \u0014\n\"Very noble. You may enter.\" And he ushered her through the gates.

For many years I worked with \na\u0014\nsmall group of doctors and nurses to help people in numerous tribes,\u0014\nhealing them and telling them of God's love.\" The second nurse \nreplied. \u0014\n \u0014\n\"Excellent!\" said St. Peter. And he ushered her through the gates as \nwell.\u0014\nFinally he posed his questions to the third nurse. \u0014\n \u0014\nShe hesitated, then explained, \"I was just a nurse at an HMO.\" \u0014\n \u0014\nSt. Peter considered her answer for a moment, then told her, \"Well, \nyou\u0014\ncan enter, too.\" \u0014\n \u0014\n\"Wow!\" the nurse exclaimed in relief. \"I almost thought you weren't \ngoing\u0014\nto let me in.\" \u0014\n \u0014\n\"Oh, you can certainly come in,\" St. Peter told her, \"but you can only\u0014\nstay for three days.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Cover 5/7/01\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Your brain on alcohol\u0014\n                      A new understanding of how alcohol alters brain\u0014\n                      chemistry may transform treatment of the disease\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Susan Brink \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ask any alcoholic trying to take it just one \nday at a time, and he'll tell you that\u0014\n                      compulsive drinking is a diseaseperiod. That's \nwhat the Big Book said,\u0014\n                      after all, the groundbreaking tome by \nAlcoholics Anonymous that came out\u0014\n                      way back in 1939. And that's what just about \neveryone has believed ever\u0014\n                      since.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But hold on. Technology, not for the first \ntime, is forcing doctors and\u0014\n                      therapists to see things in a new light. With \nthe aid of sophisticated new\u0014\n                      imaging techniques, scientists can look inside \nthe brains of alcoholics at the\u0014\n                      very moment they're being tempted by thoughts \nof cold beers, crisp martinis,\u0014\n                      or fully ripened cabernet francs. The new \nscience shows just how alcohol\u0014\n                      can rewire the circuitry of the brain, eroding \nits ability to feel pleasure and act\u0014\n                      wisely, and replacing it with a locus for \nintense craving and destructive\u0014\n                      behavior. \"Alcoholism is a disease that \ninterferes with home life, work,\u0014\n                      interpersonal relationships, and eventually \nwith health,\" says James West,\u0014\n                      medical director emeritus of the Betty Ford \nCenter in Rancho Mirage, Calif.\u0014\n                      \"It's biological, but it's also psychosocial.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The picture is a scary one. But the good news \nis that it's changing the way\u0014\n                      doctors and specialists are thinking about the \ntreatment of alcoholism. Until\u0014\n                      recently, largely believing they had nothing to \noffer, physicians have left such\u0014\n                      treatment to counselors, recovering drinkers, \nand clergy. The result has\u0014\n                      been a hodgepodge of therapies, some with good \nresults, others merely\u0014\n                      good intentions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now doctors are weighing inbig time. The most \npromising area of research\u0014\n                      is the new drugs that target specific areas of \nthe brain to help ease the\u0014\n                      craving for liquor. One such drugthe first of \nits kindhas shown promise in\u0014\n                      quelling the terrible yen for a drink. \nNaltrexone has been approved by the\u0014\n                      Food and Drug Administration and is available \nby prescription. Two more\u0014\n                      drugs that also may ease craving are being \ntested in clinical trials.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But even proponents of pharmaceutical treatment \nsay drugs aren't the whole\u0014\n                      answer. Most alcoholics will still need \ncounseling or 12-step programs to\u0014\n                      help confront the harm they may have caused or \nthe growing up they need to\u0014\n                      do. Yet just as Prozac got general \npractitioners interested in depression,\u0014\n                      anticraving drugs might get more physicians \ninvolved in alcoholism\u0014\n                      treatment. Says Keith Humphreys, a psychologist \nand addiction researcher\u0014\n                      at Stanford University: \"Doctors want to be \nable to do something medically.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brain pain. The new brain-imaging technology \nwill be the key to determining\u0014\n                      how much, and how effectively, doctors can \nhelp. Some 14 million people in\u0014\n                      the United States are alcoholics or abuse \nalcohol. They are skid-row bums\u0014\n                      and lace-curtain drunks, senseless rebels and \ncharming rogues. They chill\u0014\n                      Louis Roederer Cristal champagne in silver \nbuckets and swill Budweiser\u0014\n                      from plastic cups. They tell themselves they \nare not alcoholics because they\u0014\n                      never drink before 5 p.m., or because they make \nit to work every day, or\u0014\n                      because dinner is always on the table on time. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But their excuses can't overcome the damage \nthey do. Inga fell down a flight\u0014\n                      of stairs with her infant in her arms. Mark had \nfive wives, and five divorces.\u0014\n                      Betty polished off a pint of vodka, then \ncarpooled fourth graders from soccer\u0014\n                      practice. Jeffrey committed strong-armed \nrobbery. April, once shy, took off her\u0014\n                      clothes and danced for money. Martha threatened \nher husband with a\u0014\n                      carving knife. Paula slipped into the kitchen \nduring dinner parties to swill\u0014\n                      down the last drops of wine left in dirty \ngoblets. All are recovering alcoholics\u0014\n                      and they are ashamed of these recollections.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For active alcoholics, drinking trumps reason. \nIt distorts judgment. It severs\u0014\n                      the connection between behavior and \nconsequence. It lays waste to\u0014\n                      marriages, friendships, and careers. It leaves \nchildren stranded. For\u0014\n                      alcoholics, love and logic can't hold a candle \nto liquor.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And the damage is not limited to others. Over \ntime, addiction becomes an\u0014\n                      enervating trial for the drinker. \"I would \nalways drink out of glasses that were\u0014\n                      opaque so my husband couldn't tell what I was \ndrinking,\" says Jackie Clarke,\u0014\n                      sober for 16 years. \"I would put vodka in my \nwine because wine seemed\u0014\n                      more acceptable. I was always thinking about \nwhat I was going to drink,\u0014\n                      when I was going to drink, hiding bottles so my \nhusband wouldn't know how\u0014\n                      much I drank. It was exhausting.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Just where alcohol abuse crosses the line into \naddiction remains blurry.\u0014\n                      John Schwarzlose, president of the Betty Ford \nCenter, has his own simple\u0014\n                      criterion: An alcohol abuser might get stopped \nonce while driving under the\u0014\n                      influence, and the experience will be \nmortifyingand sobering. For an\u0014\n                      alcoholic, how- ever, the embar- rassment is \nnot enough. \"Two or more\u0014\n                      DUIsthat is an alcoholic,\" says Schwarzlose. \nBut it is often a mean- ingless\u0014\n                      distinction to family members, loved ones, and \nemployers. They know that\u0014\n                      excessive drinking can ruin lives through \nbetrayal, broken promises, lost\u0014\n                      jobs, car accidents, and a host of other \npersonal tragedies.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Pure pleasure. Alcoholism is a disease that can \nstart with a first drink. With\u0014\n                      that drink, one fork in the road appears, \nleading some to a future of\u0014\n                      alcoholism and others to a lifetime of \nenjoyable, moderate drinking. The\u0014\n                      brains of people genetically predisposed to \nalcoholism may be unable to\u0014\n                      naturally produce adequate dopamineone of the \nbrain chemicals that make\u0014\n                      us feel pleasure. For them, the first drink is \na hit of dopamine, and of\u0014\n                      pleasure, they haven't felt as strongly before. \nAnd then, it's love at first tipple.\u0014\n                      \"The first time I got drunk, I was 11 years \nold,\" says Clarke, of Falls Church,\u0014\n                      Va. \"I was babysitting with a girlfriend. We \nbroke into her father's liquor\u0014\n                      cabinet, and then we had a food fight. I never \nhad so much fun in my life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Only 1 in 9 people who drink continues the path \nto alcoholism. Those who\u0014\n                      do succumb are disproportionately related to \nalcoholics; an estimated 50\u0014\n                      percent to 60 percent of those who become \nalcoholics have a genetic\u0014\n                      predisposition. \"My father was an alcoholic,\" \nsays Mark Abel, 50, in treatment\u0014\n                      for alcoholism at Operation Par Village in \nLargo, Fla. \"He worked hard and\u0014\n                      he drank hard.\" But environment plays a \nsignificant role, too. \"When I was a\u0014\n                      kid, I used to get my dad beers,\" recalls Abel. \n\"I'd get the first couple of sips\u0014\n                      on the way back from the refrigerator. I loved \nthe taste.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That's because alcohol heads to the mind's seat \nof emotion and pleasure,\u0014\n                      called the nucleus accumbens, which also houses \ngratification of hunger,\u0014\n                      thirst, and sex. There, like other addictive \ndrugs, it increases the\u0014\n                      concentration of dopamine, a pleasure-causing \nchemical, in the brain's\u0014\n                      reward circuits. But recent research shows that \nalcohol also opens the\u0014\n                      floodgates on other feel-good chemicals, \nincluding serotonin. It disturbs\u0014\n                      levels of glutamate, which can make people feel \nhigh, and then it interferes\u0014\n                      with other chemicals that can make people feel \ntired. Enoch Gordis, director\u0014\n                      of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism, calls alcohol \"the\u0014\n                      most widespread and damaging substance we have \nin society.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once excessive drinking begins, the new \nresearch shows, alcohol begins\u0014\n                      resculpting the brain regardless of family \nhistory. \"In even nonsusceptible\u0014\n                      individuals, chronic use may create addiction,\" \nsays psychiatrist Raymond\u0014\n                      Anton, scientific director of the Charleston \nAlcohol Research Center at the\u0014\n                      Medical University of South Carolina. People \nwho binge several times a\u0014\n                      weekfive or more drinks in a day for a man, \nfour or more for a woman,\u0014\n                      according to the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholismare\u0014\n                      clearly at risk, and they can also suffer other \nconsequences like impaired\u0014\n                      concentration, slowed reflexes, disrupted \nsleep, and high blood pressure.\u0014\n                      There's no evidence, however, that moderate \ndrinkingtwo drinks a day for\u0014\n                      men, one drink for womenalters brain chemistry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Want becomes need. People often start down the \nroad to alcoholism in their\u0014\n                      teens or 20s. But stress later in lifea \ndivorce in their 30s, a job loss in the\u0014\n                      40s, the death of a loved one anytimecan also \npush a life off course. At this\u0014\n                      point, the amygdala, the part of the brain that \nhelps the body respond to\u0014\n                      stress, may be calmed by alcohol. But though \nthese drinkers may start later\u0014\n                      in life, heavy drinking likely causes similar \nbrain alterations. Barbara Halsey,\u0014\n                      47, didn't begin to drink heavily until she \ndivorced in her early 30s. At first, it\u0014\n                      was for the relief and fun of partying. Pretty \nsoon, she was drinking almost\u0014\n                      every night. \"I'd stay out late. I found myself \nlosing jobs,\" she says. However it\u0014\n                      starts, heavy drinking eventually robs alcohol \nof its value as a brain treat.\u0014\n                      Want becomes need. The drinker needs ever more \nalcohol to provide the\u0014\n                      same high until, eventually, the high is gone. \n\"There was a time in my life\u0014\n                      when chemicals did something for me. And then \none magical day, they\u0014\n                      stopped,\" says Jay Ehrlich, who has been sober \nfor 16 years. \"And I spent an\u0014\n                      inordinate amount of time trying to cross back \nover and get it back.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      At this point, recent brain-imaging studies \nshow, the primitive nucleus\u0014\n                      accumbens, with its hunger for pleasure, may \nultimately not be the main\u0014\n                      player. New pathways have been formed, adapted \nto function in alcohol's\u0014\n                      service. Now, researchers believe, the frontal \ncortex, the brain's executive\u0014\n                      branch responsible for decisions and memory, \nholds a mere memory of\u0014\n                      pleasure, as insistent as the original \npleasure, and demands another drink.\u0014\n                      Alcohol may also put its stamp on areas of the \nfrontal cortex involved in\u0014\n                      judgment and impulse control.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      From the frontal cortex, it's a short hop to \nthe basal ganglia, the brain center\u0014\n                      that when wired differently makes \nobsessive-compulsive people continually\u0014\n                      wash their hands or avoid stepping on cracks. \nThe latest results from\u0014\n                      laboratory-animal studies suggest that \nalcoholism may use the same neural\u0014\n                      pathways that lead to compulsive behaviors. The \nbrain then demands more\u0014\n                      and more alcohol, regardless of reason and \nconsequences. \"In the end, I'd\u0014\n                      drink by myself. I'd hide \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein in the \nclosets, under the porch of the house. It\u0014\n                      wasn't fun anymore. It went from a luxury to a \nmust,\" says Michael Small, 40,\u0014\n                      of Zephyrhills, Fla., who drank for more than \n20 years before entering\u0014\n                      treatment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some people summon the will to stop from \nwithin. \"What shocks people is\u0014\n                      that the vast majority of people who recover \nfrom alcoholism never sought\u0014\n                      any treatment at all,\" says Stanford's \nHumphreys. But a lot of people can't\u0014\n                      quit on their own. The ability to stop is as \nindividual as each person's internal\u0014\n                      motivation. Ehrlich, for instance, had spent \nmuch of his adulthood drinking\u0014\n                      and using drugs while he lived the high life of \na rock-and-roll promoter. He\u0014\n                      tried quitting on his own, tossing pills and \nbottles into a casket at an\u0014\n                      elaborate \"wake\" for his addictions. Finally, \nhe went to the Betty Ford Center\u0014\n                      for treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Banishing the pink elephant. About half a \nmillion people each year make a\u0014\n                      similar decision, seeking a treatment slot at \nBetty Ford, the Hazelden\u0014\n                      Foundation, Par Village, Delancey Street in San \nFrancisco, and a host of\u0014\n                      other inpatient and outpatient treatment \ncenters. Up to a million more get in\u0014\n                      touch with Alcoholics Anonymous. For the most \nimpaired, the first step is to\u0014\n                      get weaned from alcohol. This is the time when \npatients can become\u0014\n                      leg-jiggling, arm-scratching, face-touching, \nwhirling dervishes of inattention,\u0014\n                      seeing the \"pink elephants\" of lore. They can \nhave tremors,\u0014\n                      hallucinationseven seizures. The brain has \ngrown accustomed to an\u0014\n                      artificial balance between chemicals that cause \nexcitation and those that\u0014\n                      cause inhibition. Sudden withdrawal of alcohol \nalters the balance in favor of\u0014\n                      excitation. Valium can help, but it, too, is \naddictive. Some nonaddictive\u0014\n                      anticonvulsants, like carbamazepine, \ndivalproex, and gabapentin, can also\u0014\n                      ease the passage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Withdrawal is the relatively easy part, \ngenerally lasting three days or less.\u0014\n                      Dealing with the ongoing verbal dual between \nthe devil on one shoulder and\u0014\n                      the angel on the other is the hard part. The \nbrain has been reprogrammed to\u0014\n                      compulsively want a drink, and hundreds of \nindividual thoughts or actions\u0014\n                      can trigger the cravinga walk past the \nneighborhood tavern or even seeing\u0014\n                      a \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein \ncommercial. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Subconscious desires. Craving can haunt \nrecovering alcoholics even in\u0014\n                      sleep. \"I had a dream last night that my friend \nmet me at the airport with a\u0014\n                      huge glass of champagne,\" says Monica, 40-ish, \ntall, slim, and regal, who is\u0014\n                      checking out after 28 days at the Betty Ford \nCenter. Such dreams are an\u0014\n                      indication that craving never rests. \"Dreams \nare drives that call out for\u0014\n                      satisfaction,\" says Brian Johnson, a Boston \npsychoanalyst who specializes\u0014\n                      in addiction treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mark George, along with Anton, at the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina\u0014\n                      has done some of the first brain imaging \nshowing the power that the mere\u0014\n                      thought of a drink can have on a recovering \nalcoholic's brain. He put\u0014\n                      alcoholics and nonalcoholics inside an MRI, \nthen showed them\u0014\n                      photographs of martinis, \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein bottles, \nor glasses of wine. They were also\u0014\n                      shown pictures of soft drinks and coffee, and a \nthird set of neutral images. In\u0014\n                      alcoholics, the frontal cortex lights up with \ndesire at the alcohol images. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Drugs can help dampen that desire, although no \none knows exactly how. An\u0014\n                      early drug called Antabuse, now little used, \nmade patients sick when they\u0014\n                      took a drink but didn't kill the craving. \nNaltrexone appears to. Originally used\u0014\n                      to counteract opiates like heroin, it might \nwork by blocking a pleasurable\u0014\n                      surge of natural opiates released in the brain \nby an image or thought of\u0014\n                      alcohol. The drug may have worked for Scott \nCampagna, 23, of Atlanta, who\u0014\n                      participated in an ongoing trial. Campagna says \nhe binges about twice a\u0014\n                      weekseven or eight beers and two or three hard \ndrinks. \"I feel I could quit or\u0014\n                      cut back if I wanted to,\" he says. He believes \nhe got the drug, not a placebo,\u0014\n                      because he thought less about drinking the week \nhe took it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another substance, acamprosate, has shown \npromising results in Europe.\u0014\n                      And ondansetron was found to reduce drinking \nand increase days of\u0014\n                      abstinence in clinical trials. Yet for now, \nalcoholism treatment centers are\u0014\n                      reluctant to prescribe drugs. At the Betty Ford \nCenter, for example,\u0014\n                      counselors might sometimes suggest naltrexone \nto fight cravings if\u0014\n                      follow-up contact shows that a patient has \nrepeatedly relapsed. But the drug\u0014\n                      is not used during the stay there. Helping \nheavy drinkers cut back may not be\u0014\n                      enough to treat actual alcoholics, say \ncounselors. Most experts think\u0014\n                      moderate drinking is not an option for a true \nalcoholic\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Talk therapies. Experts are betting that new \ngenerations of drugs will work\u0014\n                      best when combined with counseling and group \ntherapy. These talking\u0014\n                      therapies, researchers believe, help the brain \nlearn to compensate for the\u0014\n                      damage done, just as rehabilitation helps a \nstroke victim's brain relearn\u0014\n                      speech or movement. Many alcoholics must \nrelearn how to accept\u0014\n                      responsibility for themselves and how to behave \ntoward others. Almost all\u0014\n                      group programs incorporate the 12 steps of AA, \nwhich help people just\u0014\n                      starting their recovery get support from \nveterans of the struggle. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      A large-scale study in 1997 that tested three \nkinds of treatmentscognitive\u0014\n                      therapy, motivational therapy, and group AA \nmeetingsfound that roughly half\u0014\n                      the patients in each group reduced their \ndrinking or avoided heavy drinking.\u0014\n                      (Some centers, such as Betty Ford, have success \nrates of more than 60\u0014\n                      percent.) Other chronic diseases, such as \ndiabetes and asthma, have\u0014\n                      similar relapse rates after medical treatment, \naccording to a study published\u0014\n                      last fall in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association. A setback isn't\u0014\n                      cause to give up. \"There is no, I repeat no, \ntreatment [for alcoholism] that is\u0014\n                      finished at the end of a residential stay,\" \nsays A. Thomas McLellan, author of\u0014\n                      the JAMA study. \"There aren't cures here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Treatment experts say patients and families \nshould be skeptical of\u0014\n                      programs that promise much higher success \nratessay 80 percent or more.\u0014\n                      Experts also caution against programs that \nforbid drugs of any sort, even\u0014\n                      such nonaddictive medications as some \nantidepressants, which can help\u0014\n                      some alcoholics.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      No matter how much scientists learn about the \nbrain changes behind\u0014\n                      alcoholism, much of the work of recovery still \nwill fall to patients. And so will\u0014\n                      the rewards. \"When I was drinking, my life was \na roller coaster, and when I\u0014\n                      was first sober, I thought sobriety would be a \ndull, flat line,\" says Clarke. Yet\u0014\n                      since she stopped drinking, she has lived in \nHawaii for a year, traveled to\u0014\n                      sunny climes with friends, and painted desert \nscenes in California and\u0014\n                      cherry blossoms in Virginia. \"Now, instead of \njust daydreaming, drunk on the\u0014\n                      couch, about wonderful things I would do, I do \nwonderful things.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      U.S. News spoke to dozens of alcoholics. Some \nagreed to be fully identified,\u0014\n                      others by their first names only.

One story goes like this. One of Mayor Daly's speech \nwriters came\u0014\nin and demanded a raise. Mayor Daly responded as could be expected. \nHe said\u0014\n\"I'm not going to give you a raise. You are getting paid more than \nenough\u0014\nalready. It should be enough for you that you are working for a great\u0014\nAmerican hero like myself.\" And that was the end of it...or so the \nmayor\u0014\nthought.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks later Mayor Daly was on his way to give a speech to a \nconvention\u0014\nof veterans. The speech was going to receive nationwide attention. \nNow one\u0014\nother thing Mayor Daly was famous for was not reading his speeches \nuntil he\u0014\ngot up to deliver them. So there he stood before a vast throng of \nveterans\u0014\nand nationwide press coverage. He began to describe the plight of the\u0014\nveterans. \"I'm concerned for you. I have a heart for you. I am deeply\u0014\nconvinced that this country needs to take care of its veterans. So, \ntoday I\u0014\nam proposing a seventeen point plan that includes the city, state and\u0014\nfederal government, to care for the veterans of this country.\" Now by \nthis\u0014\ntime everyone, including Mayor Daly, was on the edge of their seat to \nhear\u0014\nwhat the proposal was. He turned the page and saw only these words: \n\"You're\u0014\non your own now, you great American hero.\"\u0014",

    "title": "YOU SAY CHOICE, I SAY MURDER",
    "words": "You Say Choice, I Say Murder\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore prolife arguments can reach the undecided American, we have \ngot to look at the language we use.\u0014\nBy Guy M. Condon | posted 01/22/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will never succeed in changing our nation's abortion policies and \npractice until we change the language of the debate. Rhetoric is the \nstuff that our private and public lives are made of. The words we \nuse, the way we talk, the stories we tell will ultimately determine \nwhat we believe and what we do.\u0014\n\u0014\nProponents of abortion have succeeded in selling their version of the \nmoral context for the debate. In voicing their positions, they have \nrepeatedly used moral terms such as compassion, freedom, and choice, \nso that these words have become part of a shared public vocabulary, \nto the point where their rhetoric appeared generously-\"fundamental \nright to choose\" and \"freedom to choose\"-in the wording of Justice \nHarry Blackmun's opinion in Roe v. Wade back in 1973.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is time for prolife advocates to understand the power of words and \nto go on the offensive. We have got to make our appeal for life, not \njust to the courts and legislatures, but to the hearts and minds of \nthe American people. We have got to reach that 60 percent in the \nmiddle, those who are either uninformed, misinformed, unmoved, or \nundecided.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are taking part in a great historic battlea cultural battlea \nsocial war to define what America is and what human life is as we \nenter the next millennium. And this battle is being fought not just \nwith legislation and legal argumentation, but with words flowing to \nand from the public at large.\u0014\n\u0014\nReclaiming an ancient art\u0014\n\u0014\nUnderstanding the power of words is nothing new. In the fifth century \nB.C., the Greek philosopher Democritus taught that \"word is a shadow \nof deed.\" Plato said the same thing, only negatively, \"False words \nare not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.\" \nThe biblical letter of James tells us that those who can master their \ntongues can master anything. And Shakespeare warned, \"In law, what \nplea so tainted and corrupt / But, being season'd with a gracious \nvoice, / Obscures the show of evil?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of the struggle over slavery, Lincoln said something \nthat mirrors our predicament about the use of language in the \nabortion debate today:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world has never had a good definition of the word liberty. And \nthe American people just now are much in want of one. We all declare \nfor liberty, but in using the same words we do not mean the same \nthing . . . Each of the things is by the respective parties called by \ntwo different and incompatible means, liberty and tyranny.\u0014\n\u0014\nNazi leaders certainly understood the pernicious power of words when \nthey called their facility for carrying victims to the killing \ncenters \"The Charitable Transport Company for the Sick,\" or when they \ndefined the genocide of Jews as \"the final solution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Martin Luther King, Jr., understood the positive power of words \nand symbols when he delivered his speech for civil rights before the \nLincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963. As you read the following \nexcerpt, listen for the allusions to those words and images held dear \nby all Americans:\u0014\n\u0014\nThis situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the \nvalley of despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I say to you, my friends, that even though we must face the \ndifficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this \nnation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed-we \nhold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a \nnation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but \nby the content of their character.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing \nwith new meaning-my country 'tis of thee; sweet land of liberty; of \nthee I sing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who heard him that day found themselves drawn away from their \ntroubles and toward a vision of the way the world should be. And that \nis what rhetoric should do: present a case or a story that allows \nlisteners to see anew, to gain a fresh perspective on the matter at \nhand.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the goal of rhetoric is to persuade, this is not the only \ncriterion for judging success. If we want to direct the flow of \nsocial meaning, we must be sure that our words and stories are in \nfact connected to the real experiences of people. Our communication \nhas to do with our sense of belonging to a community. Our communion, \nso to speak, comes through our private and public dialogue about \nshared hopes and concerns. We must prove, not just say, that we have \neverybody's interests in mind.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur task is to use words and stories to create a vision of a prolife \nworld where the least among us is protected and cared for. But we \nneed to capture the public imagination to do so.\u0014\n\u0014\nA history of abortion rhetoric\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore we talk about how to create that vision, we need to review the \nevolution of language in the abortion debate during the last 30 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1962, a story surfaced that would begin a dramatic shift in the \nway Americans would think about abortion. Before, abortion had been \nalmost universally seen as an act that killed a child and was thus \ncriminal. Afterward, the law prohibiting abortion was perceived as an \ninjustice that denied help to desperate women.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe subject was Sherri Finkbine, the \"Romper Room\" television host \nfrom Phoenix, who loved children and who had four of her own. Not \nknowing the risk involved, she took her husband's thalidomide \ntranquilizer while pregnant with her fifth child. It was only later \nthat she read about the horrible deformities caused by the drug.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe sought an abortion with the consent of her doctor and local \nhospital. But she wanted civil authorities to approve publicly of \nwhat she was doing. When she could not get a public statement to that \neffect, she flew to Sweden, as one newspaper put it, \"to find a more \ncivilized attitude toward her plight.\" And she got the abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinkbine was intelligent and attractive. Happily married, she \nrepresented an American ideal of a nurturing mother and teacher of \nchildren. She became a heroine, a moral woman up against an immoral \nlaw. A woman who, in Sherri's own words, \"couldn't, in all \nconscience, bring into the world a child whose chances seemed so \nutterly hopeless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the course of telling her story, reporters first referred to \nFinkbine's unborn child as a baby, but later as a fetus. Parts of the \nstory went unreported: there was only a 20 percent chance that her \nbaby would be deformed at all. And several people offered to adopt \nher child, no matter what.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Gallup poll taken shortly after the incident showed that 52 percent \nof Americans thought she had done the right thing. For the first \ntime, a majority of Americans believed abortion could be a positive \nact.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to Sherri Finkbine's situation, stories abounded during \nthis period about desperate women taking desperate and often fatal \nmeasures to get abortions. Perhaps the most gruesome was the 1962 \nstory about a woman who died during an abortion and was cut up into \npieces, bones and flesh, and stuffed down a sewage line.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1965 to the present, proabortion communicators have also worked \nat integrating the right to abortion with the aspirations of the \nwomen's movement. Again, they have worked at soliciting public \nsupport by using the most inclusive public vocabulary possible. Equal \nrights and discrimination now pepper the discussion. The newly \ncreated concept of \"women's reproductive rights\" has quickly gained \npopularity and usurped the fetus's right to life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of equality with men and personal reproductive freedom came \ntogether in the word choice. How's Molly Yard furthered the concept \nby claiming that the \"antichoice zealots\" are trying to force women \ninto \"compulsory pregnancy.\" That is, women, like men, should be free \nto walk away from sexual encounters without fear of being stuck with \nthe reproductive consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew realize the sharp contradiction between the push to link abortion \nwith women's rights and the claims of historical feminism. Susan B. \nAnthony, a leader for the women's suffrage movement in the late \nnineteenth century, referred to abortion as \"the horrible crime of \nchild murder.\" Alice Paul, who drafted the original version of the \nEqual Rights Amendment, called abortion \"the ultimate exploitation of \nwomen.\" Through decades, the women's movement consistently used a \nrhetoric that focused on equal rights and social reforms that would \nbenefit women without disadvantaging children. It is only within the \nlast 30 years that feminism began using the vocabulary of \"choice\" as \nthe public cry for equality.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the 1980s, even television got into the act of shaping public \ndiscourse on abortion. Mostly, television has promoted the choice \nmythology. For better or for worse, TV functions as a primary source \nof shared stories that define what it means to be an American.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne episode of the now-syndicated \"Cagney and Lacey\" provides a good \nexample. In this episode, Detective Sgt. Chris Cagney, who is \nCatholic, protects an indigent, Hispanic woman seeking an abortion \nand tracks down an abortion-clinic bomber. Cagney's father urges his \ndaughter to get off the case, because the \"big boys\" downtown, who \nare Irish Catholic, would not like her involvement in this abortion \nactivity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo right away we have older men and the church pitted against women \nand their right to abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Herrera, the Hispanic woman, initially contacts Cagney for help \nin getting through picket lines to get her abortion. She is poor. Her \nhusband is on disability. She says, \"I don't want to be on welfare. I \nwant to finish business school.\" Here we get the economic \njustification for abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe abortionist does his part, too, in voicing the abortion rhetoric. \nHe says the prolifers are so worried about the unbornbut what about \nthe babies that are already here? After the bombing of his clinic, he \nsays, \"Now what kind of brand of compassion forces a child . . . to \ngo through an unwanted pregnancy?\" Choice now becomes compassion for \nthe child.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the last 30 years, prolife Christians have been on the defensive. \nThe proabortion forces have done a good job in telling their stories \ntheir way, and the media have gone along. Proabortionists have shaped \nthe language, and therefore have shaped the beliefs, policies, and \nbehavior of Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nReversing images\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, prolife advocates have failed to capture public \nimagination as we make our plea on behalf of the unborn. The Gideon \nProject abortion-clinic bombings in Pensacola, Florida, on Christmas \nmorning, 1984, show why. Their impact on public memory, as exploited \nby the rhetoric of abortion advocates, has lasted to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bombers described their action as being in accord with \"God's \nwill\" and \"a gift to Jesus on his birthday.\" Such language reinforced \nthe activists' own commitment, but projected a public image of \nextremism and violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the more strident activists of the prolife movement have yet \nto understand that they discourage rather than encourage a prolife \nconsensus in the public mind. As Molly Yard helps the prolife cause \nwhen she affirms China's coercive abortion policies, Operation Rescue \nleader Randall Terry helps the proabortion cause when he advocates \nwhat sounds a lot like theocracy to humanistic and otherwise \npluralistic ears. Such language and law-breaking rescue activity \nserve the opposition's stereotyping of prolifers as religious \nzealots, a gang of fanatics led by bullying white males indifferent \nto the needs and concerns of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch images have proven so powerful that the public, according to a \nrecent Gallup poll, more typically sees those trying to protect \nunborn children as more violent than those who promote abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how do we go about reshaping public sentiment and policy?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo overcome the inertia of the proabortion rhetoric, leaders of the \nprolife movement need to tell what they are for, rather than what \nthey are against. Proabortion leaders say they are for compassion, \nhelping the oppressed, \"a fundamental right to choose,\" equality for \nwomen, and a right to privacy. At the same time prolifers appear to \nbe angry and uncaring, against abortion, against women, and even \nagainst the democratic process if it yields policies that conflict \nwith religious beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, public voices must say in reasonable and compassionate terms \nthat the prolife movement is for a public good that benefits \neveryone. Leaders must use language and stories that build a public \nvision of caring, which embraces women and children, before and after \nbirth.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must show that we are caring, sensitive, and inclusive. We must \naffirm all human life. That includes women burdened by unwanted \npregnancy. It includes feminists. It includes members of the black \nand Hispanic communities. We must use prolife language that resonates \nwith all of these groups if we are to be successful. As soon as we \nappear to be speaking on behalf of the partisan, Catholic, and \nevangelical Religious Right, we will lose the potential for \ndeveloping a shared public vocabulary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith few exceptions, it must be women who voice the new vision in the \npublic arena. Contrary to Molly Yard's claim that abortion is \"for \nthe women of America,\" a 1990 poll conducted by the Gallup \norganization shows that more women hold strong prolife, rather than \nproabortion, convictions. The poll also shows that a higher \npercentage of women are prolife than men. (The group that is most \nconsistently prochoice is actually single men.) Women-to-women public \ncommunications will build on this prolife conviction, which is \nalready inherent in a large segment of the female population.\u0014\n\u0014\nProlifers need to talk about women and their unborn children as being \nvictimized by abortion. Abortion policy and practice have liberated \nmen to have sex without the potential obligation of providing for the \nwoman or her child. \"Decency\" merely requires that he pay for her to \nget rid of \"her\" problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must communicate that it is prolife advocates who are actually the \nones providing choices to women undergoing crisis pregnancies. \nAbortion advocates are not offering choices; they are offering \nabortionperiod. All too often there is pressure from a pregnant \nwoman's family, friends, employer, or an abortion counselor to use \nher \"right\" to abortion to solve her problem. She gets the message \nthat she owes it to herself, to everyone else involved, and even to \nthe unwanted child that can be \"prevented.\" In fact, such pressures \nhave caused three out of ten pregnant women to \"choose\" abortion.\u0014\n\"Choice\" advocates have yet to provide the support necessary for \nwomen to make any other choice than abortion. They have even resisted \nthe passage of informed consent laws that would ensure women have all \nthe relevant information they need to make an informed choice to \nabort. This would include information about the stage of development \nof an unborn child, risks associated with abortion, the potential of \nfetal pain, and the readily available Alternatives to abortion.\u0014\nThe prolife movement needs to talk compassionately about the \nlegitimate needs of women who are faced with crisis pregnancy, \nespecially since prolifers are the ones actually involved in \nresponding to such needs. There are more crisis pregnancy centers in \nthe United States than there are abortion clinics. It is the prolife \nadvocates who are providing comes and support for unwed mothers, \nadoption services, and even counseling or women suffering from \npostabortion syndrome. As evidenced by leaders of Women Exploited by \nAbortion, the victims of the abortion system may prove the most \neffective in voicing the \"caring vision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProlife influencers must learn to utilize the power of the media \nbetter to promote their vision. Historically, abortion advocates have \ndone a better job in the care and feeding of journalists. At the same \ntime, prolife advocates have distrusted them, and have assumed the \nmedia will align with the opposition. Yet most editors and reporters, \nregardless of their personal views, wish to adhere to professional \nstandards, including objectivity. Therefore, most will respond \nfavorably to prolife advocates who respectfully point out \ninaccuracies or biases in their coverage and provide alternative \nsources and stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nTelling stories\u0014\n\u0014\nConvincing rhetoric also calls for personifying unborn children \nthrough stories about real people. For example, Julie Makimaa was \nconceived when her mother was raped about 25 years ago. Julie's \nmother put her up for adoption, and Julie grew up in what she \ndescribes as a loving home. At age seven she learned she was adopted. \nBut it was not until she was an adult that she found her biological \nmother and heard about the circumstances of her conception.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulie has spoken out against rape as a justification for abortion. \nBecause of her own story, she speaks with an authority that the \npublic and even legislators find hard to ignore. Julie testified \nbefore the Louisiana legislature last year and convinced a strong \nmajority to support abortion legislation that would have disallowed \nabortion for most reasons, including rape, had it been signed into \nlaw by Governor Roemer. Legislators realized that insisting on a rape \nexception meant denying the value of Julie's existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nProlife advocate Congressman Henry Hyde proved rhetorically astute \nwhen he eloquently supported family-leave legislation before Congress \nlast year. He said, \"If a working woman becomes pregnant, she needs \nto have job security, an incentive to have that child, not to \nexterminate that child so she won't lose a job. A social policy that \nencourages motherhood is good.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe TV program \"Life Goes On,\" which includes Corky Thatcher as a \n22-year-old with Down syndrome, is adding much to our prolife \nnarrative. Audiences are responding warmly with their hearts and \nminds to his character. Many people watching Corky are believing, \nperhaps for the first time, that retardation has little to do with \ndefining the worth of an individual life.\u0014\n\u0014\nWinning the battle for public opinion and policy will depend on \nwinning the battle for linguistics. We cannot make up for our past \nfailure to shape public discourse and conviction by going directly to \nthe legislatures. Lincoln once said, \"In a government like ours, \npublic sentiment is everything, determining what laws and decisions \ncan and cannot be enforced.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOur goal should be to shape public discourse and build a ground swell \nof public conviction. With public conviction goes judicial \nconviction. And it is only then that we will be able to achieve our \nlegislative goals for providing a comprehensive legal shelter for the \nunborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have a dream that Americans will one day understand that caring for \na mother with an unwanted pregnancyunconditionally protecting and \ncaring for her unborn child before and after birthis the ultimate in \ncompassion, is inclusive, is intelligentis even liberaland is the \nAmerican way. That is what our national freedom is all about.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the onus falls on us to create that kind of vision in our use of \nlanguage and stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis article originally appeared in the June 24, 1991 issue of \nChristianity Today.\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "October 16, 1701 \u0014\nYale Founded to Fight Liberalism\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIt may come as surprise that when Yale University was founded on this \nday, October 16, 1701, it was by Congregationalist ministers unhappy \nwith the growing liberalism at Harvard. It wasn't called Yale then, \nof course, but rather the Collegiate School. The ministers donated \nforty books and declared their objective, that \"Youth may be \ninstructed in the Arts and Sciences who through the blessing of God \nmay be fitted for Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe huge campus of today, with over one hundred buildings was not \nconceived. In fact, the first classes were held in the residence of \nRev. Abraham Pierson, its first rector. Not until 1745 was the school \nmoved to New Haven and renamed Yale.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name change was in honor of Elihu Yale, a successful merchant who \nmade a donation of goods valued at $2,800. This was equivalent to the \nannual income of about fourteen medical doctors. The purpose of the \nrenamed school was \"To plant and under ye Divine blessing to \npropagate in this this Wilderness, the blessed Reformed, Protestant \nReligion, in ye purity of its Order and Worship.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nStudents were required to \"live religious, godly and blameless lives \naccording to the rules of God's Word, diligently reading the Holy \nScriptures, the fountain of light and truth; and constantly attend \nupon all the duties of religion, both in public and secret.\" Prayer \nwas a requirement. Furthermore every student was instructed to \n\"...consider the main end of his study to wit to know God in Jesus \nChrist\" and \"to lead a Godly, sober life.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFor many years these high ideals were followed. One faculty member \nwrote around 1800, \"It would delight your heart to see how the \ntrophies of the cross are multiplied in this institution. Yale \nCollege is a little temple: prayer and praise seem to be the delight \nof the greater part of the students.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut fathers cannot ensure the fidelity of their sons. Today Yale's \noriginal ideals have faded. The school is a liberal institution with \nutterances and actions that are politically correct. One suspects \nthat students are less likely to pray persistently than to engage in \npolitical protests.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nAvery, Elroy McKendree.

How are \nChristians to think about the relative roles of words (proclaiming \nthe gospel) and deeds (loving action) in what Christ has called his \npeople to be and do? We need to set our scales to a balance that \nmatches Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Balance\" may sound simple, but finding and maintaining our \nequilibrium on such a complex subject is never easy. It's like \nwalking a tightrope. Only one direction will keep us upright and \nmoving forward, and any number of missteps could lead us to fall off \none side or the other. Misguided claims abound. Here's a prominent \nexample.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow often do we hear these days, with passion and approval, the \nfamous dictum attributed to Francis of Assisi: \"Preach the gospel at \nall times. Use words if necessary\"? In this saying, the \nword-versus-deed question rears its head, stressing in this instance \nhow important it is for Christians to \"preach the gospel\" with their \nactions. Let the gospel be seen rather than spoken, it's implied. \nWords may serve a useful backup role, but our actions must take \ncenter stage if we are to make a difference in the world.\u0014\nAt first blush, this sounds right. Except that it isn't.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to those who know the relevant history wellthe \nFranciscansFrancis never uttered these words. But more important, on \nits face this dictum represents a significant error. It's simply \nimpossible to preach the gospel without words. The gospel is \ninherently verbal, and preaching the gospel is inherently verbal \nbehavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut perhaps we should lighten up, we may say. Let us view the phrase \nas a mere aphorism and avoid pressing its language too literally. \nAccording to this reading, the saying is a rhetorical trope designed \nto emphasize the importance of backing up our gospel words with \nChrist-following lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is an immensely important and thoroughly biblical idea. If this \nis all our maxim is affirming, we should deem it useful indeed. But \nunfortunately, many seem to want to treat it very literally indeed, \nprecisely because they see no difficulty in doing so. They will \ninsist that the gospel can in fact be \"preached\" without words. \nSometimes this is called an \"incarnational\" approach to evangelism \nwhereby we \"preach the gospel\" by incarnating it in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat should we make of this claim? Can we, or can we not, \"preach the \ngospel\" with our actions? Who's right, and does it matter?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it happens, it matters a great deal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stakes are surprisingly high in how we answer this question. This \nis not some esoteric debate reserved for theologians or technical \nBible scholars. Faithful obedience to Jesus Christ is our goal, and \nthat applies to all who call him Lord. Such obedience must begin with \nclear thinking about what Jesus calls us to be and do.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo let us say it again: The belief that we can \"preach the gospel\" \nwith our actions alone represents muddled thinking. However important \nour actions may be (and they are very important indeed), and whatever \nelse they may be doing (they serve a range of crucial functions), \nthey are not \"preaching the gospel.\" The gospel is inherently verbal, \nand preaching it is inherently verbal behavior. If the gospel is to \nbe communicated at all, it must be put into words.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch a statement flies in the face of a good deal of popular opinion. \nCan it withstand the light of examination? To answer this question, \nwe need an appropriate framework for our thinking, one that will help \nus understand the issues rather than confuse them.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou Can't Preach the Gospel with Deeds, May 2012, Vol. 56, No. 5, \nPage 40\u0014",

    "title": "YOUR FAVORITE HYMN---REALLY?",
    "words": "Your Favorite Hymn May Be \"Faith's Review.\" Really. \u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge\u0014\nWednesday, July 25, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile attending a breakout session during the Oasis music and worship \nconference sponsored by the Campbell University Divinity School, I \nlearned that my all-time favorite hymn was not originally titled \n\"Amazing Grace.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was \"Faith's Review and Expectation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hymn was written by John Newton, a former sea captain, active in \nthe slave trade, who once bargained with God during a frightening \nstorm at sea, leading to his conversion.\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton eventually left the sea, and in 1764 became an Anglican priest \nin the small English town of Olney. The area was rife with Protestant \ndissenters, who clearly influenced Newton's uncharacteristic \nevangelical bent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in Olney, Newton and his friend, William Cowper, wrote hymns as \na means of teaching theology to his rural congregation. In 1799, they \npublished a number of these in three volumes, including the one that \ncame to be known as \"Amazing Grace.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Newton had left Olney for a London parish in 1780, they \ntitled the hymnbook the \"Olney Hymns.\" The hymns were published as \npoetry only, without musical notation. The \"Olney Hymns\" proved so \npopular that in the next 37 years, at least 37 known editions were \nprinted, in both Britain and the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn volume one of their hymnal, Newton and Cowper arranged hymns by \nthe biblical text with which they were associated, and \"Faith's \nReview and Expectation\" was based on 1 Chronicles 17:16-17, which \nrecords David's astonishment following God's surprising promise to \nbuild the king an everlasting dynasty:\u0014\n\u0014\nThen King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, \"Who am I, \nO LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? \nAnd even this was a small thing in your sight, O God; you have also \nspoken of your servant's house for a great while to come. You regard \nme as someone of high rank, O LORD God!\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton originally published six verses of the hymn, the first three \nof which survive in most modern hymnals as verses 1-3. The fourth \nverse endures in some hymnbooks:\u0014\n\u0014\n(4) The Lord has promised good to me, his word my hope secures;\u0014\n\u0014\nHe will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe verse we commonly sing last, the triumphant \"When we've been \nthere 10,000 years ...\" was added later by an unknown author, like at \nleast seven other verses that have been sung at various times.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hymn has also been sung to more than 20 different tunes. The one \nmost of us are familiar with, \"New Britain,\" was first used in 1835 \n(if I can trust Wikipedia on this), and it stuck.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe final two verses in Newton's original hymn  like the \"10,000 \nyears\" verse that replaced them in most modern hymnals, also \ncelebrated the hope of eternal life:\u0014\n\u0014\n(5) Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall \ncease;\u0014\n\u0014\nI shall possess within the veil, a life of joy and peace.\u0014\n\u0014\n(6) The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine;\u0014\n\u0014\nBut God who called me here below, shall be forever mine. (spelling \nupdated)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hymn was based on God's promise of an eternal dynasty for David's \nhouse, but we know that David's kingdom didn't last.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian interpreters have long seen Jesus  a descendant of David  \nas the ultimate fulfillment of God's \"forever promise.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, we tend to sing the hymn as a celebration of forgiveness and \nsalvation due to God's amazing grace expressed through Jesus, often \ncalled the \"son of David.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor believers, that's faith's review  and expectation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge is associate professor of Old Testament at Campbell \nUniversity Divinity School and contributing editor to Baptists Today, \nwhere he blogs.\u0014",

    "words": "Young Women Delaying Marriage \u0014\n\u0014\nThe marriage rate in the United States is continuing its decades-long \ndownward slide, with fewer American women than ever getting married \nand others waiting longer to wed, according to a new report.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe marriage rate has fluctuated in the past, with dips in the 1930s \nand 1960s, but it has been in steady decline since the 1970s.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, researchers report that the marriage rate has dropped to a new \nlow of 31.1, meaning there are about 31 marriages in the U.S. for \nevery 1,000 unmarried women, researchers found. In 1950, that number \nwas 90.2. In 1920, it was 92.3.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe researchers also found that a woman's average age at first \nmarriage in the United States is now nearly 27, the highest in more \nthan a century.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Marriage is no longer compulsory,\" study researcher Susan Brown, \nco-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research \n(NCFMR) at Bowling Green State University, said in a statement. \"It's \njust one of an array of options. Increasingly, many couples choose to \ncohabit and still others prefer to remain single.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo calculate the marriage rate, researchers look at the percentage of \nwomen older than age 15 who get married each year. Among all American \nwomen over 15, less than half (47 percent) are married today, the \nlowest since the turn of the 20th century, and down from a peak of 65 \npercent in 1950, the report found.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, the proportion of women who are separated or \ndivorced is on the rise, at 15 percent today, compared with less than \n1 percent in 1920, the researchers say.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 7/24/13\u0014",

    "words": "You May Be Smart But That Doesn't Make You Moral \u0014\n\u0014\nJoel Snider\u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 10, 2013   Ethics Daily \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"Sighing for Eden,\" William Willimon tells a story about a young \nman riding his bike who was forced off the road and into a ditch by a \npassing car. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat disturbed the bike rider most was not the actions of the driver, \nbut his personal feelings immediately following the incident.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was surprised that the minute I hit the ground, I frantically \nsearched for rock or a pipe or anything. If that car had stopped, I \nwould've taken that rock and bashed the brains out of the guy who \ntried to do that to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Willimon sought to assure the young man that his feelings were \nunderstandable, the man replied: \"But I'm a college graduate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young man learned a valuable lesson: Education alone does not \nsolve moral problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many times have you heard a conversation that assumed education \nwas the only thing needed to make individuals nobler, kinder or able \nto demonstrate better moral judgment?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my lifetime, culture has seen education as the cure-all for moral \nproblems from promiscuity to prejudice. Once a person \"knows better,\" \nsays the conventional wisdom, they will act better.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are convinced that better educated individuals will be better \npeople. Very subtly we believe that knowledge is salvation. Yet \ntheology, philosophy and social research disagree.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"Strength for the Journey,\" Peter Gomes quotes Sheldon Krimsley's \nquestions: \"Are more educated people likely to lie less? To express \nmore humanitarian values? To be more beneficent to others? To show \nmore empathy? To make more complex moral decisions?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Gomes answers: \"I don't think so. Smart people are not \nnecessarily good people for knowledge may be power, but it is not \nvirtue, and smart people often do wicked things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Gandhi was in this country during the mid-20th century, a member \nof the American clergy asked him, \"What is it that you are most \nafraid of in the world today?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The hard-heartedness of the educated,\" Gandhi replied.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot famine, nuclear holocaust or a population explosion. Rather, the \nhard-heartedness of the educated.\u0014\n\u0014\nGhandi's words are validated by research. Randy Richardson, a \ncommunications professor at Berry College, referenced a statistic \nthat college-educated people are 40 percent less empathetic than the \ngeneral public. I don't have access to the study he quotes, but I \ntrust Richardson's research.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should add to these observations the Apostle Paul's comments to \nthe church at Corinth: \"Knowledge puffs up\" (1 Corinthians 8:1). The \nword he used for \"puffs\" is \"to inflate,\" as in the expression \"an \ninflated ego.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nKnowledge can inflate your ego, but it does not guarantee a nobler \ncharacter. In the words of Gandhi, the story of Willimon and the \nresearch of Richardson, I hear echoes of Paul.\u0014\n\u0014\nI write this article as a person who comes from a family of many \nteachers. I spent 24 years of my life in full-time education, and I \nwas 48 before I lived 50 percent of my life out of school.\u0014\n\u0014\nI believe in education because it opens doors, increases options and \nprovides a path toward a better life. But education is not salvation. \nBy itself, education does not make us more tolerant, kind or \nforgiving.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoral change comes from love, not education. As a Christian, I \nbelieve the source of that love is Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we read past Paul's \"puffs up\" comment in 1 Corinthians 8, the \napostle adds, \"Love builds up.\" Knowledge puffs up, but the love of \nGod in Christ builds up.\u0014\n\u0014\nJoel Snider is the pastor of First Baptist Church in Rome, Ga.

    "words": "Eighty-six year old Joy Johnson, a veteran of 25 New York City \nmarathons, died with her running shoes on. Johnson, who was the \noldest runner in this year's marathon, fell at the 20 mile marker in \nthe event. She crossed the finish line at about eight hours. After \nthe race she returned to her hotel room, lay down with her shoes on, \nand never woke up.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmazingly, Johnson didn't run her first marathon until she was \nsixty-one years old. The only hint of the sport was the verse from \nIsaiah 40:31 which hung on the kitchen wall in her family farm home \nin rural Minnesota: \"But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their \nstrength. They shall mount up with wings like eagles. They shall run \nand not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, the career gym teacher, Johnson was a stranger to \npersonal exercise until she took a three-mile walk in 1986. Then she \nstarted jogging and competing in 10-K races. By 1988 she had competed \nin her first New York City Marathon. Three years later she recorded \nher best time at age sixty-four with a time of 3 hours and 55 minutes.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago she told a reporter about her exercise regimen. She \nwould wake up at 4 A.M., drink her coffee while reading her Bible, \nand then set out on an eight mile pre-dawn run. \"When you wake up it \ncan either be a good day or a bad day,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"I always \nsay, 'It's going to be a good day.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe devout Christian ran every day but Sunday so she could attend \nchurch. Johnson sang hymns to herself to pass the time while running. \nAccording to Johnson's daughter, \"She was always a happy runnerand \nbesides her faith and family, this was something she loved the most.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nGreg Asimakoupoulos, Mercer Island, Washington; sources: Michael \nWinter, \"NYC marathoner, 86, dies after her 25th race,\" USA TODAY \n(11-5-13); Natasha Velez and Bruce Golding, \"Marathoner dies happy \nafter chasing dream to last mile,\" New York Post (11-5-13)\u0014",

Hecklers tried to drown \nhis voice by beating drums and pans. Or they set dogs barking by \nswinging a cat in a cage. They hurled dead dogs at him. In spite of \nthis terrible opposition, he preached outdoor sermons in Wiltshire \nfor five years. He wanted to win souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe knew the value of a soul, having lived in dread of death for \nyears. At nine years of age, he heard his dying aunt exclaim \"Last \nnight the Lord stood by me and invited me to drink of the fountain of \nlife freely and I shall stand before the Lord as bold as a lion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years John was unable to get those words out of his head. What a \nprivilege to be able to stand before the Lord as bold as a lion! How \nhe wished he could be sure of the same future. He prayed, fasted, \nhoped for it, but found himself unable to do good. He lied and \ncheated and frittered his hours in spite of his best resolutions to \ndo otherwise. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt thirteen, he had to leave school to find work. But work was not to \nbe found. Eight times he traveled to London in search of a job, \nreturning empty-handed each time. With nothing to do, he gambled away \nhis small income or spent it on plays.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, his heart became unbearably heavy. He entered a church to \npray. As he knelt there, he seemed to hear Jesus say, \"I am your \nsalvation.\" The weight rolled off him. His desires changed. No longer \ndid he want to fritter his time on cards. One day when he refused to \nplay for the sake of his conscience, he was told that there was \nanother \"stupid religious fellow\" like himself. The man turned out to \nbe a Methodist who introduced John Cennick to John Wesley. Soon John \nCennick was standing under a tree in Kingswood, preaching for the \nMethodists. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn of Quaker parents, raised in the Anglican Church, he joined the \nMethodist movement. But after several years with the Wesleyan \nMethodists, he broke with John Wesley and joined George Whitefield's \nCalvinist Methodists. Later he left the Calvinist Methodists for the \nMoravian Brethren.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Moravian, John Cennick preached with great success in Dublin, \nIreland--until he attacked the honor given to the Virgin Mary. Then \nhe was mobbed by outraged Catholics. However, when he took the gospel \nto other cities, people ran out into the streets, offering him a \ndrink of milk if he would just pray in their homes. When clergymen \ncomplained that their churches were empty because everyone had gone \nto hear John, Bishop Rider replied, \"Preach Christ crucified and then \nthe people will not have to go to Cennick to hear the Gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn wrote several hymns. These included a popular prayer for \nchildren to sing at the table before eating.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaken ill with a fever one day as he rode to London, he arrived in \nthe city exhausted and delirious. Moravians nursed him for a week as \nhis mind wandered. He died on this day, July 4, 1755, only 36 years \nold, leaving a wife and two children.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBrown, Theron and Butterworth, Hezekiah.

    "title": "YOUR LEADERSHIP STYLE",
    "words": "Your Leadership Style \u0014\nAlbert McClellan, The Baptist Program,January, 1980\u0014\n\u0014\n Granted a true Christian life with time and talents fully \u0014\ndedicated, what then fully completes a successful church \u0014\nleader? What are the general characteristics of the leader \u0014\nwho makes differences in the lives of other people and \u0014\nmotivates them to action? \u0014\n\u0014\nThese are not questions easy to answer because the \u0014\nstyles of leadership are as varied as the posts they fill. \u0014\nMinisters of opposite temperaments can be equally suc- \u0014\ncessful in identical situations. This makes leadership dif- \u0014\n- .. ficult to define. There are, however, traits that are com- \u0014\nmon to most leaders. \u0014\n\u0014\nOptimism. They think positively and they speak en- \u0014\ncouragingly. \u0014\n\u0014\nInitiative. They seem to have been born ready to move \u0014\nforward. They do not try to escape leadership responsi- \u0014\nbility, rather they relish it. \u0014\n\u0014\nEnthusiasm. They lift any group or any person with an \u0014\naggressive spirit to get on with the work. Problems are \u0014\nchallenges, and the tougher the problem, the more spirited \u0014\ntheir response. \u0014\n\u0014\nIndividualism. They are not afraid to be different. They \u0014\nfind new ways to accomplish old tasks. \u0014\n\u0014\nImagination. They are very good at solving problems in \u0014\nunusual, but simple ways. Most of the time they see sev- \u0014\neral solutions but they concentrate only on one of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nA minister who is afraid of leadership is in the wrong \u0014\nwork. He cannot long survive from a posture of timidity. \u0014\nNeither can he survive from a posture of brashness and \u0014\nover-confidence. Often in the Baptist context he must \u0014\nlead quietly but firmly from behind the scene. Woe for \u0014\nhim if he becomes too self-conscious about his leadership \u0014\nposition and announces to the people, \"I am your leader.\" \u0014\nMost followers want leaders who lead the work, not finger \u0014\nposts who point to themselves. It has often been wisely said \u0014\nthat they who govern most make the least noise. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders know how to listen. If their leadership has \u0014\nwaned, it may be that they quit listening. Ministers who \u0014\nmust flit like sparrows from post to post have never really \u0014\nheard what others are saying. \u0014\n\u0014\n~--\"\"'. Good. leaders live on ideas. They are always looking \u0014\nor new ideas, new methods and now new procedures. They \u0014\nlook all ideas squarely in the eyes, no matter where they \u0014\ncome from. Much of the time the ideas they put into effect \u0014\nare not their own, and they frankly admit it.\u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders set clear goals. The better their leadership, \u0014\nthe more these goals are related to change, and the less \u0014\nthey are related to tasks. Good leaders set the priorities \u0014\nof the group. They choose them on the basis of full infor- \u0014\nmation obtained from all their publics, including both staff \u0014\nand congregation. As group catalysts, the good leaders \u0014\nmake certain the priorities are truly group priorities, not \u0014\ntheir personal priorities. Many a leader has broken himself \u0014\nby arbitrarily imposing personal priorities upon strong \u0014\nminded groups. It should be recognized that there are dif- \u0014\nferences in leaders in a voluntary situation such as a \u0014\nchurch, and leaders in a controlled situation such as a \u0014\nbusiness. Both kinds of leaders must set priorities, but in \u0014\na church they are always more democratically selected. \u0014\nEven so, no church can clarify its own priorities without \u0014\nstrong decisive leadership. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders share both the work and the honors. They \u0014\ndo not cover themselves up with minor tasks that others \u0014\ncan handle. They do not waste their energy with decisions \u0014\nthat others can make. They do not preen themselves with \u0014\nhonors that others need. Good leaders know how to quickly \u0014\nand decisively delegate. The better their leadership, the \u0014\nmore general their delegation. They delegate by categories \u0014\nof work, not by single tasks. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders know how to martial themselves for chal- \u0014\nlenges and how to bring to bear all their energies on the \u0014\nrelevant. They do not major on minors. They deal with \u0014\nthe substances of problems, not the appearances of them. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders are never judgemental. They do not con- \u0014\ndemn by association, or fasten opprobrious labels on peo- \u0014\nple. They withhold their verdicts until they come to clear \u0014\nunderstanding of each specific case. \u0014\n\u0014\nGood leaders interface with all of their publics. They do \u0014\nnot play one against another. They are fair in their treat- \u0014\nment of all groups alike, and they make themselves equally \u0014\navailable to all alike. Above all, good leaders do not pa- \u0014\ntronize any of their publics, neither do they condescend to \u0014\nany of them. For the truly good leaders in Baptist life \u0014\nthere are no elitist peer groups. All their publics are their \u0014\npeers. \u0014\n\u0014\nPastors and other church ministers would do well to \u0014\ncarefully examine themselves as leaders to see if at the \u0014\nbottom of their failures is a patchy, mean, egotistical, in- \u0014\ndulgent, ,unorganized, distracting, misleading disintegrating \u0014\nleadership style .\u0014",

    "title": "YOUR HUSBAND'S INFIDELITY IS NOT YOUR FAULT",
    "words": "Your Husbands Infidelity Is Not Your Fault\u0014\n\u0014\nOct 23 2015  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nAdultery comes from a greedy heart, not an insufficient wife. \u0014\n\u0014\nJulie Roys, guest writer \u0014\n\u0014\nThough in many ways polar opposites, reality TV stars Khloe \nKardashian and Anna Duggar are receiving similar messages about their \nhusbands infidelity from two radically different sources: a pimp and \na Christian matriarch.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Kardashian, the message came from Dennis Hof, owner of the \nbrothel where her estranged husband, former NBA standout Lamar Odom, \nwas found unconscious last week after ingesting cocaine, alcohol, and \nherbal sexual stimulants. If she really cared about this man, Hof \nsaid, he wouldnt be at my place with my girls. This, even though \nOdoms relationship with drugs and prostitutes predates his \nrelationship with Khloe Kardashian.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Duggar, the remarks werent as direct. Following the Ashley \nMadison leak, her husband, Josh, admitted to several affairs and a \nporn addiction. Then, the Duggars family pastor in Arkansas \naddressed the leak in a sermon on infidelity. If a husband or wife \nfails to keep his or her partner happy sexually they are opening \nthemselves up to the attack of the enemy, he said. And that enemy \nis going to take your spouse away from you.\u0014\n\u0014\nA recent blog post from Anna Duggars mother-in-law Michelle carries \nthat implication. When asked to share marital advice, the mom of 19 \nsaid that wives should always be available to meet their husbands \nsexual needs, even when they are exhausted or pregnant. He can get \nhis lunch somewhere else, Duggar wrote. But you are the only one \nwho can meet that special need that he has in his life for intimacy. \nSo be available, and not just available, but be joyfully available \nfor him. Smile and be willing to say, Yes, sweetie I am here for \nyou, no matter what.\u0014\n\u0014\nNormally I ignore dramas involving reality TV stars. Ive never \nwatched Keeping up with the Kardashians or the Duggars former TLC \nshow, 19 Kids and Counting. However, these stories caught my \nattention because I have heard this blame-the-wife rationale \nexpressed both inside and outside the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, no one but Michelle knows how she intended her advice. If \nher words were offered innocently, she should say so and apologize \nfor her insensitivity and bad timing. But its ludicrous to believe \nthat Anna was responsible for Joshs immorality. He admitted to \nmolesting five girls when he was a teenager, including two of his \nsisters. Like Odom, Josh Duggars issues began before his \nrelationship with Anna. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven if both these men had squeaky clean backgrounds prior to \nmarriage, the idea that their wives bear responsibility for their \ninfidelity can be found nowhere in Scripture. Instead, this narrative \nseems a horribly misogynistic strategy to use fear of infidelity to \ncompel women to submit to their husbands sexual advances, regardless \nof their feelings or physical limitations. This has nothing to do \nwith Christian marriage, and actually violates the nature of marriage \nitself.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Sin, His Responsibility\u0014\n\u0014\nBlaming a woman for a mans sin is as old as the Garden of Eden. When \nGod confronted Adam for eating the apple, Adam immediately blamed \nEve. The woman you put here with meshe gave me some fruit from the \ntree, and I ate it. Here, Adam is speaking truthfully: Eve had \nsinned first and given Adam the apple to eat. Scripture doesnt \nindicate that Eves sin, which certainly influenced Adam, absolves \nhim of responsibility. On the contrary, God curses both, showing that \neach is responsible for his or her own behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsalm 62:12 says, You reward everyone according to what they have \ndone. This is repeated in Proverbs 24:12: Will he not repay \neveryone according to what they have done? And again, in Romans \n2:6-8: God will repay each person according to what they have \ndone. Clearly, no amount of mitigating circumstances changes our \npersonal responsibility for our sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nLust Is Insatiable\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the prostitutes whom Odom hired said she was summoned to his \nroom six times in one day, and Odom reportedly ingested several doses \nof so-called performance enhancing supplements. And Duggar not only \nreportedly had numerous sexual encounters with a prostitute and \nsought other women on Ashley Madison, but also confessed to indulging \nin pornography. This seemingly insatiable appetite for sex is common \namong men who stray because they have exchanged lust for love as the \npurpose of sex. And, like all sin, the more lust is indulged, the \nless it satisfies.\u0014\n\u0014\nLust is not the result of an overactive sex drive, says pastor and \nauthor Richard Exley. If it were, then it could be satisfied with a \nsexual experience, like a glass of water quenches thirst or a good \nmeal satisfies appetite. But the more we attempt to appease our lust, \nthe more demanding it becomes. There simply is not enough erotica in \nthe world to satisfy lusts insatiable appetite.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why wives simply offering sex as frequently as their husbands \nrequest it does not ensure fidelity. In fact, this practice may \nexacerbate the lust problem. 2 Peter 2 says those who have eyes full \nof adultery, insatiable for sin also have hearts trained in greed. \nAdultery, then, results from a greedy heart, not an insufficient wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny solutions to adultery must address the husbands problem rather \ndivert attention to the wife hes betrayed. The husband needs to \nlearn to follow Christs example and cherish his wife as his beloved. \nThis means respecting her own desires and being more eager to give \nthan to receive.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving Relationship, Not a Service Contract\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Michelle Duggars framework, marriage sounds like some kind of \nservice agreement where a wife offers her husband sex and in return, \nhe offers her a listening ear. He will sit there and listen to \neverything I need to tell him because he knows that Im there for \nhim, too, Duggar wrote. Im meeting his needs, hes meeting my \nneeds. However, Scripture presents us with a different view of \nmarriage and sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1 Corinthians 7, Paul teaches that husbands and wives should \nmaintain a regular sexual relationship and that their bodies belong \nto each other. Sex is described as mutually givingnot as something \nthe wife one-sidedly performs for her husband in return for something \nelse. Thats because marriage is supposed to reflect the life and \nlove of the Trinity. Genesis 1:27 describes the husband and wife as \nmade in the image of God. And, theologians have traditionally \nunderstood the two becoming one reflects Trinitarian life and love. \nThe marital embrace is meant to be mutually self-giving and \naffectionate, perhaps the closest approximation of Trinitarian love \nthat we know. To describe marital relations as a service agreement, \nthen, is reductionist and perverse.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, each marriage is unique. But, as a rule, when husbands \nfocus on loving their wives as Christ loved the church, women \nrespond in kind and sex becomes a beautiful reflection of mutual \nlove. If we truly want to reduce adultery, we need to emphasize Gods \ndesign for sexuality and marriage, not infuse women with fear of not \nperforming adequately for their husbands. This message not only \nvictimizes women, it also excuses sin and perverts the meaning of \nmarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJulie Roys hosts a national talk show on the Moody Radio Network \ncalled Up For Debate. She also writes for various Christian \nperiodicals, blogs at www.julieroys.com, and speaks on life issues, \ngender and sexuality, motherhood, and the intersection of faith and \npolitics. Julie and her husband live in the Chicago suburbs and have \nthree children.\u0014",

I \nremember waking up each morning around the time you were due, \nwondering, Will it be today? Will I finally meet this miracle, this \nprecious amazing baby growing, and kicking and pushing his way into \nthis world? Who will you be? What will you become? What can I teach \nyou? I never suspected in all those months I so excitedly \nmarkedsaving every grainy ultrasound photothat it would be you, \nboth of you, who would teach me.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, I held your hands as you stood, radiating joy and wobbly \ndetermination as you tried to take your first stepand then the flash \nof fear and the flush of pride as you realized I had let go and you \nwere walking on your own. I ran down the promenade, shouting \nencouragementdont look down, keep pedaling!as you learned to \nride a bike on your own. My heart broke when you cried in nursery \nschool because you didnt want me to leave, and then it broke again \nwhen you stopped crying in kindergarten because you didnt need me to \nbe with you anymore. I reassured you that the gentle waves were safe, \nas the ocean water swirled around our ankles, sucking our feet into \nthe wet sand. I tried to teach you about grace in competition when \nyou played soccer and basketball. Let your playing do the talking, \nI would lecture. Just do your best, work hard, and be a good sport. \nBut somewhere along the line, I realized that it was you, Zachary and \nSamuel, who were also teaching me.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou have taught me how to be brave, how to fight hard, but also how \nto let go. You have taught me how to treasure the moment, the \npresent, and not miss it because I am too worried about what might \nhappen, or too ashamed of what already has. You have taught me I \ncannot control everythingno matter how hard I trywhether thats \nfailing to convince you to finish your dinner, or grieving at my \ninability to shield you from the unkindness in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nI see your love and grit and grace every single day. Your love never \nwavers, and I treasure it. You are both boys now, one of you on the \ncusp being a young man. I realize that clich about time flying is \ntrueand as the memories of your first hours, days, months and years \non this earth are indelibly imprinted upon me, there are new ones to \nadd, every single day. I rejoice and marvel in all the promise of \nyour young liveseverything is all laid out in front of you, waiting \nto happen. Everything is brand new again for me as I watch your \ntriumph on the basketball court at the weekend games, your \nfrustration with that nightly algebra homework, your wonder as the \ngirls begin calling and texting and face timing. I watch and I sigh \nto myself, it has only just begun.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this Mothers Day I am profoundly grateful for the greatest gifts \never given me: the two of you. As you make your way into and through \nthis wonderful world, remember, you have just one life to live. Live \nit to the fullest. Treasure it, savor it, even the parts of it that \nhurt, for they can teach you something.\u0014\n\u0014\nBe brave. Be bold. Be kind. And always know you are loved.\u0014\n\u0014\nYour Mom\u0014",

    "words": "You Are the Manure of the Earth\u0014\n\u0014\n                                               Jesus' metaphor about \nsalt was actually about fertilizer. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnthony B. Bradley/ September 23, 2016 \u0014\n\u0014\nMy first job after graduating from Clemson University was as a \nquality control chemist at a small pharmaceutical company in Atlanta. \nIt was a great job, but I was far too extroverted to enjoy a career \nin a lab. Initially, I had enrolled in college with the intention of \nbecoming a physician, but after a spiritual awakening during my \nsenior year, I made a decision to attend seminary instead of medical \nschool. As a consequence, I learned the Bible with the sciences in \nmindwhich has been a continual source of insight into my reading of \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, I was recently doing some research for a lecture on Luke \n14:3435. When I read Jesus wordsSalt is good, but if it loses its \nsaltiness, how can it be made salty again? I decided to look into \nwhat Jesus original audience might have understood about salt when \nJesus taught them to be the salt of the earth. When I discovered \nthat salt was used as a fertilizer in Palestine, it permanently \nchanged how I viewed the command to love my neighbor. What previously \nhad been a somewhat strange charge by Jesus to be salty became a \nsource of inspiration for Christian life and mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou are salt for the soil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to specialists in environmental science and soil chemistry, \nsalt has been a major method of fertilizing soil for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn old article in the journal Biblical Archaeology, Salt, Soil, \nSavior, stands the test of time. Eugene P. Deatrick, former head of \nthe soils department at West Virginia University, argued that in \nMatthew 5:13, Mark 9:50, and Luke 14:3435, Jesus was speaking not \nprimarily of salts household use but of its agricultural use. \nAccording to Deatrick, several kinds of salt are found in Palestine \nthat are different from the kind were familiar with. There is rock \nsalt, salt evaporated from Dead Sea water, salt pits (Zeph. 2:9), and \nmore. Additionally, Deatrick writes that agricultural literature \nabounds in references to the use of salt as a fertilizer. In quoting \nanother source, he noted that the value of salt in small quantities \nappears to have been known in ancient timesCato, Virgil (and others) \nrecord its power of improving herbage of pastures.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Deatrick mentioned, agriculturalists have long recognized the \nvalue of salt as a fertilizer. A prize-winning essay on the valuable \nproperties of salt for agriculture written by Robert Faulk, a \ncontemporary of Deatricks, recognizes the long lineage of the \nagricultural use of salt. He states that the ancient Hebrews already \napplied it 2,000 years ago in Palestine, citing 2 Kings 2:21 and \nLuke 14:34. Its fascinating that this essay on the agricultural use \nof salt specifically refers to Luke 14:34 to make its case, \nindicating that Jesus is talking about an agricultural rather than a \nculinary phenomenon.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus spoke about salt in Matthew 5:13, Mark 9:50, and Luke \n14:3435, he was referring to several varieties of salts used in the \nfirst century. These salts were unlike the modern table salt (sodium \nchloride) in our kitchens. The salts in Jesus day were mixtures of \nchlorides of sodium, magnesium, and potassium, with very small \namounts of calcium sulfate (gypsum). Some of these would dissolve \nmore quickly than others, while some were better able to withstand \nthe elements. These hardier, saltier salts were generally more \nvaluable in an agricultural context because that meant their benefits \nwould last longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Jesus talked about salt losing its saltiness or savor, it \nrefers to a process in which the compounds of salts naturally \ndisintegrate over time. Disintegrated salt loses a small amount of \ngypsum, which changes its saltiness. This change in saltiness makes \nit a less effective fertilizing agent. So when Jesus talked to his \nfollowers about losing their saltiness, he was talking about losing \ntheir fertilizing properties, their ability to bring about life and \ngrowth.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are supposed to be salt in the agricultural sense, that means \nwe are supposed to get messy and to go where nothing is growing right \nnow. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus wasnt talking about table salt but fertilizing salt, that \nmeans that his reference to the salt of the earth in Matthew 5:13 \ncan just as easily be translated as salt for the soil. This makes \nbetter sense of Jesus words in Luke 14:3435: Salt is good, but if \nit loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is fit \nneither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reference to the manure pile has long been a source of confusion \nwhen viewing salt as seasoning in these passages. Jesus saying makes \nmore sense when we realize that salt maintains the fertilizing \nproperties of dung. It is common knowledge today that salt can be \nused to preserve food, but its been used as an agricultural \npreservative for fertilizer for centuries as well. A 19th- century \nagricultural reference volume notes that Salt is applicable in all \ncases in which . . . fermented dung cannot be carted at once to land. \nCovering the heap with salt will be found a cheap and effective means \nof checking fermentation. Salt keeps dunghills from rotting and \nbecoming useless as fertilizer while enhancing the fertilizing \nproperties of dung. This centuries-tested agricultural understanding \nof salt fits these passages and the ancient world much better than \ninterpreting the salt as table salteven if all this talk of \nfertilizer and manure makes us a bit squeamish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn further research, I discovered that not only did the ancient \nHebrews use salt in this way, but so did the Chinese and early \nRomans. Salt was used in arid places to help soil retain moisture, \ndestroy weeds, make stubborn soils easier to till, and make sour \ngrass sweeter and more appealing to cattle. In some soils, salt keeps \nrust from wheat, and blight from potatoes. When applied properly, \nsalt will kill surface weeds while allowing more deeply rooted plants \nand grass to thrive. And when rain or irrigation allows salt to \npermeate soil, the salt chemically frees vital minerals and nutrients \nin the soil, allowing them to nourish plants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile this may be a foreign concept to us in the West, it is still \nwell-known in other parts of the world. For example, the Philippine \nCoconut Authority recently released a technology guide sheet for \nfarmers titled, SALT (Sodium Chloride): An Effective and Cheap \nFertilizer for High Coconut Productivity. The guide notes that salt \naccelerates crop growth and development, increases crop yield, \nminimizes damage to plants, and promotes environmental \nsustainability. According to the guide, between 1991 and 1997, \nfarmers who fertilized with salt had a yield increase of 125 percent \nover unfertilized coconuts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Power of Salt\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if we were to listen to the teaching of Christ like the coconut \nfarmers in the Philippinesor the ancient people of Palestinerather \nthan as modern Westerners who only use salt to spice up their food? \nHow might a distinctly agricultural viewpoint open up new vistas in \nJesus teaching here?\u0014\n\u0014\nDeatricks paraphrase of Jesus teaching demonstrates how this \nunderstanding makes the message much more powerful: You are (like) \nthe salt for the soil, a stimulant for growth. If you become like the \nsavorless salt, no longer good for anything, how will the gospel of \nthe kingdom be preached throughout the whole world?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians are not here to merely season or preserve the world from \ndecay. The followers of Jesus Christ are sent on a mission to \nstimulate growth in the parts of the world that are barren, and to be \nmixed into the manure piles of the world so that God can use that \nfertilizer to bring new, virtuous life. But if those same followers \nare not committed to the radically countercultural message of Jesus \nChrist, they lose their saltiness, which is the unique witness to \nthe power of the gospel that brings the kingdom of God to the messes \nof the world, stimulating life and growth. If we lose our \nsaltiness, we are no longer good for anything and cannot be the \nagents of change that Jesus intended for his followers to be (Matt. \n5:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe call of the salty is the call to move toward the broken. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the agricultural use of salt makes barren soil easier to till, \nfacilitates the absorption of other vital nutrients by plants, and \nmaintains and enhances the fertilizing capacity of manure, then Jesus \nis calling us to something extraordinary and countercultural. If we \nare truly supposed to be salt in the agricultural sense, that means \nwe are supposed to get messy and go where nothing is growing right \nnow. Instead of going where things are bright, new, and exciting, we \nhave a call to explore opportunities that will probably not make \nsense in the eyes of normal people.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople may say things like, She graduated from Harvard with a degree \nin historywhy is she teaching seventh grade in rural West Virginia? \nOr, He was a varsity athlete with the talent to go pro; why did he \nchoose to stay home and support his divorced mother and three \nsiblings instead? Or, They both have promising careers; why do they \nspend so much time working with special needs adults in their \ncommunity when they could be making a difference in the corporate \nworld?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the face of these questions and criticisms, being salt and light \nfor the good of the world sets us free to love our neighbors and not \nfeel like were missing out or not living up to our potential. When \nwe realize we are fertilizer, we measure our value by the growth of \nothers, not by our comfort or vocational success. Moreover, we also \nrecognize that we need to be scattered where the soil most needs \nfertilizing. We need to be in close relationships with people who do \nnot know or believe the gospel so that new life in Christ might grow \nwhere there is now only barren soil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn agricultural understanding of Jesus call for us to be the salt \nof the earth sheds light on some of the most important issues facing \nChristians today. Questions about evangelism, justice, cultural \nengagement, and social responsibility gain a surprising clarity when \nconsidered in terms of promoting the life and flourishing of others. \nThis view of the salt of the earth encourages us to discern where \nGod is leading us by considering how our gifts and interests \nintersect with the barren places and the manure piles of the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nManure piles are all around usthey come to us in the form of \ndevastated lives. There are lifeless sections of soil in every small \ntown, big city, and suburb in America. There are friends and family \nmembers whose lives are in a state of disaster. Financial problems, \naddictions, oppression, injustice, poor decision making, ignorance, \nor outright rejection of the gospel are all too common. A whole host \nof messy problems plague the lives of those we care about.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe call of the salty is the call to move toward the broken so that \nthey may meet God and be set free to become who God wants them to be. \nAs salt, we are intended to bring life and flourishing out of \ndecaying manure piles and arid soil where nothing growsspheres of \nsociety that are dead, barren, or rotting because Christians are not \nthere. Wherever the world is not the way God in his goodness intended \nit to be, that is where Christians should be encouraging and training \none another to go. The good news is that we dont have to go that far \nto find opportunities to be salt.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo matter where God sprinkles us, grace gives us the means and love \ngives us the motive to live salty lives consistent with Jesus \nteaching for the benefit of others and the glory of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nANTHONY B.

    "words": "Barbarians menaced the Roman empire. Emperor Diocletian instituted a \nnumber of reforms aimed at saving the sprawling political entity. He \nreorganized the provinces and made the army more mobile while \nincreasing its size. To battle inflation, he issued a new coinage, \nestablished a uniform system of taxation and implemented wage-price \ncontrols.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecognizing that the empire was too large for a single man to rule, \nhe divided it into four administrative units. In doing this he raised \nto power a man who did Christians much harm. This man, Galerius, \ninstigated by his mother (a die-hard pagan) prodded the Emperor to \npersecute the Christians. With their new customs, Christians were a \nthreat to imperial unity, he said; and their vast, well-knit \norganization was the largest non-governmental body ever seen. Surely \nthey could not be trusted: their loyalty was to King Jesus rather \nthan to Caesar. Diocletian, who for eighteen years had never lifted a \nfinger against the faith, followed this wicked advice. The crackdown \nbegan on this day, February 23, 303.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe persecutors dragged off church leaders and tortured them to \ndeath, employing the rack, the scourge, slow fires, crucifixion, and \nmany other barbarities against them. They burned Christian books and \nscriptures. Many Christians died deaths of great courage. Theodotus, \nfor example, after terrible tortures said as he was being led back to \nprison, \"It is but just that Christians should suffer for Him who \nsuffered for us all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy, a deacon in Mauritania, allowed his eyes to be put out with \nred hot irons rather than reveal the hiding place of scriptures.

After horrendous torture, both were \ncrucified.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, it was the church which won the showdown. All the powers \nof Rome could not crush its allegiance to Christ.

    "words": "As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of \nschool, she told the children an untruth. Like most teachers, she \nlooked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. \nHowever, that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped \nin his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he \ndid not play well with the other children, that his clothes were \nmessy and that he constantly needed a bath. In addition, Teddy could \nbe unpleasant.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight \nin marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then \nputting a big \"F\" at the top of his papers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review \neach child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. \nHowever, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.\u0014\n\u0014\nTeddy's first grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is a bright child with a \nready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners... he is a \njoy to be around..\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis second grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is an excellent student, well \nliked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a \nterminal illness and life at home must be a struggle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis third grade teacher wrote, \"His mother's death has been hard on \nhim. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much \ninterest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't \ntaken.\u0014\n\"\u0014\nTeddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't \nshow much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he \nsometimes sleeps in class.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of \nherself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas \npresents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for \nTeddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper \nThat he got from a grocery bag Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in \nthe middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to \nlaugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones \nmissing, and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume.. But she \nstifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the \nbracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her \nwrist. Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough \nto say, \"Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to.\" \nAfter the children left, she cried for at least an hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that very day, she quit teaching reading, writing and arithmetic. \nInstead, she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson paid particular \nattention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come \nalive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the \nend of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the \nclass and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the \nsame, Teddy became one of her \"teacher's pets..\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling* \nher that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.\u0014\nSix years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then \nwrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she \nwas still the best teacher he ever had in life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years after that, she got another letter, saying that while \nthings had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with \nit, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. \nHe assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite \nteacher he had ever had in his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he \nexplained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a \nlittle further. The letter explained that she was still the best and \nfavorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little \nlonger.... The letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story does not end there. You see, there was yet another letter \nthat spring. Teddy said he had met this girl and was going to be \nmarried. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago \nand he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit at the \nwedding in the place that was usually reserved for the mother of the \ngroom.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? She wore that bracelet, \nthe one with several rhinestones missing. Moreover, she made sure she \nwas wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on \ntheir last Christmas together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson's \near, \"Thank you Mrs. Thompson for* believing in me. Thank you so much \nfor making me feel important and showing me that I could make a \ndifference.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, \n\"Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I \ncould make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n(For you who don't know, Teddy Stoddard is the Dr. at Iowa Methodist \nHospital in Des Moines that has the Stoddard Cancer Wing.)\u0014",

Now you may be wondering: what on \nearth are you doing keeping files fifty years, and why were you \nlooking back over them now? Dont you have anything else to do? \nWell, I keep them mostly because as I review them from time to time, \nthey help me keep things in perspective.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tPeople often talk about how wonderful things used to be, how back in \nthe fifties things were so much calmer, so much more at peace; it was \na nicer world back then. Well, these materials remind me that that is \nabsolutely not true. We were just as troubled then as we are now, \nincluding 9/11, and maybe more so. We were certainly far more on edge \nabout the international scene than we are today. The Cold War, the \nundeclared belligerency between the United States and its allies and \nthe Soviet Union and its allies was an obsession for us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut I also keep these materials to remind me of something else--most \nof the things that consumed us back then dont even exist today. \nTheyre gone, a thing of the past, archived in the pages of history. \nFifty years ago the headlines screamed about Molotov, and that wasnt \na cocktail either, Malenkov, Kaganovich and Krushchev and the danger \nthey represented to the world. People were buying fall-out shelters \nto protect themselves in case of nuclear attack. You could live in \none for a week if it was well stocked. Schools were installing them. \nThe U.S. Government placed survival supplies, canned water, foods of \nvarious types, etc. in churches and other community places where \npeople might gather in large numbers in case of a disaster. A church \nI served had a huge supply of these items in their basement storage \nwhen I went there in 1974. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSo let me ask you question. How many of you remember Molotov, \nMalenkov, Kaganovich or Khrushchev? Maybe you remember reading about \nKhrushchev banging his shoe on the speakers podium while he was \nmaking a  speech here in the United States and loudly exclaiming, We \nwill bury you. While it is true that the stock market couldnt do \nanything wrong during the 50s, those years werent anywhere near as \nexciting as some would have us believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tBut thats not new. When the barbarian hordes were attacking Rome, a \nBishop, nearly 60 years of age, sat down\u0014\nin that hour of darkness and despair and wrote a book which has since \nbecome one of the classics of Christian literature. He called it \nConcerning the City of God. This is essentially what he said:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tYou thought that the passing of Rome and the stability which she \ngave the world meant the end of \teverything from the point of view of \nthe Church. You were utterly wrong. Rome was an earthly city and \nshall not be everlasting. The Church is Divine and \ttherefore \nindestructible. Human cities may rise and fall, but the City of God \nremains....\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS\u0014",

    "words": "Yield or Suffer Said Diocletian\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010 28 Apr\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Emperor Diocletian?\u0014\n\u0014\nDiocletian, born Diocles, was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born \nto a family of low status in Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the \nranks of the military to become Roman cavalry commander to Emperor \nCarus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in \nPersia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed \nby Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him \nin the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire \nand marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed \nfellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian \nreigned in the Eastern Empire, and Maximian reigned in the Western \nEmpire.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman Reform\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Barbarians menaced the Roman empire, Emperor Diocletian instituted \na number of reforms aimed at saving the sprawling political entity. \nHe reorganized the provinces and made the army more mobile while \nincreasing its size. To battle inflation, he issued a new coinage, \nestablished a uniform system of taxation and implemented wage-price \ncontrols.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian Persecution\u0014\n\u0014\nRecognizing that the empire was too large for a single man to rule, \nhe divided it into four administrative units. In doing this he raised \nto power a man who did Christians much harm. This man, Galerius, \ninstigated by his mother (a die-hard pagan) prodded the Emperor to \npersecute the Christians. With their new customs, Christians were a \nthreat to imperial unity, he said; and their vast, well-knit \norganization was the largest non-governmental body ever seen. Surely \nthey could not be trusted: their loyalty was to King Jesus rather \nthan to Caesar. Diocletian, who for eighteen years had never lifted a \nfinger against the faith, followed this wicked advice. The crackdown \nbegan on this day, February 23, 303.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe persecutors dragged off church leaders and tortured them to \ndeath, employing the rack, the scourge, slow fires, crucifixion, and \nmany other barbarities against them. They burned Christian books and \nscriptures. Many Christians died deaths of great courage. Theodotus, \nfor example, after terrible tortures said as he was being led back to \nprison, \"It is but just that Christians should suffer for Him who \nsuffered for us all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine Resilience \u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy, a deacon in Mauritania, allowed his eyes to be put out with \nred-hot irons rather than reveal the hiding place of scriptures. His \nwife of just three weeks was then brought in and she attempted to \npersuade him to recant for love of her. He refused. Growing \nstouthearted, she joined him. After horrendous torture, both were \ncrucified.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, it was the church which won the showdown. All the powers \nof Rome could not crush its allegiance to Christ. Even Galerius \neventually left off the persecution. In 311, the dying emperor issued \nan edict of toleration. Christians had outlasted the might of the \nempire. Their resistance to arbitrary power was instrumental in \nwinning the right to follow their Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "YOU'VE MADE ME A BETTER MAN",
    "words": "Stephen T Robertson is with Sheena Jeffers.\u0014\nFebruary 20, 2022  \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sheena and I made the announcement that we were expecting our \nfirst child, a son we would name Arlo Paul, I shared something I \nwrote about my reluctance as a father. I wrote about how the idea of \nbeing a father didnt come to me naturally, and I lacked the inherent \nconfidence many fathers I admire seem to exude.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Sheena navigated her way through the stages of pregnancy, I worked \ndiligently to support her, though, admittedly that mostly meant I \ncooked lots of beef for her and never balked at a late evening run to \nthe store for Ukrops Chocolate Pie, because Sheenaa strength and \nknowledge of the process made pregnancy seem like a lazy river ride \ninstead of waterfalls and white water. As we grew closer and closer \nto a due date, I prepared, and over-prepared, and back-up-prepared \nour new home for the birth of our new baby, and all along, the work \nwas good. The work gave me purpose. The work had a goal, a checklist, \nand an endpoint with clear definitions of success or failure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe work was good, and I did it well, but I knew the work was a cloak \nto cover my insecurities, my fear, my reluctance to find out whether \nI was cut out to be a father. Even when Sheena was in labor, despite \nknowing what was at the end of her physical journey, I focused on \ndoing my best work to make sure things could, technically, go well.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen my son launched out of Sheenas body, and I cried.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen my son was placed on Sheenas chest, and I cried.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen I was handed a pair of surgical scissors to cut my sons last \nphysical bond to the world before our own, and I cut that bond, and I \ncried.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then, as if handed the keys to a fighter jet with only a pat on \nthe back and a youll figure it out, folks, we were at home with \nthis magical little creature we created from pure love, and trust, \nand faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now a year has past, almost.\u0014\n\u0014\nI keep telling friends that this year has been as long as ten years \nand as short as one day, all at once. The only true markers of time \nthat I can confidently remember is when Arlo was born, when we moved \nout of our newborn cocoon and I went back to work, and now, when hes \nabout to reach his first birthday. Certainly there were moments \npassing the time along the way, but such is the passage of time, at \nany given moment of memory, he is both in my arms, just one day old, \nand holding my hand walking around our front yard.\u0014\n\u0014\nAm I still a reluctant father? Yes, probably, but what Ive learned \nis that all that time before Arlo was born when I was doing the \nwork; that was what being a good father is actually all about. Im \nnot good at being a father. I will probably never be good at being a \nfather, but I am good at showing up and doing the work. What Ive \nlearned from my son over the past twelve months is that he is no \nbetter at being a human than I am at being a father, but he has no \nchoice but to show up, because thats life, and if I choose to show \nup with him, then well figure it out together. What is most \nendearing about this arrangement is that Arlo is not a reluctant son. \nHe is a natural, and in that, every single day, he makes his father a \nbetter man.\u0014",

    "words": "Yield or Suffer Said Diocletian\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n2010  28 Apr\u0014\n\u0014\nWho was Emperor Diocletian?\u0014\n\u0014\nDiocletian, born Diocles, was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born \nto a family of low status in Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the \nranks of the military to become Roman cavalry commander to Emperor \nCarus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in \nPersia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed \nby Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him \nin the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire \nand marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed \nfellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian \nreigned in the Eastern Empire, and Maximian reigned in the Western \nEmpire.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman Reform\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Barbarians menaced the Roman empire, Emperor Diocletian instituted \na number of reforms aimed at saving the sprawling political entity. \nHe reorganized the provinces and made the army more mobile while \nincreasing its size. To battle inflation, he issued a new coinage, \nestablished a uniform system of taxation and implemented wage-price \ncontrols.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian Persecution\u0014\n\u0014\nRecognizing that the empire was too large for a single man to rule, \nhe divided it into four administrative units. In doing this he raised \nto power a man who did Christians much harm. This man, Galerius, \ninstigated by his mother (a die-hard pagan) prodded the Emperor to \npersecute the Christians. With their new customs, Christians were a \nthreat to imperial unity, he said; and their vast, well-knit \norganization was the largest non-governmental body ever seen. Surely \nthey could not be trusted: their loyalty was to King Jesus rather \nthan to Caesar. Diocletian, who for eighteen years had never lifted a \nfinger against the faith, followed this wicked advice. The crackdown \nbegan on this day, February 23, 303.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe persecutors dragged off church leaders and tortured them to \ndeath, employing the rack, the scourge, slow fires, crucifixion, and \nmany other barbarities against them. They burned Christian books and \nscriptures. Many Christians died deaths of great courage. Theodotus, \nfor example, after terrible tortures said as he was being led back to \nprison, \"It is but just that Christians should suffer for Him who \nsuffered for us all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine Resilience \u0014\n\u0014\nTimothy, a deacon in Mauritania, allowed his eyes to be put out with \nred-hot irons rather than reveal the hiding place of scriptures. His \nwife of just three weeks was then brought in and she attempted to \npersuade him to recant for love of her. He refused. Growing \nstouthearted, she joined him. After horrendous torture, both were \ncrucified.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, it was the church which won the showdown. All the powers \nof Rome could not crush its allegiance to Christ. Even Galerius \neventually left off the persecution. In 311, the dying emperor issued \nan edict of toleration. Christians had outlasted the might of the \nempire. Their resistance to arbitrary power was instrumental in \nwinning the right to follow their Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "YOU SHALL NOT KILL - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "You may be surprised, as I was, to find out that many newer American \ntranslations of the Bible have substituted \"You Shall Not Murder\" for \n\"You Shall Not Kill\" in the Ten Commandments. In this book Wilma \nBailey, an Old Testament scholar and professor, shows how and when \nthis change came about. Reviewing word usage in the key Hebrew texts \nshe demonstrates that \"murder\" is not a fair translation of the \noriginal Hebrew word used in the Bible, and she builds a strong case \nthat the revisionist translations were made in response to social and \npolitical changes within various religions and within American \nsociety in the late 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book is based on scholarly analysis and Bailey's extensive \nknowledge of Hebrew and the history of biblical translations is \nimpressive. Equally impressive is the ethical passion that shines \nthrough, when, having made her case and presented all the evidence \nand arguments, she decries these mistranslations that are, in effect, \ngiving us permission to stop worrying about our collective \nresponsibility for mistreating our fellow humans whether through wars \nor other means. At one point she sums it up this way: \"People want to \nkill people, and they want biblical permission to do it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI highly recommend this book for those interested in ethics and the \nhistory of how the various Christian and Jewish traditions have dealt \nwith the question of killing.\u0014\n\u0014\n------\u0014\nThe first sentence of the preface of this book caught me by surprise: \nSometime in the middle of the twentieth century, it said, the \ncommandment \"You shall not kill \"(Exod 20:13) became \"You shall not \nmurder\" in many English Bible translations. The author briefly notes \ntwo common reasons given for the change. The first is that the Hebrew \nword in Exodus means murder \"everywhere in the Bible,\" a notion that \nshe disputes in the first chapter. The second is that killing is not \nonly permitted, but sanctioned by God in other parts of the Bible, an \nidea she labels as faulty though not false, since interpretation is \nsubjective. The rest of this slim and informative book looks at the \nchange to English translations within four traditions that publish \ntheir own translations: American forms of Evangelical Protestantism, \nMainline Protestantism, Judaism, and Roman Catholicism, which, unlike \nthe others, has maintained the older wording, \"Thou shalt not kill.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn discussing the changes to the commandment by Evangelical \nProtestants, she points out (1) evangelicals consider the Bible their \nprimary, and sometimes their only, source of authority, a document \nthat contains or IS God's word (2) despite the implications of that \ncommon belief, evangelicals seemed to accept with ease the newer \ntranslation in which the commandment prohibits \"murder\" instead of \nkilling. On the other hand, the translation of choice for \nevangelicals is the King James Version, which contains \"Thou shalt \nnot kill.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch is the meat of this book, which, as would be expected, delves \ninto political and ethical questions related to killing in war and \nself defense, the death penalty, euthanasia, and abortion. There's a \nlot of substance here to enlighten readers about the practices of a \nvariety of denominations and encourage them to reflect on the issue \nof killing and murder in American society today.\u0014",

    "words": "Young Muslims in Turkey Murder Three Christians\u0014\nDeaths mark first known martyrdom of Turkish converts since founding \nof republic.\u0014\nBarbara G. Baker, Compass Direct | posted 4/20/2007 09:31AM\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a gruesome assault against Turkey's tiny Christian community, five \nyoung Muslim Turks entered a Christian publishing office in the \nsoutheastern province of Malatya Wednesday and slit the throats of \nthe three Protestant Christians present.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo of the victims, Necati Aydin, 36, and Ugur Yuksel, 32, were \nTurkish converts from Islam. The third man, Tilmann Geske, 46, was a \nGerman citizen.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Turkish press reported Thursday that four of the five young men \narrested for the murders, all 19 to 20 years of age, admitted during \ninitial interrogations that they were motivated by both \"nationalist \nand religious feelings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We did this for our country,\" an identical note in the pockets of \nall five young men read, Channel D television station reported. \"They \nare attacking our religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the newspaper Hurriyet, one of the suspects declared \nduring police questioning, \"We didn't do this for ourselves. We did \nit for our religion. May this be a lesson to the enemies of religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a demonstration against the Zirve Publishing office in Malatya two \nyears ago, local protestors had claimed its publishing and \ndistribution activities constituted \"proselytism\" among Muslims and \nshould be closed down. Turkish law, however, guarantees the right to \nengage in religious evangelism if it does not contain proven \npolitical motives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three Christians were found tied hand and foot to chairs at 1:30 \np.m. Wednesday in the liaison office of Zirve Publishing in Malatya's \nNiyazi Misr-i district. Their throats had been cut and their bodies \nmarred by multiple stab wounds.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Aydin and Geske were already dead when local police discovered \ntheir bodies. Police had received a call from a nearby office in the \nbuilding about a \"disturbance\" happening in the Christian publishing \nhouse's third-floor office.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Yuksel was still breathing and rushed to a nearby hospital \nfor massive blood transfusions, he expired soon afterwards.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen police stormed the building, one of the killers threw himself \nfrom the third story to the street, suffering a broken leg and severe \nhead injuries. The other four suspects were apprehended as they tried \nto flee the building, still holding their bloodied knives.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring interrogation, the four confessed killers claimed the attack \nhad been planned by the fifth suspect, now hospitalized in serious \ncondition. But Thursday Malatya Gov. Halil Ibrahim Dasoz announced \nthat five additional suspects had been arrested in the police \ninvestigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurkish government leaders were quick to denounce the murders and \npromise a full investigation. The police, meanwhile, fielded \nconjecture that the suspects were linked to the Turkish Hizbollah, a \nKurdish Islamic movement calling for a Muslim state in southeastern \nTurkey.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Zirve Publishing's general manager, Hamza Ozant, the \ncompany's Malatya staff had received death threats in recent months. \nAll three of the men worked in the office and attended the local \n30-member Kurtulus Protestant Church pastored by Aydin.\u0014\n\u0014\nAydin is survived by his wife, Semse, and a son and daughter, both \npreschool age. Geske with his wife Susanne had two sons and a \ndaughter, ages 8 to 13 years. Yuksel was engaged to be married within \na few months.\u0014\n\u0014\nForensic authorities surrendered Yuksel's body last night to his \nfamily, who buried him Thursday morning in his home village in \nElazig. Aydin's funeral has been set for Saturday afternoon (April \n21), at the Anglican Church in Izmir, his home city in western \nTurkey. It is not yet known whether Geske's widow will decide to \ninter his body in Malatya or Germany.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a bold initiative Thursday, Pastor Ihsan Ozbek, chairman of the \nAlliance of Protestant Churches in Turkey, led a press conference \nbroadcast live from Malatya by CNN-TURK and shown simultaneously on \nseveral other TV channels.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlanked by the churches' legal representative, Orhan Kemal Cengiz, \nand Istanbul pastor Bedri Peker, Ihsan distributed a forthright press \nrelease to the Turkish media headlined, \"A Horrible Brutality, But \nNot a Surprise.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yesterday, Turkey was buried in the darkness of the Middle Ages,\" \nOzbek declared.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe compared the nation's ongoing conspiracy theories and missionary \nphobias to the witch-hunts of the Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We know this will not be the last [martyr]. But with all our hearts \nwe wish it would be the last,\" Ozbek said.\u0014\nFirst Convert Martyrs\u0014\n\u0014\nWednesday's deadly attack was the first known martyrdom of Turkish \nconverts from Islam since the founding of the Turkish Republic in \n1923.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it was the third tragic incident targeting Christians in Turkey \nin the past 15 months to spark major international media coverage. \nLast year an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death while kneeling \nin his church in the Black Sea port city of Trabzon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis past January, a prominent Turkish journalist of Armenian \nChristian descent, Hrant Dink, was murdered in Istanbul.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past three years, top government officials have been accused \nof fanning growing hostility against non-Muslims by openly \ncriticizing Christian missionary activities. Local prosecutors and \npolice authorities are often reluctant to pursue reported incidents \nof vandalism or threats against church buildings or personnel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last deadly attack targeting Turkish converts to Christianity \ntook place in Gaziantep in 1997, when an extremist Islamist group \nbombed a Christian bookstand at a local fair, killing a small child \nand injuring many bystanders. The culprits were arrested and \nsentenced to heavy prison terms.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2007 Christianity Today\u0014",

She could \nhave mentioned that time when she sang before the Roosevelts and the \nKing and Queen of England. She could have said it was winning a \ncoveted award for the person who had done the most for her hometown \nof Philadelphia. There was also the time when she sang before a crowd \nof 75,000 on Easter Sunday beneath the Lincoln statue. And she had \nlong since assured her financial security.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhich of these high moments would she chose? None of them. My \ngreatest moment, she said, is when I went home to my mother and \nsaid: 'Mama, you'll never have to take in washing again.'\u0014",

Astoria was a heavy cruiser that saw duty during World War \nII's Battle of the Coral Sea and at Midway, then was sunk in August \nof 1942 at the Battle of Savo Island. On board in the fight for Savo \nwas Signalman third class Elgin Staples. Sometime around 2 a.m. on \nthe ship's final day, Staples was blown overboard when one of the \nAstoria's gun turrets exploded. In the water, wounded in both legs by \nshrapnel and in a state of near-shock, Staples was kept afloat by a \nnarrow lifebelt which he had activated by a trigger.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book The Grand Weaver, Ravi Zacharias tells the fascinating \nstory of what happened next.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Four hours after being blown into the Pacific, Staples was picked up \nby a passing destroyer and returned to the Astoria. Even though the \ncruiser had been severely damaged, her captain was trying to beach \nthe ship in order to save her. When his attempts failed, Staples \nfound himself back in the water. By now, it was noon.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This time it was the U.S.S. President Jackson that plucked him out \nof the water. On board, Staples studied the little lifebelt that \nsaved his life twice that day. He noticed the belt was manufactured \nby the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Akron, Ohio, and carried \na registration number.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Allowed to go home for a visit, Staples related his story to the \nfamily and asked his mother, who worked for Firestone, the purpose of \nthe registration number on the belt. She pointed out that the company \nwas holding employees responsible for their work in the war effort \nand each worker had his/her own number. Staples recalled everything \nabout that lifebelt, including the registration number. As he called \nit out, his mother's eyes grew large. She said, 'That was my personal \ncode that I put on every item I was responsible for approving!'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"His mother had made the belt which had saved his life twice.\"\u0014",

    "title": "YOU SHALL BE MY WITNESSES",
    "words": "\u0014\nThere is one very crucial point to make about our identity as \nwitnesses. We must always remember that we are Christs witnesses. \nJesus plainly says, You will be MY witnesses. In other words, \nfollowers of Christ are not witnesses of theological doctrine or of \nreligious practices. They are not witnesses of moral and political \nagendas. They are witnesses of the person of Jesus with whom they \nhave an intimate relationship. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the sad notes about Christianity is its long association with \ninjustice, oppression, violence, and war. From the time of Medieval \nEurope, when the church carried out violence against so called \nheretics, to the time when slavery in this country was supported by \nwhite Christians, to more recent days when a new poll indicated that \nthe majority of evangelicals support torture, Christianity has often \nfailed to be an authentic witness to the authentic Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we are to be recognized as having been with Jesus, then our lives \nand our messages must express to the world the transformative message \nabout a Christ who loves and embraces all. But if our lives and \nbeliefs express neglect, injustice, intolerance, exclusion, hate, \nviolence, and war, or the support of any of these, then we are false \nwitnesses to a false Christ. When we believe that we must stand for \nintolerance, hatred, violence, and oppression in order to be true to \nwhat we think God desires, we are indeed more witnesses of a false \nChrist than the authentic Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is shocking to me is that many evangelicals who practice \nwitnessing as a confrontational approach to convincing people of \ntheir guilt and sin and their need to convert to Christianity, are \noften the most intolerant of people, whose intolerance and hate \nspeech do not fit with having been with Jesus. In their form of \nbearing witness, they have we so changed the person of Jesus that \nthey bear false witness to who Jesus really is. If the church is to \nbe the authentic witness to the authentic Jesus, then we must become \nrecognizable to the world as having been with Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nC. Drew Smith, Ph.D.\u0014",

    "words": "Robert E. Lee once declared, Weve made a terrible mistake! Weve \nplaced all our worst generals in the fields, and weve got all our \nbest generals in the newspaper offices! Thats not a slam on \nnewspaper people; but it is a good reminder that anyone who does \nanything significant is likely to be criticized by someone sitting on \nthe sideline.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are in the fields, even the fields of ministry, criticism \nwill come. If you attempt anything significant, you will be \ncriticized. Jesus himself warned that something is wrong when all \npeople speak well of you. Criticism, therefore, should be accepted as \na cost of call-following.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur effectiveness in following our call will depend largely on how we \nrespond to that criticism. On the one hand,we cant dismiss \ncriticism. On the other hand, we cant allow ourselves to be \ndevastated by criticism either. Effective call-followers take their \nmedicine when they need to, yet they dont swallow every bitter pill \nthat someone tries to stuff down their throats.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effective call-follower develops a tender heart, a tough hide, a \nclear mind, and a discerning ear. If you are without any one of the \nfour you are like a car running with one flat tire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                            There was a very cautious \nman\u0014\n                                            Who never laughed or \nplayed.\u0014\n                                            He never risked, he never \ntried\u0014\n                                            He never sang or prayed.\u0014\n                                            And when he one day \npassed away,\u0014\n                                            His insurance was denied\u0014\n                                            For since he never really \nlived,\u0014\n                                           They claimed he never died!\u0014\n\u0014\n                                             ( In John C.

BOTH ways yadda, yadda, yadda \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I remember promising myself that when I grew up, there was no way \nin hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on my kids about \nhow hard I had it and how easy they've got it!   \u0014\n\u0014\nBut now that I'm over the ripe old age of thirty, I can't help but \nlook around and notice the youth of today.  You've got it so easy!

If we wanted \nto know something, we had to go to the durn library and look it up \nourselves, in the card catalog!!   \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no email!!  We had to actually write somebody a letter - \nwith a pen!   Then you had to walk all the way across the street and \nput it in the mailbox, and it would take like a week to get there!  \nStamps were 10 cents! \u0014\n\u0014\nChild Protective Services didn't care if our parents beat us.

There \nwere no CD players!  We had tape decks in our car.  We'd play our \nfavorite tape and \"eject\" it when finished, and then the tape would \ncome undone rendering it useless.  Cause, hey, that's how we rolled, \nBaby!  Dig? \u0014\n\u0014\nWe didn't have fancy crap like Call Waiting!  If you were on the \nphone and somebody else called, they got a busy signal, that's it! \u0014\n\u0014\nThere weren't any freakin' cell phones either. If you left the house, \nyou just didn't make a call or receive one. You actually had to be \nout of touch with your \"friends\". OH MY GOD !!!  Think of the \nhorror... not being in touch with someone 24/7!!!  And then there's \nTEXTING.  Yeah, right.  Please!  You kids have no idea how annoying \nyou are. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we didn't have fancy Caller ID either! When the phone rang, you \nhad no idea who it was!  It could be your school, your parents, your \nboss, your bookie, your drug dealer, the collection agent... you just \ndidn't know!!!  You had to pick it up and take your chances, mister! \u0014\n\u0014\nWe didn't have any fancy PlayStation or Xbox video games with \nhigh-resolution 3-D graphics!  We had the Atari 2600!  With games \nlike 'Space Invaders' and 'Asteroids'.  Your screen guy was a little \nsquare!  You actually had to use your imagination!!!  And there were \nno multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen... Forever!  \nAnd you could never win.  The game just kept getting harder and \nharder and faster and faster until you died!  Just like LIFE! (No \nAtari for me!)\u0014\n\u0014\nYou had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was \non! You were screwed when it came to channel surfing!  You had to get \noff your butt and walk over to the TV to change the channel!!!  NO \nREMOTES!!!  Oh, no, what's the world coming to?!?!\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no Cartoon Network either! You could only get cartoons on \nSaturday Morning.  Do you hear what I'm saying? We had to wait ALL \nWEEK for cartoons, you spoiled little rat-finks!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd we didn't have microwaves.  If we wanted to heat something up, we \nhad to use the stove!  Imagine that!     \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd our parents told us to stay outside and play... all day long.  \nOh, no, no electronics to soothe and comfort.  And if you came back \ninside... you were doing chores!   \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd car seats - oh, please!  Mom threw you in the back seat and you \nhung on.  If you were lucky, you got the \"safety arm\" across the \nchest at the last moment if she had to stop suddenly, and if your \nhead hit the dashboard, well that was your fault for calling \"shot \ngun\" in the first place!   \u0014\n\u0014\nSee!

    "words": "Since God has treated us not as we deserve, but with grace, we are \nfree to behave graciously toward others. Harold Warlick tells a \nbeautiful story of a man by the name of Dapozzo. In 1943 Dapozzo was \nconvicted by a Fascist tribunal. He was condemned to death, but \nbecause he had four children and a wife, he was given a term in the \nconcentration camp. After eight months in the concentration camp, he \nweighed only eighty pounds. His left arm was broken and was left to \nmend without any medical attention. His body was covered with scars. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Christmas Eve the commandant of the concentration camp punished \nhim because he had shared his faith in Christ with the other \nprisoners. The commandant filled a beautiful table with the finest of \nfoods and made Dapozzo stand for an hour while he feasted on all that \nwas before him. After he had finished feasting, he brought out a \nsmall brown paper bag and said, \"Dapozzo, your wife is a good cook. \nFor several months she has been sending little cakes that she has \nbaked for you, and I have eaten them all. And I will now eat the one \nshe has recently sent to you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDapozzo then realized that that vile and cruel man was eating the \nfood right out of his children's mouths. But his response was this, \n\"You are a poor man. I am a rich man, because I am saved by the grace \nof our Lord Jesus Christ.\" With that Dapozzo was angrily dismissed. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the war was over, Dapozzo began searching for this evil and vile \nman. After ten years, he found him. He went to see him with a \nProtestant minister and a poorly disguised package. At first the \ncommandant did not recognize this former prisoner. Dapozzo said, \"Do \nyou remember Prisoner 175?\" The man did not. Dapozzo said, \"Do you \nremember Christmas Eve, 1943?\" and with that the man was horrified. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe backed up against the wall and said, \"You have come to seek \nrevenge!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nDapozzo said, \"Yes!\" Then he unwrapped the package and asked the \nman's wife to make coffee, and they gathered around the table and ate \nthe cake he had brought.\u0014",

What many people didn't know, however, was that 17 \nyears earlier, Rousseau had taken as his lifelong mistress (he \nfinally married her in 1768) a hotel maid, Theresa le Vasseur, and \nhad five children by her, all of whom he sent to a foundling hospital \nsoon after they were born.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he became famous as a writer, philosopher and moralist, \nRousseau's guilt about abandoning his family, and his pain over what \nhe had done to his children, caused a mental collapse and depression \nthat eventually ended his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Robert Hendrickson, World Literary Anecdotes (New York: Facts on \nFile, 1990), 207.\u0014",

    "words": "A December, 2010 article in Newsweek argues that after a brief period \nof cutting back Americans are starting to spend againwhether they \ncan afford it or not. Some experts call it \"frugality fatigue\"in \nother words, we're weary of cutting back, and we're ready to splurge \nagain. The authors argue, \"The truth is that spending may be hard to \ncontain. Entire generations of consumers have grown up with the idea \nof instant gratification and the credit culture that comes with it.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThese are some of the key statistics from the article:\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0002American households have pared their debt (from $12.5 trillion in \n2008 to $11.6 trillion in September of 2010), but most of that came \nfrom home foreclosures and defaults on credit cards. \u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0002From the start of the recession, we have continued to increase our \nspending in the following expense categories: Telephone equipment (up \n16.6 percent), pet expenses (up 14.4 percent), and child care (up \n12.8 percent). \u0014\n\u0014\n\\\u0002Although 89 percent of Americans say they're watching their \nexpenditures, spending has increased anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore tellingly, the authors include two stories that epitomize our \nrunaway spending. First, Maria Diaz, a 30-year-old waitress who was \nforced to move in with her mother, said, \"I keep waiting for things \nto get better, and they just don't. After awhile I just decided, \n'Screw it. I need some new clothes. I'm going to get them.' My mama's \nnot happy, but I don't care. You stop spending, and you stop living.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there's the story of Harry Dugan, a 50-year-old respiratory \ntherapist from New Jersey. Although he's \"underwater\" on his mortgage \nand he tried to curtail his expenses, he recently \"had a bit of a \nrelapse\": he purchased a $900 television and a $21,000 car. \"It was \nan impulse buy,\" he confessed. \"If I could go back, I'd get something \ncheaper.\" \\\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\nThe article concludes with a warning: \"Yes, spending is great fun, \nuntil the bill arrives. That's a lesson we've learned the hard way. \nOr maybe we haven't.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMatt Woodley, managing editor of PreachingToday.com; source: Stefan \nTheil, \"The Urge to Splurge,\" Newsweek (12-6-10)\u0014",

One such association is the YMCA.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe YMCA's first report expressed as well as anything the problem \nwhich led to its formation. \"Until recently the young men engaged in \npursuits of business were totally neglected. They were treated as \nthough deprived of mind, as though formed only to labor and \nsleep...without a moment for spiritual or mental culture, without the \ndisposition or even the strength for the performance of those \ndevotional exercises which are necessary to the maintenance of a \nspiritual life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCountry boys like George Williams were appalled at the degradation of \nworkingmen in London. Williams, who was strongly influenced by a \nrather unusual combination of religious forces--the British Quakers \nand the American evangelist Charles Finney--began a work among his \nfellow employees. Soon he had won many to Christ. A go-getter in \nbusiness, too, he rapidly advanced to partnership in his firm (a \ndrapery house) and used his own substantial wealth to support \nevangelical causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day June 6, 1844, twelve men, all but one associates of \nWilliams' firm, met in his bedroom and created the Young Men's \nChristian Association. Its original intent was merely to work with \nemployees of other drapery houses. The era was one of evangelical \nadvance. Associations to deal with the dreadful social and moral \nconsequences of the industrial revolution were springing up \neverywhere in Protestant countries. The YMCA hired a hall and assumed \nthe task of reclaiming men through lectures, exercise and innocent \namusement.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany prominent men threw their weight behind the work. Lord \nShaftesbury was the YMCA's president for a time. Thomas Binney and \nother evangelical leaders gave their support.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe organization caught on like wildfire. Long before Williams' death \nin 1905, it had achieved a membership of 150,000 in Britain and half \na million in America with thousands of branches worldwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor his service to the well-being of the nation, Queen Victoria \nknighted him. Today the YMCA does not have the evangelical impulse it \nonce did. Nonetheless, it continues to promote physical and \nintellectual well-being in men and women throughout the world. \nAlthough now largely forgotten, its early nondenominational Christian \nideals gave rise to an organization which bettered the lives of \nmillions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams, George.
