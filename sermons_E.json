    "words": "An Episcopal rector describes a case study in which he interviewed a \ndozen people about their personal experiences of sensing the presence \nof God in times of trouble.  Six of them were atheists or agnostics, \nand the other six were active church members.  The Christian \ninterviewees all shared vivid accounts of how God had helped them in \ntheir time of need.  The non- believers had similar experiences of \nescaping from difficult circumstances but attributed their \ndeliverance to luck or their own skill.  However, the difference \nbetween the two groups was not just a matter of labels.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Christians who experienced the presence of God all indicated \nthat it resulted in a changed outlook and an ability to cope with \ntheir particular challenges more successfully. Also, although members \nof both groups went through similar emotions (fear, joy, anxiety), \nthe Christians found a great sense of peace based upon their belief \nin the purposefulness of their existence.  The atheists did not have \nthis peace, particularly when facing death.  The writer feels \nstrongly that the conviction on the part of the Christians that God \nhad definitely intervened in their lives will give them an internal \nstrength for facing future trials. The non-believers simply do not \nhave any comparable resource.\u0014\n  \"Experiencing the presence of God during times of need: a case \nstudy\" by Robert Marston.

    "words": "A farmer who raised chickens felt that his rooster was getting \nolder and not able to service the hens properly so he bought a \nyounger rooster.  When it arrived on the farm, the old rooster said \nto the younger one: \"I just want you to know that I am not over the \nhill by a long shot, and to prove it I will race you around the barn \nthree times.  If I lose, I will turn all the hens over to you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     The young rooster said, \"Fair enough!  And to show you  how \naccommodating I am, if I win, I will share half of the hens with \nyou.\"  So they started running.\u0014\n\u0014\n     The first time around the barn the older rooster was in front \nbecause he knew the territory better.  On the second leg, however, \nthe younger rooster's strength began to show, and he was fast closing \non the older one.  About that time a \"bang!\" was heard, and the \nyounger rooster fell dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n      The farmer had a shotgun in his hand.  He turns to his wife and \nsays, \"I'll be durned.  This is the third rooster I've bought this \nmonth, and every durn one of them has been a queer.\"\u0014",

Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in\u0014\nhydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and travelled by\u0014\nCamelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have\u0014\nto live elsewhere. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. The bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of \nthe\u0014\nBible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.\u0014\nOne of their children, Cain, asked, \"Am I my brother's son?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea where they made\u0014\nunleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients.\u0014\nMoses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments.\u0014\nHe died before he ever reached Canada.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Solomom had three hundred wives and seven hundred\u0014\nporcupines\u0014\n\u0014\n5. The Greeks were a highly sculptured people and without them\u0014\nwe wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a\u0014\nfemale moth. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man=20\u0014\nof that name. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving\u0014\npeople advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of\u0014\nwedlock. After his death his career suffered a dramatic decline.\u0014\n\u0014\n8. In the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the\u0014\nbiscuits, and threw the java. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. Eventually the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls\u0014\npeople Romans because they never stayed in one place for very\u0014\nlong\u0014\n\u0014\n10. Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.\u0014\nThe Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to \nbe made king.

Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by\u0014\nBernard Shaw. Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should\u0014\nbe hanged twice for the same offense. \u0014\n\u0014\n13. In midevil times most people were alliterate. The greatest writer\u0014\nof the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses\u0014\nand also wrote literature. \u0014\n\u0014\n14. Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an \napple while standing on his son's head. \u0014\n\u0014\n15. Queen Elizabeth was the \"Virgin Queen\".

Gutenberg\u0014\ninvented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention\u0014\nwas the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical\u0014\nfigure=20\u0014\nbecause he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir\u0014\nFrancis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.\u0014\n\u0014\n17. The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William\u0014\nShakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his\u0014\nbirthday. He never made much money and is famous only because\u0014\nof his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies,\u0014\nall in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a\u0014\nheroic couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet. \u0014\n\u0014\n18. Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel\u0014\nCervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John\u0014\nMilton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote\u0014\nParadise Regained. \u0014\n\u0014\n19. During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus=20\u0014\nwas a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about=20\u0014\nthe Atlantic.

The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the=20\u0014\nsettlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain=20\u0014\nJohn Smith was responsible for all this. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n21. One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English=20\u0014\nput tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their \nparcels=20\u0014\nthrough the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War=20\u0014\nand no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13=20\u0014\nstates formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin,=20\u0014\nand Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of=20\u0014\nIndependence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats=20\u0014\nbackwards and declared, \"a Horse divided against itself cannot=20\u0014\nstand.\" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n22. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to=20\u0014\nsecure domestic hostility. Under the Constitution the people=20\u0014\nenjoyed the right to bare arms. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n23. Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent.=20\u0014\nLincoln's mother died in infancy and he was born in a log cabin=20\u0014\nwhich he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the=20\u0014\nslaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of=20\u0014\nApril 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his \nseat=20\u0014\nby one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed=20\u0014\nassinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposedly insane actor. This=20\u0014\nruined Booth's career. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n24. The enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltaire invented=20\u0014\nelectricity and also wrote a book called Candy. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n25. Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable \nin=20\u0014\nthe autumn when the apples are falling off the trees. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n26. Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and=20\u0014\nhad a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old=20\u0014\nspinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the=20\u0014\npresent. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so=20\u0014\nwas Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.=20\u0014\nHe was very large. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n27. Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so=20\u0014\ndeaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even=20\u0014\nwhen everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and=20\u0014\nlater died for this. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n28. The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened=20\u0014\nand catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit=20\u0014\nhis power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't have=20\u0014\nany children. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n29. The sun never set on the British Empire because the British=20\u0014\nEmpire is in the East and the sun sets in the West. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n30. Queen Victoria was the longest queen. She sat on a thorn for=20\u0014\n63 years. She was a moral woman who practiced virtue. Her death=20\u0014\nwas the final event which ended her reign. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n31. The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts=20\u0014\nand inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started=20\u0014\nreproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a=20\u0014\nnetwork of rivers to spring up. Cyrus McCormick invented the=20\u0014\nMcCormick raper, which did the work of 100 men. =20\u0014\n\u0014\n32. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was=20\u0014\na naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie=20\u0014\ndiscovered radio.

TUCK\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eyes of the demonic seem to be burning brighter again with the \nappearance of movies and novels like Rosemary's Baby and The \nExorcists. Although the world is in a scientific and technological \nrevolution, the impact of the occult with its astrology, seances, \nSatan cults, astrologers, witches, horoscopes, and drugs reveals an \nemerging force which must be confronted in the Age of Aquarius. In \nthis sense, then, the scripture, while sounding a bit like a tale of \nEdgar Allan Poe, does have a faintly contemporary ring.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disciples never forgot the experience with the demoniac of \nGadara. So vivid was it in their minds that all three of the Synoptic \nGospels record it. After an exhausting day Jesus and his disciples \ntook a small boat across the Sea of Galilee.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs soon as the vessel touched the southern shore of the Sea of \nGalilee, Jesus and his disciples began to climb slowly up the steep \ngorge to the bluff above. Suddenly out of the darkness of the \nmountain graveyard leaps a screaming, naked, hideous creature, \ndragging and clanging the chains which were supposed to restrain him. \nHis eyes were wide with derangement, his body was covered with huge \nbloody welts, his arms were waving wildly, his long hair was \nentangled in a mass of twisted knots, and his movement seemed to \nindicate that he possessed superhuman strength.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the disciples were frozen with fear, the tormented creature \nthrows himself at the feet of Jesus. Jesus said to the man, 'Come out \nof him, evil spirit. In Jesus' words to the demoniac the tense is \nimportant. From the moment of his encounter with the demoniac, Jesus \nrepeatedly ordered the demons to be exorcised, but his first efforts \nwere unsuccessful. Then Jesus asked what may sound to us like a \nstrange inquiry: What is your name? What importance could that \npossibly have? In an age when belief in demon possession was \nprevalent, the knowledge of a demon's name gave the exorcists power \nover him. Instead of giving his name, the demons replied with a \nnumber. We are six thousand. This was the number of soldiers in a \nRoman regiment. There are many of us; we are a mob; we are Legion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe herd of swine on the slopes nearby indicates that we are in pagan \ncountry. No Jew would raise pigs, religiously unclean animals. The \nstrange request by Legion to enter the hogs, if the demons are to be \ncheated out of a human habitat, was an attempt to avoid the abyss of \nthe deep sea waters, the final area of destruction for all evil \nspirits. Ironically, the force of the demonic entrance into the pigs \nis severe enough to send the whole herd of two thousand plunging to \ntheir death into the depths of the sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice the epilogue. When the pigs herdsmen rush into the city and \nbring back the owners, do they rejoice at the great miracle which \nthey have seen? Instead of celebrating in the wonder of the \nredemption which the demoniac received, the people fear Jesus, the \nexorcist, and ask him to leave. The demoniac, alone in expressing \ngratitude, requests Jesus to let him go with him. But Jesus sends him \nhome and urges him to tell his friends about the power of God's gift \nof healing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are we to make of such a story today? Do we merely reject it as \na folk tale, reflecting the superstition and demonology of its time? \nSome approach the problem of demonology as an ancient way of \nexpressing what is called in contemporary society by psychiatric \nnomenclature. Biblical references to demon possessions are seen as \noriental descriptions of epilepsy. schizophrenia, or various forms of \ninsanity. Without question there is much truth in this approach.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus did not attribute all illness to demon possession. The blind \nman, Jairus' daughter, the woman with the hemorrhage, the paralytic, \nand the centurian's servant are all cases where Jesus does not \nassociate diseases with evil spirits. In some instances it is clearly \nevident that the person was either an eplileptic or suffered from \nsome kind of psychological disturbance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the problem of demon possession in the New Testament cannot be \nsolved that easily. Jesus not only spoke about the power of demons \nbut he also exorcised them and commanded his disciples to cast them \nout in his name. Though it may seem embarrassing to a church which \nfunctions in a scientific age, the power to cast out demons was \ncentral to the ministry of Jesus. Harvey Cox has declared, Most of \nus would prefer to forget that for many of his contemporaries Jesus' \nexorcism was ~i1 no way peripheral but stood at the heart of his \nwork. Paul Tillich affirmed that preaching Christ as the power to \nconquer the demonic forces that control our lives, mind and body, \nwill prove to be the most adequate way to communicate the message of \nChrist for the people of our time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can this demonic imagery be meaningful to us today? The answer \nlies in breaking through the prescientific images of demons and evil \nspirits to the reality to which they attest. The New Testament \nacknowledges vividly the awesome power of evil in such images as \nprincipalities and powers, Messengers of Satan, rulers of \ndarkness, Satan, the father of lies and deception, the \nAntichrist, the evil one, the adversary, and the destroyer. \nPrincipalities and powers, a phrase that recurs frequently in the \nwritings of Paul, was a common New Testament conception of the cosmic \ndimension of the power of evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern man laughs at the old Cornish prayer: From ghoulies and \nghosties, and long-leggity beasties, and all things that go bump in \nthe night, good lord, deliver us. We are too modern for that. We \nprefer: From systems and ologies and isms, good Lord, free us. Evil \nbecomes more comfortable for us when it is abstract and impersonal. \nChallenging this comfortable approach, Cohn Morris has stated: I \nmake no apology for calling evil by that old-fashioned, personal \nname, the Devil. It is a good way of keeping us alert to the fact \nthere is about the operation of evil the subtlety of a malevolent \npersonality rather than the crudity of a blind, irrational force.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou do not think evil is real? Can we possibly believe that the \ndepths and the dimensions of the kingdom of evil in the world are \nmerely illusions of the mind. Tell the relatives of the six million \nJews who were annihilated by the Nazis that there is no evidence of \ndemonic power in the world. Tell the villagers at Mai Lai that evil \nis an illusion. Tell it to the parents whose son jumped from the \ntwelfth story after an overdose of LSD. Are we really so civilized \nthat we cannot see the awesome power of evil? We no longer throw ink \nwells at the devil, as Martin Luther once did. We are too civilized \nfor that, too mature! Yet one of the most civilized nations in the \nworld exterminated six million human beings of one race.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us be honest and admit as openly arid forcefully as did the early \nNew Testament Christians that evil is real and demonic. Somewhere we \nhave lost the New Testament urgency of the unseen warfare. Without \nhesitation the New Testament senses a mighty contradiction at the \nheart of the universe. The New Testament writers picture the \nChristian engaged in a combat with the forces of evil, but they shout \na ringing affirmation that in Jesus Christ God has unleashed victory \nover sin, death, and the principalities and the powers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commentaries which I have examined indicate that this demoniac \npassage is without realistic theological or moral value for modern \nman. Rather than being out of focus for today's man, Legion is \nsymbolic of modern man. He is contemporary man; he is each of us. The \ndemoniac becomes our mirror. Jesus says, What is your name? My \nname is Legion. I am many. I am a mob. I do not know who I am. There \nare many selves within me, and I am torn and pulled in every \ndirection, seeking to find myself. How often we say: I don't feel \nlike myself today. I was nearly out of my mind. I said to myself, \n'Pull yourself together. Christ, he comes in judgment. A  'I just \nwas not myself single life standing in the light of the other day. \n\"I am ashamed of the judgment of his presence sees myself. I forgot \nmyself for the the immensity of the force of Legion moment. I hate \nmyself for doing within, which divides and per-that. \u0014\n\u0014\nMan is rarely a unity; he is plexes one's personality. He will\u0014\nns a at civil war within.

When bring to man a center in his \ndivided man is initially confronted by life.\u0014\n\u0014\nLegion's cry, then, was real, and it is the cry of every man: What \nhave you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech \nyou, do not torment me. But redemption does come to this disturbed \nman. His torn personality finds wholeness through the power of \nChrist. Come out of the man you, unclean spirit! Here is the act of \nredemption, freeing a man's spirit from chaos to unity, conflict, to \npeace, bondage to freedom, despair to hope, and fragmentation to \noneness. Jesus Christ offers to man the unification and integration \nof his personality. He calls a truce to the internal civil war and \nfurnishes wholeness and stability.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus' exorcism is viewed merely as a healing, the deep \nimplications of the cosmic dimension of salvation are minimized. It \nis clear from the gospel accounts that Jesus wanted to avoid the \nreputation of simply being a hea1er. There was a cosmic element to \nhis heahings. The salvation of Jesus is concerned with the total man, \nnot just man's physical, moral, or spiritual self, but the whole man \nand his interrelatedness. Redemption is concerned with overcoming \nman's estrangement from himself, others, and God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mighty contradiction which man senses in the universe goes beyond \nhis need merely for redemption of his individual sins; he experiences \nthe power of collective evil. The modern demons which threaten to \ndestroy man are more than just the sum of individual evil acts. \nExorcising demons, modern style, will involve redeeming not only \nindividuals but also the systems which have enslaved them. The evil \nforces which crucified Christ are representative of the corporate \naspect of evil: religious intolerance, commercial graft and political \ncorruption, injustice, the mob mentality, public apathy, militarism, \nand the class system. These evil forces are deeply rooted within our \nsocial systems. Jesus was crucified by a system which allowed him to \nbe executed, although he was found innocent. As a member of the lower \nclass he was not given representation or defense.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut corporate evil is not confined to the first century. Confronting \nthe collective power of evil is the modern equivalent of exorcising \ndemons. The Church, as Walter Rauschenbush said more than fifty years \nago, is the social factor of salvation. The Church is the social \nforce in the world which challenges the collective forces of evil. At \nleast it should be! The Church to use Harvey Cox's phrase, is the \ncultural exorcist. The Church is the social force which says, for \nexample, that not only do we seek to challenge and overcome racial \nprejudice but we shall also strive to help the minority groups to \nattain their own sense of personal respect and dignity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome voices say that if we get men to make a personal commitment to \nChrist, the problem with society will be solved. I wish it were so! \nIn a deep southern community a young minister friend of mine \nattempted to relate the gospel to men of all races. He was told he \ncould not enter the pulpit again, and he, his wife, and five children \nwere put out of their home within a week. Was that church, where \nindividuals had made commitments to Christ, free from the demonic \npower of evil? A deeper dimension of redemption and healing was \nneeded. Sometimes, instead of being the force to change society, the \nchurch perpetuates the very evil from which it needs deliverance. But \nthe challenge remains: the church is called today to be the exorcist, \nthe healer, and the deliverer from the demonic forces in society.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice again the epilogue to the story. After the demoniac has \nreceived redemption, the townspeople are terrified by a man who has \nsuch powers and seem little concerned with the change in Legion. The \nowners of the pigs were also greatly disturbed by their loss. They \nappeared more upset about the loss of the pigs than the cure of the \nman. How contemporary can a story be! Pigs are more important than \npeople. Property rights are more important than human rights. The \nmirror is before us as we sense modern man's reaction to open \nhousing, racial desegregation, poverty, and Mhe ghettos. Property is \nmore important than people. Here is a demonic force whose power is so \nintense that it is incessantly moving man closer to chaos. Cured and \nsane, Legion desires to follow Jesus. But Jesus instructs him to go \nhome, the toughest territory of all for him to demonstrate his \nwholeness. Go home and show your family and friends the wholeness and \nunity which God has given you. No easy task for any man.\u0014\nT. H. White in a modern fantasy entitled The Sword and the Stone \ndepicts a contest between Merlin the Magician and the evil witch, \nMadame Mim. It is a contest to the death, both using their greatest \nskills and powers. Madame Mim assumes many horrible and deadly \nshapes, but each time Merlin meets her with one better until finally \nthe witch is annihilated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the centuries evil has assumed many forms, shapes, and \ndisguises. Sometimes it has been recognized in the form of one nation \nenslaving another, or a small group of men crushing any in the way of \ntheir self-appointed goal, or one individual demanding absolute \nobedience to his fanatical wishes. Whatever shape evil may take, the \nChristian must never lose sight of the fact that he is indeed engaged \nin an unseen warfare with principalities and powers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Christian engages in this struggle with the assurance of \nvictory. Through Jesus Christ man finds inner courage and strength, \nhaving done all, to stand. The Christian is aware, though he may \nstumble under the impact of the demonic power, ultimately evil will \nbe defeated. In hope and anticipation, he shouts in the face of evil \nthe words of the Apostle Paul in Romans 8:31, 37-39.\u0014",

Jack worked at the high \nschool agriculture shop, where he had a job cutting oak trees into \nfence posts. The money he earned helped support their family, which \nwas struggling to survive by working in the cotton fields of rural \nArkansas. A terrible accident occurred one day. A table saw severely \ncut Jack, resulting in his death a few days later. \u0014\n\u0014\nSometime before his death, Jack had announced to his family and the \ncommunity that he intended to be a preacher. Everyone agreed he would \nmake a fine preacher, for his strong Christian character was already \nwell known. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohnny Cash looked up to his older brother, and Jack's example still \ninfluences him to this day. Cash writes, \"Jack isn't really gone, \nanyway, any more than anyone is. For one thing, his influence on me \nis profound. When we were kids, he tried to turn me from the way of \ndeath to the way of life, to steer me toward the light, and since he \ndied his words and his example have been like signposts for me. The \nmost important question in many of the conundrums and crises of my \nlife has been 'Which is Jack's way? Which direction would he have \ntaken?'

    "words": "HORNE:\tESCHATOLOGYTHE CONTROLLING THEMATIC IN THEOLOGY 59\u0014\n\u0014\nSOME MAJOR Vmws OF THE ESCHATOLOGICAL MOTIF\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Existential View\u0014\n\u0014\nRudolph Bultmann is the foremost example of this approach. From the \nstandpoint of traditional temporal eschatologies Bultmann's position \nrepresents. a 'de-eschatologizing'. Flowing from the device of \n'demythologizing' his main purpose has been to make the message of \nthe New Testament relevant to modern man. While an Evangelical \nscholar may not be critical of Bultmann's purpose he cannot be \npleased with his method. Thus as an exegete he was already \nreinterpreting eschatology existentially in divesting it of its \ntemporality.' Contrasting Schweitzer with Bultmann, Cullmann states,\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas for Schweitzer and his school the delay of the parousia had \nto transform Jesus' eschatology, temporally understood, into a \nsalvation history by one way or another, in a rectilinear \nlengthening, according to Bultmann and his school the delay induced \ntwo totally different developments. One was a legitimate one, freeing \nthe core of Jesus' expectation to be disclosed existentially, and the \nother was the illegitimate, the salvation-historical one, taking \nfurther the temporal element that really should be eliminated.20\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Bultmannian position, Paul and John provide us with \na legitimate eschatological perspectivefor them Christ is supposedly \nthe end of all continuous history. The original core is more and \nmore consciously extracted from the mythological husk of a temporal \nend.21 The false solution is the salvation-historical approach found \nin Luke's writings.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the early Barth, as well as for the later Tillich, the \neschatology of the eternal now was dominant. The universal relevance \nof eschatolgy was gained by a radical redefinition in which the \nhorizon of the future disappeared into the eternal depths of the \npresent moment.... In Bultinann's case the future was finally \nsubjectivized into the futuricity of existence in the immediate \npresent. The eschatological future became an existential stance of \nopenness to the world. The future as the front line of God's \nadvancing kingdom which generates the expectancy of really new \nhappenings in world history was not the focus of faith in the period \nof dialectical theology. Neither Barth's theology of the word nor \nBultmann's theology of existence gave us an eschatology that \nincorporated the horizontal line of history that moves outward and \nforward. Theology was eschatological in terms of a vertical dialectic \nbetween eternity\u0014\n\u0014\n19.\tOscar Cullmann, Salvation in History (New York: Harper and Row, \nPubs.,\u0014\n1967), p. 41.\u0014\n20.\tIbid., p. 43 f.\u0014\n21.\tIbid., p. 44.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nand time, from above to below, but at the price of the horizon of the \nfuture.22\u0014\n\u0014\nTermporal Views\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tConsistent Eschatologyan exclusive futuristic eschatology. It may \nbe defined as the consistent interpretation of Jesus' eschatology as \nan expectation of an imminent end.23 The foremost representative of \nthis position was Mbcrt Schweitzer. He maintained that Jesus taught \nthe imminent end, temporally understood. This proved however, to be \nan illusion and thus in a subsequent development of theology we see \nnot a consistent eschatology but a progressive abandonment of \neschatology a 'consistent de-eschatologizing'.\u0014\n\u0014\nCullmann writes concerning Schweitzer,\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an exegete Schweitzer did not, like Bultmann, find an existential \nmeaning as the actual intention of Jesus behind his futuristic \nexpectation. Thus, from, Schweitzer's exegetical premises the \nconclusion must actually be drawn that Jesus' whole teaching stands \nor falls with this expectation as its central point, and therefore \nmust fall and be given up. We all know that Schweitzer did not draw \nthis conclusion. We know what Jesus and Paul actually meant for \nSchweitzer. But he based his own philosophy of life neither on Jesus' \nexpectation that the end was imminent, which was proven an illusion \nand in no case could be reinterpreted, nor upon some kind of \nde-eschatologizing 'salvation history' understood as a solution to an \nembarrassment created by the delay of the parousia and therefore \nvalueless because it had its beginning in an illusion. Schweitzer \nfounded his own personal attitude on 'reverence for life.' For \nSchweitzer, this went hand in hand with a practical Christianity. But \ntheoretically it was neither rooted in the eschatology of Jesus, as \nSchweitzer understood it exegetically, nor in the eschatological \nmysticism of Paul, which he rejected because it was worked out in an \neffort to come to grips with an illusion. Since Schweitzer as an \nexegete is averse to every reinterpretation of the New Testament, an \nimpossible gap opens between his exegetical and his \nreligious-philosophical attitudes. With his extremely consistent, but \npurely hypothetical, exegetical account of Jesus' teachings and his \nflagrant inconsistency in his practical conclusions, Schweitzer's \nimposing theological work left behind burning and unanswered \nquestions and therefore has determined the debate of the present to \nan extent which the parties in dialogue today hardly recognize.24\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tRealized Eschatologyan eschatology of the present. According to \nthis view the Kingdom of God has already dawned in the ultimate \nsense. Representatives of this view include: C. H. Dodd, J. A. T. \nRobinson, Joachim. Jeremias and Ethelbert Stauffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to this position Jesus never spoke of an actual eschato-\u0014\n\u0014\n22.\tBraaten, The Future of God, p. 19 f.\u0014\n23.\tCullmann, Salvation in History, p. 29.\u0014\n24.\tIbid., p. 31 f.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nlogical event in the distant future but only of events in the \nimpending history of Israel. Exegetically all the futuristic \nstatements of Jesus are understood as referring either to the present \nor, at any rate, to the coming events of the present and already \nfulfilled aeon. Whatever cannot be thus explained is regarded as a \nlatter addition. 25\u0014\n\u0014\nDodd and his followers maintain that there was a break between Jesus' \nview of the end and that held by some within the early church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe may compare Dodd and Schweitzer in this respect as follows:\u0014\n                                 \tJesus\t        The Primitive Church\u0014\nDodd\tThe Kingdom realized in the\t       Its dawning shifted \nto                     \u0014\n\t                            present\t                           the \nfuture\u0014\n\u0014\nSchweitzer The Kingdom to be realized     Its dawning shifted into\u0014\n\t                      in the future\t               the present\u0014\n\u0014\nIt should be carefully noted that Dodd and Schweitzer are agreed that \nJesus' and the Church's expectation of the end were conceived in a \ntemporal way; the former making it all a matter of the present, the \nlatter all a matter of the future from the perspective of Jesus \nHimself.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. A Realized and Anticipated Eschatologya present and future \neschatology. According to this view, the basic feature \ncharacterizing Jesus' eschatology was that the Kingdom of God \nproclaimed to be at once present and future.26 Two important \nrepresentatives of this position are Oscar Cllmann and W. G. \nKumm.el. Cullmann states,\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout advancing the tension between 'already' and 'not yet,' as I \nhave done in my later works, I took up a position accepting neither \nthe present nor the futuristic interpretation of Jesus' eschatology, \nfinding instead its. characteristic and essential feature in the \njuxtaposition of present and future, thereby assuming that the \nbeginings of a salvation history could already be found with Jesus.27\u0014\n\u0014\nCullmann maintains that the key to the understanding of New Testament \nSalvation History is the Salvation-Historical tension between \n'Already' and 'Not Yet.'28 In Christ, the Kingdom is both present and \nfuture.\u0014\n\u0014\nCullmann sees two days in the divine war with evil: D-day occurred at \nthe midpoint of history in Jesus Christ when the powers of evil were \nbroken by the Kingdom of God; V-day will be the day of the Parousia \nwhen the Kingdom will destroy the powers of evil and will fill the \nworld.29\u0014\n\u0014\n25.\tibid., p. 35.\u0014\n26.\tibid., p. 37.\u0014\n27.\tIbid., p. 37 f.\u0014\n28.\tibid., p. 166 if.\u0014\n29.\tGeorge E. Ladd, The Pattern of New Testament Truth (Grand Rapids, \nMich.:\u0014\nWin. B. Eerdinans Pub. Co., 1968), p. 50.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers scholars representing this approach have suggested the \nformula: promise, fulfillment, and consummation of the KingdomA. M. \nHunter, R. Schnackenburg. Actually the central problem in current \ndiscussion of the Kingdom of God is its relationship to history in \nview of the modem historian's understanding of history but for all of \nthose in this school the Kingdom is concerned with history. It has \nbroken into history in Jesus Christ, and it will involve a \nconsummation in power either in history or at the end of history.30\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament promise of the coming of the Kingdom, fulfillment \nof the promise of the Kingdom in history in the person, words, and \ndeeds of Jesus, consummation of the promise at the end of \nhistorythis is the basic structure of the theology of the Synoptic \nGospels 31\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Kingdom has come (Matt. 12:28) in Christ's own person and \nmission. This is the 'mystery' of the Kingdom (Mark 4:11): the \nrevelation of a new redemptive actthat before the eschatological \ntheophany, God has invaded history to bring men the blessings of his \nredemptive reign. But the Kingdom is also yet to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis eschatological (referring to the end of time) character of the \nkingdom of God preached by Jesus is one of the chief presuppositions \nof the whole of his kerygma, and the references to it are like a \ngolden thread interwoven with glorious future in places like Matthew \n7:21,.. .(Matt. 8:11, cf. Lukel3:28, 29);.. .(Matt. 13:43); ...(Matt. \nl6:28);...(Mark9:1);...(Matt.2021 of. MarklO:37);\u0014\n(Matt. 25:34);... (Matt. 26:29, of. Mark 14:25, Luke 22:18). It is \ndifficult to deny that these passages, and many others, speak of \nanother realityan 'eschatological' reality.33\u0014\n\u0014\nThis later view would appear to be the lines, along which an \nEvangelical eschatology must be constructed.\u0014\n\u0014\nCONCLUSION\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we may best summarize the purpose of this survey of current \neschatological thought as providing the controlling thematic in \ntheology by the following statements.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, eschatology is an aspect of divine truth which needs special \nemphasis in our day; it would appear to have particular apologetic \nvalue.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, we must be careful however, that we do not allow it to become \nsimply another theological fad.\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, one way in which we may guard against this is by seeking to\u0014\n\u0014\n30.\tIbid., p. 51.\u0014\n31.\tIbid., p. 54.\u0014\n32.\tIbid., p. 55.\u0014\n33.\tHerman Ridderbos, The Coming of the Kingdom (Philadelphia: The \nPresbyterian and Reformed Pub Co., 1962), p. 37 f.\u0014\nconstruct a Biblical concept of the Future. Our eschatology must be \nbased upon a careful exegetical study of the Scriptures themselves..\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Biblical concept of the Future in broad outline would include:\u0014\n(1)\tThe idea of the Kingdom of God as His sovereign redemptive rule \nin the lives of men working forward toward the ultimate dawning of \nthat eternal Kingdom when God will be all in alla Kingdom which will \nbe realized either in or at the end of history. (2) The idea that \nthis Kingdom is both present and future'already' but 'not yet'. (3) \nThe idea that this rule of God is being centrally mediated though \nChrist by the Spirit in, history. (4) The idea that the power of the \nGod of the Future is calculated to move us into responsible action on \nbehalf of others in the present.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Furth, we should celebrate in the present in appreciation of \nGod's working in the past and in anticipation of His coming in the \nfuture.\u0014",

Cuneo, author of \nAmerican Exorcism:\u0014\n                      Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Agnieszka Tennant | posted 8/24/01\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Recently we've seen a rise in interest in \nexorcism. What\u0014\n                      makes it so appealing?\u0014\n                      We live in a therapy-mad culture. There's been \nan explosion over the\u0014\n                      past couple decades of 12-step groups and \ntherapeutic procedures of\u0014\n                      every imaginable description. Everyone, it \nseems, has been looking\u0014\n                      for some kind of an instant fix to problems. \nExorcism fits in very\u0014\n                      nicely because it is a kind of therapy that \npromises to be\u0014\n                      immediately and dramatically effective. And for \nmany people, by the\u0014\n                      way, this in fact is the case. Demon expulsion \nmay be\u0014\n                      therapeutically beneficial, at least in the \nshort term. There's no\u0014\n                      question about that. It's a relatively \ninexpensive therapy that can be\u0014\n                      taken with dispatch. Exorcism is, for the most \npart, morally\u0014\n                      exculpatory. It lets us off the hook.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The devil made me do it\"?\u0014\n                      Yes, you know, my sexual infidelities, well, \nthey're not my fault; it's\u0014\n                      the demons. Or my recurrent animosities toward \ncoworkers? Well, I\u0014\n                      mean, obviously I'm demonized. We live in a \nculture where we're\u0014\n                      encouraged to look for ways to get us off the \nmoral hook and to find\u0014\n                      excuses. Indisputably, we are also, as a \nculture, very\u0014\n                      impressionable. And we are deeply influenced by \nthe images that are\u0014\n                      presented to us by the popular entertainment \nindustry.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Have you witnessed an exorcism or a deliverance \nsession in\u0014\n                      which you were convinced demons were really \ncast out?\u0014\n                      I always go on site and interview people \ndirectly and take situations\u0014\n                      seriously. But still there's so much I don't \nknow. I attended more than\u0014\n                      50 exorcisms and never once did I walk away \nconvinced that the\u0014\n                      person being exorcised was really demonized. I \nalways thought that\u0014\n                      medical, cultural, and psychiatric explanations \ncould have accounted\u0014\n                      for what was going on. But I could be wrong. \nAnd people would\u0014\n                      always say to me, \"But Michael, you should have \nbeen here last\u0014\n                      week.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      You just missed it!\u0014\n                      But that might be true. And some would say to \nme, \"The reason you\u0014\n                      haven't seen really powerful and dramatic \nsymptoms of\u0014\n                      demonization, such as bodies levitating and so \nforth, is that you're a\u0014\n                      writer, and the Devil is trying to disguise his \nactivity and hide it from\u0014\n                      you.\" I would find that strange but, \nnevertheless, it may be a\u0014\n                      possibility. A psychiatrist friend told me \nthat, in his estimation, 999\u0014\n                      out of 1,000 claims of demonic possession are \nfalse claims. But he\u0014\n                      believes that there's always that one out of \n1,000 which isn't false. I\u0014\n                      never happened across that one.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Does exorcism work?\u0014\n                      I haven't done the long-term, follow-up studies \nit would take to answer\u0014\n                      this question definitively. In the short term, \nexorcism can be\u0014\n                      therapeutically beneficial for certain people. \nIt can provide relief,\u0014\n                      reinforce their sense of self, and help them \novercome a feeling of\u0014\n                      demoralization or depression. I think exorcism \ncan provide spiritual\u0014\n                      and emotional rejuvenation; it can embolden \npeople and empower\u0014\n                      people. I'm not suggesting this would be in \nevery case and with all\u0014\n                      people. In some cases, demon expulsion can be \nnasty and\u0014\n                      detrimental. But I was at many exorcisms where \nI was convinced\u0014\n                      that at the very least nothing detrimental was \nhappening. If anything,\u0014\n                      something therapeutically beneficial was taking \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Could you describe it?\u0014\n                      I sat in on quite a few private deliverances \nthat were conducted by\u0014\n                      evangelical deliverance ministers. The majority \nof these were\u0014\n                      undertaken with pastoral adroitness and \npsychotherapeutic\u0014\n                      sensitivity. And these evangelical deliverance \nor exorcism ministers,\u0014\n                      for the most part, were not determined to find \ndemons in the subject\u0014\n                      at all costs. There was real gentleness and a \nreal care taken. I didn't\u0014\n                      know if there were demons presentI'm not smart \nenough to figure\u0014\n                      that out since I don't have any special power \nof spiritual\u0014\n                      discernmentbut at the very least I was \nconvinced that nothing bad\u0014\n                      was taking place and the person receiving \nexorcism or deliverance\u0014\n                      was not harmed. I saw people who, in the short \nterm, would clearly\u0014\n                      feel better, feel uplifted, and empowered. And, \nfollowing the casting\u0014\n                      out of their demons, they would overcome \ndemoralization.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.\u0014",

It appears\u0014\nthat presumably honest and well-intentioned citizens mistakenly \nidentified them as\u0014\nviolent criminals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs tragic as their stories are, they are the lucky ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are others imprisoned on mistaken identifications who will not \nbe proven innocent.\u0014\nMistaken eyewitnesses, many of them adamant about their \nidentifications, are the top\u0014\nreason innocent people wind up behind bars.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow is it possible for a witness to be so certain, yet so wrong, when \nthe stakes are so\u0014\nhigh?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's easy. Just ask Jennifer Thompson of Winston-Salem, N.C.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was the rape victim whose testimony sent Ronald Cotton to prison \nfor 11 years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was positive. I couldn't have been more certain of anything in my \nlife,\" Thompson said of her identification of Cotton as the lone \nrapist. She had carefully\u0014\nstudied the face of her attacker. Yet, she testified, she had never \nseen another suspect in the case, Bobby Poole.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, she said, \"there was never a moment when I ques- EYEWITNESSES \ntioned myself - not ever was there a moment when I thought I made a \nmistake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, in 1995, DNA tests proved her to be wrong. Cotton was innocent. \nPoole was the rapist.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can it happen?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe short answer, said Gary L. Wells, a professor at Iowa State \nUniversity and an expert on witness identification, is that \neyewitness identification is unreliable under certain conditions yet \nhighly persuasive to jurors. The degree of confidence shown by the \nwitness may sway a jury, but it has no\u0014\nbearing on accuracy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf eyewitness testimony were more reliable, then its persuasiveness \nwould not be such a problem. If it were not so persuasive, then its \nunreliability would not be such a problem, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Edmund S. Higgins, a Charleston, S.C., psychiatrist who has \nstudied wrongful convictions, says memory is not permanent. It can \nchange over time without a witness being aware of it. Even the \ninitial memory can be inaccurate because of stress and trauma, poor \nlighting and other factors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, Wells said, in a sense, memory is like trace evidence such as \nfingerprints, blood and fibers, in that it \"can be tampered with, \ndestroyed, lost distorted or contaminated by the process used to \ncollect it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCox was identified by two witnesses who were themselves facing \ncriminal charges. Betty Layne DesPortes, one of Cox's lawyers, said, \n\"Certainly nothing Jeff did put him in the crosshairs [of the \npolice]. Here he was - a guy from New Kent being identified for a \nRichmond murder.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If it can happen to Jeff, it can happen to anybody,\" warned \nDesPortes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Innocence Project, of the first 70 prisoners in the \ncountry freed by DNA testing, 61 were wrongly convicted at least in \npart because of mistaken identification. In a study by Higgins of 316 \nprisoners found to be innocent, 184, or 58 percent, were convicted \nbecause of erroneous\u0014\neyewitness identification.\u0014\n\u0014\nTim Murtaugh, spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Jerry W. \nKilgore, said, \"We have no evidence that convictions based on \nmistaken eyewitness evidence is a common problem. It's a rarity. But \ncertainly, you're dealing with human beings, and human beings make \nmistakes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMurtaugh said that is why Kilgore supports the use of technological \nadvances such as DNA to support the testimony of witnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\nContributing to the problem, Wells said, is that, in many police \nagencies, witnesses are asked to look at photo or in-person lineups \nthat usually involve six or more photos or possible suspects.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said the cognitive process underlying recognition memory is \ncomplex, but there is one process that is simple to understand: \nPeople have a tendency to pick the person who looks most like the \noffender compared to the other members of the lineup.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Controlled eyewitness experiments consistently show that the most \ndifficult problem for eyewitnesses is recognizing the absence of the \noffenders because, even when the offender is not in the lineup, there \nis still someone who looks most like the offenders,\" Wells wrote in a \nrecent paper.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigators can compound the problem, reinforcing the error by \ntelling the witness, or even unconsciously suggesting, they picked \nout the \"right\" suspect. In the Thompson-Cotton case, when Thompson \npicked out Cotton's photo, detectives turned to her and said, \"That's \nthe guy we thought it was,\" Wells wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1984, Thompson was a 22-year-old student at Elon College who lived \nalone in a Burlington, N.C., apartment when she was raped. Police \ndrew a composite sketch of her attacker, and she said the face on the \nsketch, which differed from her attacker, became, in her mind, the \nface of the rapist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sketch ran in the local newspaper, and a caller phoned police to \nreport that it resembled Cotton. Cotton had been convicted earlier of \nbreaking and entering and assault with the intent to commit rape. \nPolice believed he was a good suspect.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on her new mind's-eye view of the suspect, Thompson picked \nCotton's photograph out of a lineup of photographs police presented \nto her. It was his face that now became the face of the rapist.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe positively identified him as the assailant in the 1984 trial, and \nhe was convicted. Cotton said he could not understand how she could \nidentify him. While in prison, Cotton heard of another inmate, Bobby \nPoole, bragging that he had committed the rape of Thompson.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton won another trial; during it, Thompson was asked if Poole was \nher attacker. \"I said, 'I've never seen him before in my life. I \ndon't know who he is.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton remembers Thompson pointing him out in the courtroom at the \nfirst trail. \"I just couldn't believe it. I know people can get \npeople mixed up,\" especially people of a different race, he said. \nNevertheless, \"I just couldn't believe it. I was angry. She's got the \nwrong one. She has it all wrong.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was convicted a second time. But, in 1995, DNA tests proved that \nCotton was innocent and Poole, who has since died in prison, guilty. \nThe news shocked Thompson and moved her to meet with Cotton in 1997. \nCotton forgave her, and the two are now friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nCox spent nearly 11 years in prison for a Richmond murder after two \neyewitnesses identified him as a participant in the slaying. Anderson \nspent 15 years in prison when an Ashland rape victim identified him \nas the suspect. Both were apparently cleared recently, Anderson by \nDNA and Cox when a renewed investigation cast doubt on his guilt and \nled to the arrest of another suspect.\u0014\n\u0014\nCox was freed from prison last year. Anderson was already on parole \nwhen the DNA tests were run. Hanover Commonwealth's Attorney Kirby H. \nPorter is waiting for further DNA test results before deciding \nwhether to join in a petition to the governor for a full pardon for \nAnderson.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe witnesses in their cases either could not be reached or declined \nto comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Anderson case, according to the Innocence Project, a color \nphotograph from Anderson's employer - Anderson had no convictions so \nno mug shot was available - were shown to the victim, along with a \nhalf dozen other black and white photographs. The victim picked \nAnderson as her attacker.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn hour later, she picked him out of a lineup. Anderson was the only \nperson in the lineup whose photograph was in the array she had been \nshown earlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnderson recently declined to comment on his case. However, last \nmonth, he told The Times-Dispatch he did not blame the victim for \nmaking a mistake. \"I have no animosity toward her. Here's a woman \nthat was attacked, beaten and raped,\" he said. \"She was confused \nabout a lot of things.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Cox's case, his lawyers said the two eyewitnesses could not make a \npositive identification of him from photographs, so police arranged \nfor them to see him in person when he was led through a door into \nRichmond General District Court in handcuffs by deputy sheriffs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as Cox is concerned, the security measures meant he was a \ncriminal who must have been guilty of something. \"Anybody led through \nthat door would have been convicted,\" he said. One of the witnesses \ndid identify Cox that day, and the other identified him at his \none-day trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nCox remembers their identifying him. \"You got people up there saying \nsomething that's not true. . . . It was a traumatic experience. How \ndo you unprove it? I wanted to speak up and say, 'That isn't true!'\" \nbut he couldn't.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can't really hold any animosity toward them. I don't really know \nthe story\" of how they came to identify him, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis lawyer, DesPortes, agreed. \"We don't really know the \ncircumstances yet as to how the identification was made.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Was there some suggestiveness in the process, in which case you \nwouldn't even be able to fault the witnesses for making a mistake?\" \nshe said. \"It may be that it was purely a mistake. An absolute \nmistake. We do know that neither of the witnesses knew Jeff, and they \nhad no animosity toward him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Frank Green at (804) 649-6340 or fgreen@timesdispatch.com \u0014\nThis story can be found at : \nhttp://www.tiMESDIspATCH.com/vametro/archive/mgbgs74ozwc.html\u0014",

It is \nunworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining rock, and cover \nHim in whose fist all things are enclosed. Take away the linen \nclothes, I pray; leave the napkins in the tomb: Thou art sufficient \nfor us, and without Thee there is nothing. Release the chained shades \nof the infernal prison, and recall to the upper regions whatever \nsinks to the lowest depths. Give back Thy face, that the world may \nsee the light; give back the day which flees from us at Thy death. \nBut returning, O holy conqueror! Thou didst altogether fill the \nheaven!\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther, German Reformer; sermon, ca. 1525\u0014\nYou have heard in the story of the Passion how Christ is portrayed as \nour exemplar and helper, and that he who follows him and clings to \nhim receives the Spirit, who will enable him also to suffer. But the \nwords of Paul are more Christian and should come closer home to our \nhearts and comfort us more, when he says: \"Christ was raised for our \njustification.\" Here the Lamb is truly revealed, of whom John the \nBaptist testifies, when he says in Jn. 1, 29: \"Behold, the Lamb of \nGod, that taketh away the sin of the world.\" Here is fulfilled that \nwhich was spoken to the serpent: \"I will put enmity between thee and \nthe woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy \nhead,\" which means that for all those who believe in him, hell, \ndeath, and the devil and sin have been destroyed. In the same manner \nthe promise is fulfilled today which God gave to Abraham, when he \nsaid in Gen. 22, 18: \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth \nbe blessed.\" Here Christ is meant, who takes away our curse and the \npower of sin, death and the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll this is done, I say, by faith. For if you believe that by this \nseed the serpent has been slain, then it is slain for you; and if you \nbelieve that in this seed all nations are to be blessed, then you are \nalso blessed.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Donne, dean of the Cathedral of St. Paul's, London; sermon, \nMarch 28, 1619\u0014\nChrist dyed because he would dye; other men admitted to the dignity \nof Martyrdome, are willing to dye; but they dye by the torments of \nthe Executioners, they cannot bid their soules goe out, and say, now \nI will dye. And this was Christs case: It was not only, I lay down my \nlife for my sheep [John 10:15], but he sayes also, No man can take \naway my soule; And, I have power to lay it down; And De facto, he did \nlay it down, he did dye, before the torments could have extorted his \nsoule from him; Many crucified men lived many dayes upon the Crosse; \nThe thieves were alive, long after Christ was dead; and therefore \nPilate wondred, that he was already dead [Mark 15:44]. His soule did \nnot leave his body by force, but because he would, and when he would, \nand how he would; Thus far then first, this is an answer to this \nquestion, Quis homo? [Who is this man?] Christ did not die naturally, \nnor violently, as all others doe, but only voluntarily.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Spurgeon, British Baptist preacher; sermon, April 9, 1882\u0014\nThe learned are going to destroy the Christian religion. Already, \naccording to their boastings, it has pretty nearly come to an end. \nThe pulpit is effete, it cannot command public attention. We stand up \nand preach to empty benches! As you seeor do not see. Nothing \nremains for us but to die decently, so they insinuate. And what then? \nWhen our Lord was dead, when the clay-cold corpse lay watched by the \nRoman soldiery, and with a seal upon the enclosing stone, was not the \ncause in mortal jeopardy? But how fared it? Did it die out? Every \ndisciple that Jesus had made forsook Him, and fled, was not \nChristianity then destroyed? Nay, that very day our Lord won a \nvictory which shook the gates of hell, and caused the universe to \nstand astonished. Matters are not worse with Him at this hour! His \naffairs are not in a sadder condition today than then. Nay, see Him \ntoday and judge. On His head are many crowns, and at His feet the \nhosts of angels bow! Jesus is the master of legions today, while the \nCaesars have passed away! Here are His peopleneedy, obscure, \ndespised, I grant you, still, but assuredly somewhat more numerous \nthan they were when they laid Him in the tomb.

    "title": "EASTER IN AN AGE OF TERROR",
    "words": "Easter in an Age of Terror\u0014\nLiving and dyingand living againafter September 11.\u0014\nBy M. Craig Barnes | posted 03/28/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople flood churches on Easter because they know they are going to \nhear good news. But Easter is also terrifying news. According to \nMark's Gospel, early on a Sunday morning Mary Magdalene, Mary the \nmother of James, and Salome made their way to a tomb to anoint the \ndead body of Jesus. Mark also tells us that these women had earlier \nwatched the crucifixion of Jesus \"from a distance\" (Mark 15:40). When \nit was all over, they saw Joseph of Arimathea pull the dead body off \nthe cross, wrap it in a linen cloth, lay it in a tomb hewn out of a \nrock, and then roll the stone over the door of the tomb. They watched \nit all from a distance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is our favorite perspective on deathwe do all we can to keep \nour distance from it. We try to stay healthy, work out, watch what we \neat, and we're careful. So careful. It's all a way of keeping death \nat bay. But occasionally it catches up to someone you love, and then \nyou know, like these women, that you have to go and see death up \nclose.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast September 11, it became painfully clear that death can always \nbridge the distance to find any of us. What crumbled on that dark day \nwere not just skyscrapers, but also our illusions that we were \nsomehow safe from the violence the rest of the world has known for a \nvery long time. It doesn't matter how wealthy, well defended, or far \nremoved we are from evil men. Terror can still find us. Every time I \ndrive past the Pentagon and gaze at the gaping wound in its side, I'm \nreminded that not even powerful generals and admirals in a seemingly \nimpenetrable fortress can keep death at a distance. What hope do the \nrest of us have?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the aftermath of that dark day, many of our social commentators \nrepeatedly said, \"Everything has changed.\" It remains to be seen just \nhow much we have changed beyond tolerating longer lines at the \nairports and pasting American flags onto our cars. Maybe the soul of \nthe nation is changing as well. Maybe. But clearly one of the \nundeniable marks of being an American today is that we all miss the \nnavet we enjoyed on September 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nPushing Against the Stone\u0014\nThe women who made their way to the tomb on the first Easter morning \nhad been with Jesus since Galilee. Ah, Galilee. How far that \ndelightful place must have seemed from this place of death. In \nGalilee, Jesus had been so full of life and was constantly restoring \nthe lives of others. Before Mary Magdalene met him, her soul had been \ntorn apart by seven demons. All of the women knew they were something \nless before meeting Jesus. This man was their Savior. But now he was \ndead.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe as the women walked down the road toward the tomb, someone \nmentioned that the world has always been hard on saviors. Or like \nmost people in deep grief, maybe they said nothing at all as they \nquietly closed the distance between themselves and the tomb of death. \nTheir only dilemma, according to Mark, was how they would get that \nhuge stone rolled back.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also know about pushing against a huge stone. We have all been \npushing against something for a long time. Maybe this Easter finds \nyou pushing against a supervisor who is hard to satisfy or against \nthe threat of being downsized from your job. Or maybe you are pushing \nagainst a marriage that seems destined for the ditch. Or you're \npushing against a disease, depression, loneliness, or some obstacle \nthat is between you and your dreams. Lately, we've all been pushing \nagainst the anxiety that terrorists will strike again. We think that \nif we can just get this burdensome thing rolled back, we'll be fine. \nBut as the story goes, even if we get rid of the huge stone, all that \nis waiting on the other side is death.\u0014\nThis is one of the worst ironies of life. When we work so hard to \nsave our lives, we are actually doing little more than anointing the \ndead. Even if we spend years achieving our dreams, all we have really \ndone is close the distance between death and us. As Jesus kept trying \nto explain, those who try to save their lives will lose them. \nEventually you will lose your job, your relationships, your health, \nand everything you are pushing to save.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story always ends in loss. Every wonderful thing in life comes to \nan end. We know that. People never come to my office for pastoral \ncounseling because they have doubts about death and loss. No one has \ntrouble believing in death. That's why we push so hard. We want to \nget as much as we can out of our jobs, relationships, and health \nbefore we lose them.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Easter is not some ancient story. We can all take our place beside \nthose three women wondering what it will take to push against the \nstone. How much hard work, money, love, and sacrifice do our hopes \nand dreams require of us?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the women arrived at the tomb, they were startled to discover \nthat the stone was already rolled back. So they walked inside, where \nthey saw an angel in white. And they became \"alarmed\" (Mark 16:4). \nThe angel said, \"Don't be alarmed.\" Angels always say that in the \nBible. But how can it not be alarming to see a messenger from God? \nThe women soon discovered, however, that the messenger wasn't nearly \nas alarming as the message.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was \ncrucified. He is risen! He is not here. Look, there is the place \nwhere they laid him. But go and tell his disciples and Peter that he \nis going on ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as \nhe told you.\" Then, we are told, \"the women fled from the tomb, for \nterror and amazement had seized them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond Bunnies and Chicks\u0014\nThis is the element of Easter that is so often missing from our \ncelebrations. We think of Easter as a time for bunnies and little \nchicks, colorful eggs, and little girls in cute new dresses. But we \nought to be thinking about grown women, with their dresses hiked up \nto their knees, running with terror out of a cemetery. Easter was not \na happily-ever-after ending pasted onto the otherwise frightening \nending of Jesus on the cross. The way Mark tells the story, it's \nEaster that is the frightening part of the story.\u0014\nAlong with Joseph of Arimathea, you and I had put Jesus into a \ntombwrapped, signed, sealed, and delivered. But when we get a good \nlook into the tomb three days later, everything is unwrapped. Nothing \nis as we left it. Nothing is as it should be. Now, we cannot even \ncount on death. Easter has changed the rules.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo wonder the women fled the tomb in fear. We may not care much for \ndeath, but we understand it. We know that it's impossible to ignore. \nIt is what sets the agenda for the rest of life. That is why we push \nso hard at lifeagainst aging, against diseases, against terrorists. \nWe want to stay away from death as long as possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if death is not waiting at the end, then everything in life has \nto change. We have to start over. We have to discover a whole new \npurpose for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Easter, the point of life isn't to collect as many \nthings as possible before it is too late, or to hold your loved ones \nas tightly as possible before you have to give them back, or to waste \nyour precious few years of life trying to postpone death. (Never \nconfuse life with postponing death.) According to Easter, the point \nof life is to discover a death-defying hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou Can't Scare Dead People\u0014\nEaster is not about renewal, new beginnings, the perseverance of the \nhuman spirit, or the first crocuses of spring. Long ago, I lost count \nof how many times I have stood in front of a congregation at a \nfuneral. When I look out at the tear-stained faces of the \nbrokenhearted family and friends of the deceased, do you think any of \nthat sentimental drivel about springtime is going to help at all? No \nway. But how about if instead I quote an angel in asking, \"Why do you \nseek the living among the dead?\"\u0014\nTwo things happen to people at funerals when the preacher speaks of \nthe Resurrection. First, they are reminded of the hope for a future \nbeyond their comprehension. The hope of heaven becomes more urgent to \nus after the passing of our loved ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, if they are really paying attention, they start to wonder \nabout the life they are living right now. You cannot stare at a \ncasket in a church without confronting some ultimate questions. You \nask yourself, for example, if it really makes sense to push so hard \nat work. You ponder what will be said when someone is delivering your \nown eulogy, and then you wonder if it is still possible to change \nyour life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why it is such a profound opportunity to join the two Marys \nand Salome in staring right at the empty tomb of Christbecause then \nwe can stare at our own tombs of loss and death without fear. Not \nonly do the followers of Christ not dread death; we actually try to \nget it over with as soon as possible, which is how the church has \nalways understood baptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the church first began, it struggled through periods of \npersecution for 300 years. Every Sunday when the believers gathered, \nthey took time to embrace and love each other because they did not \nknow who might be martyred for the faith before their next gathering.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy were so many so willing to lay down their lives for the \nconfession that Jesus is Lord? Because when they were baptized, they \nwere buried with Christ. They had already died to all of the old \ndreams for life. And you just can't scare dead people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey died with Christ, however, only to be raised to a new life with \nhim and in hima new life that began the moment they passed through \nthe water. Only in his death and resurrection is it possible for us \nalso to die to the old agendas and rise to a changed life that is no \nlonger crippled by fear.\u0014\nA while back I was finishing up a premarital counseling session for a \nwonderful young couple. We were only a few weeks away from the \nwedding, and had already made all of the finishing touches on the \nservice. As we came to the end of this last meeting, the groom-to-be \nblurted out, \"I just have to say that I am so scared of this!\" He \nsuddenly had the undivided attention of his fiance. He quickly \nadded, \"Oh no, honey, it isn't that I'm afraid of being married to \nyou. I'm afraid of losing you. When my mother died, the grief was \njust overwhelming, and I love you even more. I just don't know how I \ncan ever survive if something happens to you.\" Then he looked at me.\u0014\n\u0014\nI could tell from his pleading eyes that he wanted me to reassure him \nthat they were both young and healthy, and that he needn't worry \nabout such things. But I couldn't say that, because I have buried too \nmany young people. So I said, \"In my experience, 100 percent of all \nmarriages come to an endsome tragically through divorce or early \ndeath; others last for over 60 years. If your marriage is long and \nfilled with intimacy, then when death comes, you're going to be even \nmore in love than you are now. Then it will hurt even more to say \ngoodbye when the time finally comes. And that's the best scenario \nyou've got! So why do you want to go through marriage wondering if \nthis is the day you'll lose your beloved? Give her up today. Get the \ngrieving over with. Die to your right to have her, die to your fear \nof losing her, and die to the myth that you can keep her. Until you \ndo, you'll be too afraid to enjoy her.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't what he wanted to hear, but on this side of Easter, it's \nthe only thing a pastor can say. Because the terrifying truth of the \nCross is that it's only in dying that we can finally live.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistory's Greatest Catastrophe\u0014\nThe French philosopher Paul Ricoeur has written about the creative \npossibility of \"limit experiences.\" A limit experience is an \nexperience that is beyond the limits of normal life. It's the one you \nspend most of your life avoiding and dreading, like death and \nseparation. Beyond the limits of those things, we think there's \nnothing but emptiness, loss, and anomie. But as Ricoeur reminds us, \nthere is more. There is also God, whose creative love knows no limits.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatching enormous skyscrapers crumble into dust is beyond the limits \nof comprehension. It doesn't matter how many times we watched the \nvideo; it's still beyond comprehension. As is imagining how men can \nbe so evil as to crash full airplanes into buildingsand \nunderstanding how thousands could so easily die on our own \nwell-protected soil. And knowing that your mail could kill you if it \nhappened to brush against anthrax spores before reaching your \nmailbox. It's all beyond our limits.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dare not claim that God uses the crazed acts of terrorists as a \njudgment for our sins. No one can know that. But anyone can know that \nit is always the will of God that evil be redeemed and not given the \nlast word. That is why God can always be found at work beyond the \nlimits of evil's destructive powers, waiting to bring us back to new \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe greatest catastrophe of history happened not on September 11, but \n2,000 years ago when we crucified the Son of God. That was the \nultimate experience beyond humanity's limit. But it was then that \nhistory was given the possibility of resurrection. When Jesus Christ \ndefeated death, he did so that we may experience something beyond our \nlimitsto rise with him into a new life. After every cross, \nresurrection remains a possibility. The stone that covers the tomb is \nrolled back, but it will be up to us to walk out of it as new \ncreaturesor, in the case of September 11, a new nation. It all \ndepends on the choices we make.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf our choices arise out of a new vision of service and justice, if \nwe now commit ourselves to something greater than collecting more and \nmore personal wealth, and if we unite around our leaders and stop \nwhining about how small a piece of the American pie they are giving \nus, then we'll emerge from this tragedy as a nation ready to fulfill \nits calling on the Earth. But if our future choices arise out of \nfear, we might as well stay in the tomb. It all depends on the \nchoices we make on the other side of death and loss.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven the most conservative Bible scholars agree that in the original \ntext, Mark's Gospel probably ended in the eighth verse of chapter 16, \nwith a conversation between the angel and the women. But that seems \nso unfinished. He tells us nothing about the road to Emmaus, the \nstruggle of Thomas to believe, or the tender conversation by the fire \nwith Peter. And if verse eight is the end of the Gospel, then Mark \nhasn't given us any appearance of the risen Christ. That is probably \nwhy the church found it irresistible to add a couple of different \nendings that both include material found in the other Gospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if Mark meant for his Gospel to end right herewith an empty tomb \nand an angel giving the women the terrifying news that Jesus is \nwaiting for them back in Galileethen he would have purposefully left \nthe Easter story unfinished.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo how does the story get finished? It gets finished back in Galilee, \nwhere the women and the disciples lived. Back in the ordinary places, \nwhere you and I spend most of our time. Back where we work and live \nand make our home. The Easter story gets finished when ordinary \npeople do the most extraordinary things with their lives, because \nthey gave up pushing against stones and diseases, terrorists and fear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Easter story gets finished when the hungry are fed and the \nhomeless are given shelter, when the sinner is forgiven and broken \nrelationships are mended. The Easter story gets finished when the \nlonely are made part of a church family, when the sick and the \nprisoner are visited, and those in grief are comforted. It gets \nfinished when parents find time to raise their children, when \nbusiness people do what is right regardless of the cost, when leaders \nhave the courage to lead people through their fears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Easter story gets finished every time someone comes to the \nrealization that it is in giving life away that we find it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis lifeeternal lifecan be found today. But it cannot be bought or \nearned. You can only receive it. And you will never be able to \nreceive life if you are busy pushing your way into a tomb.\u0014\nAll across the world on Easter, in churches speaking every language \nunder the sun, the frightening call will be issued to think again \nabout the eternal purpose of our lives, to walk away from our private \ntombs, and to walk instead toward the hope of the risen Savior, Jesus \nChrist.\u0014\nHe is waiting for us, as the angel reported, in the ordinary places.\u0014\n\u0014\nM.

    "words": "It was written by an 8-year-old, Danny Dutton of Chula Vista, CA, for \nhis \u0014\nthird-grade homework assignment. The assignment was to explain God. \u0014\nWonder if any of us could do as well? \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEXPLAIN GOD \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of God's main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the \u0014\nones that die, so there will be enough \u0014\npeople to take care of things on earth. He doesn't make grown-ups, \njust \u0014\nbabies. I think because they are smaller and easier to make. That way \nHe \u0014\ndoesn't have to take up His valuable time teaching them to talk and \nwalk. \u0014\nHe just leaves that to mothers and fathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod's second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot \nof \u0014\nthis goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at \ntimes beside bedtime. God doesn't have time to listen to the radio or \nTV because of this. \u0014\n\u0014\nGod sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which \nkeeps Him \u0014\npretty busy. So you shouldn't go wasting His time by going over your \u0014\nMom and dad's head asking for something they said you couldn't have. \u0014\n\u0014\nAtheists are people who don't believe in God. I don't think there are \nany \u0014\nin Chula Vista. At least there aren't any who come to our church. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus is God's Son. He used to do all the hard work like walking on \nwater \u0014\nand performing miracles and people finally got tired of him preaching \nto \u0014\nthem and they crucified Him. But He was good and kind, like His \nFather \u0014\nand He told His Father that they didn't know what they were doing and \nto \u0014\nforgive them and God said \"O.K.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHis Dad (God) appreciated everything that He had done and all His \nhard \u0014\nwork on earth so He told Him He didn't have to go out on the road \u0014\nanymore. He could stay in heaven. So He did. And now He helps His Dad \u0014\nout by listening to prayers and seeing things which are important for \nGod \u0014\nto take care of and which ones He can take care of Himself without \nhaving \u0014\nto bother God. Like a secretary, only more important. You can pray \u0014\nanytime you want and they are sure to help you because they got it \nworked \u0014\nout so one of them is on duty all the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou should always go to church on Sunday because it makes God happy, \nand \u0014\nif there's anybody you want to make happy, it's God. Don't skip \nchurch to do \u0014\nsomething you think will be more fun like going to the beach. This is \nwrong. \u0014\nAnd besides the sun doesn't come out at the beach until noon, anyway. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you don't believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be \nvery \u0014\nlonely, because your parents can't go everywhere with you, like to \ncamp, \u0014\nbut God can. It is good to know He's around you when you're scared in \nthe \u0014\ndark or when you can't swim and you get thrown into real deep water \nby big \u0014\nkids. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut . . . you shouldn't just always think of what God can do for you. \nI \u0014\nfigure God put me here and He can take me back \u0014\nanytime He pleases. And . . . that's why I believe in God.\u0014",

    "words": "Eugenics gains second chance? \u0014\nNew age of genetics spurs debate \u0014\n\u0014\nBY PETER HARDIN\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT\u0014\n\u0014\nCOLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. As scientists unravel the human genetic \ncode, the life of Carrie Buck is coming under a microscope.\u0014\n\u0014\nVirginia forcibly sterilized the unwed young mother from \nCharlottesville after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way on May \n2, 1927.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared for the court, \"Three \ngenerations of imbeciles are enough.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventy-five years later, Buck's case lies at the historic heart of \nquestioning whether some attitudes about heredity from her era \nsurvive today.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuck was perhaps the pivotal figure of the American eugenics \nmovement, an influential campaign in Virginia and many other states \nfor selective human breeding and social engineering in the early \n1900s.\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nCarrie Buck Detamore\u0014\nColony for the Epileptics and Feebleminded in Lynchburg. 1980 Quote: \n\"All they told me was that I had to get an operation on me. I never \nknew what it was for. Later on, a couple of the other girls told me \nwhat it was. They said they had it done on them.\" \u0014\nLearn more \u0014\nAbout the human genome project: www.nhgri.nih.gov \u0014\nEugenics image archive: www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/ \u0014\nVirginia House Joint Resolution No. 299, honoring the memory of \nCarrie Buck; and Virginia Senate Joint Resolution No. 79, commending \nRaymond W. Hudlow: http://leg1.state.va.us/021/bil.htm\u0014\nAt a New York symposium, scientists, educators and policy-makers \nglimpsed for the first time a newly unearthed photograph of the \nsad-faced, 18-year- old Buck and her mother. It was taken shortly \nbefore the eve of the trial testing Virginia's new sterilization \nstatute.\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nVirginia outright fabricated the legal case portraying Buck as \nmorally \"degenerate\" and \"feebleminded\" to get its new sterilization \nlaw affirmed, and the Supreme Court went along, a schol- ar told the \ngroup.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaking off from that infamous case, experts pondered whether \nparallels exist between the eugenics movement, which sought to weed \nout supposedly defective hereditary traits, and today's unfolding new \nage of genetics.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat lessons from the movement could be applied to the contemporary \nera of deciphering the human genetic code, called the human genome?\u0014\n\u0014\nAre practices of modern medical genetics, intended to combat certain \nintractable diseases with a strong hereditary factor, influenced by \neugenic thinking?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough coerced sterilization has been largely consigned to the past \nsince Nazi Germany embraced it, is there a eugenic principle in \nparents' decisions to end certain pregnancies after genetic testing \nresults are delivered?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern ethicists have been posing such questions for some time. At \nthe symposium, there were no simple answers, but one clear theme: The \neugenics movement offers a cautionary tale for modern times.\u0014\n\u0014\nVirginia was in the forefront of American eugenics. It has recently \nbegun owning up to mistakes. Last year the legislature voiced \n\"profound regret\" for Virginia's role in American eugenics, a \nmovement that has largely been discredited.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday, the 75th anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court \ndecision titled Buck v. Bell, a highway marker honoring Carrie Buck - \nand in effect attesting to her victimization - will be dedicated in \nCharlottesville.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was the first person involuntarily rendered unable to bear \nchildren under Virginia's eugenic sterilization law of 1924. The \nSupreme Court upheld the statute 8-1 in a decision that still stands.\u0014\n\u0014\nVirginia aimed to prevent the birth of \"genetically inferior\" \nchildren, but later evidence showed Buck had no \"hereditary defects,\" \nthe marker states.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe General Assembly passed a resolution honoring Buck's memory. It \nnoted the sweeping impact of Buck v. Bell, which paved the way for \nsimilar laws in some 30 states. About 60,000 people were sterilized \nnationwide, including about 8,000 in Virginia. Nazi Germany \nsterilized between 360,000 and 3.5 million victims from 1933 to 1945.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Lynchburg, Raymond W. Hudlow, a World War II veteran decorated \nwith the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and the Prisoner of War Medal, \nis to receive a General Assembly commendation Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Hudlow was a teen-ager housed at a state asylum almost 60 years \nago, he was deemed \"feeble-minded\" and was sterilized to prevent the \nbirth of more like him.\u0014\n. . . \u0014\nAs scientists have deciphered the human genome, interest has been \ngrowing nationally in the eugenics movement, whose name was derived \nfrom a Greek word meaning \"good in birth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo look more closely at the movement, scientists and other experts \ngathered last week at the two-day symposium, \"American Eugenics and \nthe New Biology: Perspectives and Parallels.\" It was convened at Cold \nSpring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost a century ago the Eugenics Record Office, the forerunner of \nwhat is now Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, became the epicenter of \nthe American eugenics movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts superintendent, Harry H. Laughlin, drafted a model sterilization \nlaw that was adopted in part by Virginia and other states. He gave \ntestimony for the Buck trial, branding her family as members of \"the \nshiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the \nSouth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother Eugenics Record Office official visited Buck's neighborhood, \nlocated witnesses favorable to Virginia and testified in favor of \nsterilization.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn modern times, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has been home for four \nNobel laureates whose research was critical to development of DNA \nscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey include its current president, James D. Watson, who with Francis \nCrick discovered the double helical structure of DNA. Inside the \nnucleus of a cell, DNA carries genetic instructions for making living \norganisms.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe laboratory has taken a leading role in revisiting eugenics, with \ngrant funding by the National Human Genome Research Institute.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the eugenics movement left a legacy of shame, experts have \nanalyzed how the underlying science became distorted.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"American eugenicists sought an almost exclusively genetic \nexplanation of human development, and neglected the important \ncontributions of the environment,\" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's \nDavid Micklos and geneticist Elof A. Carlson of the State University \nof New York wrote in a scientific journal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe study of the past \"tells us that many of the first crop of human \ngeneticists loaded their data and models with their own aspirations \nfor society,\" they wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing an archive on its Web site and events such as the workshop, a \nunit of the laboratory is seeking to teach both students and \nprofessionals in a new era of biology.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the symposium was an indicator, a 21st century understanding of \nthe eugenics movement carries a more nuanced view than the rather \nblack-and-white case of Carrie Buck.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's one of the very few instances in the history of eugenics where \nyou have a very clear villain and a very clear victim,\" said legal \nhistorian Paul A. Lombardo of the University of Virginia, an expert \non Buck's case.\u0014\n\u0014\nEugenics \"was a word that admitted to different meanings at different \ntimes, to different people,\" Lombardo said, and its \"big tent\" aspect \ncontributed to its success.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong efforts tied to eugenics was one to restrict immigration of \npeople believed to have inferior hereditary material. In 1924, \nCongress passed the Immigration Restriction Act, which led to sharply \nreduced immigration quotas for southern and eastern Europeans.\u0014\n\u0014\nEugenicists, thinking human stock could be improved by selective \nbreeding, encouraged reproduction by the \"best\" people.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey sought to reduce births of \"defective\" people by compulsory \nsterilization or institutionalization. Through sterilization, they \nhoped to remove an economic and social burden from society.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute \ndegenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their \nimbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from \ncontinuing their kind,\" Justice Holmes wrote in Buck v. Bell.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor some adherents there was a strong element of racial supremacy, as \nthey sought to purify the white race and prohibit marriage between \nwhites and nonwhites in states like Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween history and present, professor Garland E. Allen of Washington \nUniversity in St. Louis saw direct parallels. Eugenicists studied \nsupposedly inherited tendencies for everything from \"pauperism\" to \nability to be a naval officer, he said at the symposium.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, with claims made for genetic roots of problems from crime to \nmanic depression, the same message comes across: \"The problem lies in \nthe individual's defective biology,\" Allen contended. He is a \nspecialist in the history of 20th century biology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe cautioned against overemphasis on science and technology as a \n\"magic bullet\" in dealing with what may be social problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nU.Va.'s Lombardo advocated humility. He urged people to get over a \nsense of moral superiority to Justice Holmes and wrestle with this \nquestion that he adapted from Holmes' \"three generations of \nimbeciles\" remark:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What characteristic of human beings is it that you say should \ndisappear?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is \"the hard job with modern genetics,\" Lombardo said.\u0014\n. . . \u0014\nWhat difference did the eugenics session make for professionals?\u0014\n\u0014\nT. Phil Talbot teaches students at Skyline High School in Salt Lake \nCity to do their own DNA analysis. He knew of the eugenics movement \nbefore attending the symposium. He left New York with fresh ideas for \nteaching, including assigning a case study on Carrie Buck.\u0014\n\u0014\nTalbot thinks it's valuable to be aware of what American eugenicists \ndid. But he also points to major changes in society since then.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think there's more social consciousness now than back then,\" \nTalbot said. \"Human rights are more of an issue now. I don't really \nsee the parallels between then and now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJudith L. Benkendorf, a Washington health policy and genetics \nconsultant, took away a different lesson.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe found in the eugenics movement a piece of \"my 'professional \nfamily' history that I didn't know anything about,\" Benkendorf would \ntell a class of Georgetown University medical and nursing students \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\nBenkendorf wondered aloud whether a shadow of eugenics lingers in her \nfield today. Genetics counselors help clients make genetic testing \ndecisions and understand the results of those tests, such as prenatal \ndiagnosis.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe doesn't believe she engaged in forced or overt eugenics as a \ngenetics counselor. But the symposium led Benkendorf to question \n\"what covert messages might be between the lines\" in the current \npractice of medical genetics and counseling.\u0014\n\u0014\n. . . \u0014\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory plans to add two rare photographs to \nits online archives, showing the three generations of Bucks.\u0014\n\u0014\nCarrie Buck was 17 when she was raped, apparently by a nephew of her \nfoster parents, and became pregnant. The baby, Vivian, was given to a \nfoster family.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuck's fallopian tubes were removed on the morning of Oct. 19, 1927, \nin the infirmary of the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and \nFeebleminded in Lynchburg, where she was an inmate.\u0014\n\u0014\nBuck's mother, Emma, had several illegitimate children and brushes \nwith the law. She, too, was placed in the Virginia Colony.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the first picture, Emma Buck and 18-year-old Carrie are frowning, \ntheir heads slightly tilted, their resemblance strong. The mother's \nhand rests on her daughter's shoulder. The picture apparently was \ntaken six or seven months after Vivian was born to Carrie.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second picture, Vivian's foster mother, Alice Dobbs, held her \nand also a coin; historian Lombardo thinks Mrs. Dobbs was checking \nthe baby's mental alertness in a crude test for a visitor from the \nEugenics Record Office.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs an infant, Vivian was labeled retarded after a cursory \ninvestigation. But she made the honor roll in 1931 at Venable School \nin Charlottesville. She died at age 8 of a childhood sickness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe image of Carrie and Emma represents \"the most evocative and \nemblematic photo of the American eugenics movement,\" said Micklos of \nthe Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\u0014\n\u0014\nTogether, the photos \"represent three generations of lives ruined by \neugenics,\" he said. \"Although eugenicists saw the Buck family as a \npedigree of degeneracy,\" Micklos judged \"their only sin was being \nborn poor women in the impoverished South.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Peter Hardin at (202) 662-7669 or phardin@mediageneral.com \u0014\nThis story can be found at : \nhttp://TIMESdIspatch.com/frontpage/MGBTkrhsi0d.html\u0014",

    "words": "Exploding myths that sap investors\u0014\nCommentary: 10 notions that enrich Wall Street \u0014\n \u0014\nBy Thom Calandra, CBS.MarketWatch.com      June 24, 2002 \u0014\n \u0014\nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Success, Gen. George Patton once said, is \nhow high you bounce when you hit bottom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe U.S. stock market has a long way to go to hit bottom, and it's \nheaded there in large part because of the perverted financial rules \nWall Street feeds as investing gospel to Main Street. These are the \n10 myths that enrich Wall Street ... and bankrupt America\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 1: After a relentless slide this year, the current stock \nmarket is undervalued, or fairly valued. The fact is, stocks have no \nfair value, by any measure. You can measure stocks by earnings, \ndividend yields, return on invested capital, against the coupon of a \nTreasury bond or against its industry peers. It's all a moving \ntarget, as relative as it gets. Stocks don't have a fair value. \nThey're driven by many forces: psychological and economic. Fear of \nlost opportunity, envy over the neighbors' new SUV, productivity, \ninflation, deflation, product innovation, pricing power and global \nmoney flows are some of the thousands of pieces of this puzzle. \u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 2: Professional stock market strategists have reliable \ninsights. Not quite. Strategists at the major investment banks are \npaid to have insights, and they're called price forecasts. These \nreports are anything but reliable. In April, Abby Joseph Cohen at \nGoldman Sachs (GS: news, chart, profile) said her targets for this \nyear were 11,300 for the Dow and 1,300 for the S&P 500. The Dow is \nclose to 9,000, and the S&P 500 is below 1,000. Cohen very well may \nsee the stock market reach her targets by year's end, but not before \n90 percent of ordinary stock market investors pull their hair out, \noverdose on Tylenol or file for personal bankruptcy. \u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 3: A weak dollar has little or no effect on American stocks. \nTell that to the stock market. The euro has gained about 12 percent \nagainst the dollar since mid-January. In the same span the S&P 500 \nbasket of America's largest stocks is down 15 percent. Overseas \ninvestors have no reason to be buying American stocks when the \ncurrency those stocks represent is declining. Who wants to own a \nstock in a declining currency? Overseas investors rang up a mere net \n$17.6 billion of U.S. stock-market purchases in the first quarter vs. \n$41.7 billion in first-quarter 2001.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 4: Mutual fund investors have a vested interest in buying \neven more of their losing mutual funds, doubling down to lower their \ncost average. Mistake. Most Americans are suffering portfolio pain \nthat amounts to 50 percent and greater losses for their personal and \nretirement accounts. Do the math: a mutual fund (or a stock) that's \ndown 50 percent needs to rise 100 percent to reach the break-even \npoint. Mutual funds offer the added insult of the thick fees that \nmanagers and administrators skim off the top. Oh, and while they're \nlosing money, mutual fund shareholders still pay capital gains for \nthe quarterly churn those glass-tower portfolio managers have \nmastered. \u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 5: Not to worry, the stock market will recover in the next \n10 to 20 years, which happens to be when most Americans see \nthemselves dancing away their retirements on the decks of cruise \nships. Here's the sad news: If you bought stocks in the very good \ntimes of 1966, you probably didn't turn a profit until 1991. Sure, \nsome of us will be waltzing away our golden years on a Carnival \nCruise (CCL: news, chart, profile), but it won't be stocks that pay \nfor the berth.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 6: This is a market for stock pickers. After all, people \nhave to invest in something, and sector rotation can benefit your \nportfolio. This is classic Wall Street churn-burn; they churn you get \nburned. Fact is, since the Jan. 14 Dow peak this year, 60 percent of \nall American stocks are in the red, according to Standard & Poor's \nCompustat database. This year alone, the entire stock market, as \nmeasured by the Wilshire 5000 Index, has lost more than $1.5 trillion \nof wealth for investors.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 7: I'll just short-sell the market, or buy put options as \ninsurance against the downdraft. That's what hedge funds do for a \nliving, not individuals. There's nothing wrong with short-selling \nstocks, but you have to be prepared for the long haul to really make \nmoney. Short sales are expensive; they require margin interest of 8 \npercent or more. Plus, the short seller pays the dividends on the \nstock. Hedge funds hold their short-sale positions for years, not \nmonths, and spend 10 hours a day on the telephone, monitoring those \npositions. As for options contracts, one in five investors probably \nmake money on equity options.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 8.: Gold mining stocks are expensive. Actually, this one is \ntrue. Gold mining shares such as Newmont Mining (NEM: news, chart, \nprofile), the world's largest, are selling for 13 times cash flow. \nBut as we said, it's all a moving target. Gold stocks will get even \nmore expensive, fabulously more expensive, as the stock-market and \nU.S. dollar declines become part-and parcel of everyday life. Every \n$10 rise in the gold price is like rocket fuel to gold miners' profit \nmargins. With the price of spot gold flirting with the $330 level, \nmining equities are poised to retain their status as this year's \nbiggest stock market gainers.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth No. 9: Holding cash amounts to lost opportunity. All I can say \nto that is, forget the glory days and stop trying to forecast the \nfuture. Cash is way under-rated these days. It still pays the bills. \nRecipe for success: put all of your retirement cash in a basic \nmoney-market account, let it sit for 20 years, sleep like a baby. \nWhen you wake up, take that Caribbean cruise, first-class berth, \nplease.\u0014\nMyth No. 10: Now is the time to be looking for bargains. Have you \never seen bargain hunters at a swap meet? They're fast, they're \ntight-fisted, they know exactly what they're looking for ... and they \nrarely find it. What sets them apart from the rest of the crowd is \nthis: bargain hunters know they have a 1-in-100 shot at finding \nsomething they truly consider a score. The rest of us think it's our \nbirthright to buy things cheap. It's reality time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow America Lost Its Shirt\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELICAL THEOLOGY DRIVES ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL AND MIDDLE EAST",
    "words": "Evangelical Theology Drives American Attitudes toward Israel and \nMiddle East\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Wingfield\u0014\n04-16-02 \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Ed McAteer watches current events unfold in the Middle East, he \nsees the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese things must come to pass, he believes, in order for Jesus to \nreturn and bring world history to its end. That's why he was saddened \nbut not surprised when the United Nations recently voted against \nIsrael, in his opinion, on a resolution on the Middle East conflict. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When the nations gather against Israel, I believe at that time the \nScriptures will be fulfilled,\" said the retired sales executive who \nnow devotes himself full time to conservative Christian causes. \u0014\n\u0014\nMcAteer may be Israel's No. 1 supporter among evangelical Christians. \nHe hosts an annual prayer breakfast for Israel attended by both \nJewish and evangelical Christian leaders. He recently chaired an \ninternational committee that created sufficient public pressure to \nstop the construction of a mosque near Christian holy sites in \nNazareth. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his Memphis, Tenn., home, McAteer frequently speaks by phone \nwith key Israeli leaders who seek his counsel or support. \u0014\n\u0014\nEd McAteer loves Israel. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut he loves Israel because he believes the Bible tells him to. He \noften cites God's promise to Abraham, \"I will bless them who bless \nyou and curse them who curse you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the perspective of this Baptist layman, the mandate to support \nIsrael without equivocation runs all the way from Genesis to \nRevelation. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough more articulate and passionate about the subject than most \nother American evangelicals, McAteer represents a stream of \ntheological and political thought that has driven United States \npolicy toward Israel for more than 50 years. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No one in the U.S. outdoes fundamentalists in their support of \nIsrael, not even American Jews,\" said Tim Weber, a Christian \nhistorian and dean at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in \nIllinois. \u0014\n\"Since Menachem Begin, all Israeli leaders have seen American \nfundamentalists as important shapers of American foreign policy \ntoward Israel. What many people do not understand is that most \nfundamentalists support Israel because they believe it will play a \nkey role in events leading up to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile this theological view of the end-times--known as premillennial \ndispensationalism--is not the majority view among Christians \nworldwide or even nationwide, it strongly shapes Americans' views of \nIsrael, Weber said. \"The influence of such ideas extends way beyond \nthe tight community that nurtures and studies them. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The dispensationalist scenario is imbedded in the fundamentalist \nsubculture, has much greater influence in the more expansive world of \nAmerican evangelicalism and even reaches into the larger secular \npopulation. These ideas matter, and not just for those who believe \nand understand them.\" \u0014\nNeed proof? Look at book publishers' bestseller lists, where the \n\"Left Behind\" series has held sway for months. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo date, the nine-book series has sold more than 50 million copies. \nIn 2001, the latest installment, \"Desecration,\" beat out John Grisham \nfor top annual sales of hardback fiction, with 2.9 million copies \nsold. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe eighth book in the Left Behind series, \"The Mark,\" was the No. 2 \nbestseller in 2000, and the seventh book, \"Assassins,\" was No. 3 in \n1999. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese books are fictionalized accounts built out of a \ndispensationalist view of the end times. And more significantly than \nmost people realize, this worldview impacts American thought on \nIsrael, Weber contends. \u0014\n\u0014\nDispensationalism, articulated as a distinct theology by John Nelson \nDarby about 1830, teaches that shortly before the return of Christ, \nthe nations will gather for war in the Middle East against a restored \nJewish state. \u0014\n\u0014\nWeber explains: \"Dispensationalists patch together prophecies in \nDaniel, Ezekiel and Revelation and predict that a northern \nconfederacy made up of Russia and her allies will join forces with \nkings of the South, usually identified as an Arab/Muslim coalition, \nto launch a sneak attack to annihilate Israel once and for all. \nThough Israel's doom seems certain, God intervenes and destroys the \ninvaders.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut that's still not the end. \"Relieved but still shaky, the Jews \nthen make a security pact with the charismatic, peace-promising \nleader of a 10-nation European confederation, a revived Roman Empire. \nAfter securing the peace of Jerusalem for three and a half years, \nthis leader suddenly reveals himself to be the Anti-Christ. Working \nclosely with a demonic false prophet, Anti-Christ enters the restored \nJewish temple in Israel, demands to be worshipped as God and then \nlaunches a genocidal war against all who refuse to acknowledge him. \nIn response, the kings of the East send a 200-million-man army to \nfight Anti-Christ's forces on the plains of Megiddo, northwest of \nJerusalem. This is the battle of Armageddon. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Before the armies can annihilate each other, Jesus Christ breaks out \nof the clouds with his warrior saints and destroys the assembled \narmies. The surviving Jews then acknowledge him as their Messiah, and \nKing Jesus restores David's throne in Jerusalem, near the purified \nJewish temple where priests perform the ancient blood sacrifices. \nJesus reigns in peace and justice for a thousand years.\" \u0014\nAll this, however, hinges on restoring and preserving a Jewish state \nin Palestine. \u0014\n\u0014\nMcAteer agrees that the existence of Israel as a nation is \"very \nimportant\" to his view of Christian theology. \"Jesus said when these \nthings come to pass, lift up your head, your redemption draweth \nnigh.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early days of dispensationalism, Christians were content to \nwait for the prophesied events to unfold on God's own timetable. But \nsince the late 19th century, some evangelicals have attempted to \nspeed up the clock by ensuring certain things come to \npass--specifically the restoration of a Jewish state. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the first advocates of this brand of Zionism was William \nBlackstone, an Illinois businessman who wrote the bestseller \"Jesus \nis Coming\" in 1878. \"Blackstone did not want to wait around for a new \nJewish state,\" Weber explained. \"He did what he could to make it \nhappen.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the modern state of Israel finally was created in 1948, \n\"dispensationalists hailed its founding as the most significant \nprophetic fulfillment of the age, the undeniable proof that they had \nread the Bible correctly,\" Weber said. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince 1948, dispensational theology has pushed for expansion of \nIsrael's borders on prophetic grounds. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dispensationalists understood the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not \nin terms of international law or the rights of self-determination, \nbut as a modern expression of the ancient biblical rivalry between \nIsaac and Ishmael for their father Abraham's birthright and \nblessing,\" Weber said. \"Thus dispensationalists did not see any way \nto reconcile the two warring parties. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The divine die was cast. Jews win; Palestinians lose.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIndicative of this view, McAteer believes there's \"no such thing as \nthe land of Palestine. That's something that's been manufactured. \nThat piece of geography was given by God to Israel.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere should the Palestinians go, then? Anywhere else in the Middle \nEast, McAteer said, so long as they leave the Jewish nation alone. \n\"The Arabs have 485 times as much land as do the Jews.\" \u0014\nThis is where McAteer and others who are consistent in applying their \ntheological beliefs to politics find discomfort with some of the \nRepublican leaders they have helped elect. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen President George W. Bush indicates that perhaps Israel should \ngive up some of its land and be more conciliatory toward the \nPalestinians, McAteer and company are not pleased. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not in lockstep with a number of my religious Christian \nbrethren, even those in the Southern Baptist Convention in their \nendorsing and wrapping their arms around everything George W. Bush \nsays about he Middle East,\" McAteer explained. \"One day, he says one \nthing; the next day, he says another.\" \u0014\nMcAteer especially bristles at Bush taking a hard-line stance against \nterrorists attacking the United States but not against Palestinians, \nwho he believes are terrorists attacking Israel. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Find me one time in all this that Israel has initiated a conflict \nwith the Palestinians,\" he said. \"I'm not saying everything Israel \nhas done has been right, but they have not initiated the conflicts.\" \u0014\nBut even so, the bottom line for him remains the Bible, not politics. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I believe without any reservation whatsoever that every grain of \nsand on that piece of property called Israel belongs to the Jewish \npeople. It's not because I happen to think that. It's not because \nhistory gives a picture of them being in and out of there. It's \nbecause God gave it to them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Mark Wingfield is managing editor of the Baptist Standard, from \nwhich this article is reprinted with permission.\u0014",

Now, in singling out the Jewish people \nfor evangelistic exemption, they are withholding the hope of Israel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statement, Sibley says, \"unequivocally says that the bishops have \nabandoned any semblance of biblical authority.Originally, the only \nform of evangelism was Jewish evangelism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo far, Weblog hasn't seen a response from Roman Catholic leaders, \nbut The Dallas Morning News quotes Abraham Foxman, director of the \nAnti-Defamation League, who calls Sibley's analysis \"offensive and \ncompletely absurd.Coming from a ministry with a track record of \ndenigrating other religions and engaging in aggressive campaigns \naimed at converting Jews, this statement is the height of hypocrisy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Al Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary, and Michael Brown, president of ICN Ministries, appeared on \nMSNBC's Donahue program last Tuesday to talk about the Catholic \nbishops' statement.

    "title": "EVANGELICALISM'S DECADES OF FIRE",
    "words": "Evangelicalism's Decades of Fire\u0014\nNew historical survey highlights twentieth-century evangelicalism's \nimpassioned middle decades.\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong | posted 09/06/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the chance to survey evangelicalism's growth and development \nthrough the twentieth century, Steve Rabey and Monte Unger did what \nany of us might have done. In preparing their new book, Milestones: \n50 Events of the 20th Century that Shaped Evangelicals in America \n(Broadman and Holman), Rabey and Unger spent over 50 percent of their \ntime looking at the '50s, '60s, and '70sover 40 percent in the \nlatter two decades alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems clear from this book that the middle decades were, indeed, \nwhere the action was really at in 20th-century evangelicalism. From \nBilly Graham and the rise of mass evangelism in the 1950s to the \nascension of evangelicals like Colson and Carter to political power \nin the 1970s, the movement again and again asserted itselfand \nreinvented itselfacross many cultural arenas.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't get me wrong. This is no exercise in antiquarianism. Out of \ntheir historical material the authors have built an up-to-the-minute \ncomposite portrait of the movement. Their avowed guiding question was \n\"What things, for better or worse, have had the greatest impact on \nmaking evangelicals who they are today?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn choosing to survey the century just ended, Rabey and Unger do fall \nheir to the peculiar difficulties of doing near-contemporary history: \nWhen we look back over a period mere decades past, it's often hard to \nsort out the trivial from the lasting.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when we hit the twentieth century's middle years, the time lag \nseems about right. In some of their best short chapters (none is \nlonger than the average magazine article) the authors, now at some \ndistance from the initial hype, are able to do helpful analysis and \nfruit-testing of such vintage but still-powerful trends as the church \ngrowth movement and seeker-sensitive ecclesiology.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother advantage of the book's focus on the middle decades is that \nthis is truly unknown territory for many readers who came to the \nmovement either relatively late in their lives (I fit that category, \nhaving converted in 1984 at age 21) or late in the movement (anyone \nwho's a teenager or young adult now). It's always instructive to see \nwhat put a fire in the bones of those whose legacy we enjoy (or \nsuffer).\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, some of this material may just make some of us \nfeel old. I certainly found myself asking at several points in the \nbook: Has such-and-such been around that long? It can't possibly have \nbeen that many years since Amy Grant ushered Christian contemporary \nmusic into the mainstream (1985, chap. 40), Willow Creek spurred the \nmegachurch movement (1975, chap. 34), the NIV challenged the KJV's \ntraditional dominance (1973, chap. 32), or James Dobson launched his \nfamily-values crusade (1970, chap. 28). Excuse me while I get my \nGeritol.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt other points, readers may find themselves asking another, similar \nquestion: Are we still fighting those same battles? Given how much of \nwhat we are nowgood, bad, and questionablewas launched in those \nshort decades at the middle of the century, the feeling of dj vu \nsuffuses the chapters on the clash of evangelical morality and sexual \nfreedom (1953 and 1973, chaps. 16 and 31), the wrangles over religion \nin the classroom (1962, chap. 21), and the growing popular taste for \nesoteric spirituality (1968, chap. 26). Are evangelicals stuck in a \ncycle, rehashing old concerns whose ground rules and strategies were \nlaid out long ago?\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the authors never let history sit. Each chapter moves from the \nevents of the past to the trends and concerns of the present. So in \nchapter 22 on Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, \nthe authors update King's concern that Sunday morning from 11 to 12 \nis America's most segregated hour, with the telling fact that \nalthough by 2001 nearly half the U.S.'s big cities housed more \nminorities than whites, evangelical churches remained among the \nnation's most segregated. And in the chapter on the experimentation \nwith non-Western religions in the sixties (chap. 26), we are reminded \nthat continued immigration to America from Asia and the Middle East \nhas today broken the old Protestant-Catholic-Jewish monopoly, as by \nthe late 1990s Muslims outnumbered Episcopalians in the U.S.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Rabey and Unger demur from offering a grand summary at the \nend, a core picture of evangelicalism does emerge. We see a movement \nmarked first, by its evangelistic activism, and second, by this \nactivism's twin (sometimes, the authors imply, its evil twin): a \nchameleon-like skill in adapting to cultural trends in order to \nspread the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth of these powerful forces drove major changes in the movement's \nidentity during the '60s and '70s, so it is no surprise to find their \nepitome in 1970. That year saw the release of D. James Kennedy's \nfamed manual, Evangelism Explosion. The authors editorialize that \nthough the book has helped thousands of evangelicals reach millions \nwith the gospel, \"the program exhibits problems that have bedeviled \nmany of the mass evangelism campaigns that became increasingly \npopular during the 1960s and 1970s: it converted Christianity into a \ncommodity and marketed it like any other consumer product, \nemphasizing its immediate benefits and downplaying its long-term \ncosts.\" Rabey and Unger link this commodification to Bill Bright's \n\"Four Spiritual Laws\" tract, which they call \"the most widely \ndistributed document in evangelical history.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOther, much more positive benefits have accrued from this evangelical \npenchant for culturally strategic \"gospel activism.\" One is the \nmovement's (improving) record of cooperation both within its \nboundaries (chap. 8 on the National Association of Evangelicals, \nchap. 18 on the founding of Christianity Today) and without (chap. 45 \non recent efforts to find common ground with Roman Catholics). \nAnother is the sheer creativity and multiplicity of the ways \nevangelicals have \"done church\" (chap. 1 on the founding of \nPentecostalism, chap. 20 on the charismatic movement, chap. 27 on the \nJesus People, chap. 48 on \"postmodern\" modes of ministry to \n\"Generation X\").\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, evangelical readers of this account needn't always like \nwhat we see. In fact, we should be suspicious if we do. But unless we \nknow our genealogythe peculiar mix of theological nature and \ncultural nurture that make us who we arewe are doomed to do the \nthings we do in darkness. This book ushers evangelicals towards the \nbright exit of that tunnel of history-blindness.\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "Even in dying, Browning Ware listened and learned\u0014\n\u0014\n      ___Editor's note: Buckner newswriter Russ Dilday visited \nBrowning Ware this fall in his residence\u0014\n      at Buckner Villas in Austin, just a few weeks before Ware died \nOct. 29. The story is presented as\u0014\n      written before Ware's death.\u0014\n\u0014\n      ___By Russ Dilday\u0014\n      ___Buckner News Service\u0014\n      ___AUSTIN--Browning Ware's room at Buckner Villas is markedly \ndifferent than other residents'\u0014\n      rooms. Many living at the Buckner retirement community in \nAustin make their room their home,\u0014\n      decorating with the familiar furniture and memorabilia of lives \nlong lived. \u0014\n      ___Several keep their collections, such as china dolls, stuffed \nanimals or photographs\u0014\n      prominently and proudly displayed. Ware's room seems a stark \ncontrast, with only three chairs, a\u0014\n      couple of photographs on a side table and a floral bouquet \nbedside. The white-walled room has\u0014\n      the feel of transitional housing and, indeed, it may be. At 73, \nWare is dying of cancer.\u0014\n      ___But, as residents, employees and visitors have learned \nduring the short time the pastor\u0014\n      emeritus of First Baptist Church in Austin has lived at the \nVillas, he does have his own collection,\u0014\n      a collection of people who have streamed through his door \nseeking an audience.\u0014\n      ___Villas marketing director Lisa Wyatt said Ware has received \n\"about a thousand\" visitors\u0014\n      through his door.\u0014\n      ___\"I wouldn't put a number on it, but we have had a lot,\" he \nadmitted, noting: \"They\u0014\n      come through looking for different things. I don't know and \nthey don't always know.\"\u0014\n      ___But they come, many seeking out Ware as the only religious \nvoice they've heard. In addition\u0014\n      to his 22-year pastorate at First Baptist Church, Ware also \nauthors a weekly column in the Austin\u0014\n      American-Statesman on faith, which continues to attract a large \nfollowing. Some look for\u0014\n      guidance. Some come to say goodbye. Others come because they \ndon't want to. \u0014\n      ___\"They are looking for some kind of an affirmation,\" he said, \n\"sort of a blessing that would help\u0014\n      them say it is OK for me to be where I am and for them to be \nwhere they are. Some of them can\u0014\n      use the words 'illness' and 'death' and talk about my illness. \nSome of them can't. And it touches\u0014\n      people on different levels. \u0014\n      ___\"There is a psychiatrist that comes to see me,\" he said. \n\"This whole thing of my being ill and\u0014\n      dying is really tearing him up, because he is going through his \nown mortality. \u0014\n      ___\"When I told him that I want to be present for my living and \nmy dying, he said, 'That terrifies\u0014\n      me.' I said, 'What is frightening?' And he said, 'To be there, \nin the unknownness.' \u0014\n      ___\"I said, 'Well, I'm known. I'm not ill at ease there. I am \nknown in the unknown.' So there's a level\u0014\n      of intimacy there and a willingness that people have, a hunger \nto talk about these things.\" \u0014\n      ___While he speaks, a tall, bearded man, Don, walks quietly \ninto the room and sits by Ware's\u0014\n      bed, saying, \"I just came by to see you.\"\u0014\n      ___The two talk of events happening in Don's life, and they \nfinish with a prayer. \u0014\n      ___\"Browning and I discuss the light and the difficult problems \nof life together,\" explained Don,\u0014\n      who makes custom furniture. \"Browning has had a few ups and \ndowns, and I have been up and\u0014\n      down like a toilet seat most of my life. He is my friend, and \nfriends are really at the end of what\u0014\n      happens to you. I am 68 years old, and they are really about \nall you've got.\" \u0014\n      ___What Ware says he gives to people like Don who come through \nthe doors of his room is\u0014\n      \"honest answers--honest in the sense that I can tell them \nwithout much adjustment or editing how I\u0014\n      feel about something. I am far enough down the pike that I \ndon't need to edit the material or\u0014\n      soften it for them.\"\u0014\n      ___That honesty runs deep, even for his own needs, he said. \u0014\n      ___\"I want to be present to what is happening to me, as fully \npresent as possible. And I am not\u0014\n      even sure I want all of the pain relief that hospice keeps \ntelling me I ought to have. I know there\u0014\n      are times when I want it, and I want it really bad. But I want \nto be present. I don't want to go out in\u0014\n      a fog. I want to be as available to what God can provide me \nduring this time.\" \u0014\n      ___The honesty also extends to the realities of his condition, \nwhich began as prostate cancer but\u0014\n      moved into his bones. \u0014\n      ___The thought of death has caused him to weep sometimes, he \nadmitted. \"I get kind of\u0014\n      sentimentalistic. I don't mind dying, but I do regret not \nliving a little longer.\"\u0014\n      ___On the other hand, facing death \"has really taken the chains \noff,\" he said. \"What have I got to\u0014\n      win or to lose?

I\u0014\n      don't have anybody come through here now that we don't pray \ntogether.\" \u0014\n      ___While terrible, the cancer has opened unimaginable doors.\u0014\n      ___In recent months, his articles have prompted responses from \nthe chancellor of the University\u0014\n      of Texas system as well as a 51-year-old lesbian mother.\u0014\n      ___Meanwhile, the hardest truth to learn may be that the \nminister needs ministry.\u0014\n      ___\"It's very traumatic at times,\" Ware said. \"At times it's \nunnerving. At camp a few years back,\u0014\n      there was this big old boy, twice as big as I am, and we were \nwashing each other's feet. When I\u0014\n      washed his, everything went along fine. I was in charge. But \nwhen he washed me, it just tore me\u0014\n      up. It just broke me up inside.\"\u0014\n      ___\"This pilgrim continues to learn,\" he wrote in a recent \ncolumn. \"Often, we want our lives to be\u0014\n      characterized as ministry--service to others. We are proud of \nwhat we do for others and busy\u0014\n      ourselves in their behalf. That's well and good, but beyond \nthis, there is a new and humbling\u0014\n      lesson--sometimes others must serve us because we are in need.\"\u0014\n      ___In the last months of life, as he battled cancer, Browning \nWare received a steady stream of\u0014\n      visitors, some of whom sought his ministry and others who came \nto turn the tables with ministry to\u0014\n      the minister. \u0014\n\u0014\n      The Baptist Standard\u0014",

    "words": "Cover Story 12/9/02\u0014\nThe activist\u0014\nEinstein's pacifism did not stop him from urging research on the \natomic bomb\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 16, 1939, a hot Sunday morning, a car drove up to Albert \nEinstein's summer cottage on Long Island with two other foreign-born \nphysicists, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. Their mission was to \nenlist Einstein in an effort to keep uranium out of Adolf Hitler's \nhands. It was Einstein's prestige they wanted; the great scientist \nknew nothing about nuclear chain reactions and their destructive \npotential. But he quickly saw the implications and agreed to help.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree days later, Szilard met with Alexander Sachs, an economist who \nhad easy access to the Roosevelt White House. Sachs said he would \ncarry a letter from Einstein. Drafted with Szilard and Sachs, the \nletter reported that \"it may become possible to set up nuclear chain \nreactions in a large mass of uranium.\" Noting the potential for \n\"extremely powerful bombs of a new type,\" it called for stepped-up \nresearch.\u0014\n\u0014\nSachs did not see Roosevelt until October 11, after Hitler had \noverrun Poland. Roosevelt never wrote about the meeting, but Sachs's \naccounts agree that Roosevelt answered, \"What you are after is to see \nthat the Nazis don't blow us up,\" and told his aide Pa Watson, \"This \nrequires action!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSluggish bureaucrats and puny funding meant action came slowly. But \nthe idea had been planted in Roosevelt's mind. Finally, on Oct. 9, \n1941, he ordered a crash program to produce an atomic bomb.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bomb enabled the United States to defeat Japan without a \nhigh-casualty assault on the home islands and to deter the Soviet \nUnion from attacking Western Europe. Yet Einstein, a pacifist, \nregretted the development of so terrible a weapon. He signed the \nletter, he later wrote, only because of \"the likelihood that the \nGermans were working on the same problem with the chance of \nsucceeding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEinstein's contributions to physics are many. But his greatest effect \non history may have been made by moving forward a project he never \nworked on and whose result he rued. -Michael Barone\u0014",

It is \nunworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining rock, and cover \nHim in whose fist all things are enclosed. Take away the linen \nclothes, I pray; leave the napkins in the tomb: Thou art sufficient \nfor us, and without Thee there is nothing. Release the chained shades \nof the infernal prison, and recall to the upper regions whatever \nsinks to the lowest depths. Give back Thy face, that the world may \nsee the light; give back the day which flees from us at Thy death. \nBut returning, O holy conqueror! Thou didst altogether fill the \nheaven!\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther, German Reformer; sermon, ca. 1525\u0014\n\u0014\nYou have heard in the story of the Passion how Christ is portrayed as \nour exemplar and helper, and that he who follows him and clings to \nhim receives the Spirit, who will enable him also to suffer. But the \nwords of Paul are more Christian and should come closer home to our \nhearts and comfort us more, when he says: \"Christ was raised for our \njustification.\" Here the Lamb is truly revealed, of whom John the \nBaptist testifies, when he says in Jn. 1, 29: \"Behold, the Lamb of \nGod, that taketh away the sin of the world.\" Here is fulfilled that \nwhich was spoken to the serpent: \"I will put enmity between thee and \nthe woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy \nhead,\" which means that for all those who believe in him, hell, \ndeath, and the devil and sin have been destroyed. In the same manner \nthe promise is fulfilled today which God gave to Abraham, when he \nsaid in Gen. 22, 18: \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth \nbe blessed.\" Here Christ is meant, who takes away our curse and the \npower of sin, death and the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll this is done, I say, by faith. For if you believe that by this \nseed the serpent has been slain, then it is slain for you; and if you \nbelieve that in this seed all nations are to be blessed, then you are \nalso blessed.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Donne, dean of the Cathedral of St. Paul's, London; sermon, \nMarch 28, 1619\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist dyed because he would dye; other men admitted to the dignity \nof Martyrdome, are willing to dye; but they dye by the torments of \nthe Executioners, they cannot bid their soules goe out, and say, now \nI will dye. And this was Christs case: It was not only, I lay down my \nlife for my sheep [John 10:15], but he sayes also, No man can take \naway my soule; And, I have power to lay it down; And De facto, he did \nlay it down, he did dye, before the torments could have extorted his \nsoule from him; Many crucified men lived many dayes upon the Crosse; \nThe thieves were alive, long after Christ was dead; and therefore \nPilate wondred, that he was already dead [Mark 15:44]. His soule did \nnot leave his body by force, but because he would, and when he would, \nand how he would; Thus far then first, this is an answer to this \nquestion, Quis homo? [Who is this man?] Christ did not die naturally, \nnor violently, as all others doe, but only voluntarily.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Spurgeon, British Baptist preacher; sermon, April 9, 1882\u0014\n\u0014\nThe learned are going to destroy the Christian religion. Already, \naccording to their boastings, it has pretty nearly come to an end. \nThe pulpit is effete, it cannot command public attention. We stand up \nand preach to empty benches! As you see-or do not see. Nothing \nremains for us but to die decently, so they insinuate. And what then? \nWhen our Lord was dead, when the clay-cold corpse lay watched by the \nRoman soldiery, and with a seal upon the enclosing stone, was not the \ncause in mortal jeopardy? But how fared it? Did it die out? Every \ndisciple that Jesus had made forsook Him, and fled, was not \nChristianity then destroyed? Nay, that very day our Lord won a \nvictory which shook the gates of hell, and caused the universe to \nstand astonished. Matters are not worse with Him at this hour! His \naffairs are not in a sadder condition today than then. Nay, see Him \ntoday and judge. On His head are many crowns, and at His feet the \nhosts of angels bow! Jesus is the master of legions today, while the \nCaesars have passed away! Here are His people-needy, obscure, \ndespised, I grant you, still, but assuredly somewhat more numerous \nthan they were when they laid Him in the tomb.

    "words": "Evolution versus creationism: \nScientists see them differently\u0014\n\u0014\nREX SPRINGSTON\u0014\nTIMES-DISPATCH COLUMNIST Jan 09, 2003\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Richard J. Neves is an unusual species of scientist. He believes \nin miracles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Virginia Tech biologist is a nationally known expert in mussels, \nthose clamlike creatures in our rivers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeves also is a creationist. He doesn't believe in evolution, \nconsidered by most biologists the foundation of\u0014\n\u0014\ntheir profession. Neves believes God created the world's creatures \nbasically as they are.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike other biologists, Neves was taught evolution in college. But \nwhen he got out, he said, what he saw didn't square with what he had \nbeen taught.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Seeing the diversity and complexity that exists within nature, it \nreally began to challenge my belief that all this came about by \nrandom chance, which is basically what evolution states.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNeves' belief raises a question: How do scientists reconcile their \nprofessional side, which emphasizes cold, hard rationalism, with \ntheir spiritual side, which calls for faith?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question probably causes inner stress for many scientists, said \nDr. Mike Ellerbrock, a Tech economist and a deacon in the Catholic \nChurch. He teaches a Tech course called \"Science and Religion: \nFriends or Foes?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPolls show that scientists, on the whole, are less religious than the \ngeneral public. \"It's basically due to the nature of their training - \nto be skeptical and to want proof,\" Ellerbrock said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut a scientist can be religious. Many who argue creationism versus \nevolution set up a false choice between God or science, Ellerbrock \nsaid. \"Who started it all in the first place? If there was a Big Bang \n[to begin the universe], who started the Big Bang?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many scientists, the answer is God.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, it's unusual for a biologist to be a creationist. Scientists \nrely on evolution to explain, among other things, differences in \nspecies and differences in populations of animals of the same species.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's [evolution] a great unifying theory,\" said Dr. Eric M. \nHallerman, a Tech geneticist. \"It's believed by virtually every \nserious biologist, geneticist - everyone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Hallerman, a friend of Neves, added, \"Dick and I don't differ as \nmuch as it might seem from the outside.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his work, Hallerman thinks about evolution \"eight hours a day and \na couple hours in the evening, too.\" But Hallerman, a conservative \nJew - the middle of Judaism's three main streams - believes God \ndirects the process of evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So when Dick says 'intelligent design' [is behind the diversity of \nanimals] and I say, 'God's directing the symphony,' we are close.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHallerman added, \"I don't have a lot of conflict\" about being \nreligious and believing in evolution, \"but it took me a while to sort \nit out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll creationists were not created the same. Many take the Bible \nliterally. They believe the Earth is only 10,000 years old or younger \n- estimates often made by counting genealogies in the Bible. However, \nmost scientists say the Earth is about 4.6 billion years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeves, a 56-year-old Catholic, calls himself \"sort of an old-Earth \ncreationist.\" He does not take the Bible literally. He believes the \nEarth is millions of years old, but he's not sold on the 4.6 billion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt bothers Neves that science excludes religious explanations for \nchanges in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"To not consider the supernatural . . . is an inherent bias in \nscience. If you are not thinking the way science says you should be \nthinking, you are an outcast.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA federal biologist who teaches and researches at Tech, Neves has \npublished more than 100 scientific papers. His work with mussels, he \nsaid, doesn't require him to use the word \"evolution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm just describing what nature is presenting - how the animals \nreproduce, how they survive, their requirements, etc.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvolution works mainly through natural selection, scientists say. \nAnimals born with features that enable them to survive and reproduce \n- fast legs to avoid predators, or strong beaks to crack nuts - pass \non those characteristics to their offspring over many generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nBritish naturalist Charles Darwin described natural selection in the \nmid-1800s - and the evolution-versus- creationism battle began.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Pinder, a state biologist, is a firm believer in evolution. \n\"Evolution is an explanation of how we got here, and religion to me \nis how we are supposed to live. Those two are totally separate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPinder, also a friend of Neves, has debated the issue many times with \nhim. \"We agree to disagree. . . . He's a great scientist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPinder works with Neves to protect rare mussels in Southwest \nVirginia. \"How they got here doesn't matter,\" Pinder said. \"We are \ntrying to make sure they stay around.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOr, as Neves put it: \"As a Christian, I feel I have a moral \nresponsibility through my profession to maintain the diversity that \nwas put here on Earth, whether it was created or evolved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Rex Springston at (804) 649-6453 or \nrspringston@timesdispatch.com\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis story can be found at: \nhttp://tiMESdISPATCH.com/news/columnists/mgb9pbsmpad.html\u0014",

    "title": "EMPTY CATHEDRALS",
    "words": "A tour of the great cathedrals of Europe would not be complete \nunless you visited Rome. \u0014\n       There the obligatory stops would include not only the massive \nSt. Peter's Basilica, but also \u0014\n       St. Paul's Outside-the-Walls, and St. John Lateran Cathedral.\u0014\n\u0014\n       These two are particularly fascinating for those with an \ninterest in the necrology of the \u0014\n       church, for - like most cathedrals - they feature the remains \nof two of the\u0014\n       church's most famous apostles: Peter and Paul. Visit these \nchurches and you won't\u0014\n       need a sixth sense to see dead people. \u0014\n\u0014\n       The tomb of Paul is located in St. Paul's, but his head is not \nthere. For a view of the reliquary        \u0014\n       containing the head of Paul you must go to St. John Lateran. \nAbove the High Altar is the \u0014\n       canopy or baldacchino, a Gothic structure resting on four \nmarble columns. Near the top the \u0014\n       heads of the apostles Peter and Paul rest in separate but \nequal golden reliquaries and \u0014\n       constitute the great treasure of the basilica, which until \nthis shrine was prepared to receive \u0014\n       them, had always been kept in the Sancta Sanctorum, the \nprivate chapel of the Lateran \u0014\n       Palace adjoining.\u0014\n       \u0014\n       Now, that the cathedrals of Europe are home to scores of dead \nshould come as no\u0014\n       surprise, and indeed, many of us might claim that our own \nchurches in America are\u0014\n       full of dead people as well.\u0014\n       \u0014\n       But your interest in necrology might lie outside the church. \nSo you travel to Florence\u0014\n       to the Church of Santa Croce. There, you can see the tomb of \nthe\u0014\n       scientist-cum-heretic, Galileo, an ornate structure placed \nthere by the Church more\u0014\n       than 100 years after his death, and the tomb of Michelangelo. \nThere's a tomb for\u0014\n       Dante, as well, but, in a feud with the Florentines, he \nrefused to be buried there, and\u0014\n       his body lies instead in Ravenna.\u0014\n\u0014\n       So it goes. The cathedrals of Western Europe are full of \npeople, but they're mostly\u0014\n       dead people.\u0014\n\u0014\n       Take Canterbury Cathedral, for example. For more than nine \ncenturies, pilgrims\u0014\n       made their way in multitudes to the majestic Canterbury \nCathedral in England,\u0014\n       trekking from all over Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n       Today? At Morning Prayer on a recent Sunday, the vaulted \nceiling of Canterbury\u0014\n       Cathedral looked down on a grand total of 13 worshipers. A \nmidday communion\u0014\n       service did better, with about 300 people on hand, counting a \ncluster of tourists with\u0014\n       video cameras. Not bad, but in a cavernous cathedral like \nCanterbury, most of the\u0014\n       seats were still empty.\u0014\n\u0014\n       What's going on? The psalmist said, \"Come, let us sing for joy \nto the Lord\" (95:1\u0014\n       NIV). Is no one singing anymore? Is there no praise left among \nthe people of God?\u0014\n       Are those who love God so few in number that the voices of \nthose who do praise\u0014\n       him, echo alone in the cavernous chambers of an empty house of \nworship?\u0014\n\u0014\n       Social critics have their theories. Some sense that modern \nlife in Europe has\u0014\n       become so easy and comfortable that people can avoid facing \nthe big issues of life\u0014\n       and death. Says Michael Chandler, a priest at Canterbury, \"You \ncan get to age 50 or\u0014\n       higher without ever facing the death of somebody close to \nyou.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n       There simply aren't many Europeans these days who are \nresponding to the call of\u0014\n       Psalm 95, \"Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol \nhim with music and\u0014\n       song!\" (v. 2 NIV).\u0014",

    "words": "June 8, 2003\u0014\nEmpire Maker Ends Funny Cide's Triple Crown Bid\u0014\nBy JOE DRAPE\u0014\n\u0014\ninstead of dousing the spirits of those who came to be part of \nhistory, the rain that pounded Belmont Park yesterday afternoon made \ntheir hope blossom. This was Funny Cide's home track. He was New \nYork-born and had captured two-thirds of the Triple Crown. A little \nslop? Forget about it.\u0014\nHis last five workouts at Belmont had been the fastest of the day  \ntwo in conditions as soupy as yesterday's. Three weeks ago, Funny \nCide seemed to ski over a sticky track to win the Preakness. So what \nif rain pounded the 135th running of the Belmont Stakes? Funny Cide \nwas going to pound his five rivals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least that was the feeling in the North Shore Terrace, the dining \nroom where J. P. Constance, one of the six high school buddies from \nSackets Harbor, N.Y., who are the core of Funny Cide's ownership, was \nprobably the only optician in the world signing autographs. A Funny \nCide victory was the desperate wish of the soaked crowd of 101,864.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll those hopes and wishes went unfulfilled. Like War Emblem, \nCharismatic, Real Quiet and Silver Charm in the past seven years, \nFunny Cide could not win the Belmont and capture the Triple Crown. He \nfinished third behind Empire Maker and the runner-up, Ten Most Wanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil Funny Cide, a chestnut gelding who was the even-money favorite, \nbroke from the gate, this was among the finest miserable days in New \nYork history. And then?\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing really went wrong in Funny Cide's bid to become the 12th \nTriple Crown champion, a feat that horseplayers have been waiting to \ncelebrate since 1978, when Affirmed won the Belmont.\u0014\nIt was just that nothing really went right, either.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We were beaten by a good horse,\" said Barclay Tagg, Funny Cide's \nstoic and straightforward trainer. \"I don't know what else to say. I \nam being honest. It is horse racing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis jockey, Jose Santos, broke Funny Cide sharply, just as he did in \nthe Kentucky Derby and Preakness. Funny Cide glided like a hovercraft \ninto the first turn, leaving Scrimshaw and Empire Maker in his wake. \nSantos and Funny Cide were loping at a sensible place  a half-mile \nin 48.70 seconds, three-quarters of a mile in a manageable 1:13.51.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom his vantage point in a clubhouse box, Tagg glanced up from \nbeneath a brown fedora to the toteboard clocks. He felt pretty good.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was pretty confident when he made the three-quarter mark at 1:13 \nand change,\" Tagg said.\u0014\nBut from his seat a length behind Funny Cide, Jerry Bailey, on Empire \nMaker, was seeing the best thing imaginable for his colt: Santos was \nasking, begging, fighting Funny Cide to slow down.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeading into the far turn, Bailey knew that redemption for Empire \nMaker, for himself and for the colt's trainer, Bobby Frankel, was \njust a half-mile away. They had beaten Funny Cide in the Wood \nMemorial in April only to be embarrassed in the Derby, when Empire \nMaker was the heavy favorite. Now Bailey watched Santos wrestling \nwith Funny Cide and turned his own colt loose.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I knew I had him from the top of the backside,\" Bailey said. \"He was \nso rank and he couldn't get him to settle down.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Bailey asked Empire Maker, a son of Unbridled, to run, and he \ninhaled Funny Cide at the midpoint of the final turn and squared his \nshoulders down as he entered the long stretch. Frankel knew he had \neveryone's favorite horse beat. \"But I still had an anxious moment \nwith Ten Most Wanted,\" he said.\u0014\nThe jockey Pat Day had Ten Most Wanted, the Illinois Derby winner, in \nfull stride, and his colt was pole-vaulting down the middle of the \nlane. Ten Most Wanted lunged and lurched, but came up three-quarters \nof a length short of Empire Maker.\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpire Maker finished in 2:28.26 and paid $6 on a $2 bet to win. \nFrankel earned his first Triple Crown victory after going 0 for 11.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the owners' box, the faces of Funny Side's owners, Santos's family \nand Tagg said that the five-week celebration of a modestly bred, \ncheaply purchased overachiever was through.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstance, the autograph-signing optician, and Jack Knowlton, the \nmanaging partner of Sackatoga Stable, which owns Funny Cide, watched \nwith watery eyes before giving respectful applause to Empire Maker. \nRita Santos and her 8-year-old son, Jose Jr., collapsed tearfully \ninto each other's arms. Tagg kept his usual stone face intact, \nalthough his squinted eyes betrayed his disappointment.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I feel bad for the people who were so behind him,\" Tagg said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSantos said of the horse that returned him to the top rank of jockeys \nand nearly made him a household name these past five weeks: \"He was \nthird best today. I am not disappointed in this horse at all. He had \na great run.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe most broken-hearted of all were Funny Cide's legions of fans \nwho had come to see a blue-collar horse, trained by an everyday \ntrainer and owned by a group of regular guys, perhaps grab greatness. \nIn fact, when Empire Maker trotted into the winner's circle, a \nsmattering of boos could be heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankel, a Brooklyn-born Hall of Famer, had said before the race that \nif everyone hated him after the Belmont Stakes, then he had done his \njob.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobin Smullen, Tagg's assistant and companion, had predicted that \nwin, lose or draw, Funny Cide would remain everyone's favorite horse. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Frankel and Smullen proved to be correct.\u0014",

    "title": "EMPIRE MAKER SPOILS FUNNY'S TRIPLE CROWN RUN",
    "words": "Bill Finley\u0014\nSpecial to ESPN.com\u0014\n\u0014\nELMONT, NY -- Amid his confidence, expressed over and over again in \nthe days and minutes leading up to the race, even Bobby Frankel had \nmomentary visions that fate may conspire against him, that maybe the \nBelmont Stakes was not going to be about who was the fastest horse \nafter all. He's a grizzled racetracker, hardly the type who believes \nin magic, but he sensed that maybe, just maybe, there was something \nalmost mystical about Funny Cide. He was, of course, not alone. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm sure the public would have liked to see Funny Cide win,\" Frankel \nsaid. \"They hadn't seen one win in 25 years. That 25 years got me a \nlittle worried. Maybe destiny wanted that horse to win.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe should have known better. Funny Cide may have been the good story, \nbut Empire Maker was the better horse. At least he was on this day, \nthe day when his once-glowing reputation was restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt hashappened again: in 2003, there will be no Triple Crown. Funny \nCide tried his best over the sloppy track on a miserable, wet day at \nBelmont Park. But his best was not good enough. Clearly beaten once \npassed by Empire Maker about three furlongs from the finish, he \nchecked in third as Empire Maker dug down in the stretch and to hold \noff Ten Most Wanted in a three-quarter length victory.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not disappointed by this horse,\" said Funny Cide's rider, Jose \nSantos. \"He had a great run. We came here to the Belmont Stakes to \ntry and win the Triple Crown. To win the Triple Crown is very \ndifficult. It's been 25 years without someone winning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Triple Crown hex remains alive. There has not been a Triple Crown \nwinner since Affirmed in 1978. Since then, nine horses have come into \nthe Belmont Stakes with a chance of sweeping the series and all nine \nhave lost. Five potential Triple Crown winners have gone down in the \nlast seven years alone, and Funny Cide's failure to win will now \ncreate the longest gap between Triple Crown winners in history--at \nleast 26 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a time when all the talk was Empire Maker, when he was the \none everyone expected to enter the Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown \nbid on the line. His mission crashed and burned in the Kentucky Derby \nwhen he finished second behind a relative unknown named Funny Cide. \nAfterward, Frankel blamed himself, saying he babied the horse. That's \nhow confident he was he would win the Kentucky Derby. He wanted to \ntrain his colt, who was hobbled by a bruised foot in the day's \nleading up to the race, in a manner that would leave him a fresh \nhorse for the final two legs of the Triple Crown.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What happened in the Kentucky Derby? I played it real close,\" he \nsaid. \"I was thinking ahead. I didn't train him hard and then he \nmissed some training time with the bruised foot. With the way he was \ntrained for the race, I gave him too much to overcome. If I could do \nwhat they call a do-over and could do it all over again, he would \nhave won the Kentucky Derby.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankel was intent on proving he, and so many others, were right \nabout Empire Maker all along. He bore down on his horse in the five \nweeks he had off between the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont, \nfine-tuning him to where he was sure he would run his race. He \nbelieved that would be good enough.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was very, very confident in this horse,\" he said, ignoring his few \ndoubts about the destiny factor. \"There was no doubt in my mind that \nhe would win.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, strategy would play a key. Funny Cide has more speed than \nEmpire Maker does and he is a tenacious horse. Jerry Bailey, the \nrider of Empire Maker, knew he couldn't afford to let the Kentucky \nDerby and Preakness winner get away from him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe gunned him from the gate, took back for just a second, and then \nplaced his mount just off Funny Cide's flank. He got an assist when \nScrimshaw also joined the fray to put some pressure on Funny Cide. \nThe pace was comfortable as Funny Cide completed a half-mile in \n:48.70, but Bailey already knew his rival was in trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As soon as I saw Funny Cide get a little rank and start pulling \nJose, that is when I eased back and moved outside,\" he said. \"When I \nturned up the backside, Funny Cide was really rank and my horse was \nrelaxed. That's what you want going a mile and a half, a relaxed \nhorse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide was all but done midway on the turn. Santos was already \nresorting to the whip on his mount and was getting no response. \nMeanwhile, Empire Maker was cruising and opened up by 1  lengths.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then came Ten Most Wanted, the horse who had been such a big \ndisappointment in the Kentucky Derby. He was coming with menacing \nstrides on the outside and appeared to have a chance. But, according \nto Bailey, Empire Maker was just loafing. Once the colt saw that \nthere was a challenger on his outside, he dug down and gamely held on \nto win by three-quarters of a length. It was another 4 1/4 lengths \nback to Funny Cide in third. He was followed by Dynever, Supervisor \nand Scrimshaw.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I really wanted to win it, but more so for the horse,\" Frankel said. \n\"The press tends to get down on a horse like this and I wanted to get \nhim back on top and have everybody raving aout him again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEmpire Maker paid $6.00 as the second choice among the crowd of \n101,864, the second largest attendance in Belmont history. He \ncompleted the mile and a half in 2:28.62. It was Frankel's first win \nin a Triple Crown race, breaking an 0-for-11 run. Afterward, Funny \nCide's trainer, Barclay Tagg, wasn't offering any excuses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I feel bad for all the people who came out,\" he said. \"We had a good \nfirst quarter. The :48 and the 1:13 and change was a sensible pace. I \ndon't know if it was the extra quarter-mile. We were beaten by a good \nhorse. I don't know what else to say.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Santos believed his horse didn't handle the sloppy track.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's not a cheap excuse,\" he said. \"That's the honest truth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith both Funny Cide and Empire Maker based in New York, the two will \nlikely meet again, possibly in the Aug. 23 Travers at Saratoga. There \nmight be a budding rivalry here, one that may entertain racing fans \nin the months ahead. They're two very good horses, but right now \nEmpire Maker is on top.\u0014",

I had to swerve a number of times \nbefore I hit him. \u0014\n\tI pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my \nmother-in-law and headed over the embankment. \u0014\n\tIn my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole. \u0014\n\tI had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I \nreached an intersection a hedge sprang up obscuring my vision, and I \ndid not see the other car. \u0014\n\tI had been driving for 40 years when I fell asleep at the wheel and \nhad an accident. \u0014\n\tI was on my way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my \nuniversal joint gave way causing me to have an accident. \u0014\n\tAs I approached the intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a \nplace where no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to \nstop in time to avoid the accident. To avoid hitting the bumper of \nthe car in front, I struck the pedestrian. \u0014\n\tMy car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle. \u0014\n\tAn invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished. \u0014\n\tI told the police that I was not injured, but upon removing my hat \nfound that I had a fractured skull. \u0014\n\tI was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of \nthe curb when I struck him. \u0014\n\tThe telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out \nof its way when it struck the front end. I was thrown from the car as \nit left the road. I was later found in the ditch by some stray cows. \u0014\n\tThe indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car \nwith a big mouth. \u0014\n\tThe pedestrian had no idea which direction to run, so I ran over \nhim. \u0014\n(from The Humorama Newsletter)\u0014",

    "words": "End of a Spectacular era\u0014\n\u0014\nHorse of the Year, dual classic winner Spectacular Bid dies in New \nYork at 27\u0014\n\u0014\nby Tom Law\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE VISITORS came, year after year, to the small central New York \ntown of Unadilla.\u0014\n\u0014\nJonathan Davis, D.V.M., estimates that between ten to 15 people \narrived monthly just to see the legendary Spectacular Bid, the 1980 \nHorse of the Year, three-time Eclipse Award winner, and winner of \ntwo-thirds of the Triple Crown in 79. Those numbers would swell \nannually around the anniversaries of Spectacular Bids victories in \nthe Kentucky Derby (G1) and Preakness Stakes (G1).\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid, who died of an apparent heart attack on June 9 at \nDaviss Milfer Farm near Unadilla, was easily the star attraction of \nOtsego County. In a twist of fate, the 27-year-old stallion died \nexactly 24 years to the day after he lost the Triple Crown by 3 1/2 \nlengths to Coastal and runner-up Golden Act in the 1979 Belmont \nStakes (G1). Known fondly to fans and handlers alike as \"Bid,\" the \nson of Bold Bidder was the oldest living Kentucky Derby winner, a \ndistinction now held by 1980 winner Genuine Risk.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was always eye-opening to me that Bid essentially had his own fan \nclub,\" said Davis, who had stood Spectacular Bid since 1992. \"I was \nalways amazed that people would take off from work just to get a \npicture taken next to him. He was an icon.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavis indicated Spectacular Bid seemed a bit off his feed the weekend \nbefore his death at the time when racing witnessed another horse, \nFunny Cide, lose the Triple Crown by finishing third in the Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He had been doing well up to then. He hid his age very well,\" Davis \nsaid. Davis said a special headstone would be placed at Spectacular \nBids grave site, which is on a portion of Milfer near the stallion \nbarn. Brilliant start\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid earned high distinction and a legion of fans after a \nbrilliant racing career that ranks him among the sports greatest \nrunners. The gray out of Spectacular, by Promised Land, won 26 of 30 \ncareer starts, earned a then-record $2,781,608, and was named \nchampion in each of his three seasons on the track.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid registered 13 Grade 1 victories, set or equaled eight \ntrack records, and roared through an undefeated nine-race campaign in \n1980 that resulted in a Horse of the Year crown. He was inducted into \nthe Racing Hall of Fame in 1982.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He was the greatest horse that ever looked through a bridle,\" said \ntrainer Grover G. \"Bud\" Delp, who joined Spectacular Bid in the Hall \nof Fame last year. \"The only two horses that I believe would have \ngiven him a run were Citation and Secretariat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBred in Kentucky by Madelyn Jason and her mother, Grace Gilmore, \nSpectacular Bid was foaled at Buck Pond Farm near Lexington and was \npurchased by Harry Meyerhoffs Hawksworth Farm for $37,000 at the \n1977 Keeneland September yearling sale.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid started his career with a pair of victories at \nPimlico Race Course but then suffered the only back-to-back losses of \nhis life. He rebounded to win the final five starts of his juvenile \ncampaign, including the Champagne Stakes (G1) at Belmont Park and the \nLaurel Futurity (G1) at Laurel Park to clinch the Eclipse Award as \nchampion two-year-old male.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid started his Triple Crown campaign with easy victories \nin the Hutcheson Stakes, Fountain of Youth Stakes (G3), and Florida \nDerby (G1) at Gulfstream Park and the Flamingo Stakes (G1) at Hialeah \nPark. His final prep, in which he scored a seven-length romp in the \nBlue Grass Stakes (G1) at Keeneland Race Course, came nine days \nbefore the Kentucky Derby.\u0014\n\u0014\nChase for the crown\u0014\n\u0014\nWith teenaged jockey Ronnie Franklin aboard, Spectacular Bid was bet \ndown to 3-to-5 in the field of ten in the Kentucky Derby. He lived up \nto that billing, coming from nearly ten lengths behind after a \nhalf-mile to romp to a 2 3/4-length victory over General Assembly in \n2:02 2/5.\u0014\n\u0014\nFacing just four opponents two weeks later, Spectacular Bid destroyed \nthe field in the Preakness, winning by 5 1/2 lengths over Golden Act \nat odds of 1-to-10 in 1:54 1/5 for the 1 3/16 miles. The victory in \nthe Preakness set up Spectacular Bids run for the Triple Crown, \nwhich had been won the previous two years by Seattle Slew and \nAffirmed, respectively. After a strange sequence of events, \nSpectacular Bid finished third.\u0014\n\u0014\nFranklin and Spectacular Bid chased the quick early pace in the \nBelmont set by 85.60-to-1 longshot Gallant Best before opening up a \ntwo-length lead after running one mile in 1:36. He eventually tired, \nbeaten 3 1/2 lengths by Coastal.\u0014\n\u0014\nDelp did not initially criticize Franklins ride on Spectacular Bid, \nbut he never rode the jockey again on the champion. Two days after \nthe race, Delp said Spectacular Bid had stepped on a safety pin, \nwhich penetrated into his foot on the morning of the Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid came out of the Belmont with an infection in his left \nfront foot, an injury that sidelined him for nearly three months. \nDuring that time, a deal was consummated to stand Spectacular Bid at \nthe Hancock familys Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe returned to win a 1 1/16-mile allowance race in a record 1:41.60 \nat Delaware Park under jockey Bill Shoemaker, then avenged his \nBelmont defeat by conquering Travers Stakes (G1) winner General \nAssembly and Coastal in the Marlboro Cup Handicap (G1) at Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe final defeat in Spectacular Bids career came in his next start, \nwhen he finished second, three-quarters of a length behind Affirmed, \nin the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup (G1) at Belmont. He ended the \nseason with a victory in the Meadowlands Cup (G2) and earned champion \nthree-year-old male honors.\u0014\n\u0014\nDominant at four\u0014\n\u0014\nAs brilliant as Spectacular Bid was at three, he was more dominating \nat four.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid won his first six starts of the season in California, \nturning in a track-record performance in the seven-furlong Malibu \nStakes (G2) in 1:20 and an American-record run in the 1 1/4-mile \nCharles H. Strub Stakes (G1) in 1:57 4/5. He also posted a \nfive-length win over Flying Paster carrying 130 pounds in the Santa \nAnita Handicap (G1) and a seven-length score under 132 pounds in the \nMervyn LeRoy Handicap (G2).\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid carried 130 pounds to subsequent wins in the \nCalifornian Stakes (G1) at Hollywood Park and the Washington Park \nHandicap (G3), the latter by ten lengths in an Arlington Park record \nfor 1 1/8 miles in 1:46 1/5. He ended his career with a victory over \nchampion older mare Glorious Song in the Amory L. Haskell Handicap \n(G1) at Monmouth Park and in a walkover in the Woodward Stakes (G1) \nat Belmont.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid, named champion older male and Horse of the Year in \n1980, was retired after being diagnosed with chips in his left front \nankle.\u0014\n\u0014\nStruggles at stud\u0014\n\u0014\nSyndicated for a then-record $22-million prior to entering stud at \nClaiborne, Spectacular Bid stood his first season for $150,000. Just \nas he did when he moved to Milfer after the 1991 season, Spectacular \nBid drew fans to Claiborne, where he resided in a stall across the \naisle from Triple Crown winner Secretariat. Visitors would gasp in \nawe when Claiborne grooms led out the two physically imposing \nstallions.\u0014\n\u0014\nYearlings from his first two crops sold well at public auction in the \nhigh-water auction years of 1983 and 84, including Immortal Dancer, \na colt out of the Northern Dancer mare Farouche who brought \n$3-million at the 83 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga selected sale. Immortal \nDancer won two races in England and was eventually sent to Chile.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpectacular Bid, who has 751 foals in his first 20 crops and was \nstanding for $3,500 this year, sired 44 stakes winners, including 17 \ngroup/graded winners, and had progeny earnings of $21,513,949 through \nthe day he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore proving popular as a sire of show horses while standing in New \nYork, Spectacular Bid sired Spectacular Love, who won the 1984 \nFuturity Stakes (G1). He also sired Grade/Group 2 winners Lay Down, \nan earner of $593,423, Marquette, Festivity, Bite the Bullet, \nShepherds Field, Spectacular Sue, and Spectacular Joke, but never \ngot the outstanding runner that would have made his stud career.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis leading earner, Lotus Pool, won the 1990 Two Thousand Guineas \nTrial in Ireland and finished third in the Airlie Coolmore Irish Two \nThousand Guineas (Ire-G1) before returning to North America. He won a \npair of Grade 3 events and set or equaled three course records before \nretiring with earnings of $694,543.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bid would definitely throw you an athletic and versatile horse,\" \nDavis said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What I really didnt appreciate, and came to learn from Bid, was how \nhe had a tremendous fan club--people who loved him as an individual,\" \nDavis continued. \"Were still receiving requests for memorabilia--a \nlock of hair, shoes, halters, everything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTom Law is deputy news editor of Thoroughbred Times.\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELICAL, FUNDAMENTALIST AND \"BORN AGAIN\"",
    "words": "Evangelical, Fundamentalist and Born Again  \nAre Not Interchangeable Words \u0014\n\u0014\nIt seemed they were employed interchangeably, as if their definitions \nwere synonymous. In popular culture, those terms are shorthand for \nstaunchly conservative, small-minded, and mean-spirited. It's a \nmatter of semantics, but it is spiritually significant.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe word evangelical comes from the Greek euangelion, meaning \nthe good news or the gospel. During the Protestant Reformation, \nMartin Luther adopted  the word to describe his breakaway church; for \nhundreds of years thereafter, evangelical  meant, simply, \nProtestant.\u0014\n \u0014\nToday, in American society the term is used in three ways, according \nto the Institute for the\u0014\n Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton College:\u0014\n \u0014\nTheologically, it is an umbrella term for Christians who believe in \nthe need for conversion, the command to spread the gospel, the \ninerrancy of the Bible, and the primacy of Jesus Christ's atoning \ndeath on the cross.\u0014\n \u0014\nStylistically, evangelical also describes a kind of religious \npractice as much as a set\u0014\nof doctrines. This is where you really see the diversity of \nevangelicalistn: Mennonites,\u0014\nAfrican-American Baptists, Southern Baptists, Catholic charismatics \nand Dutch Reformed all  fall under the evangelical-as-a-style \numbrella.\u0014\n \u0014\nPolitically, evangelical describes a coalition of Protestants \n(including evangelist Billy Graham) who used the term in an attempt \nto distance themselves from the Christian\u0014\n fundamentalist movements of the 1 920s and '30s. Fundamentalism's \nhallmarks were (and to a certain extent remain) anti-intellectualism, \nanti-modernity and a belief that the church should not engage with \nculture. Mainstream evangelicals, by contrast, sought to actively Be \na part of culture in order to transform it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Evangelical and fundamentalist are not one in the same. They are \nin many ways opposites. In fact, Christian fundamentalists have more \nin common with fundamentalists\u0014\n from other religions than they do with other Christians: a siege \nmentality and distrust of the\u0014\n other, topped with a liberal dose of ardent  legalism.\u0014\n \u0014\n\"Born-again, meanwhile, is a colloquialism derived from Jesus' own \nwords in the New Testament, that describes a conversion experience \nwhere a person encounters God and is spiritually transformed. Not all \nevangelicals and fundamentalists use those words to describe \nthemselves, but many in each group do.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Bachmann profile describes the late evangelist and thinker \nFrancis Schaeffer, a figure nearly as legendary in evangelical \ncircles as Graham, as one of the exotic influences on the \ncongresswomans worldview, which has been shaped by institutions and \npeople unfamiliar to most Americans.\u0014\n \u0014\nPollsters and scholars estimate that evangelicals comprise roughly 30 \npercent of the U.S.\u0014\n population  a minority to be sure, but hardly an obscure one.\u0014\n \u0014\nIf the New Yorker piece is any indication, apparently we evangelicals \nremain an elusive, vastly misunderstood lot--30 years after \nevangelicals became a potent political force. In the\u0014\npopular imagination at least, evangelicalism is an ideological \nmonolith.\u0014\n \u0014\nThose of us in the media would do well to treat evangelicals as \nneither homogenous nor\u0014\n uncommon, and choose our words more carefully.

Sometimes I snap my fingers every 2.5\u0014\nseconds in a deadly rhythm that expresses those\u0014\nnumbers: a child dying unnecessarily with every snap\u0014\nofthe fingers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis situation is not inevitable. It is part of the\u0014\nmajor global transition that marks our age - a transition\u0014\nas far-reaching as the Industrial Revolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore countries are being forced into worsening\u0014\npoverty. Through the rapid technological developments\u0014\ndriving this \"globalization,\" many jobs are\u0014\nbeing eliminated or moved to where wages are low\u0014\nand regulations protecting the environment and\u0014\nworkers are few.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result is the growing gap between rich and\u0014\npoor nations, between very rich people and everyone\u0014\nelse. 1.5 billion people in about 100 countries are\u0014\nliving at lower standards of living today than 30 years\u0014\nago.

The\u0014\nU.S. represents about 4% of the world's people and\u0014\nconsumes about 40% of world resources. A person in\u0014\nthe U.S. will use about 75 times the energy that a\u0014\nBangladeshi will. If the Chinese today had the same per\u0014\ncapita consumption of energy as the U.S., all known\u0014\nreserves of fossil fuels would be depleted in 3 years. The\u0014\ngap between wealthy and poor is growing rapidly - the\u0014\nwealthiest 20% ofpeople hold 85% of all wealth. This is\u0014\nnot socially sustainable.

    "title": "EATING MEAT USED WITH IDOLS",
    "words": "1 Corinthians 8:1-13\u0014\n\u0014\nThe matter of meat offered to idols in today's lectionary reading is \nvery interesting, because it arises from confusion about the \ninstructions issued by the Jerusalem council several years before \n(Acts 15). Gentiles were told that they did not need to first become \npracticing Jews in order to become believing Christians. But some \nsocial and dietary suggestions were offered so that Gentiles and Jews \nmight be able to share table fellowship, particularly when \ncommemorating the Last Supper together. The brief instruction at that \ntime was to \"abstain from food sacrificed to idols\" (Acts 15:29).\u0014\n\u0014\nAlready, these few years later, that command was being interpreted in \na variety of ways. When animal sacrifices were made at cultic \nshrines, particularly on well-attended public occasions, there was \noften too much flesh either for burning or for eating at the time. \nWithout refrigeration the meat was destined to spoil quickly so much \nof the excess was dumped into the markets at bargain-basement prices. \nSince some of the Christians in Corinth were from lower classes, this \ninexpensive meat offered a lot of meal for the money and that is \nwhere the controversy began.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome, who had taken strong hold on the freedoms offered by Christ, \nknew that idols were not rival gods, and therefore any meat purchased \nin this way was simply a wise use of funds. Others, who had emerged \nfrom working at the shrines and formerly participating in the cultic \npractices of these non-Christian religions, found it scandalous for \nChristians to buy and eat such meat. Another group remembered the \ninstructions of the Jerusalem council and thought it a matter of \nprinciple not to engage in this act that had specifically been \nitemized by the church leaders as inappropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul's response sorts through these differing reflections on \nChristian freedoms and interpersonal responsibilities and leaves the \nfinal decisions up to maturing believers who are wise enough to \nunderstand how their behaviors can impact others. Once again, as with \nhis instructions in his letter to the Galatians, Paul places the goal \nof a loving response to Jesus as primary in the making of all moral \nand ethical choices and follows that closely with a sense of \nobligation to serve and help others. In effect, Paul's ethical code \nis essentially that which Jesus espoused: love God above all, and \nlove your neighbor as yourself.\u0014",

    "words": "October 23, 1685 \u0014\nElizabeth Gaunt Burned for a Kindness\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowd was sympathetic. Elizabeth Gaunt was not only an old woman, \nbut known to many of the onlookers as a kindly Christian who helped \nthe poor and exiles. But in the England of 1685, as in all of the \nworld, cruel deaths were all too often dished out to people who \nangered the authorities with independent religious views.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth arranged straw around herself to speed the flame so that \nher misery would be as short as possible. When the people saw this, \nmany burst into tears. Few of the onlookers felt that Elizabeth's \nsentence was just. She had no part whatever in treason, but was to \nburn alive for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat had happened was this. Two years earlier, several members of the \nWhig party plotted to assassinate King Charles II as he passed by a \nplace known as Rye House. Although they abandoned the plot, they were \nbetrayed to the government. James Burton, one of the men implicated \nin the plan pleaded with Elizabeth Gaunt to hide him from his \npursuers for the sake of his family. Believing that it was what God \nwould expect, she not only helped him escape but gave him her \nprecious savings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government issued a proclamation that any one who gave evidence \nleading to others who took part in the plot would be given immunity \nfrom prosecution. James Burton saw this as a way to save his skin. He \nmade adeal with the authorities: He would testify against Elizabeth, \nthe woman who had saved his life, if they would grant him the \npromised immunity. The government agreed to this, and as the \nphilosopher David Hume wrote, \"He received a pardon as a recompense \nfor his treachery and she was burnt alive for her charity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several years, King James II, who had come to the throne, made \nuse of Judge Jeffreys, a brutal and unjust man, who made a career of \nhanding out cruel sentences against the king's enemies. Everyone \ncould imagine what level of justice Elizabeth could expect. Probably \nmercy would not have been shown to her even if she had not been one \nof the hated Anabaptists. These people taught pacifism and, contrary \nto the practice of most denominations, rejected infant baptism. They \nbelieved that only someone old enough to know the meaning of baptism \nshould receive the water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My fault,\" wrote Elizabeth, shortly before her death, \"was one which \na prince might well have forgiven. I did but relieve a poor family \nand I must die for it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDie she did, in the flames, on this day, October 23, 1685. She died \nbravely, the last woman burned alive in England for treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, was at the scene and saw her \ndie. He recorded some of the details.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, a furious storm burst upon England, which many considered \nto be a sign of God's anger at the burning of the innocent woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBarker, Anthony Richard.

    "words": "Eating Is Moral Act in World Where \nObese Outnumber Hungry\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Robert Parham\u0014\nWednesday, February 8, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nU.S. Catholic magazine posted a jolting article about the unbalanced \ndiet in the global community, which now has more obese people than \nhungry people. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"In a world of want where 1.4 billion people are struggling to \nsurvive on $1.25 a day, the No. 1 global health problem related to \nfood is now obesity. According to the International Federation of the \nRed Cross (IFRC), the 1.5 billion obese people worldwide now \noutnumber the 925 million who are hungry,\" wrote Kevin Clarke.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are eating ourselves to death in one corner of the planet, while \nin another families skip meals to extend food budgets or trade \neducation or shelter for daily caloric survival,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Prepare for more grotesquerie in the future  both obesity and \nhunger are poised to escalate,\" Clarke wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As First World diets are overwhelmed by inexpensive processed foods \nthat contribute to obesity and runaway health costs that are proving \na crippling economic burden in the West, hunger looms in the \ndeveloping world as world commodity prices spike to record levels and \ndrought brings famine to regions in the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan \nand elsewhere,\" said Clarke.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis piece appeared to draw from a longer article by Bekele Geleta, \nsecretary of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Societies.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fifteen per cent of the world's population goes to bed at night \nhungry. Most live in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly on the \nIndian subcontinent and in sub-Saharan Africa,\" wrote Geleta last \nSeptember. \"Each year, three million children tragically die before \ntheir fifth birthday from under nutrition, a condition arising from a \nserious lack of one or more key nutrients.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"[A]gainst this backdrop of severe hunger and misery, over a billion \npeople are tackling the opposite problem of obesity and, perhaps \nsurprisingly, malnutrition,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In contrast to undernutrition, malnutrition can arise from the \nover-consumption of poor quality and unhealthy food and is becoming a \nserious health problem for those living in societies where food is \nplentiful,\" wrote Geleta. \"Poor and rich alike are at serious risk \nfrom an epidemic of malnutrition.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPutting obesity and hunger on the same plate reframes the food \ndisorder in the global community. Apparent disconnectedness becomes \nan interconnected reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd while goodwill Christians begin to see the twisted connectedness \nof obesity and hunger, perhaps we should also begin to think more \nabout food and faith in terms of disorder and order.\u0014\n\u0014\nFood disorder is a cord that binds the biblical witness together. \nFrom the earliest accounts, we see food at pivotal points.\u0014\n\u0014\nEating fruit from one tree triggered a disorder that resulted in \nhuman beings eating bread in sweat. Red pottage split apart Esau and \nJacob.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hoarding of manna, which bred worms, was a sign of disobedience. \nThe daily distribution of food created conflict in the early church.\u0014\n\u0014\nConversely, food is a source of order. We see that every tree in the \nGarden was good for food. The consumption of lamb in Egypt created \nunity for the journey ahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus fed 5,000 and taught his followers to pray for daily bread. The \ndisciples were brought together around a common meal. Jesus showed \nhimself to his disciples at a fish fry on the beach.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Bible, food has both light and dark sides. So it is today in \ncommunities gathered around the Bible. Food blesses and binds \ntogether communities. Food also curses and divides communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen American congregations gather for an unhealthy, calorie-intense \nWednesday night meal, many other Christians in both the United States \nand abroad have too few nutritious calories.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe may profess one Lord, one faith and one baptism. But we are \nnutritionally divided.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany goodwill people of faith do engage in feeding programs at home. \nWe do support hunger and development programs abroad. Yet too few of \nus have on our plate an understanding that our global food system \nharms both the well-off and poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Clarke notes, \"eating is a moral act.\" As such, the biblical \nimperative to seek justice compels us to think more about how the \nmalformed global food system creates harmful abundance and ensures \nharmful scarcity.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet's paraphrase an infrequently heard prayer: \"May those who are \nhungry have bread; may those of us who have bread hunger for a just \nfood system.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is executive editor of EthicsDaily.com and executive \ndirector of its parent organization, the Baptist Center for Ethics.\u0014",

    "words": "By Anugrah Kumar , Christian Post Contributor \u0014\nApril 29, 2012|\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical leaders strongly condemned the burning of Qurans by \nFlorida Pastor Terry Jones on Saturday in protest of Iran's continued \nimprisonment of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani.\u0014\n\u0014\nJones burned copies of the Quran and an image depicting Muhammad on \nSaturday evening in front of his church Dove World Outreach Center in \nGainesville, Fla., where about 20 people gathered to witness the \nevent, OCALA.com reported. Gainesville police were stationed near the \nchurch and patrolled the area.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe event was streamed live over the Internet.\u0014\n\u0014\nGainesville Fire Rescue issued the church a citation for violating \nthe city's fire ordinances. Fire Chief Gene Prince was quoted as \nsaying that Jones had approval for a burn but did not have the \nrequired authorization to burn books, which can harm environment. The \nfine is $271, which includes court costs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The burning of a sacred text is wrong and unwarranted. The burning \nof the Qur'an is especially grievous to Muslims and does not reflect \nthe biblical values nor the spirit of the Lord Jesus whom we serve,\" \nDr. Geoff Tunnicliffe, secretary general of the World Evangelical \nAlliance, said in a statement Saturday. \"We appeal to Islamic leaders \nworldwide to understand that this self-proclaimed antagonist does not \nrepresent Christians. Indeed he violates the call of Jesus to love \npeople everywhere. Such violence does harm to us all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJones' public burning followed a personal meeting and intense \nconversation just one day earlier with representatives of the World \nEvangelical Alliance (WEA), including Tunnicliffe.\u0014",

    "title": "END-TIME DOOMSAYERS MAKE ISLAM THEIR NEW ANTI-CHRIST",
    "words": "End-Time Doomsayers Make Islam Their New Anti-Christ\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Jim Evans,    May 25, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1970, evangelical author Hal Lindsey penned a book that became a \nstaple of Christian end-time table talk. The title said it all: \"The \nLate Great Planet Earth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this book, Lindsey laid out the now all-too-familiar scheme of \nend-time paranoia, which includes the rise of one-world government, \nthe appearance of the anti-Christ, the isolation and attack on \nIsrael, and, of course, a final worldwide conflagration, Armageddon  \nthe ultimate war to end all wars.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe culmination of all this, of course, is the second coming of Jesus \nand the establishment of a New Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of this so-called prophecy is based on a particular reading of \nthe Book of Revelation, the last book found in the New Testament \ncanon.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevelation is an example of what scholars call apocalyptic \nliterature; it employs a complex series of symbols and imagery to \nconvey a message.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost scholars agree that the message embodied in apocalyptic writing \nwas intended for a contemporary audience.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut popular authors like Lindsey, and more recently Tim LaHaye and \nJerry Jenkins in the ubiquitous \"Left Behind\" series, have translated \nJewish apocalyptic imagery into 21st century political ideology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere comes the fun part.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Lindsey's version of the end-time drama, the old Soviet Union is \nthe evil dragon, the 10-horned beast that opposes all that is godly \nand good in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading through the lens of Lindsey's interpretation, the Christian \nworld, mainly represented by the United States, has a divine calling \nto oppose godless communism because it will eventually be in league \nwith the anti-Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere can be no compromise, no dtente, because the Soviet Union is \nan evil empire dedicated to the destruction of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, at least for Lindsey and his following, the Soviet Union \ncollapsed, and for a brief period serious end-time hand-wringers \nstruggled to find an evil entity of sufficient stature to take its \nplace.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, Islamic extremists attacked the United States on 9/11 and \nvoila  a new evil empire was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith a wave of the hand and the adjustment of a few words here and \nthere, Islam replaced the old Soviet Union as the instrument of the \nanti-Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, with the help of end-time doomsayers, Islam is the new agent of \nend-time Armageddon.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years ago, Elaine Pagels wrote a brilliant book titled \"The \nOrigin of Satan.\" In the book, she detailed how Jewish and Christian \ngroups throughout history used the character of Satan to demonize \nopposition groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt different times in history, Satan has been in league with certain \nJewish sects, pagans, various Christian heresies, and, of course, in \nthe book of Revelation, the Roman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would seem that some religious groups have a propensity for \nidentifying their opponents with ultimate evil. A new twist on an old \nsaying: If they are not with us, then they are the devil.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem with this thinking should be fairly obvious. Just as all \nChristians are not saints, so all Muslims are not radical extremists. \nTo make Islam the enemy of all that is good and godly is a gross \ndistortion of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the anti-Christ, my own reading suggests that this figure will \nnot be some shadowy political figure that establishes one-world \ngovernment, but rather, as John states in his letters, it is anyone \nwho refuses to follow the teachings of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd to quote John, there are already many anti-Christs in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L. Evans is pastor of Auburn First Baptist Church in Auburn, \nAla.\u0014",

    "words": "February 12, 1865 \u0014\nEx-Slave Henry Garnet Addressed U.S. House\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 12, 1865, the galleries of the United States \nHouse of Representatives were packed. Black and white alike vied for \na place where they might share in the historic moment. For the first \ntime in the history of the Republic, a black man--and an ex-slave at \nthat--was about to address the House of Representatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was President Lincoln who asked Presbyterian minister Henry \nHighland Garnet to deliver a sermon in the United State House of \nRepresentatives. Other national leaders had added their \nencouragement. Now Henry stood poised to give one of the two most \nimportant speeches of his life. He had delivered the other speech 22 \nyears earlier, in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn a slave in Maryland in 1815, he escaped with his father and \nother family members when he was nine years old. Quakers helped them \non their way to freedom. Eventually the fugitives settled in New \nYork, where Henry got an education. Unable to find work, he went to \nsea, despite a leg injured when he was fifteen (eventually it had to \nbe amputated at the hip). On his return from a voyage to Cuba, he \nfound that his home had been raided by slave hunters and his sister \nseized. His father escaped by leaping from an upstairs window, \nFurious, the boy bought a bowie knife and stalked the streets, bent \non revenge. Friends coaxed him to lie low. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1835, Henry had even more reason to be angry. With thirteen other \nblack students he was admitted to Noyes Academy in Canaan New \nHampshire. On July 4th, they spoke up for the abolition of slavery. \nThis angered local whites. A few weeks later, the whites dragged the \nschool house into a swamp. Although seriously ill, Henry had to flee. \nHe crossed the mountains into New York where he could take a \nsteamboat; Friends spread their coats on the deck to cushion him. He \nwas bedridden for two months.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, he was invited to study for the ministry. Even before his \nordination he began to pastor a church. Later, he became a \nPresbyterian missionary to Jamaica. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was at the Negro National Convention in Buffalo, New York in 1843, \nthat Henry made the first speech that brought him to national \nattention. He called on America's four million slaves to revolt. \"You \nhad far better all die--die immediately, than live slaves...\" he \ncried. \"If you must bleed, let it all come at once--rather die \nfreemen, than live to be the slaves.\" Slaves were not allowed to keep \nGod's laws, he taught. Therefore they must throw off the wicked \nsystem that oppressed them.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, in his second important speech, standing in the House of \nRepresentatives, Henry compared those who kept slaves to the \nPharisees whom Jesus charged with laying heavy burdens on others \nwhile refusing to lift a finger themselves. He exclaimed, \"Great God! \nI would as soon attempt to enslave Gabriel or Michael as to enslave a \nman made in the image of God, and for whom Christ died. Slavery is \nsnatching man from the high place to which he was lifted by the hand \nof God, and dragging him down to the level of the brute creation, \nwhere he is made to be the companion of the horse and the fellow of \nthe ox.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry died in Liberia in 1882, having become an advocate of \nestablishing a state of free blacks there.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nGarnet, Henry Highland. \"An Address to the Slaves of the United \nStates of America.\" http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2937t.html\u0014\nGarnet, Henry Highland. \"Discourse Delivered in the House of \nRepresentatives, 1965.\" http://www.lihistory.com/5/hspeech2.htm\u0014\nHenry Highland Garnet. \nhttp://www.africawithin.com/bios/henry_garnet.htm\u0014\nVarious other encyclopedia and internet articles.\u0014",

    "words": "February 18, 1678 \u0014\nEvery Pilgrim's Story, by John Bunyan\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel. Pilgrim made it safely to the \nCelestial City by heeding and believing that message.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan, John.

Villalva , Christian Post Reporter  May 29, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tomb of the late King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, has been \nannounced to go up for auction next month.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the cemetery may not be the most obvious place to hold an \nauction, that is precisely where Julien's Auctions will be holding \ntheir next event. Up for auction will be the former tomb of Elvis \nPresley and his mother.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crypt was the two month home of both Elvis and his mother Gladys \nin 1977, before both bodies were moved to Graceland, Presley's \nestate. According to the president of the auction, the sale is a once \nin a lifetime opportunity, although it may not be very useful until \nafter death.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just consider that if you're an ultimate fan of Elvis Presley, \nit's an opportunity,\" Darren Julien told The New York Times. \"It's \ndefinitely a conversation piece.

Winehouse \nwore the robe during her music video \"Rehab.\" A cigarette pack signed \nby the Beetles is also up for auction.\u0014\n\u0014\nElvis Presley moved to Memphis at the age of 13, where he began his \ncareer in 1954 at Sun Records.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe starting point of sale for Presley's former crypt will begin at \n$100,000 with post-life services included. One lucky bidder will not \nonly be awarded Presley's temporary death spot, but will also receive \na complimentary opening and closing of the vault and crypt for \nburial, a memorial inscription and the use of the chapel for a \ncommittal service.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe president of the auction denied that selling the tomb was \n\"morbid,\" although some users joked that the sale had them \"all shook \nup.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Evolution and Christians: 5 Questions Answered \u0014\nErnest Lucas\u0014\nPosted: Friday, June 22, 2012 6:34 am\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 1: Isn't evolution only a theory? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in everyday language \"theory\" means something uncertain and \nunproven, that is not what \"theory\" means in science.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn science it means, \"a hypothesis that has been confirmed or \nestablished by observation or experiment, and is propounded or \naccepted as accounting for the known facts,\" according to the Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scientific evidence for evolution is now very strong, especially \nfrom the newer areas of molecular biology and genetics. Evidence of \nthis is set out strongly in recent books by J.A. Coyne and D.J. \nFairbanks.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 2: Doesn't evolution contradict Genesis 1-3?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is crucial that we interpret Genesis 1-3 correctly. John Calvin, \nin 1554, recognized that these chapters should not be read for \nscientific information, \"Nothing is here treated of but the visible \nform of the world. He who would learn astronomy and other recondite \narts, let him go elsewhere.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn verses 6-8, the King James Version says that God created a \n\"firmament\" and called it \"heaven.\"\u0014\nThe translators recognized that the Hebrew word raqa used here means \nsomething solid, indeed it implies something made of beaten-out metal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is how the Hebrews thought of the sky, as is shown by Job 37:18, \nwhere it is said to be made of \"cast bronze.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGod gave the Hebrews a creation story based on the way they saw the \nworld, not to convey \"scientific\" information but to give them a true \ntheological understanding of God's purpose in creating the world, the \nnature of that world and of human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a very long Christian and Jewish tradition of understanding \nthese chapters in that way. Sometimes the story deliberately counters \nother creation stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 3: Does evolution undermine human uniqueness?\u0014\n\u0014\nBiblically, human uniqueness rests in our creation in the \"image\" of \nGod (Genesis 1:27).\u0014\nEvolution is about a purely material process that God may have used \nto bring into being the species scientists call Homo sapiens. The \ndefinition of Homo sapiens is based on observable physical \ncharacteristics.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"God is spirit\" (John 4:24) and so, presumably, is the \"image\" of God \nin humans. It is not observable in terms of physical characteristics.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not understand how the non-material aspects of our being (such \nas \"mind\") are related to the material (such as \"brain\"), though it \nis clear that there is an important link (brain injury can affect \npeople's mental and spiritual life).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, we are in no position to say when and how Homo sapiens became \nwhat John Stott called Homo divinus: creatures bearing God's image, \nwhich is what the Bible means by \"human beings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvolution has nothing to say for or against such a development.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 4: What about the fall and Adam and Eve?\u0014\n\u0014\nUncertainty about the relationship between Homo sapiens and Homo \ndivinus leaves open a number of possible ways of relating the story \nin Genesis 2 and 3 to the process of evolution.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy own speculation is that first self-consciousness, and then \nGod-consciousness, appeared as what some scientists call \"emergent \nproperties\" as the central nervous system became increasingly complex.\u0014\nOnce God-consciousness was possible, God took the initiative to \nestablish a relationship with humans, and humans were faced with the \nchoice of how they were going to live in relationship with their \ncreator.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis may have involved an initial pair of humans. Calvin's concept of \nAdam and Eve as \"federal heads\" of the human race may be helpful.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust as our solidarity in Christ, our new \"federal head,\" and his \nsalvation is something spiritual imparted by God, so human solidarity \nin Adam and his sin might be something spiritual imparted by God \nafter Adam and Eve's disobedience.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo. 5: What about death before the fall?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1839, William Buckland concluded a careful study of all relevant \nbiblical passages by saying, \"Though most clearly inflicted on man \n[death] is by no inspired writer spoken of as a penal dispensation to \nany other living creature excepting Adam and his posterity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, animal death before the fall is no problem biblically. Despite \nthe threat in Genesis 2:17, Adam did not die the moment he sinned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis indicates that biblically the most important thing about death \nafter the fall is alienation from God, not the end of physical \nexistence.\u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Dr. Ernest Lucas is vice principal and tutor in biblical studies \nat Bristol Baptist College, former biochemical researcher, with \ndoctorates in both chemistry and Old Testament studies.

Details are \nstill emerging, but eye witnesses told Open Doors in telephone \ninterviews that the attackers approached the AIC church, shot the two \npolicemen guarding the church at point blank range, took their guns \nand started shooting at worshippers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the church-goers realized what was going on, they tried to flee. \nMany were shot dead as they attempted to escape. The attackers threw \nat least four grenades into the church. At the Catholic Church the \nattackers apparently jumped over a fence and started shooting at \npeople standing near the church. Three church members were killed \nbefore the attackers fled. These brazen attacks on innocent \nChristian worshippers are horrific, says Open Doors USA \nPresident/CEO Carl Moeller. The area near the border of Somalia and \nKenya is becoming a killing field as well as a place where many aid \nworkers are being kidnapped. While attacks on churches in Nigeria \nhave held our attention over the last few months, attacks on \nChristians have increased in the Somalia/Kenya border area. Please \npray for the families of the victims. (Editor's note: some reports \nare saying only 17 people were killed in these incidents.)\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 7/3/12\u0014",

The House of \nBishops voted at the denomination's triennial General Convention in \nIndianapolis,Ind., to include \"gender identity and expression\" in its \n\"non-discrimination canons\" -- meaning sexual orientation, including \nthat of people who have undergone sex-change operations, could not be \nused to exclude candidates for lay and ordained ministry. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe resolution must now be approved by the church's House of \nDeputies.

    "words": "Steve Yeaton tells a story he discovered in Candice Millard's 2011 \nbook, Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the \nMurder of a President. When James Garfield was nominated for \npresident, the party leaders paired him with a candidate from the \nlosing faction, Chester Arthur, to be his vice-president. Garfield \nwas opposed to the spoils system, but Arthur had come up through that \nvery corrupt systema system that paid off people with government \npositions regardless of qualification. He had no experience and \ncertainly no qualifications to be vice-president; but there he was, a \nheartbeat away from the presidency. Garfield sought to end this \npractice and replace it with a system whereby people were appointed \nbased on their credentials rather than connections. Garfield was shot \nby a disgruntled office seeker who wanted Arthur to be president. \nSome wondered if Arthur might have had something to do with the \nassassination attempt. He didn't, but that didn't stop the rumors. As \nGarfield struggled to recover from the bullet wound, Arthur genuinely \nworried he might become president. He knew he was in over his head.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of it all, he began receiving letters from an invalid \nwoman he never had met by the name of Julia Sand. She wrote, \"Your \nkindest opponents say, 'Arthur will try to do right'adding \ngloomilyHe won't succeed, thoughmaking a man a president cannot \nchange him.'\" She went on, \"(M)aking a man president can change him! \nGreat emergencies awaken generous traits which have lain dormant half \na life. If there is a spark of true nobility in you, now is the \noccasion to let it shine. Faith in your better nature forces me to \nwrite to youbut not to beg you to resign. Do what is more difficult \nand more brave. Reform!\" With each letter, she urged him to be a \nbetter man than he ever could have imagined. That's what happened. \nArthur rose to the occasion, and upon Garfield's death did what \nnobody expected. He went against his own patrons and implemented the \nreform policies of Garfield. Arthur became the better man Julia Sand \nknew he could be. There are people who believe in you. Even if no one \nelse does, God does.\u0014",

Her widow says they asked \nfor three days for an abortion to ease her pain but were refused \nbecause the fetus still had a heartbeat.\u0014\n\u0014\nA coroner found that Halappanavar died from internal infections and \norgan failure three days after the fetus itself died. Her parents in \nIndia have accused Irish authorities of letting their only daughter \ndie to preserve the nation's constitutional ban on abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking to address international criticism, Ireland announced its \nfact-finding investigation would be led by Sir Sabaratnam \nArulkumaran, a Sri Lankan-born expert on maternal care who is head of \nobstetrics and gynecology at St. George's Hospital in London. He is \nalso president of the International Federation of Obstetrics and \nGynecology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHealth Minister James Reilly deflected criticism that the \nseven-member panel would be given around three months to report on \nthe medical treatment Halappanavar received at University Hospital \nGalway in western Ireland. She was placed in intensive care Oct. 24 \nwith suspected blood poisoning hours after the dead fetus was removed \nfrom her womb.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I want this carried out as expeditiously as possible but obviously \nthere's a balance to be struck with ... doing it properly,\" Reilly \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer widow, Praveen Halappanavar, on Monday thanked the Irish public \nfor its goodwill since news of his wife's death broke last week.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 10,000 people marched Saturday through Dublin beneath banners \nof Savita Halappanavar's face and the motto \"Never again,\" and a \nsimilar protest is planned for Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nReilly said the full Cabinet would discuss another \ngovernment-commissioned report this week on drafting new rules to \nexplain when life-saving abortions can be performed. Opposition \nlawmakers planned to introduce a bill Tuesday demanding immediate \nlegislation, but the government said it would reject the move as \npremature.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Europe, which previously has criticized Ireland's \nill-defined policies on providing life-saving abortions, condemned \nIreland's medical care for Halappanavar in a statement Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I consider what happened to Savita an affront to human dignity and a \nserious form of violence,\" said Tina Acketoft, chairwoman of the \ncouncil's Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The only way in which this disturbing death can be a little less \npointless is by ensuring that no more women die in Ireland from being \ndenied legal abortion,\" she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuccessive Irish governments have refused to pass legislation in \nsupport of a 1992 Supreme Court judgment that found life-saving \nabortions should be legal in Ireland. The court ruled that a \n14-year-old girl who had been raped and impregnated by a neighbor \nshould receive an abortion because she was making credible threats to \ncommit suicide if denied one. The government had blocked her plan to \ntravel to England for an abortion; the girl reportedly suffered a \nmiscarriage during the court case.\u0014",

    "title": "EIGHT HARMFUL AFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY",
    "words": "\u0014\nAfter reviewing a number of research studies, a 2012 issue of Men's \nHealth magazine summarized the following eight harmful effects of \nporn:\u0014\n\u0014\n1) It is progressive. A 1985 study found that 92 percent of boys had \nlooked at Playboy by age 15. Another study conducted over 20 years \nlater (2008) found that 74 percent of 15-year-old boys had viewed \nhighly graphic and deviant internet porn.\u0014\n\u0014\n2) It creates unrealistic expectations. A Utah University study found \nthat regular porn use creates longings and needs that are rarely met \nin real life relationships.\u0014\n\u0014\n3) It can lead to casual sex. Paul Wright, Ph.D. at Indiana \nUniversity concludes that men who regularly view pornography are more \nlikely to engage in casual sex, have multiple partners, and cheat on \ntheir spouse.\u0014\n\u0014\n4) It amplifies emotional problems. Dr. Ray Bergner, professor of \npsychology at Illinois State University, states that \"the combination \nof normal sexual desire and using sex to cope with emotional \nproblems\" creates a \"potent sexual cocktail\" which drives an even \ndeeper need to use porn to cope with emotional issues.\u0014\n\u0014\n5) It creates unhealthy sexual bonds. William Struthers, Ph.D., \nauthor of Wired for Intimacy writes, \"If you're viewing pornography, \nyour partner is the screen in front of you.\" In other words, porn \nusers are conditioning their brains to bond and attach to \npornographic images, not a real partner.\u0014\n\u0014\n6) It counterfeits true intimacy. Struthers says, \"People think porn \nis about sex. It's not. It's about intimacy. The guy who can't find a \ngirlfriend and starts looking at porn is searching for intimacy. He \nhasn't found it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n7) It disrupts real relationships. Norwegian and University of \nCalifornia studies have concluded that when only one partner is into \nporn an \"unwelcome third party\" has invaded the relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\n8) It hurts your spouse. A 2011 study in the Archives of Sexual \nbehavior found that 36 percent of women surveyed consider porn use as \nbeing unfaithful. More than 40 percent of women feel their partner's \nporn use means that she's \"not good enough.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJerry De Luca, Montreal West, Quebec; source: Elizabeth Lawson, \"Smut \nCheck,\" Men's Health (November 2012)\u0014",

    "words": "January 4, 2013    New York Times\u0014\nEscaping Slavery\u0014\n\u0014\nBy CHARLES M. BLOW \u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica has slavery on the brain these days. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere were the recent releases of the movies Lincoln (which I found \nenlightening and enjoyable) and Django Unchained (which I found a \nprofound love story with an orgy of excesses and muddled moralities). \nI guess my preferences reflect my penchant for subtlety. Sometimes a \nlittle bit of an unsettling thing goes a long way, and a lot goes too \nfar. Aside from its gratuitous goriness, Django Unchained \nreportedly used the N-word more than 100 times. Lincoln used it \nonly a handful. I dont know exactly where my threshold is, but I \nthink its well shy of the century mark. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd there was this week the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation \nProclamation, one of the most important documents in this countrys \narchives. \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this has caused me to think deeply about the long shadow of \nslavery, the legacy of that most grievous enterprise and the ways in \nwhich that poison tree continues to bear fruit. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, America has moved light-years forward from the days of \nslavery. But the idea that progress toward racial harmony would or \nshould be steady and continuous is fraying. And the pillars of the \ninstitution  the fundamental devaluation of dark skin and strained \njustifications for the unconscionable  have proved surprisingly \nresilient. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, in October, The Arkansas Times reported that Jon \nHubbard, a Republican state representative, wrote in a 2009 \nself-published book that the institution of slavery that the black \nrace has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may \nactually have been a blessing in disguise. His misguided point was \nthat for all the horrors of slavery, blacks were better off in \nAmerica than in Africa. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was a prevailing, wrongheaded, ethically empty justification for \nAmerican slavery when it was legal. \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert E. Lee wrote in 1856: The blacks are immeasurably better off \nhere than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful \ndiscipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further \ninstruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better \nthings. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in a famous 1837 speech on the Senate floor, John C. Calhoun \ndeclared: I hold that in the present state of civilization, where \ntwo races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other \nphysical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, \nthe relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, \nis, instead of an evil, a good  a positive good. \u0014\n\u0014\nLee was later appointed commander in chief of the armies of the \nSouth, and Calhoun had been vice president and became secretary of \nstate. But in November, Hubbard lost his seat; I guess thats \nprogress. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the persistence of such a ridiculous argument does not sit \nwell with me. And we should all be unsettled by the tendency of some \npeople to romanticize and empathize with the Confederacy. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Pew Research Center poll released in April 2011 found that most \nSouthern whites think its appropriate for modern-day politicians to \npraise Confederate leaders, the only demographic to believe that. \u0014\n\u0014\nA CNN poll also released that month found that nearly 4 in 10 white \nSoutherners sympathize more with the Confederacy than with the Union. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is perhaps more problematic is that negative attitudes about \nblacks are increasing. According to an October survey by The \nAssociated Press: In all, 51 percent of Americans now express \nexplicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48 percent in a similar \n2008 survey. When measured by an implicit racial attitudes test, the \nnumber of Americans with anti-black sentiments jumped to 56 percent, \nup from 49 percent during the last presidential election. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot progress. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, it feels as though slavery as an analogy has become \nsubversively chic. Herman Cain, running as a Republican presidential \ncandidate, built an entire campaign around this not-so-coded \nlanguage, saying that he had left the Democrat plantation, calling \nblacks brainwashed and arguing, I dont believe racism in this \ncountry today holds anybody back in a big way. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the best-selling author Michelle Alexander pointed out in her \nsensational 2010 book The New Jim Crow, various factors, including \nthe methodical mass incarceration of black men, has led to the \ndisintegration of the black family, the disenfranchisement of \nmillions of people, and a new and very real era of American \noppression. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs Alexander confirmed to me Friday: Today there are more \nAfrican-American adults under correctional control  in prison or \njail, on probation or parole  than were enslaved in 1850, a decade \nbefore the Civil War began. \u0014\n\u0014\nDefinitely not progress.\u0014",

    "title": "EVALUATING YOUR PASTOR'S EFFECTIVENESS",
    "words": "Can You Evaluate Your Pastor's Effectiveness? \u0014\n\u0014\nMark Tidsworth\u0014\nEthics Daily.com     January 15, 2013 m\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United Methodist denomination is the latest to make the news \nregarding its efforts to address the clergy effectiveness debate. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, they decided to do away with guaranteed appointments, then \ndecided to continue the practice. Their ambivalence simply indicates \nthat this is a tough issue, embedded within a sophisticated \ndenominational system.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, I found myself in the middle of the clergy effectiveness \nconversation while presenting at the Bishop's School of Ministry in \nSouth Carolina. The topic was just that  clergy effectiveness  \nanother indicator that denominations are giving considered attention \nto this concern.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in my work in training clergy for effective leadership, I \ndiscovered the effectiveness debate has been around a while.\u0014\n\u0014\nI distinctly remember a conversation with Dave Odom, who was the \npresident of the Center for Congregational Health at the time:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dave, just what are the standardized leadership competencies of \neffective clergy? Is there an agreed on list somewhere I could see?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe snickered and wisely responded, \"Mark, welcome to the clergy \nleadership effectiveness debate.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the complexity of congregational life, the changing \nrelationship with the church in America, the diversity in contexts of \ncongregations, and the wide variety of personality types among \nclergy, it's no wonder a comprehensive and exhaustive clergy \ncompetency list has not arisen.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo where do we go from here? Since leadership in congregations is an \nextremely relevant issue, how do we make progress on it?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, considering the images of pastoral leadership is informative. \nDuring the 1950s-1980s, the Protestant church in America enjoyed a \nrather stable and prosperous run. Culture was largely accepting, even \nsupportive, of Protestantism.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople participated in church with a variety of motivations, some \nmore noble than others.\u0014\n\u0014\nCulture and society generally smiled upon church participation. In \nthis milieu (the tail-end of the modern period), three clergy images \nflourished.\u0014\n\u0014\n? The statesman-pastor was the paragon of stability, building systems \nin the congregation while enjoying status as a community leader.\u0014\n\u0014\n? The entrepreneur-pastor often served as a new church developer or \nbrought renewal to existing congregations. This pastor led through \ninnovation and creativity, with an ability to attract others to \nsomething new.\u0014\n\u0014\n? The chaplain-pastor led through relationship building, almost \nbecoming a member of the family. This pastor specialized in walking \nwith people through the vicissitudes of their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nEach of these three images was useful and helpful in its cultural \ntime period, but anyone involved in congregational life (professional \nor laity) knows that church is different now. More specifically, the \nplace of church in society is different now.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church has moved more to the periphery, not occupying its \nprevious place at the center of community life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur stutter-steps into this postmodern period bring discontinuous \nchange and constant transition to congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat kind of pastoral leadership is effective now?\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been playing with a new pastoral image that I believe may \ncapture some of what's needed: faith community change agent.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will save my list of competencies for another time, yet I see this \npastoral leadership image synthesizing competencies from other \nprofessions into the role of pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe primary calling of faith community change agents is to help \ncongregations move through their transition to missional \neffectiveness in their postmodern context.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommunity organizer, group therapist, leadership coach, networker \nextraordinaire, social scientist. These are a few of the images that \nroll into faith community change agent.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow that we have a new image for clergy that is more context-specific \nand relevant we can begin to consider clergy effectiveness.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm eager to continue the conversation with those who are invested in \nhelping clergy live out their callings as fully and effectively as \npossible.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm eager to watch the missional outcomes as faithful faith community \nchange agents find their voices in pastoral leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Tidsworth is president of Pinnacle Leadership Associates.\u0014",

    "words": "Easter as an Earthquake Matthew 28:1-10\u0014\nBy William H. Willimon \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, \ndescending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on \nit.\" (Matthew 28:2) \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn says that they got to the tomb on Easter morning, and it's \nempty. Then, they go back home. \u0014\n\u0014\nGo back home? Reminds you of the two disciples in Luke on the way to \nEmmaus. \"Some women told us that Jesus had been raised from the dead, \nbut we had already planned to have supper over in Emmaus, so we \ncouldn't change our reservations.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA man is raised from the dead and you can't cancel lunch? How dumb \nare these disciples? \u0014\n\u0014\nSo my friend Stanley Hauerwas, in dialogue with dear Marcus Borg of \nthe errant Jesus Seminar says, \"Marcus thinks the disciples had an \nexperience. They said, 'Wasn't it great being with Jesus before they \nkilled Him? You remember those great stories He told? The lectures, \ner, sermons? Just thinking about it makes Him seem almost still here. \nYep, by God, He is still here. Let's all close our eyes and believe \nreal hard that He's still here. Okay?'\" \u0014\nHey, Jesus Seminar, the disciples weren't that creative! These were \nnot imaginative minds we're dealing with here. They were the sort of \npeople who could see an empty tomb and not let it spoil lunch. You \ndon't get an idea like the bodily resurrection of Jesus out of people \nwith brains like Simon Peter's. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, the disciples were people like us. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople like us are the sort or folk who like to believe that you can \nhave resurrection and still have the world as it was yesterday. We \nwant to have Easter and still have our world unrocked by \nresurrection. We are amazingly well adjusted to the same old world. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think that's why Matthew says that when there was Easter, the whole \nearth shook. Luke does Easter as a meal on Sunday evening with the \nRisen Christ. John has resurrected Jesus encounter Mary Magdalene in \nthe garden. But Matthew? Easter is an earthquake with doors shaken \noff tombs and dead people walking the streets, the stone rolled away \nby the ruckus and an imprudent angel sitting on it. \u0014\n\u0014\nI've been in an earthquake, even though I'm not from L.A. I was \npreaching in Alaska and during my sermon, the earth heaved a moment \nthat seemed forever. The little church shook. The Alaskan Methodist \n\"How about that, the light fixtures didn't fall this time.\" I ended \nmy sermon immediately. I was shaken by the earthquake, but also a bit \nshaken by those nonchalant Alaskans. Afterwards (at lunch!) I asked \nthe pastor, \"What the heck would it take to get this congregation's \nattention? I'd hate to have to preach to them every Sunday.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew says Easter is an earthquake that shook the whole world. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe modern types try to \"explain\" the resurrection. One says that \nJesus was in a deep, drugged coma and woke up. Another said that the \ndisciples got all worked up in their grief and just fantasized the \nwhole thing. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou can't \"explain\" a resurrection. Resurrection explains us. The \ntruth of Jesus tells on the faces of the befuddled disciples who \nwitnessed it. Not one of them expected, wanted Easter. Death, defeat, \nwhile regrettable, are utterly explainable.\u0014",

I am assuming that it is a \nhighly symbolic interpretation of the meaning of human history.

The understanding he is given is quite \nprofound. On the one hand, he is shown that there is an unchanging \nreality to which all other things relate. That is represented by God, \nwho is seated on a throne in royal splendor surrounded by \nrepresentations of all powers. That is the one who ultimately rules \nall things. On the other hand, there is human history that is an open \nand ongoing drama that is being played out in the interaction of all \nof the forces God has set free on the earth. Even though the end of \nthe drama (the telos) is in the hands of God, the processes by which \nit will be achieved will have to be worked out through the \ninteraction of the forces of love and the forces of hate in the \nworld. The history that is about to unfold is symbolized by the \nscroll with seven seals. As the book of Revelation progresses it will \ndescribe human history in terms of symbolic images, representing \nfirst oppression, then conflict, and finally victory for God's good \npurpose for humankind. (The book of Revelation is very realistic in \nits analysis of history.) But in order for this history to begin to \nunfold, someone must break the seals and open the scroll.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone of the powers present in \"heaven\" is found to be qualified or \nworthy to open the scroll. But there is one there who is like a lamb \nthat has been slaughtered, one who represents the Christ, who has \nhimself entered human history, offered the possibility of love, and \nendured the reaction of hate. He is found worthy to open the scroll \nand allow human history to unfold toward its end. In a sense, the \nopening of the scroll is like someone who is able saying \"Game on\" \nfor the unfolding of human history. And all of the realities \nrepresented by the host of heaven join in a great cheer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Killen\u0014",

Five or six years earlier, Alice Uden \nshot her husband, Richard Holtz, in the back of a head with a .22 \nwhile he slept  then wrapped the body in a blanket, stuffed it in a \nbarrel and dropped it into a mine shaft, the authorities said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe shaft was excavated in August, and investigators found Holtzs \nbody 40 feet below the earth, according to the affidavit.

Abusers will get sent home and might join another \nagency. Of known data from abuse cases, 25 percent are repeat cases, \nhe said.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, he says, he sees some positive movements among some \nProtestants. Bob Jones University has hired GRACE to investigate \nabuse allegations, a move that encourages Tchividjian, a former \nFlorida prosecutor. Thats like the mothership of fundamentalism, \nhe said. His grandfather split with Bob Jones in a fundamentalist and \nevangelical division.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Protestant culture is defined by independence, Tchividjian \nsaid. Evangelicals often frown upon transparency and accountability, \nhe said, as many Protestants rely on Scripture more than religious \nleaders, compared to Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbusers discourage whistle-blowing by condemning gossip to try to \nkeep people from reporting abuse, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 10/2/13\u0014",

    "title": "ELECTION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT",
    "words": "ELECTION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT \u0014\n\u0014\n Election is the operative principIe of God's covenant with Israel \nThe background for the doc- \u0014\ntrine of election in the NT is the OT. \u0014\n\u0014\nOld Testament Background_ In the OT \"election\" relates directly to \nIsrael's understanding of its \u0014\nown origins, Election signifies the meaning and expression of \nIsrael's destiny: God's giving of \u0014\nHimself to be their God and His selection of them to be His people. \nWith this election they will \u0014\nknow the blessing of His abiding presence. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn nonreligious biblical usage, election indicates the \"choice\" of an \nindividual person, place, or \u0014\nthing out of a wide selection. When pertaining to persons, election \npoints to their selection \u0014\nfor or appointment to an office (see Gen 13:11; Exod 18:25; 1 Sam \n8:18)_ Thus there call also \u0014\nbe a passive use of the word elected, which often indicates the great \nworth and usefulness \u0014\nof something or someone. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheologically, election signifies God's selecting His people from the \nnations to be holy and whol- \u0014\nly for Himself. They have .been chosen to be His inheritance (see \nDeut 7:6; 10:5).  Outside of \u0014\nDeuteronomy, \"election\" is used frequently by Isaiah: \"You are My \nServant, I have chosen you \u0014\nand have not rejected you; fear not\" (Isa 41:9)_ The object of God's \nchoice, the Servant of \u0014\nGod, names him \"Chosen.\" But the idea here is much more one of office \nrather than personal \u0014\ncondition to which God's servant is called.\u0014\n \u0014\nWithin the elected community God chose individuals for. specific \nduties {for example, see Deut \u0014\n18:5, the Levites; Ps 105:26, Aaron} and in an extended sense Judah \n(Ps 78:68) and Abraham (Neh 9:7).\u0014\n \u0014\nThe election of the king is special in this regard (Deut 17:15). \nAbove all, David was elected by the Lord (I Sam 10:24). Also \naccording to Deuteronomy and other related OT literature, God elects \nthe place for the holy of holies [Deut 12:18)-particularly Jerusalem \n(1 Chron 6:6; Zeph 1:17).\u0014\n \u0014\nNew Testament Teaching. In the NT election has several different \nusages that correspond to the usages of the OT. Jesus chose the \ntwelve from the group of His disciples (Luke 6:13) and told them that \nHe had chosen them \"out of the world\" (John 15:19}. \u0014\n\u0014\nElection is entirely a work of God. He claims persons for Himself and \nHis own purpose: this is His glory, Indeed, our knowledge of election \nalways comes as an already accomplished fact \"He chose us in Christ \nbefore the foundation of the world\" (Eph 1:4) and \"the elect whom he \nchose\" (Matt 13:20) indicate that election is an action of God -prior \nto and independent of any human action or condition. Through the \nmeans of God's gracious election, He actually bestows all spirttuaJ \nblessings that \u0014\naccompany salvation (see Eph 1:4-l4). \u0014\n\u0014\nCharacteristically, however, the NT teaching of election is always \ndescriptive and never discloses God's reasoning behind his action. \nOne fact is unmistakable: the mystery of God surrounds this gracious \nexpression of His almighty will. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere the NT indicates a basis for election, grace and love are \nmentioned to the exclusion of any righteous works or superior value \nof an individual. Faith is the means by which God's worK of election \nis made known. A most serious and holy consequence is connected with \nthe knowledge of election: the renunciation of all pride and the \npursuit of a righteous and holy life before the Lord.\u0014\n \u0014\nFaith matures in the knowledge of election, and every Christian \nvirtue flourishes (Col 3:12). This understanding certainly supplies \nbelievers with confidence in the promise of the sanctifying power of \nthe Holy Spirit (l Pet 1 :2). Obedience to all of Christ's commands \nserves to confirm election (2 Pet 1:10). This knowledge builds within \nthe believer an understanding of a shared faith within a large \ncommunity of spiritual people of God. \u0014\n\u0014\nPersonal security in salvation is also an outcome. But this is based \nupon the fact, first of all, of God's securing a people for Himself \nwho will be living witnesses of His electing grace to the whole \nworld. Election then is that will and action of God to call \nundeserving persons TO share in His glory. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe should note finaliy the most special case of election, that of \nJesus, the Son of God (Luke 9:35). This designation of Christ seems \nto relate to the fact that believers are elect through Him; and \nremaining \"in Christ,\" they enjoy every spiritual blessing (Eph 1:3).\u0014",

    "title": "ELEVEN OF THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES CHURCH MAKE",
    "words": "Eleven of the Most Common Mistakes \nChurches Make\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\tFailure to have a informative, easy-to-use website. I cringe when \nI see some churches' websites. That is now the first place a \nprospective guest visits when he or she is thinking about attending a \nchurch. Websites are incredibly affordable today, and they can be \nupdated easily. A church website should be updated at least once a \nweek. It should be one of high quality. And it should contain good \nand accurate information for guests and members alike.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.\tFailure of pastors and staff to be actively involved in social \nmedia. That is analogous to a missionary in another land failing to \nlearn how to speak the language of the people.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.\tFailure of pastors and staff to understand they represent the \nchurch when they are involved in social media. When I see some of the \nblog posts and Twitter and Facebook communication of pastors and \nstaff, I am often left speechless. Even if it is a personal blog or \nTwitter or Facebook account (or almost a dozen other social media \nentrants), church members read them. The community reads them. \nPastors and staff: you represent yourself, your church, and, most \nimportantly, Christ. Please be careful with your words.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.\tFailure to urge people to be a part of groups. Groups are key to \nhealthy assimilation, ministry involvement, evangelistic \nintentionality, biblical accountability, and community connections. \nChurch leaders should regularly encourage members and others to get \ninvolved in a small group, home group, Sunday school class, or some \nother ongoing group.\u0014\n\u0014\n5.\tFailure of leaders to be actively involved in influencing the \ncontent of groups. Can you imagine a pastor asking a random person to \npreach on Sunday morning without any idea what that person would say? \nThat's how many leaders treat their groups. Some have no idea what is \nbeing taught, studied, and discussed.\u0014\n\u0014\n6.\tFailure of church members to be considerate of where they sit \nduring a worship service. I can't tell you how many guests told me \nthey had to climb over church members who arrived early and got an \naisle seat. I can't tell you how many left no room for others because \nthey used space for their coats, Bibles, smartphones, and other items.\u0014\n\u0014\n7.\tFailure to have parking lot greeters. This ministry is a church's \nopportunity to make a positive first impression. However, most \nchurches do not have parking lot greeters.\u0014\n\u0014\n8.\tFailure to have clearly marked guest parking. Most churches have \nguest parking places. The problem is most guests can't find them.\u0014\n\u0014\n9.\tFailure to have clearly marked entrances to the worship center. \nAsk a person who has never attended your church to do so. Then ask \nthem how difficult it was to find the worship center. Because we know \nour own church well, we often don't comprehend the challenges a first \ntime guest may have.\u0014\n\u0014\n10.\tFailure to have clearly marked entrances to the church offices. \nThis issue is, of course, more of a problem during weekdays.\u0014\n\u0014\n11.\tFailure to have adequate restroom facilities. There should be an \nadequate number of restrooms. They should be clean. And guests should \nsee clearly marked signs that tell them how to find them.\u0014\nTom Rainer blog, 2/10/14\u0014",

    "title": "ENDURING SUFFERING WITHOUT LOSING HOPE",
    "words": "Tim Keller on Enduring Suffering Without Losing Hope\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy Christianity has the best answer to the pain that life brings.\u0014\nBook Review by Gerald L. Sittser   1/8/2014  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nSuffering can make even secure and mature Christians wonder: How can \nI believe that God is good, that he is with me and for me? It is by \nno means certain that suffering people will find comfort in \nChristianity. Some Christians even choose to reject their faith after \nthey have suffered. Having experienced severe losses myself and \nwritten about them at length, I was curious to learn how Timothy \nKeller's latest book would handle this difficult subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it turns out, Walking with God through Pain and Suffering (Dutton) \nadopts a surprisingly broad perspective. The book is at turns \napologetic, theological, and pastoral. As an apologist, Keller, \nfounding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, \nexplains how other religions and philosophies address and answer the \nproblem of evil and suffering. After exploring these options \n(Stoicism, Buddhism, and several others), he demonstrates \nconvincingly that the Christian answer is both more intellectually \nsatisfying and personally helpful. But, he adds, it must be the \ngenuine Christian answer rather than some insipid and superficial \nexpression of Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is only in the past 200 years, Keller argues, that Westerners have \nused evil and suffering as an argument against the existence (or \ngoodness) of God. He is especially critical of the modern and secular \nview of suffering, which places all confidence in human reason and \nassumes that God, if he exists at all, exists solely to make us \nhappy. This view helps explain why so many people avoid suffering at \nall costs, do their best to manage and minimize it once it interrupts \ntheir lives, and often yield to utter hopelessness when it persists. \nIn the end, a secular view leaves us empty and alone, stripped of \nanswers, devoid of all comfort and confidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian answer to suffering, on the other hand, is more \nconsistent, complete, and humane than any of the alternatives. It is \nattentive to human emotions. It views God as both sovereign and \nsuffering. It alone satisfies the human longing for meaning and \nsignificance. And it is by far the most hopeful. Keller sums up the \nChristian perspective with the metaphor of a furnace. The flames of \nsuffering consume our sinful inclinations, and yes, this is painful. \nBut this purification process makes us holy, provided we turn to the \nGod who reveals himself as both transcendent and present, Victor and \nVictim, Lord and Servant.\u0014\n\u0014\nPathway through the Valley\u0014\n\u0014\nAt certain points, Keller appears to move from the lectern to the \npulpit. As a theologian and preacher, he provides a thorough, \nbalanced, and nuanced view of suffering from a biblical perspective. \nOn some occasions, suffering manifests God's judgment on all sin (our \nexpulsion from the Garden) or punishment for individual sin (David's \nadultery). On other occasions, its causes appear random and unfair \n(the anguish of Job).\u0014\n\u0014\nKeller is cautious about sweeping statements that imply a single \nanswer for every circumstance. Drawing from Scripture, he shows that \nthere are varieties of suffering: some our own fault, some the result \nof betrayal and loss, and some utterly mysterious. And he asserts \nthat no two people respond to suffering the same way. Some grow \nangry; others fall into depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, we can know this with certainty: All people suffer, but \nGod has provided a pathway through it in Jesus Christ. On the cross, \nJesus' suffering defeats suffering and turns evil back on itself, \nprecipitating its destruction. He opens the way for us to regain \nfellowship with God and share in his glory.\u0014\n\u0014\nKeller offers sage counsel to lead us through the valley of the \nshadow of death. Here, the preacher leaves the pulpit and joins us in \nthe living room. He sets a realistic and practical course of action. \n\"We are to meet and move through suffering without shock and \nsurprise, without denial of our sorrow and weakness, without \nresentment or paralyzing fear, yet also without acquiescence or \ncapitulation, without surrender or despair.\"\u0014",

Ignorance of history leads to distortions of the past.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe miracle in Philadelphia occurred because the Founders met to \nstrengthen central authority. The Articles of Confederation failed \nbecause there was a void at the center. The Founders may have \nembraced checks and balances, but they gave the federal government \nmore powers than had appeared possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, the Constitutions preamble settles the debate  We the \npeople of the United States.

But according to the June 9 \nfiling, the man was privately baptized in December 2012, a few weeks \nbefore making a regular trip to Damascus. He had repeatedly asked for \nthe baptism to be done privately for his safety, and he alleges that \nhe secured a promise from First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa to keep \nthe baptism private. But a few days after arriving in Syria, the \nOklahoma church allegedly published an announcement on its website \nthat he had been baptized.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon after the news of his baptism went online, the convert alleges \nthat he was beaten by Muslim extremists in Damascus, who told him \nthey had read about his baptism on the internet. Even after denying \nhis conversion, the man was held captive and tortured for days before \nhe managed to escape and return to the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawsuit claims that a murder sentence exists against the convert \nin Syria, where his son still lives and his business and possessions \nare now forfeit. The convert, who has permanent resident status but \nis not yet a U.S. citizen, is asking for $75,000 in retribution from \nthe church that allegedly inadvertently prompted his persecution.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Defendants were either grossly negligent or deliberately \nindifferent to Plaintiff's safety by publicizing his baptism and \nconversion to Christianity,\" states the lawsuit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We understand the skepticism toward the claim,\" attorney Keith Ward \ntold Tulsa World, \"but his injuries and all the allegations are well \ndocumented.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I cannot share more details with you because this is a matter in \nlitigation,\" pastor James D.

Eliza Hewitt may have \nwondered that.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliza was born on this day, June 28, 1851 in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. Educated in the local school system, she graduated as \nvaledictorian of the Girl's Normal School that she attended. She \nbecame a teacher in the public schools of her city.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then came misery. Her career screeched to a halt when she was \nforced to bed with a painful spinal problem. (One of her descendants \nhas contacted us and said her debilitating condition was caused by an \nreckless student striking her with a piece of slate.) Lying in bed, \nshe could have been bitter. Instead, she studied English literature \nand began to sing and write:\u0014\n\u0014\nSing the wondrous love of Jesus; sing his mercy and his grace. \u0014\nIn the mansions bright and blessed he'll prepare for us a place.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of her lines came into the hands of Professor John R. Sweney. He \nwrote her asking for more, and set a few of her songs to music, \nincluding one of the better known: \"Will there be any Stars in My \nCrown?\" He and William J. Kirkpatrick published her first hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe remember Eliza Hewitt today because of those hymns. Had she never \nbeen bed-ridden, she might not have written them. Among the best \nknown are, \"Give Me Thy Heart, Says the Father Above,\" \"When We All \nGet to Heaven,\" \"Sunshine in My Soul,\" \"Will there be any Stars in My \nCrown?\" and \"More About Jesus Would I Know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLater Eliza's well-being improved, although she suffered \nre-occurrences for the rest of her life. Despite her health problems, \nshe was deeply interested in Sunday school work, and superintended a \nSunday school for the Northern Home for Friendless Children.

    "words": "By David M. Stanwick \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not a documentary, but I would say it is fairly accurate \nportrayal of events surrounding the life of Frank Morris at Alcatraz, \nat least a far as anyone could know.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, it's a bit slow, but remember these men were locked up in their \nindividual cells 16 to 23 hours a day (depending upon whether they \nhad a prison job or not) -- not a lot happens in a average day.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe film concludes emphasizing that Frank and the Anglin brothers \nwere never caught, and their bodies never found, and notes the \nwarden's quick declaration that they drowned. The movie, in my \ninterpretation, implies that the escape must have been successful.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, it is far more likely that they drowned. The plan was for \nthe men to swim to Marin County via Angel Island, break into a \nclothing store in Tiburon to change out of their prison clothes, and \nsteal a car to get out of the area. No such crimes were committed in \nthe days or weeks following the escape. Furthermore, the Morris and \nAnglin families were never contacted by the escapees, something that \nwould seem likely in the weeks, months, or years since.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother interesting fact is that a man (Seymour Webb) committed \nsuicide, in front of numerous witnesses, off the Golden Gate Bridge \non the very night of the escape and during the same window of time -- \nhis body was never found either, despite very quick attempts by the \nCoast Guard to rescue him. (The tidal currents can be very strong in \nSan Francisco Bay.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been at least one Alcatraz escapee (Floyd Hamilton) who was \ndeclared drowned but found alive two days after his escape when he \nreturned to the prison (starving and cold) after hiding in a cave \nalong the shore.\u0014",

Who's \nYours? \u0014\nGriff Martin\u0014\nOctober 20, 2014  EthicsDaily.com \u0014\n\u0014\nMy best friend was married two years ago, and I had the honor of \ndelivering the homily. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it came time to the rehearsal dinner speech, I spoke \"off the \ncuff,\" ending my speech by saying, \"I thought that when one grew up, \na best friend was no longer part of your life. However, you have \ntaught me that a best friend continues to be one of the most \nimportant elements of your life by being mine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA man walked over after dinner and asked if I was a preacher. When I \nsaid, \"yes,\" he took my arm and said, \"I hope you preach the toast \nyou made tonight. People need to know about friendship today; people \ndon't have best friends, and that is a real problem in our world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI thought about his comment and began to see how true his words were. \nAlthough we have more ways to connect than ever before, we have built \nislands of isolation and many people are very lonely.\u0014\n\u0014\nI started asking members in my congregation about their best friends. \nMany said something like, \"I have not talked to my high school best \nfriend in years now.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe consensus was that there are a lot of adults walking around in \nour world who don't have a best friend.\u0014\n\u0014\nI eventually preached a sermon on friendship and focused on how my \nbest friend offered me continual salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was not a great sermon, but it was honest and it generated more \nfeedback than any sermon I have preached this year.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaving church that morning, one of my oldest members stopped me with \ntears rolling down his checks and said, \"I buried my friend a few \ndays ago, and it's been really hard to grieve losing a best friend in \na world that does not understand that. Thanks for creating that space \nand giving those words to me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA young mother walked by with tears in her eyes and said, \"That is \nwhat is missing in my life. I need a friend like that.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can one journey through life without a friend? How can ministers \npreach sermons trying to get communities of faith to follow Christ if \nthey are on a solo journey? How is life even possible without the \ncommunity of close and intimate friendships?\u0014\n\u0014\nClose friendship provides us a place to be authentically ourselves as \nwell as a space to practice hospitality and inclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriendship allows us to be honest about our doubts, gives us light in \nour darkest hours, provides foundations for ministry, and models what \ntrue, authentic and good lives looks like.\u0014\n\u0014\nA mentor once told me that on the ministry journey I was choosing, I \nwas going to need a best friend and I needed to name that and work on \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nI took his words to heart, and I think this advice is true for us \nall, no matter what our vocation might be.\u0014\n\u0014\nEstablishing and strengthening friendships take time and effort, as \nin any relationship. Yet, we work on the things that are most \nimportant in our lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I make it a point to have regular conversations with my best \nfriend. We arrange our schedules so that even though we live in \ndifferent states, we see one another on a regular basis and are able \nto share all of life that we can with one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am as blessed by this friendship as any other sacrament in my life. \nAnd that should not be surprising. History and theology prove how \nimportant friendship is.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorical examples, such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, John \nSteinbeck and Ed Ricketts, Harper and Alice Lee, and St. Francis and \nSt. Claire, come to mind. In the Bible, we find David and Jonathan, \nJames and John, and Paul and Timothy, to name a few.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's time for Christians to reclaim the importance of friendship, and \nnot the kind that we form through Facebook or other social media \nplatforms.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo see the importance of friendship is to acknowledge one of the \ndeepest and most sacred places in our lives. To work to create \nfriendships is to find expressions of salvation and grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nHopefully, Christians can begin to bring an end to a world where it \nseems an odd confession for someone beyond grade school to stand up \nand say, \"I have a best friend.\" But instead to create a world where \nfriendship is the norm.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue salvation and Christ-following demand no less.\u0014\n\u0002Griff Martin is co-pastor of University Baptist Church in Baton \nRouge, Louisiana.\u0014",

Consider this true story. In \nAugust of 2010, communications specialist Judy Rivers went to her \nlocal bank to open a new account. As the clerk input Rivers' personal \ninformation, everything seemed to be going smoothly, but then the \nwoman behind the desk stopped abruptly and frowned.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's odd,\" she said. \"There seems to be an issue regarding your \nSocial Security number.\" With a skeptical glance, the employee rose \nand disappeared in the back room; several minutes later, Rivers was \ngreeted by the branch manager. \"Ma'am,\" the woman pronounced, \nbrandishing a folded paper, \"your Social Security number was \ndeactivated in 2008 due to death.\" Incredulous, Rivers rose from her \nchair. \"You're trying to tell me I've been dead for two years,\" she \nstammered, \"and no one bothered to tell me?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nRivers' plight as a categorized deceased person is not singular: it \nis estimated that every year, some 12,200 U.S. citizens are declared \ndead by the Social Security Administration due to \"keystroke errors.\" \nIn 2011, the Office of the Inspector General conducted an audit of \nthe Death Master File, and found that, from May 2007 to April 2010, \n36,657 people had been added to the master file, making them legally \ndead. Those affected become like the walking dead, unable to secure a \njob, make financial transactions, file taxes, or visit the doctor, \nand for months on end, must endure the nightmare of convincing a \nlarge bureaucracy that they haven't yet bit the dust.\u0014",

Wouldn't you like to be \nable to have a comeback like that at times? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then \nasks one of his new students to stand. \u0014\n\u0014\n'You're a Christian, aren't you, son?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes sir,' the student says. \u0014\n\u0014\n'So you believe in God?'\u0014\n\u0014\n'Absolutely. ' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Is God good?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Sure! God's good.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Are you good or evil?'\u0014\n\u0014\n'The Bible says I'm evil.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor grins knowingly. 'Aha! The Bible! He considers for a \nmoment. 'Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over \nhere and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would \nyou try?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes sir, I would.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'So you're good...!' \u0014\n\u0014\n'I wouldn't say that.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you \ncould. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student does not answer, so the professor continues. 'He doesn't, \ndoes he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though \nhe prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Can you \nanswer that one?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student remains silent. 'No, you can't, can you?' the professor \nsays. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the \nstudent time to relax. 'Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Er..yes,' the student says. \u0014\n\u0014\n'Is Satan good?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student doesn't hesitate on this one. 'No.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Then where does Satan come from?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student falters. 'From God' \u0014\n\u0014\n'That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil \nin this world?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes, sir..' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes' \u0014\n\u0014\n'So who created evil?' The professor continued, 'If God created \neverything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according \nto the principle that our works define who we are, then God is evil.' \nAgain, the student has no answer. 'Is there sickness? Immorality? \nHatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things, do they exist in this \nworld?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student squirms on his feet. 'Yes.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'So who created them?' The student does not answer again, so the \nprofessor repeats his question. 'Who created them?' There is still no \nanswer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the \nclassroom. The class is mesmerized. 'Tell me,' he continues onto \nanother student. 'Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student's voice betrays him and cracks. 'Yes, professor, I do.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe old man stops pacing. 'Science says you have five senses you use \nto identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen \nJesus?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'No sir. I've never seen Him.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'No, sir, I have not..' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your \nJesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or \nGod for that matter?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yet you still believe in him?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes' \u0014\n\u0014\n'According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable \nprotocol, science says your God doesn't exist... What do you say to \nthat, son?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Nothing,' the student replies.. 'I only have my faith.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes, faith,' the professor repeats. 'And that is the problem science \nhas with God. There is no evidence, only faith.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of \nHis own. 'Professor, is there such thing as heat?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes. \u0014\n\u0014\n'And is there such a thing as cold?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes, son, there's cold too.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'No sir, there isn't.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The \nroom suddenly becomes s very quiet. The student begins to explain. \n'You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, \nunlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't \nhave anything called 'cold'. We can hit down to 458 degrees below \nzero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There \nis no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder \nthan the lowest -458 degrees. Everybody or object is susceptible to \nstudy when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body \nor matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the \ntotal absence of heat. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to \ndescribe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can \nmeasure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the \nopposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.' \u0014\n\u0014\nSilence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, \nsounding like a hammer. \u0014\n\u0014\n'What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes,' the professor replies without hesitation.. 'What is night if \nit isn't darkness?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the \nabsence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright \nlight, flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have \nnothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use \nto define the word. In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would \nbe able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This \nwill be a good semester. 'So what point are you making, young man?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to \nstart with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. 'Flawed? Can \nyou explain how?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'You are working on the premise of duality,' the student explains.. \n'You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and \na bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, \nsomething we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less \nfully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is \nto be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive \nthing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Now tell me, professor.. Do you teach your students that they \nevolved from a monkey?' \u0014\n\u0014\n'If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, \nyes, of course I do.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes \nwhere the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed. \u0014\n\u0014\n'Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and \ncannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you \nnot teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a \npreacher?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the \ncommotion has subsided. 'To continue the point you were making \nearlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I \nmean.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe student looks around the room. 'Is there anyone in the class who \nhas ever seen the professor's brain?' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe class breaks out into laughter. 'Is there anyone here who has \never heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched \nor smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, \naccording to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable \nprotocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, \nsir.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your \nlectures, sir?' \u0014\n\u0014\nNow the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his \nface unreadable. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man \nanswers. 'I Guess you'll have to take them on faith.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with \nlife,' the student continues. 'Now, sir, is there such a thing as \nevil?' \u0014\n\u0014\nNow uncertain, the professor responds, 'Of course, there is. We see \nit Every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. \nIt is in The multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. \nThese manifestations are nothing else but evil.' \u0014\n\u0014\nTo this the student replied, 'Evil does not exist sir, or at least it \ndoes not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is \njust like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe \nthe absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of \nwhat happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. \nIt's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness \nthat comes when there is no light.' \u0014\n\u0014\nThe professor sat down. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you read it all the way through and had a smile on your face when \nyou finished, mail to your friends and family. \u0014\n\u0014\nPS: The student was Albert Einstein Albert Einstein wrote a book \ntitled God vs. Science in 1921...\u0014",

    "words": "Elizabeth Dirks Drowned as Anabaptist\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Dirks was a trailblazer and a woman of great courage. \nRaised in a nunnery in East Friesland, she learned to read Latin and \nread the Bible through and through. She became certain that \nmonasticism was not the way taught in Scripture. With the help of \nmilkmaids she escaped and became a follower of peaceful Menno Simons. \nShe was one of the first Reformation women ministers, probably a \ndeaconness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1549, Catholic authorities arrested her. When they found her Bible \nthey knew they had the person they were looking for. Mistakenly, they \nthought she was the wife of Menno Simons. When they tried to get her \nto take an oath at her interrogation, she refused, saying Christ had \ntaught that our yes should mean yes and our no mean no.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe record of her inquisition shows that the examiners asked her to \ninform on those whom she had taught. Knowing that this would lead to \ntheir arrest, she refused.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, my Lords, do not press me on this point. Ask me about my faith \nand I will answer you gladly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We will make it so tough that you will tell us,\" they threatened.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she would not reveal who had baptized her or whom she had \ntaught, they questioned her beliefs. She insisted that church \nbuildings were not the house of God, for our bodies are the temple of \nthe Holy Spirit. She denied that the New Testament spoke of the bread \nand wine as a sacrament but rather as the Lord's Supper. Asked if she \nwere saved by baptism, she replied, \"No, my Lords. All the water in \nthe sea cannot save me. All my salvation is in Christ, who has \ncommanded me love the Lord, my God, and my neighbor as myself.\" She \ndenied that priests have authority to forgive sins--only Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill refusing to reveal who had baptized her, she was taken to the \ntorture chamber and said, \"So far we have treated you gently. Since \nyou won't confess, we will put you to the torture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA man named Mr. Hans applied screws to a thumb and fingers until \nblood spurted from under her fingernails. Still she wouldn't give \naway her friends, but her agony was so great that she cried aloud to \nChrist and received relief. So they lifted her skirt to apply torture \nto her shins. She pleaded that she had never allowed anyone to touch \nher body and they promised to respect her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they crushed her leg bones with screws until she fainted. The \nmen thought she was dead, but she came to and assured them she was \nnot. Realizing that they could get nothing out of her, the \nauthorities condemned her to die. Rather than burn her, as was \ncustomary, they tied her in a bag and drowned her on this day, March \n27, 1549.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "EDGAR ALLEN POE'S FIRST AND LAST LOST",
    "words": "In one of the last letters he would ever write, Edgar Poe told his \naunt, Maria Clemm, I think [Elmira] loves me more devotedly than any \none I ever knew & I cannot help loving her in return. In the same \nnote, he spoke of his desire to marry Elmira, the woman to whom he \nhad been engaged twenty two years earlier and who had inspired a \nnumber of his poems written during those two decades. \u0014\n\u0014\nElmira was Sarah Elmira Royster Shelton, one of the people who had \nthe greatest influence on Poes life and work. When their first \nengagement was broken by her father, the eighteen-year-old Poe wrote \nabout his sense of loss in poems including Tamerlane, Song, and \nTo Elmira. Even Poes brother, William Henry Leonard Poe, wrote a \nshort story about the doomed romance. A few critics also believe both \nPoes poem To One in Paradise and his 1848 version of To Helen \ndescribe the garden Poe and Elmira used to hide from her disapproving \nparents during their courtship. Years later, after a \ntwenty-seven-year-old Poe encountered a married Elmira Shelton at a \nRichmond party, he wrote To Zante about the experience. The poems \nrefrain of No more! foreshadowed the famous refrain of Nevermore, \nwhich would be published eight years later. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the age of forty, when Poe renewed his engagement to the widowed \nShelton, he may have told her she was his Lost Lenore, but it is \nunlikely that he had actually written The Raven about her. He may \neven have told her Annabel Lee had been written about her for there \nare echoes of their first courtship in such lines as She was a \nchild, and I was a child But other women may also have claims to \ninspiring the poem (if it was, in fact, based on any person in \nparticular). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe significance of Annabel Lee to their relationship may, however, \nbe reflected in the account of his desire to have it published for \nthe first time with their wedding announcement in the local papers. \nSince Poe died just ten days before they would have been married, the \npoem was instead first printed at the end of his obituary written by \nRufus Griswold in the New York Daily Tribune (although Poe had \nactually sold it to his John Sartains Union Magazine). As Poe lay \ndying in a Baltimore hospital, he repeatedly told his physician he \nhad a wife in Richmond to whom he needed to return. Though the \nmarriage had not yet taken place, Poes wife might have been Elmira \nShelton.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon hearing word of Poes death, Shelton wrote to Poes aunt Maria \nClemm, that he had been the dearest object on earth. Shelton then \nwrote Poes attending physician John J. Moran, Mr. Poe was more to \nme than any other living being and expressing her desire to know \neverything about Poes final days. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn her remaining years, Shelton spoke little of Poe and refused to \ncooperate with Poes biographers when they requested interviews. One \nof Sheltons granddaughters, who lived with her, later claimed to \nknow nothing of Poes relationship with her grandmother until around \n1876, probably when she read about it in one of Poes biographies. In \nan 1875 interview with Richmond sculptor and historian Edward V. \nValentine, Shelton, likely embarrassed by her connection with such an \ninfamous figure as Poe (whose first biography had portrayed him as a \ndrunken madman in an attempt to impugn Poes character), went so far \nas to deny she had actually been engaged to Poe in 1849, but this is \ncontradicted by one of Sheltons own letters written to Maria Clemm \non September 22, 1849 in which Shelton clearly implies she is engaged \nto Poe. The newspapers at the time also reported that It was \nuniversally reported that he was engaged to be married. The lady was \na widow, of wealth and beauty, who was an old flame of his, and whom \nhe declared to be the ideal and original of his Lenore. (John M. \nDaniel. Richmond Semi-Weekly Examiner. October 12, 1849). When \nShelton finally granted John Moran an interview for his book A \nDefense of Edgar Allan Poe (1885), she verified that she had indeed \nbeen engaged to Poe. In the same book, Moran repeatedly refers to \nShelton as [Poes] Annabel Lee, further spreading the rumor that \nPoe had written the poem about her. After Sheltons death in 1888, \nher obituary in the Richmond Whig bore the headline Poes First and \nLast Love.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince Shelton was so reluctant to speak about Poe, many of the facts \nof their relationship remain secret, and what has come to light is \noften a mixture of legend and truth. It is known that Shelton kept as \nsouvenirs of the author a daguerreotype of Poe (known today as the \nTraylor Daguerreotype), a mother-of-pearl purse, a locket \ncontaining Poes hair, a drawing Poe made of her as a teenager, and \nan albumen print photograph of Poe. The latter was printed decades \nafter Poes death. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Poe Museum opened in 1922, Sheltons great granddaughter, \nMrs. Elsie W. Pearson, was one of its founding members and later left \nSheltons daguerreotype, eyeglasses, and photograph of Poe to the \nmuseum. Other Shelton descendants, Thomas and William Cobb, also \ndonated Shelton family items to the Poe Museum, continuing the \ntradition of Shelton family support of the museum. Visitors to the \nmuseum can today see some of these items on display as reminders of \nthe role Shelton played in Poes life.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven Sheltons influence over Poes life and work, one might be \nsurprised to know that she is buried in an unmarked grave next to her \nhusbands severely weathered and barely readable monument. This \nOctober, the Poe Museum, which was instrumental in marking the grave \nof Poes mother and in placing a plaque on the grave of Poes first \nlove, Jane Stanard, will finally mark the grave of Sarah Elmira \nRoyster Shelton in Richmonds Shockoe Hill Cemetery.\u0014",

I think they would come if they \nknew you were going to speak.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEric did not like to speak in public. He was shy. But he did not say \nanything to D. P. Thompson of this. He looked at his feet a couple \nmoments then looked up and answered, \"yes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's how he wound up on the platform, making his appeal to people \nto turn their lives over to God. He didn't chew them out for doing \nwrong. Instead, he spoke of God's love and support as he had \npersonally experienced it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEric had needed that support. His parents were missionaries in far \noff China. For much of his life he had had to stay behind in Scotland \nwithout them. There he had shown great ability as a scholar and as an \nathlete. He and his brother Rob were noted rugby players and when \nEric began to run and win races, his picture was frequently in the \nnewspapers. People began to speak of him as an Olympic Games \ncontender. He trained hard for the opportunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you've seen the movie Chariots of Fire, you have thrilled at Eric \nLiddell's stand for principle. It almost cost him his chance at \nOlympic gold, for the 100 meter was his best race. But he dropped \nout, rather than run in the qualifying heats on a Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead he preached in a Paris church that day while starting guns \npopped in the stadium. Nevertheless, Eric captured an unexpected \nbronze in the 200 meter and worked his way through the qualifying \nheats for the 400 meter. His trial times were not spectacular. It did \nnot seem he could beat the other fine contenders.\u0014\n\u0014\nEric crouched ready to run. It was on this day, July 11, 1924.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefeat or victory today, he would accept it. He had told the crowds \nwho came to hear him speak that he did not ever question what God \nbrought his way. \"I don't need explanations from God. I simply \nbelieve him and accept whatever comes my way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gun cracked. Eric was out of his crouch and running, head tilted \nback, arms flailing. If this had been a sprint, he could not have \nflown faster. When the finish tape drew taut across his chest, he was \nfive meters ahead of his nearest rival. Eric had won the gold in 47.6 \nseconds, a world record!\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Eric Liddell, however, this was not the ultimate race. His whole \nlife was a race: a race for the kingdom of heaven. He sailed two \nyears later to China as a missionary and was still running his race \nfor God when he died on February 21, 1945 of a brain tumor and \ntyphoid in a Japanese prison camp.

    "words": "Elizabeth Gaunt Burned for a Kindness\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe crowd was sympathetic. Elizabeth Gaunt was not only an old \nwoman, but known to many of the onlookers as a kindly Christian who \nhelped the poor and exiles. But in the England of 1685, as in all of \nthe world, cruel deaths were all too often dished out to people who \nangered the authorities with independent religious views.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tElizabeth arranged straw around herself to speed the flame so that \nher misery would be as short as possible. When the people saw this, \nmany burst into tears. Few of the onlookers felt that Elizabeth's \nsentence was just. She had no part whatever in treason, but was to \nburn alive for it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat had happened was this. Two years earlier, several members of \nthe Whig party plotted to assassinate King Charles II as he passed by \na place known as Rye House. Although they abandoned the plot, they \nwere betrayed to the government. James Burton, one of the men \nimplicated in the plan pleaded with Elizabeth Gaunt to hide him from \nhis pursuers for the sake of his family. Believing that it was what \nGod would expect, she not only helped him escape but gave him her \nprecious savings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government issued a proclamation that any one who gave evidence \nleading to others who took part in the plot would be given immunity \nfrom prosecution. James Burton saw this as a way to save his skin. He \nmade a deal with the authorities: He would testify against Elizabeth, \nthe woman who had saved his life, if they would grant him the \npromised immunity. The government agreed to this, and as the \nphilosopher David Hume wrote, \"He received a pardon as a recompense \nfor his treachery and she was burnt alive for her charity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several years, King James II, who had come to the throne, made \nuse of Judge Jeffreys, a brutal and unjust man, who made a career of \nhanding out cruel sentences against the king's enemies. Everyone \ncould imagine what level of justice Elizabeth could expect. Probably \nmercy would not have been shown to her even if she had not been one \nof the hated Anabaptists. These people taught pacifism and, contrary \nto the practice of most denominations, rejected infant baptism. They \nbelieved that only someone old enough to know the meaning of baptism \nshould receive the water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My fault,\" wrote Elizabeth, shortly before her death, \"was one which \na prince might well have forgiven. I did but relieve a poor family \nand I must die for it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDie she did, in the flames, on this day, October 23, 1685. She died \nbravely, the last woman burned alive in England for treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, was at the scene and saw her \ndie. He recorded some of the details.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, a furious storm burst upon England, which many considered \nto be a sign of God's anger at the burning of the innocent woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBarker, Anthony Richard.

    "title": "EVERY PILGRIM'S STORY BY JOHN BUNYAN",
    "words": "\u0014\nThe most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotaations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel. Pilgrim made it safely to the \nCelestial City by heeding and believing that message.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan, John. Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.

    "title": "ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE CHURCH'S APPALLING HISTORY",
    "words": "The Strange Encouragement \nof the Churchs Appalling History\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lives of our greatest heroes often undermined the gospel they so \neloquently preached. \u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Wilson/ March 17, 2017  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the last year, the greatest challenge to my faith has been reading \nabout the churchs history (mainly from Diarmaid MacCullochs A \nHistory of Christianity). In many ways, the story of Christianity is \nfull of lightmission, education, art, healthcare, abolition, \ncompassion, justiceand I have read, taught, and loved that story for \nmany years.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is an undeniable dark side: attacking, burning, crusading, \ndrowning, enslaving, flogging, ghettoizing, hunting, imprisoning, \nJew-hating, killing, lynching, and so on through the entire alphabet. \nWhat makes this difficult to stomach is that the people involved, as \nfar as we know, have loved God, followed Jesus, and received his \nSpirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis poses several problems for believers today. There is an \napologetic problem: If God is real, and his church is the light of \nthe world and the salt of the earth, we really ought to be doing \nbetter. There is a practical problem: The consequences of our actions \ncontinue to sour the world, blighting efforts to cultivate peace and \njustice. There is a theological problem, namely that we are standing \non the doctrinal shoulders of some who behaved appallingly. There is \neven a personal problem, in that the numerous specks in our \nancestors eyes mean that there must be at least one or two logs in \nours.\u0014\n\u0014\nA short while ago, I had a bonfire in my garden, and as I threw more \nwood onto the blazing mound, I couldnt help thinking, We used to do \nthis to people. God forgive us. Considering our failures can be \nupsetting. Yet it can also be instructive, challenging, and even \nencouraging to reflect on what the dark side of our history teaches. \nWe can learn a lot about our shape from our shadow.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first thing to learn, surely, is humility. Without a cold, hard \nlook at our low points, a mixture of hopeful eschatology and pride \ncould easily encourage an unrealistic (and probably very irritating) \ntriumphalismor even the progressivist belief that although the \nchurch in the past made terrible mistakes, we would never be so \nsilly. If we are feeling pleased with ourselves for developing \nuniversities and hospitals, remembering forced baptisms and witch \nhunts will help set us straight. Our successes remind us that the \nkingdom is now; our failures remind us that it is also not yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey also remind us that the church is not to fight with the weapons \nof this world. You dont have to be a pacifist (although I am) to \nagree that the institutional church shouldnt fight wars or punish \ncriminals. We are called instead to fight with spiritual weapons: the \nWord, the Spirit, the shield of faith, the gospel of peace. When we \ndo, no one is drowned except in baptism, the only fire we need is \nthat of Pentecost, and nothing is enslaved except slavery itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur low points expose the fallibility of our heroes, and prompt us to \nthank God that he built (and continues to build) his church through \nbroken people. At one level, the fact that Bernard of Clairvaux \npreached the Second Crusade, and Jonathan Edwards owned slaves, and \nMartin Luther denigrated Jews, undermines the gospel they preached so \neloquently. At another level, it vindicates it. All at once, they \nwere princes and paupers, priests and beggars, sinners and saints. So \nare we.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn honest reading of church history also makes the Bibles history \nfar more applicable. There is no hint of a whitewash of Israel in \nGenesis or Judges, 1 Kings or 2 Chronicles. The story of the early \nchurch is full of great achievements alongside rifts, squabbles, \nbetrayals, and disappointments. Scripture paints Gods people as a \nmighty yet flawed community, anointed by God yet afflicted by sin. \nWhen we find that our ancestors in church history have been similar, \nit should not surprise us.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo knowing our ugliest moments can help cultivate humility, peace, \ngratitude, and the fear of Godnot to mention a fresh appreciation \nfor the grace that works in spite of our behavior. It can be painful \nto think about, especially for those whose lives are shaped by the \nlegacy of previous failures. But it can also be strangely \nencouraging. After all, it is the people dwelling in deep darkness \nwho, in their desperation, finally see a great light.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Wilson is teaching pastor at Kings Church London and author \nmost recently of The Life We Never Expected (Crossway).\u0014",

    "words": "Suppose you are a survivor of an outlawed organization whose origins \ngo back to around 1700, seventy-six years before America became an \nindependent nation. \"Tell the story of your people,\" you are urged.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is, your people were an illegal group. In fact, the \ngovernment tried to exterminate them! Their leaders were captured and \nkilled and many letters and books burned. They left no public \nfestivals, no monuments--very little by which historians ordinarily \ntrace history. And to make your task more challenging, your people \nwere scattered over most of the known world. How could you possibly \nput together their story? That is the kind of task Eusebius tackled.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis people were the Christians who had been persecuted for almost \nthree hundred years. A measure of peace came to the believers when \nConstantine became emperor. At last the story of the church could be \ntold.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius was the one for the job. He had already prepared a \nchronology of the Bible and early church, trying to establish the \ndates of Christ's death and the events that followed. This was a \ndifficult undertaking because many different calendars were in use at \nthe time and he had to match up events recorded under one system to \nevents recorded under others.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius' ten-volume history is our best authority for early \nChristian history. We owe him a special debt because he quotes from \nmany sources that no longer exist. We are blessed that he showed \ninterest in a broad range of material. He traced the lines of \napostolic succession in key cities. Thus we know how the church \nprogressed in the big towns. The church has always been nourished \nwith the blood of martyrs. Eusebius told the stories of many who \nsuffered for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was also interested in debates over which books should be in the \nBible and he gave us various views of the matter. Because of this we \nknow a good deal about how we got the New Testament. Eusebius also \ntraced the threads of heresy. Through him we know of challenges to \northodoxy in the early centuries of the faith. Above all, Eusebius \ndescribed how God preserved the church and poured his grace upon it. \nEusebius even followed the woeful fate of the Jews and their \nstruggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nLate in life, Eusebius was invited to become bishop of Antioch. He \nturned down the offer. His backers appealed to the Emperor to compel \nhim to accept. Instead, Constantine praised Eusebius for refusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius died on this day, May 30, 339. He was seventy-four years \nold. In addition to all his other writings, he left behind him \ncommentaries on Isaiah and on the Psalms, a geography of the Bible, \nand a concordance of the Gospels. He wrote books to clear up \ndifferences in the Gospels. Finally he produced an account of the \nMartyrs of Palestine whom he had personally known. But his history \nremains his most important contribution to the church, and the one by \nwhich his name will always be remembered, for it gave us our past.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "words": "Evangeline Cory Booth Spent Her Years for God\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not how many years we live, but rather what we do with them,\" \nsaid Evangeline Cory Booth. When Evangeline died on this day, July \n17, 1950, she had put her 85 own years to good use.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe youngest daughter of William and Catherine Booth (founders of the \nSalvation Army), she was born in 1865, the same year that it was \nfounded. Her name was taken from the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, in \nwhich little Eva St. Claire was a Christian heroine.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline inherited her parents' flair for ministry and \nsalesmanship. She began preaching at the age of fifteen. Given her \nown leadership post two years later, she won the nickname \"White \nAngel of the Slums.\" Sometimes, she wore the same tattered clothes as \nthe flower girls in order to minister to them. Full of tact, charm, \ninventiveness and good spirits--not to mention good looks, she had a \nknack for solving problems and dramatizing the Salvation Army cause. \nIn fact, she became an Army troubleshooter. General William Booth \nsent Eva in when persecutions broke out or a local branch of the Army \nwas in disarray. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the American leaders of the Salvation Army disagreed with \nGeneral William Booth (splitting to found the Volunteers of America) \nit was Evangeline whom the general sent to solve the organization's \nwoes. She succeeded. Eventually, she was appointed leader of the \nAmerican work and became an American citizen. In 1934, she became \ngeneral of the world wide movement, a position she held for five \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline's style was to work herself to exhaustion for weeks or \nmonths, rest a few days, and then begin the cycle over again. \nNonetheless, she enjoyed life thoroughly. She rode horses and loved \ndiving. Horses weren't her only rides: she was the first prominent \nSalvationist to try a bicycle. Another means of relaxation was \nplaying musical instruments such as the harp.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her travels, Evangeline delivered powerful lectures. Many of these \nwere gathered into a volume titled Toward a Better World. \"The better \nworld is the home as well as the sure reward for the faithful unto \ndeath. They may have dreary and disappointing experience on earth: \nhard toil for the hands, sickness of the body, anxiety at the home, \npatched clothes on the back, and, maybe, rejected love in the heart; \nbut neither principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not \nthings to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall \nclose against them the gates of THE BETTER WORLD.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong her many writings were hymns. Perhaps the most famous was \"The \nWorld for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world for God! The world for God! \u0014\nThere's nothing else will meet the hunger of my soul...\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline's death was from arteriosclerosis.

    "title": "ESTHER'S STORY IS ACCOUNT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING",
    "words": "ESTHER'S STORY IS AN ACCOUNT OF \nHUMAN TRAFFICKING\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Leslie Cox 8-10-2017 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Esther is one of those essential Sunday school lessons. \nWe tell our girls to be brave like Esther, to be beautiful like \nEsther  but we dont tell them what actually happened to Esther. We \nforget the darkness woven throughout her testimony and we exploit her \nstory without honestly accounting for her victimization and trials.\u0014\n\u0014\nEsther is a victims account of human trafficking.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United Nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment, \ntransportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means \nof the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of \nabduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power  for the \npurpose of exploitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith this definition in mind, let us examine the story of Esther.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we tell Esthers story, we usually overlook that of her \npredecessor, Queen Vashti, the woman who refused a king. The text \ntells us that after seven days of banquets, the king drunk with wine, \ncommanded his men to go and grab Queen Vashti, ordering her to go \nbefore all the people wearing her crown  possibly only her crown  \nfor she was beautiful to behold. (1:10-11)\u0014\n\u0014\nToo often we think that human trafficking involves trafficking people \ngroups across borders. While this does happen, as we discover later \nin the story, no movement is required to meet the definition of human \ntrafficking. What is required is coercion, abuse of power, and the \nexploitation of an individual  like a husband demanding his wife \nparade around without any clothes for the amusement of drunken men. \nWhen Queen Vashti refuses the king, she risks her life, and we see \nthat refusal is not an option. (1:12) Were never really told what \nbecomes of Queen Vashti except that she was deposed of her position. \nAnd the King seeks a meek replacement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe relationship that develops between the king and Esther is one of \nsexual exploitation. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet beautiful young virgins be sought out, says the Kings decree. \n(2:3) And so, his appointed commissioners gathered all the beautiful \nyoung virgins from all the provinces and brought them to the harem, \nplacing them under the custody of one of the kings men.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike countless women, men, boys, and girls, these young girls were \ntrafficked across borders away from their homes. They are gathered. \nThey are brought. They are placed in the custody of another.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the other young girls stories avoid the mention of consent, \nEsthers story brings the lack of it to the forefront. While the \nother girls were gathered, Esther was taken. (2:8)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what do we know about her? She was an orphan, marking her as one \nof ancient societys most vulnerable members. (2:7) While she was \nadopted by Mordecai, her cousin, the text states this girl was fair \nand beautiful, suggesting that perhaps her adoption was a result not \njust of familial protection, but also a direct result of her beauty. \n(2:7)\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was also an ethnic other, a Jew. Esther is of the minority race \nin this story. Throughout the Book of Esther, her people were \nthreatened with extinction. This part of Esthers identity was so \nsuppressed that she was ordered by Mordecai not to reveal either her \npeople or her kindred. (2:10)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile her parentless status and her ethnic heritage left her \nvulnerable, her beauty marked her for exploitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Esther was placed in the custody of the kings man, the text \nreads that she first pleased him. Only after winning his favor did \nhe provide for her. (2:9) We do not know what it took to please this \nman, nor do we know what it took to win his favor. But it is clear \nthat only after winning his favor did she receive her portion of food.\u0014\n\u0014\nEsther continued to win favor, advancing her and seven other chosen \nmaids to the best place in the harem. Hegai, the sole authority of \nthese young women and girls, was at liberty to choose those he \nfavored and rank the girls against one another. This situation is \nripe for exploitation, leaving these girls as disposable as Queen \nVashti.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a year in the custody of the kings men, the next round of \ntesting began: We are told that in the evening the girls went in one \nby one, and in the morning they came back. While trafficked into the \nkings palace as virgins, after a year of beauty treatments, they \nwere left to the sexual appetite of the king.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is Esthers story.\u0014\n\u0014\nEsthers story continues to unfold as the text reveals the king \nloved Esther more than all the other women. (2:17) As we tell this \nstory in our Sunday school classrooms, were tempted to tell it as a \nfairytale. Esther: the orphan that wins the love of a king.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet what type of love is this? The relationship that develops between \nthe king and Esther is one of sexual exploitation. It is a story of \none mans power and a young girls vulnerability. This love is not \nthe fate we wish for any of our daughters.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, Esther does become a queen and the royal crown finds its way \nonto her head, but this occurs after she spent time living in the \nspace between the harem and the kings chambers. (2:17) Esther won \nthe crown as a concubine forced to earn the favor of men. She married \na man who took her from her homeland and forced her, along with \ncountless other young girls, to win his favor.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is these first two chapters of Esthers life that speak to the \nestimated 20.9 million trafficked victims in our world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United Nations hypothesized that one of the reasons we often miss \nvictims of human trafficking is because we dont understand the many \ndiverse faces of human trafficking victims. Some of these faces are \nin our Scriptures, our sacred texts. We have, in our Bible, stories \nthat can teach us how to spot human trafficking, and the danger \nvictims are placed in through the coercion and exploitation of people \nin power. It is important that we open our eyes to the humanity in \nour sacred texts. For our modern-day Esthers, there is a story within \nour holy text that speaks of similar trauma, exploitation, and \ntrials. Most importantly within our Scripture we find our call: Let \nthere be no more Esthers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nLeslie Cox \u0014\nLeslie Cox is a third year student at Columbia Theological Seminary \nperusing ordination in the Presbyterian (USA) church.

    "title": "EIGHT TRAITS OF OUTSTANDNG STAFF MEMBERS",
    "words": "\u0014\nThese eight characteristics are for you as you relate to the other \nstaff at your church, regardless of how they respond or reciprocate. \nThe most godly and influential staff members I have known share these \neight traits.\u0014\nThey pray for other staff members individually. In their private \nprayer time, effective staff members pray for the others who serve on \nthe team. They pray for those who support them. And they pray for \nthose who oppose them and even antagonize them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey seek to build up the ministries of the other staff members. In \npublic and private, the best church staff members say great things \nabout the other ministries. They seek to work with the other areas of \nministry instead of competing with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey communicate openly. They have no hidden agendas. They are not \nduplicitous in their public words versus their words said in private. \nThey make certain everyone else understands fully what is taking \nplace in their ministries and why.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey express disagreements with other staff face to face. They are \nnot cowards who spread venom behind the backs of other staff. If they \nhave a disagreement with another staff person, they go to that person \ndirectly in a spirit of humility, honesty, and love.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey seek to serve. They will show up at a ministry led by another \nstaff person to help and demonstrate support. They will ask other \nstaff how they can help them. I know the story of a discipleship \npastor who brought a meal to the worship pastor during the busy \nEaster season just to let him know he appreciated him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey execute the tasks they are given. When one church staff member \ndoes not execute the tasks for which he or she is responsible, the \nentire staff is demoralized. There is a sense that some are working \nand others are not. It makes the entire staff ministry look weak or \nincompetent to church members. Often, other staff members have to \npick up the slack.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey defend other staff members to church members. Every church staff \nmember receives criticisms on a regular basis from church members. \nBut the best staff members will not allow a church member to \ndenigrate other staff to him or her. The outstanding staff members \nwill defend their fellow team member or, at the very least, direct \nthe church member to speak directly with the person who is the \nsubject of the criticism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey support and encourage the families of other staff. Families of \nchurch staff need support and encouragement. For sure, they often get \nenough of the negative feedback. Support and encouragement is \nespecially powerful when it comes from another church staff member. \nFew things unify a church staff and, thus, a church as much as \nintentional encouragement of the families of church staff.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said in John 13:35, By this all people will know that you are \nMy disciples, if you have love for one another. Unity and love are \nincredibly important for Christian witness. Unity and love are \nimperative for church staff who serve together.\u0014\n\u0014\nTom S. Rainer\u0014",

Elizabeth Gaunt was not only an old woman, \nbut known to many of the onlookers as a kindly Christian who helped \nthe poor and exiles. But in the England of 1685, as in all of the \nworld, cruel deaths were all too often dished out to people who \nangered the authorities with independent religious views.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth arranged straw around herself to speed the flame so that \nher misery would be as short as possible. When the people saw this, \nmany burst into tears. Few of the onlookers felt that Elizabeth's \nsentence was just. She had no part whatever in treason, but was to \nburn alive for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat had happened was this. Two years earlier, several members of the \nWhig party plotted to assassinate King Charles II as he passed by a \nplace known as Rye House. Although they abandoned the plot, they were \nbetrayed to the government. James Burton, one of the men implicated \nin the plan pleaded with Elizabeth Gaunt to hide him from his \npursuers for the sake of his family. Believing that it was what God \nwould expect, she not only helped him escape but gave him her \nprecious savings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government issued a proclamation that any one who gave evidence \nleading to others who took part in the plot would be given immunity \nfrom prosecution. James Burton saw this as a way to save his skin. He \nmade a deal with the authorities: He would testify against Elizabeth, \nthe woman who had saved his life, if they would grant him the \npromised immunity. The government agreed to this, and as the \nphilosopher David Hume wrote, \"He received a pardon as a recompense \nfor his treachery and she was burnt alive for her charity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several years, King James II, who had come to the throne, made \nuse of Judge Jeffreys, a brutal and unjust man, who made a career of \nhanding out cruel sentences against the king's enemies. Everyone \ncould imagine what level of justice Elizabeth could expect. Probably \nmercy would not have been shown to her even if she had not been one \nof the hated Anabaptists. These people taught pacifism and, contrary \nto the practice of most denominations, rejected infant baptism. They \nbelieved that only someone old enough to know the meaning of baptism \nshould receive the water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My fault,\" wrote Elizabeth, shortly before her death, \"was one which \na prince might well have forgiven. I did but relieve a poor family \nand I must die for it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDie she did, in the flames, on this day, October 23, 1685. She died \nbravely, the last woman burned alive in England for treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, was at the scene and saw her \ndie. He recorded some of the details.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, a furious storm burst upon England, which many considered \nto be a sign of God's anger at the burning of the innocent woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\nBarker, Anthony Richard.

    "words": "Everyone \nNeeds Someone Else\u0014\nWHY Americans OF ALL AGES are coming together in intentional \ncommunities\u0014\nBy Jeffrey Kluger   Time Magazine  11/18/17\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIts that business of relieving loneliness thats key to the \npopularity of intentional communities. Human beings may not always \nget along, but the fact is, we cant get enough of one another. There \nare currently 7.6 billion of us in the world but we inhabit only \nabout 10% of the planets land, and roughly 50% of us live on just 1% \nof that land.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe evolved to depend on our social connections, says Dr. Vivek \nMurthy, former U.S. Surgeon General. Over thousands of years, this \ngot baked into our nervous systems  so much so that if we are \nfeeling socially disconnected, that places us in a physiologic stress \nstate.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a study by AARP, over 40% of American adults suffer from \nloneliness, a condition that, Murthy warns, is as dangerous to our \nphysical health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, increasing the risk \nof cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and more. Worse, \nloneliness is a condition that makes no demographic distinctions; it \naffects millennials just starting their careers, widowed boomers just \nending theirs, empty-nesters, new divorcees, first year college \nstudents a thousand miles away from family and high school friends. \nSocial media, which ostensibly draws people closer, in fact may be \natomizing us further, creating virtual connections that have little \nof the benefits of actual connections.\u0014\n\u0014\nA gusher of studies since the early 1990s have established the health \ndividends of social ties. Among people with cardiovascular disease, \nthose with more social connections have a 2.4 times lower risk of \nmortality within an established period than those with poor social \nties. Social connections lower the risk of cancer, speed recovery \namong people who do contract the disease, and reduce the risk of \nhypertension and other cardiovascular illnesses. Even wound-healing \nimproves with social connections. Multiple studies suggest that part \nof this may come from the psychological boostincluding the sense of \nresponsibilitythat meaningful relationships provide. When friends \nand family members are counting on you to be around, you make better \nhealth choices, even if theyre unconscious. Other studies have shown \nthat similar brain structures control both physical pain and social \npainand that pain relief, through analgesics in the first case and \nrelationships in the second, operate similarly as well. Being \nsocially connected doesnt simply make you healthier, it just plain \nfeels good.\u0014\n\u0014\nIntentional communities are about creating attachment, the feeling \nthat someone has your back, says Harvard University psychiatrist \nRobert Waldinger, director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, \na decades-old survey of the health of a population of Harvard \ngraduates and their descendants. We often ask people in studies, \nWho would you call in the middle of the night if you were really \nsick or scared? Intentional communities can help you have an answer \nto that question.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not easy to come by a firm count of how many intentional \ncommunities are out there. Only about 160 of them have been built \nfrom the ground up with co-housing in mind, but the regularly updated \nFellowship for Intentional Community lists 1,539 communities in all \n50 states that have also used existing housing stock to establish \nco-housing arrangements.\u0014",

    "title": "ELECTORAL COLLEGE VS. MAJORITY RULE",
    "words": "Constitutional \nignorance, perhaps contempt \u0014\n                            \tBy Walter E. Williams  Richmond Times \nDispatch   1/19/18\u0014\n\u0014\nHillary Clinton blamed the Electoral College for her stunning defeat \nin the 2016 presidential election in her latest memoirs, What \nHappened. Some have claimed that the Electoral College is one of the \nmost dangerous institutions in American politics. Why? They say the \nElectoral College system, as opposed to a simple majority vote, \ndistorts the one-person, one-vote principle of democracy because \nelectoral votes are not distributed according to population.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo back up their claim, they point out that the Electoral College \ngives, for example, Wyoming citizens disproportionate weight in a \npresidential election. Put another way, Wyoming, a state with a \npopulation of about 600,000, has one member in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and two members in the U.S. Senate, which gives the \ncitizens of Wyoming three electoral votes, or one electoral vote per \n200,000 people. California, our most populous state, has more than 39 \nmillion people and 55 electoral votes, or approximately one vote per \n715,000 people. Comparatively, individuals in Wyoming have nearly \nfour times the power in the Electoral College as Californians\u0014\n.\u0014\nMany people whine that using the Electoral College instead of the \npopular vote and majority rule is undemocratic. I'd say that they are \nabsolutely right. Not deciding who will be the president by majority \nrule is not democracy. But the Founding Fathers went to great lengths \nto ensure that we were a republic and not a democracy. In fact, the \nword democracy does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, \nthe U.S. Constitution, or any other of our founding documents.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow about a few quotations expressed by the Founders about democracy? \nIn Federalist Paper No. 10, James Madison wanted to prevent rule by \nmajority faction, saying, Measures are too often decided, not \naccording to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, \nbut by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. \nJohn Adams warned in a letter, Remember Democracy never lasts long. \nIt soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a \nDemocracy Yet, that did not commit suicide. Edmund Randolph said, \nThat in tracing these evils to their origin, every man had found it \nin the turbulence and follies of democracy. Then-Chief Justice John \nMarshall observed, Between a balanced republic and a democracy, the \ndifference is like that between order and chaos.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Founders expressed contempt for the tyranny of majority rule, and \nthroughout our Constitution, they placed impediments to that tyranny. \nTwo houses of Congress pose one obstacle to majority rule. That is, \n51 senators can block the wishes of 435 representatives and 49 \nsenators. The president can veto the wishes of 535 members of \nCongress. It takes two-thirds of both houses of Congress to override \na presidential veto. To change the Constitution requires not a \nmajority but a two-thirds vote of both houses, and if an amendment is \napproved, it requires ratification by three-fourths of state \nlegislatures. Finally, the Electoral College is yet another measure \nthat thwarts majority rule. It makes sure that the highly populated \nstates  today, mainly 12 on the East and West coasts  cannot run \nroughshod over the rest of the nation. That forces a presidential \ncandidate to take into consideration the wishes of the other 38 \nstates.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose Americans obsessed with rule by popular majorities might want \nto get rid of the U.S. Senate, where states, regardless of \npopulation, have two senators. Should we change representation in the \nHouse of Representatives to a system of proportional representation \nand eliminate the guarantee that each state gets at least one \nrepresentative? Currently, seven states with populations of 1 million \nor fewer have one representative, thus giving them disproportionate \ninfluence in Congress. While we're at it, should we make all \ncongressional acts be majority rule? When we're finished with \nestablishing majority rule in Congress, should we then move to change \nour court system, which requires unanimity in jury decisions, to a \nsimple majority rule?\u0014\n\u0014\nMy question is: Is it ignorance of or contempt for our Constitution \nthat fuels the movement to abolish the Electoral College?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason \nUniversity\u0014",

    "title": "EVERY PILGRIM'S STORY, BY JOHN BUNYAN",
    "words": "The most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotaations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel.

In 49 AD, he expelled Jews from Rome (Acts \n18:2) because of a \"Chrestus\" (Suetonius, Claud. 25.4). This \nexpulsion brought the Jewish couple Aquila and Priscilla to Corinth, \nwhere they met Paul and became fellow workers in Ephesus (Acts 18:26; \n2 Tim. 4:19) and Rome (Rom. 16:3).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNero (AD 5468)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 55 AD, the Senate in Rome set up a statue of Nero in the temple of \nMars Ultor (Tacitus Ann. 13.8.1)the first time since Caesar that an \nemperor had been directly associated with a god in Rome. In 65 AD, he \nrejected a proposed temple to \"the divine Nero,\" citing the tradition \nthat only dead emperors were divine.

Inthe Sayings of the Desert Fathers, \nAbba Moses (d. 407) reveals \"The cell teaches us everything.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cell was foremost a place of prayer, and prayer was the primary \nsocial service of the Byzantine monk. Most Eastern monasteries were \nlocated in desolate areas, remote from civilization, and thus \nconducive to prayer: St. Sabas's monastery in the Holy Land, St. \nCatherine's monastery on Mount Sinai, the monastic republic of Mount \nAthos, and the towering rocks of Meteora in central Greece.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Eastern monks and nuns engaged in education, evangelism, and \ncharitable work, but these works were considered secondary to the \nmonastic's main vocationprayer. Visitors to the monasteries expected \nto find places of prayer, to discover persons of prayer, and to \nencounter holy people with the gift of spiritual direction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal of prayer, and of all monastic life, was union with God. \nSuch union was made possible only through a life of spiritual \npurification and total renunciationa self-stripping of both material \npossessions and intellectual projections. This was the way of \nnegation, or of apophatic knowledge. The unknowable God was venerated \nthrough a series of negations that showed God as \"ever beyond.\" The \napophatic way had a moral dimension too: the purification from \nwrongful desires.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the West, monasteries often became nurseries of scholarship, but \nin the East, they were always centers of spirituality. The most \nprecious service of Eastern monasticism was its ever burning flame of \nprayer and spirituality. One monastery in Constantinople was called \nAkoimetoi (literally, \"the\u0014\nsleepless ones\"), where prayer was ongoing, 24 hours a day, with \nmonks taking turns to recite prayers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a sense, then, Eastern monastic life has been an experience of \ncharismatic enthusiasm, a Pentecostal reality. The monk has been a \npneumato phoros (\"Spirit-bearer\"), bearing witness to the abiding \npresence of the Spirit in the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Chryssavgis is professor of theology at Holy Cross Greek \nOrthodox School of Theology in Brookline, Massachusetts.\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELINE BOOTH SPENT HER YEARS FOR GOD",
    "words": "Evangeline Cory Booth Spent Her Years for God\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not how many years we live, but rather what we do with them,\" \nsaid Evangeline Cory Booth. When Evangeline died on this day, July \n17, 1950, she had put her 85 own years to good use.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe youngest daughter of William and Catherine Booth (founders of the \nSalvation Army), she was born in 1865, the same year that it was \nfounded. Her name was taken from the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, in \nwhich little Eva St. Claire was a Christian heroine.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline inherited her parents' flair for ministry and \nsalesmanship. She began preaching at the age of fifteen. Given her \nown leadership post two years later, she won the nickname \"White \nAngel of the Slums.\" Sometimes, she wore the same tattered clothes as \nthe flower girls in order to minister to them. Full of tact, charm, \ninventiveness and good spirits--not to mention good looks, she had a \nknack for solving problems and dramatizing the Salvation Army cause. \nIn fact, she became an Army troubleshooter. General William Booth \nsent Eva in when persecutions broke out or a local branch of the Army \nwas in disarray.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the American leaders of the Salvation Army disagreed with \nGeneral William Booth (splitting to found the Volunteers of America) \nit was Evangeline whom the general sent to solve the organization's \nwoes. She succeeded. Eventually, she was appointed leader of the \nAmerican work and became an American citizen. In 1934, she became \ngeneral of the world wide movement, a position she held for five \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline's style was to work herself to exhaustion for weeks or \nmonths, rest a few days, and then begin the cycle over again. \nNonetheless, she enjoyed life thoroughly. She rode horses and loved \ndiving. Horses weren't her only rides: she was the first prominent \nSalvationist to try a bicycle. Another means of relaxation was \nplaying musical instruments such as the harp.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her travels, Evangeline delivered powerful lectures. Many of these \nwere gathered into a volume titled Toward a Better World. \"The better \nworld is the home as well as the sure reward for the faithful unto \ndeath. They may have dreary and disappointing experience on earth: \nhard toil for the hands, sickness of the body, anxiety at the home, \npatched clothes on the back, and, maybe, rejected love in the heart; \nbut neither principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not \nthings to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall \nclose against them the gates of THE BETTER WORLD.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong her many writings were hymns. Perhaps the most famous was \"The \nWorld for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline's death was from arteriosclerosis. She was buried near \nWhite Plains, New York.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBooth, Evangeline Cory. Toward a Better World.

    "title": "EXPLAINING \"THE TRIBULATION\"",
    "words": "1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. Hope Rises on Exulting Wings. This passage \nand the one following (5:1-11) cannot be separated, for they are two \nhalves of a block of eschatological truth. Both raise a vital issue \n(4:13; 5:1). Both present an answer (4:14-17; 5:2-10). Both conclude \nwith an admonishment to the Thessalonians to comfort one another \n(4:18; 5:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nHere the issue is obscured for the average reader and the whole \npassage made difficult because of Paul's vivid description of the \nmanner of the parousia. The end of the world has come. The clouds of \nthe sky open and the Lord descends with a cry of command, with the \narchangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God (vs. 16). \nThere is a dramatic opening of the graves of the Christian dead, \ntheir resurrection, and startling levitation into the clouds. \nSimultaneously, the living Christians are swept off the earth, there \nis a joint and rapturous meeting of both of them with the Lord in the \nair, and an eternal union with him in glory begins (vss. 17-18).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian theology of the first century was built around belief \nin the speedy return of the Lord, and the early Christians assumed \nthat all who accepted him and received the Spirit would take part in \nthe blessed event. This hope sustained them in their tribulations, \nnourished their courage, and refreshed their hearts. In its power \nthey faced their bitter trials with quiet faith. It was the morning \nstar in their dark sky. But the Lord did not come. Time passed and no \ntrumpet of God sounded. They were still being oppressed and harried. \nThe haughty and evil kings of the earth were still on their thrones. \nSo their hearts began to fail and their minds to be disturbed because \nof two things. First, the inevitable scoffing of the pagans and Jews \naround them, who ridiculed the Christian hope and pointed out that \nthings were going on just as they always had. If their Christ was \ngoing to come, why did he not come when their need was so great? \nSecond, and more important, some of their number had died. What was \nto happen to them? Had God withdrawn their election? \u0014\n\u0014\nWould they just lie in the ground as the pagans expected to do? Or \nwould they have a glorious resurrection and have part in the \nparousia? If so, what would be the order of precedence? Would the \ndead precede the living or vice versa?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese six verses are a glorious reassurance to the troubled. Paul's \nabsolute certainty is that all who die in Christ remain in Christ \n(vs. 16) forever, and will therefore have their share in the Second \nAdvent. He undergirds this truth with the rising of Jesus Christ as \nthe validation and guarantee of the resurrection of the saints (vs. \n14).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis paragraph has much to say to us in this day. (a) A great man can \nbe in error. Paul was firmly convinced that Jesus would return during \nhis lifetime. This was a tremendous dynamic to him as a missionary \nand evangelist, for it was his hope personally to present to God the \nmembers of the churches he had formed (Col. 1:28); they were to be \nhis crowning glory in the presence of his Lord (2:19). He was wrong \nin this and changed his views as the years passed. Yet he tenaciously \nclung to the conviction that the parousia was near at hand (Rom. \n13:11; I Cor. 16:22). He was also wrong in this. Still hoping for the \ncoming, he was later forced to accept the possibility that death \nmight cut him down before his hope was fulfilled (Phil. 1:20-25).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nInterpreter's Bible, The - Exposition - Volume 11.\u0014",

    "words": "Extraordinary Lottie Moon Reached China\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If I had a thousand lives, I would give them all for the women of \nChina,\" said Lottie Moon. These words were a testimony to how much \nChrist had changed her. She wasn't always so dedicated. On the \ncontrary, as a child she was called a \"devil\" because of her defiant \nattitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nLottie's father was a was well-to-do cotton merchant when she was \nborn in Viewmont, a Virginia plantation in 1840. But he died when she \nwas thirteen. Did bitterness toward God for the loss of her dad drive \nher into rebellion?\u0014\n\u0014\nLottie did not like to go to church. But because of a friend, she \nagreed to attend a missionary meeting. At that meeting the Holy \nSpirit showed her how ugly her spirit was. After praying all night, \nshe confessed her bad behavior to God and to others. She decided to \nbecome a missionary herself. A good student, Lottie worked hard and \ngraduated with her masters degree. Two years later she sailed as a \nSouthern Baptist missionary to China. Her appeals inspired drives for \nmission funds in the United States, especially at Christmas. Arriving \nin China on this day, October 7, 1873, she began work in Tonchow, \nNorthern China.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chinese did not respond well to her overtures at first. When she \noffered them home-baked cookies they refused them, thinking they were \npoisoned. Gradually, she broke down barriers. She used her knitting \nand sewing skills to interest Chinese women.\u0014\n\u0014\nEleven years after coming to China she prepared for a much needed \nfurlough. As she was about to leave for the United States, men from \nPintow arrived on foot, pleading with her to come work in their city \nwhere many were eager to hear the gospel. Lottie immediately \nabandoned her plans for a rest, moved to Pintow, and led many people \nto know the Jesus who had changed her own life. During her forty \nyears in China, she took only three furloughs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she was in her seventies, China suffered severe famine. Lottie \nwould not eat because her people had nothing to eat. Naturally she \nbecame ill. She was put on boat to return to America but died of \nstarvation when the ship reached Kobe, Japan. She may not have given \na thousand imaginary lives for China but she gave the one she had.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDeen, Edith. Great Women of the Christian Faith.

    "title": "ELIZABETH GAUNT BURNED FOR A KINDNESS",
    "words": "Elizabeth Gaunt Burned for a Kindness\u0014\nDan Graves, MS\u0014\n\u0014\nThe crowd was sympathetic. Elizabeth Gaunt was not only an old woman, \nbut known to many of the onlookers as a kindly Christian who helped \nthe poor and exiles. But in the England of 1685, as in all of the \nworld, cruel deaths were all too often dished out to people who \nangered the authorities with independent religious views.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth arranged straw around herself to speed the flame so that \nher misery would be as short as possible. When the people saw this, \nmany burst into tears. Few of the onlookers felt that Elizabeth's \nsentence was just. She had no part whatever in treason, but was to \nburn alive for it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat had happened was this. Two years earlier, several members of the \nWhig party plotted to assassinate King Charles II as he passed by a \nplace known as Rye House. Although they abandoned the plot, they were \nbetrayed to the government. James Burton, one of the men implicated \nin the plan pleaded with Elizabeth Gaunt to hide him from his \npursuers for the sake of his family. Believing that it was what God \nwould expect, she not only helped him escape but gave him her \nprecious savings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government issued a proclamation that any one who gave evidence \nleading to others who took part in the plot would be given immunity \nfrom prosecution. James Burton saw this as a way to save his skin. He \nmade a deal with the authorities: He would testify against Elizabeth, \nthe woman who had saved his life, if they would grant him the \npromised immunity. The government agreed to this, and as the \nphilosopher David Hume wrote, \"He received a pardon as a recompense \nfor his treachery and she was burnt alive for her charity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several years, King James II, who had come to the throne, made \nuse of Judge Jeffreys, a brutal and unjust man, who made a career of \nhanding out cruel sentences against the king's enemies. Everyone \ncould imagine what level of justice Elizabeth could expect. Probably \nmercy would not have been shown to her even if she had not been one \nof the hated Anabaptists. These people taught pacifism and, contrary \nto the practice of most denominations, rejected infant baptism. They \nbelieved that only someone old enough to know the meaning of baptism \nshould receive the water.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My fault,\" wrote Elizabeth, shortly before her death, \"was one which \na prince might well have forgiven. I did but relieve a poor family \nand I must die for it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDie she did, in the flames, on this day, October 23, 1685. She died \nbravely, the last woman burned alive in England for treason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, was at the scene and saw her \ndie. He recorded some of the details.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, a furious storm burst upon England, which many considered \nto be a sign of God's anger at the burning of the innocent woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBarker, Anthony Richard.

Roberg prayed for his health, but was relieved \nwhen his case appeared to be asymptomatic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen in late May, Roberg got another alarming call from the facility. \nIt wasnt the virus, they said  something else was wrong. His head \nwas down into his chest, and he was sitting slumped in his \nwheelchair, her fathers aide said, according to Roberg. He was not \nhis perky, chatty self.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoberg later learned that her father, whod always had a healthy \nappetite, had been losing weight. Even more isolated in quarantine \nafter his Covid-19 diagnosis, he was becoming quiet and disengaged, \neven with the staff members who tended to him, a nurse later told her.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe still had no coronavirus symptoms  he was just withdrawn, \naccording to Roberg and an administrator at Copperfield Hill. Roberg \nwas hopeful that he would bounce back with more hands-on attention \nfrom the facility. But four days later, on June 2, she got another \ncall: She should come right away. Her father was dying.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat morning, Roberg flew in from Wisconsin and met her brother in \nthe parking lot of Copperfield Hill. Together they walked into the \nentryway of the facility, where they were temperature-checked, and \nthen put on gowns, gloves and face shields. A nurse finally brought \nthem up to her fathers floor and opened the door.\u0014\n\u0014\nOh wait a minute she said, stopping short. I think hes gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoberg gasped when she saw her fathers gaunt body lying on the bed. \nAfter three months of separation, she missed her only chance to see \nher father by minutes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis death certificate listed the cause of death as the progression of \nAlzheimers disease and social isolation / failure to thrive related \nto COVID-19 restrictions.\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial isolation was listed as a contributing cause of death for at \nleast nine other Minnesotans  almost all long-term care residents  \nfrom June to September, according to state death records; no deaths \nin the previous two years cited social isolation as a cause.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the nurses who treated Peske later described his deterioration \nas a burning candle with no oxygen left to draw from the air. It was \nas if a light had gone out, Roberg said: He couldnt survive from \nbeing isolated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe unseen cost of lockdowns \u0014\n\u0014\nThe effort to shield elderly, frail and disabled residents from the \ncoronavirus has created another wrenching health crisis: The \nconfinement meant to protect the most vulnerable is also threatening \ntheir lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe isolation is robbing them of whatever good days they have left  \nit accelerates the aging process, Joshua Uy, associate professor at \nthe University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, said.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou see increased falls, decrease in strength and ability to \nambulate.

    "words": "Evangelical Leaders 'Wittingly Propagated Lies' about 2020 Election, \nWheaton Faculty Say in Statement\u0014\nMichael Foust | ChristianHeadlines.com  | Tuesday, January 12, 2021\u0014\n________________________________________\u0014\nMore than 225 members of the Wheaton College faculty and staff have \nsigned a statement condemning the wicked leadership of President \nTrump and also criticizing evangelical leaders who  the statement \nsays  wittingly propagated lies about the 2020 election.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statement, which addresses last weeks mob attack on the capitol \nbuilding but also the controversy surrounding the election results, \nhas been signed by 231 current and emeritus faculty and staff.\u0014\n\u0014\nWheaton College, located in Wheaton, Ill., is one of the most \nprominent and influential evangelical schools in the United States. \nNotable alumni include Billy Graham and Jim Elliot.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe January 6 attack on the Capitol was characterized not only by \nvicious lies, deplorable violence, white supremacy, white \nnationalism, and wicked leadership  especially by President Trump  \nbut also by idolatrous and blasphemous abuses of Christian symbols, \nthe statement says. The behaviors that many participants celebrated \nin Jesus name bear absolutely no resemblance to the Christian \nteachings or ethics that we submit to as faculty and staff of Wheaton \nCollege.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe statement also criticizes Christian leaders for their public \nstatements about the election in recent weeks as President Trump was \nalleging the results were rigged. Their comments  the statement \nsays  helped lead to the attack on the capitol.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days and weeks preceding January 6, many more leaders, \nincluding many evangelical leaders, could have spoken truth to the \ndisillusioned supporters of President Trump  diminishing the \nprospects for violence and bolstering the witness of Christian love \nand the call for justice in our civic life. Some did, the statement \nsays. However, many wittingly propagated lies, or were unduly silent \nin a just cause. Our Christian faith demands greater courage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe repent of our own failures to speak and to act in accordance with \njustice, and we lament the failures of the Church to teach clearly \nand to exercise adequate church discipline in these areas, the \nstatement says in a concluding paragraph. Moreover, we grieve over \nthe inadequate level of discipleship that has made room for this type \nof behavior among those who self-identify as Christian. We pray that \nthe Holy Spirit will reveal to us all manner of idolatry, and we \ncommit to speaking plainly against it wherever and whenever we find \nit. We commit ourselves to a more faithful witness in our callings as \nthe faculty and staff of Wheaton College, and will work diligently to \nprovide ample opportunities to show students, as well as the larger \nWheaton College and Christian community, how to practice discernment \nin civic engagement, to demonstrate the connections between love and \njustice, and to courageously communicate the truth  even and \nespecially when the truth is difficult to hear.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe pray that, in so doing, we will fulfill the Lords requirement of \nus: To do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before our God \n(Micah 6:8).\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELICALS FACE A RECKONING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP",
    "words": "Evangelicals face a reckoning: Donald \nTrump and the future of our faith\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must live up to our calling as evangelicals: to proclaim Jesus \nChrist to the world, rather than betray Him to sustain worldly power.\u0014\nEd Stetzer   Opinion contributor    USA TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one likes to admit they were fooled. It's tough to admit we were \nwrong. Now, many evangelicals are seeing President Donald Trump for \nwho he is, but more need to see what he has done to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts time for an evangelical reckoning.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm an evangelical, like about a quarter of the United States \npopulation. Evangelicals believe in the good news of the Gospel  \nthat Jesus died on the cross, for our sins, and in our place  and we \nneed to tell the world about that.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut thats not what most people are talking about today. You see, \nwhite evangelicals embraced the president, some begrudgingly and some \nenthusiastically, because he addressed many of their concerns.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany evangelicals and leaders invested money, time and conviction \ntoward the promise of making America great again. In turn, Donald \nTrump made good on these investments from an evangelical perspective. \nMost evangelicals (me included) are grateful for the Supreme Court \njustices he appointed and for some of the religious liberty concerns \nhe addressed. His anti-abortion stances surprised many (again, me \nincluded), and for that I was thankful.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, most of that is in jeopardy now because Trump is who \nmany of us warned other evangelicals that he was.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe reap what Trump has sown\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has burned down the Republican Party, emboldened white \nsupremacists, mainstreamed conspiracy theorists and more.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet of greater concern for me is the trail of destruction he has left \nwithin the evangelical movement. Tempted by power and trapped within \na culture war theology, too many evangelicals tied their fate to a \nman who embodied neither their faith nor their vision of political \ncharacter.   \u0014\n\u0014\nSocial media isn't always true:Evangelicals, we need to address the \nQAnoners in our midst\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result, we are finally witnessing an evangelical reckoning.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years weve been talking about a coming evangelical reckoning. A \nflood of books, articles and conferences  many of which I wrote and \nparticipated in  have warned of the approaching storm clouds for the \nevangelical movement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis reckoning is here.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericans (and the world) have the right to ask us some hard \nquestions. Some of us were vocal, often and early, about the dangers \nof Trumpism. It was costly. As we sort through the coming months and \nyears, we must be clear on three reasons why we have arrived at this \npoint:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, far too many tolerated egregious behavior. The past \nhalf-decade has offered near daily examples of people co-opting the \nGospel for sinful ends. Racism, nationalism, sexism and a host of \nother sins have found purchase within the evangelical movement in \nboth overt and subtle expressions. Many have been able to dismiss \nthese examples as outliers that did not truly represent the \nevangelical movement. We have long since exhausted this excuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs evangelicals, we have to stop saying this isn't who we are. This \nis who we are; these are our besetting sins. However, this isn't who \nwe have to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, far too many failed to live up to their promise of speaking \ntruth to power. During the 2016 election, and at many points since, \nmany evangelicals justified their full-throated support by promising \nto be a check on Trumps character. What has become apparent is that \nthis promise was hollow. Too few were willing to speak out regularly \nand often couched their criticism so much it lacked any weight. When \nevangelicals finally had access to the White House, they seemed \nunable or unwilling to use their prophetic voice to speak truth to \npower.\u0014\n\u0014\nWatergate figure, and later evangelical leader, Chuck Colson once \nsaid:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I served under President Nixon, one of my jobs was to work with \nspecial-interest groups, including religious leaders. We would invite \nthem to the White House, wine and dine them, take them on cruises \naboard the presidential yacht.  Ironically, few were more easily \nimpressed than religious leaders. The very people who should have \nbeen immune to the worldly pomp seemed most vulnerable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was us.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, all of us have failed to foster healthy political \ndiscipleship. The foundation of our reckoning was laid far before \nTrump. Committed to reaching the world, the evangelical movement has \nemphasized the evangelistic and pietistic elements of the mission. \nHowever, it has failed to connect this mission to justice and \npolitics.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe result of this discipleship failure has led us to a place where \nnot only our people but also many of our leaders were easily fooled \nand co-opted by a movement that ended with the storming of the U.S. \nCapitol.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat comes next \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the root of these three causes lies our inability to live up to \nour calling as evangelicals: to righteously, prophetically and \ncompassionately proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. Our \nreckoning is not because we have lost worldly power but because of \nwhat we betrayed to attain and sustain it in the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have been working on a book on evangelicalism for three years, and \nit has been one of the most frustrating projects in my life. At its \ncore, the problem is not in diagnosing the illness but in prescribing \nthe cure. Where do we go? What do we do? How can the evangelical \nmovement navigate this reckoning?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn listening and praying, Ive found myself coming back to Martin \nLuthers words: Toward those who have been misled, we are to show \nourselves parentally affectionate, so that they may perceive that we \nseek not their destruction but their salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't believe that everyone who voted for Trump was fooled or \nfoolish. And Trump voters are not Trump. They are not responsible for \nall of his actions over the past four years, but they are responsible \nfor the ways they responded and for their own hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the evangelical movement is to flourish in the coming generations, \nwe must face (and even embrace) this reckoning. As leaders and \nmembers, we must acknowledge our failings but also understand the \nhabits and idols that drew us to Trump in the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat we have failed and been fooled is disheartening but not \nsurprising. The true test will be how we respond when our idols are \nrevealed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWill we look inside and repent when needed, or will we double down? \nEvery political and cultural instinct will pull us to the latter, but \nGod calls us to the former. Into this temptation we hear the words of \nJesus: For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and \nforfeits his soul? (Matthew 16:26).\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have reached a reckoning. What comes next will reveal where our \ntrust truly lies.\u0014\n\u0014\nEd Stetzer is a dean and professor at Wheaton College, where he also \nleads the Wheaton College Billy Graham Center.\u0014",

    "words": "Every Pilgrim's Story, by John Bunyan\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotaations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel.

    "title": "END TIMES PROPHECY AND WHY SO MUCH DIFFERENCE",
    "words": "End Times Prophecy and Why There Is So Much Disagreement \u0014\nPosted: 11 Mar 2021 12:00 PM PST\u0014\n \u0014\nMost of us have probably gone through a period in our Christian lives \n(or are still there) when we thought about little else than what the \nBible says about end times prophecy. In this post, Dr. Michael Heiser \noffers his thoughts on why there is so much disagreement on the topic \nof biblical eschatology.\u0014\n\u0014\nI recall how, shortly after I became a Christian as a high school \nstudent, the timetable for the tribulation period and the rapture \nbecame an obsession. To date myself, it was right around the time \nwhen Hal Lindseys Late Great Planet Earth was made into a movie. \nWhile I know some people who came to the Lord because of that film \nand its end times trajectory, my path toward becoming a biblical \nscholar showed me that discerning exact end times details wasnt a \nfruitful use of my time.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow having taught eschatology at a Bible college many times, I know \nthat not only was Jesus unsure of precisely when he would return \n(Matt 24:36), but we arent going to figure that out any time soon \neither. No end times scheme is self-evident (or biblical as \nadherents like to say). There are intentional ambiguities in the \nbiblical text when it comes to prophecy. And by intentional I mean \nthat prophecy is deliberately cryptic. There were very good reasons \nwhy, even after the resurrection, the disciples had a hard time \nunderstanding what was going on (Luke 24:4445).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy is end times prophecy so unclear?\u0014\n\u0014\nI wrote about why prophecy regarding the messiahs first incarnation \nwas intentionally obscure in my best-selling book, The Unseen Realm: \nRecovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible. Similarly, \nmessianic prophecy surrounding the second arrival is also hard to \ndetermine with any certainty; but I didnt lay out that case in my \nbook. Instead, I saved that discussion for a Mobile Ed course, \nProblems in Bible Interpretation: Why Do Christians Disagree about \nthe End Times? In this course, I work through several examples of why \nevery position on end times has significant uncertainties and, more \nimportantly, why that ought to compel us to be gracious and \ncharitable toward believers with whom we disagree.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea that the Bibles teaching about end times is not \nself-evidentthat you cant just study the Bible and get a clear, \nbeyond-any-reasonable-doubt answer to whats going to happenmay be \nnew to some readers. If so, you need only to spend some time studying \nother views of end times besides your own. Dont fear such an \nenterprise; its good for you. Youll discover that biblical passages \nrelated to eschatology really can be read in more than one way. The \nfact is that all of the end times systems look beautiful and \nelegantuntil their assumptions are challenged by other systems. All \nend times reconstructions cheat where they have to in order to take \ncare of problems (i.e. passages that raise the possibility the \nsystem could be wrong). Thats just the way things are. And in my \nview, God intended that to be the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nIllustrating the ambiguities\u0014\n\u0014\nIts not difficult to demonstrate from Scripture that beliefs about \nthe end times lack certainty. Lets take the question of the nature \nof the kingdom of God. Many Christians default to a future earthly \nmillennial reign when they see or hear that phrase. But Paul viewed \nChristians as already having been put into the kingdom (Col. 1:13). \nThe apostles regularly linked the gospel with the kingdom of God \n(Acts 8:12; 28:30-31). The kingdom is an already-present reality in \nthe book of Revelation (Rev. 1:6; 5:10) before one ever gets to the \nmillennium passage in Revelation 20:16.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason a literal millennial kingdom is expected by so many is \nbecause of the land promise given to Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; 15:17-20). \nSince a specific land was promised to the people of Godthe children \nof Abrahamand those promises were unconditional, then, so the \nreasoning goes, the future kingdom promises are tied to the physical \nland of Israel and ethnic Jews. But were the promises of Abraham \nunconditional? Not according to Genesis 17, where inheritance of the \nland is promised with a conditionfaithfulness to Yahweh of Israel:\u0014\n\u0014\n1When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and \nsaid to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, \n2that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you \ngreatly. . . . 8And I will give to you and to your offspring after \nyou the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an \neverlasting possession, and I will be their God.\u0014\nGenesis 22 echoes the same idea:\u0014\n\u0014\n15And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from \nheaven 16 and said, By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, \nbecause you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only \nson, 17I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your \noffspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the \nseashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies . \n. . 18and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be \nblessed, because you have obeyed my voice.\u0014\nIn addition, the land described by God to Abraham (Gen 15:18-19; \nExod. 23:31) aligns very closely to the land brought under the \ndominion of Israel at the time of Solomon (1 Kings 4:21). The \nimplication would be that the land promise to Israel was fulfilled in \nSolomons dayso theres no need to expect a future fulfillment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on the other side of the issue, there are relevant rebuttal \nquestions. First, while the Abrahamic covenant had conditions, does \nthat mean that it was also unconditional? Paradoxically, yes. Parsing \nthe covenant exegetically leaves one with the realization that it was \nindeed unconditional (God would have a people and a kingdomincluding \nan earthly onebecause thats what he wants), but how that \nunconditional purpose was accomplished, and what people participated \nin those purposes, depended on loyalty to Yahweh. One could not \nworship another god, or no god at all, and expect to be part of Gods \nfamily and kingdom at any time, including the future.\u0014\nSecond, while the land boundaries align well with Solomons kingdom, \nthere are actually differing boundary descriptions of the Promised \nLand in the Old Testament (i.e., they arent consistently the same). \nSome of these do not conform to Solomons dominion. Does that matter \nfor the kingdom promise? It may well, but we cannot know for sure.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider a different example: the rapture. When you study all the \npossible references to what has to describe the return of the messiah \n(given Jesus identification as messiah) the descriptions do not \nmatch in all details. In some, Jesus touches down on earth (Zech. \n14:4) and comes as a warrior (Rev. 19:1116). But in others, Jesus is \nsaid to return in the air to take believers, living and dead, with \nhim (1 Thess. 4:1618). While the content of all the passages is \nclosely related (Jesus returns), if the Bible student makes the \ndecision to keep these descriptions separated, two returns of Jesus \nemerge, one of which has been described as the rapture, and the other \nthe second coming. But is this the way we handle divergent wordings \nelsewhere in the Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\nRarely. When two closely related incidents or conversations in the \nGospels disagree, Christians nearly universally say the solution is \nto harmonize the passages. Adopting that common strategy when it \ncomes to passages about a messianic return systematically eliminates \na rapture since the decision to harmonize produces only one return. \nSo the question becomes, are you a splitter, or a joiner? The Bible \ncontains no instruction manual for helping us make this choicewe are \nleft with ambiguity on the issue.\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELICAL DIFFERENCES, WORTH FIGHTING OVER?",
    "words": "\u0014\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN EVANGELICALISM AND ARE THEY WORTH \nFIGHTING OVER?\u0014\nII Tim. 2:14-15\u0014\n\u0014\n  Evangelical is a term you must know if you are going to be literate \nabout the world of religion in general and Christianity in \nparticular. Note, please, that its not \"angelical\" but \n\"evangelical.\" It is a historical term within Christianity that has \nhad a large variety of meanings. It essentially began in the 18th \ncentury, especially in Germany, as a reaction to the rigid orthodoxy \nof post-Reformation Lutheranism and Calvinism. It was generally \ncalled Pietism. Please note that word also. It also originated in \nEngland as a reaction against the sterility and dying state of the \nestablished churches. The religious awakenings of George Whitefield \nand John Wesley and the rise of Methodism were all parts of the 18th \ncentury evangelicalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 19th century, it came to America as a result of the Great \nAwakening (1740s) and spread throughout the world by way of \nmissionaries. Evangelicals, unlike the old established churches, \nstressed justification by faith alone, the priesthood of believers, \nand the sinful depravity of humankind, set in the biblical context of \ndivine grace and forgiveness through the death of Christ. Strongly \nindividualistic in character, evangelicalism emphasized personal \ncommitment to God by a conversion experience. They often \noveremphasized the emotional side of the experience but always \ninsisted that it should result in a personal, moral and spiritual \ntransformation evidenced in disciplined living, strict morality, \nfervent personal prayer, and pious works of charity and service.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicalism has achieved great things. The movement was chiefly \nresponsible for winning legislation against slavery, especially the \nslave trade, for prison reform, opposition to work on Sunday, and the \nprohibition of gambling and alcoholic beverages wherever possible.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicalism has had its critics. We have often been chided for an \nextreme individualism, failing to support the fullness of the church. \nAnother criticism has been about the heavy emphasis on emotionalism. \nIt has been faulted, and justly so, for its poor record on social \naction, at least in the past. Its emphasis on literally interpreting \nthe Bible has often been an embarrassment to educated believers. Its \ngreatest criticism has, perhaps, been that it has an air of spiritual \nsuperiority to it, the attitude that we have arrived at the truth and \nall others are in varying degrees still struggling with it. It has \noften implied or said that those who do not agree with us are \nheretics or at least second class Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaptists, Methodists, some Presbyterians, Churches of Christ, \nIndependent groups, and some others are considered to be among the \nevangelicals. Evangelicals are and have always been a minority within \nthe Christian faith, a very small minority, as a matter of fact.\u0014\n\u0014\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN EVANGELICALISM?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist\u0014\n\u0014\nIn any movement, there is the far right--not the right, the far \nright. In any movement, the far right is referred to as the \nFundamentalist side. E.g. Khomeni is leader of the Fundamentalist \nsect (the Shiites) of Islam. There is such a  group, whose name I \ncannot spell or pronounce, among the Hindus headquartered in Bombay. \nAmong the Sikhs, we read nearly every day about their Fundamentalist \nleaders killing someone or ordering them killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalism as a branch of Christianity is really quite young. It \nstarted in the late 1870s as a reaction against the study of the \nBible in a scientific way. Fundamentalists were not willing for \nscholars to evaluate the manuscripts from which we got our Bible. \nThey do not seem to know or want to know of the wide divergence in \nthe text of thousands of the biblical manuscripts. They resented, and \nstill do, the application of serious study that questions the long \nunquestioned authorship of the books of the bible. Scholars who \nreally know the ancient languages and have done extensive study in \nthem have some problems with Moses being the author of a book that \ntells about his own death. Fundamentalists tend to give very simple \nanswers to very difficult questions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom 1909 until 1915 the Fundamentalists published a series of \npamphlets called the Fundamentals, which attempted to stress the need \nfor retaining the old doctrines. They included: (1) The inerrancy of \nthe bible, (2) the Virgin Birth of Christ, (3) Christ's atoning death \nfor sin, (4) His resurrection from the dead, and (5) belief in his \nmiracles. Another group added (6) the premillenial return of Christ. \nFew evangelicals have any problems with these first five provided \nthere is some room for discussion about what is meant by \"inerrant.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem with the fundamentalist, however, is that he/she is not \nwilling to let anyone else define the issue being discussed. Dr. E. \nJ. Carnell, now deceased but a highly respected evangelical scholar \nwho came from a fundamentalist background, said, \"It is a highly \nideological attitude. It is intransigent and inflexible: ...This \nattitude helps to explain its crusade against the Revised Standard \nVersion of the Bible. ...Fundamentalists believe that liberals \ncorrupt whatever they touch. \"\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalists love to stress \"the Old Time Religion.\" That has an \nodd appeal to a lot of people. Most people don't brag about their old \ntime chemistry, their old time history, their old time medicine, or \ntheir old time education, but many get a strangely warm feeling \ntalking about their old time religion. When that is put in its true \nperspective, it means, \"Don't tell me anything I don't already know \nor that I haven't heard of. It's very disturbing to think that I may \nhave to change my mind about something.\" Fundamentalists have an \nongoing war with science and education. They see every scientist as \nan enemy and every educator as a potential enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalists are given to very authoritative statements. E.g., a \npast president of the Southern Baptist Convention, Jerry Vines, said \nbefore the convention in St. Louis, in 1987, \"When some of the \nbrethren get back to where they ought to be, they'll be where I am.\" \nAnother example is the already referred-to statement by Adrian \nRogers, past president of the SBC, \"If Southern Baptists believe that \npickles have souls, that's what the seminaries ought to be teaching.\" \nAnother is Bailey Smith's recent pronouncement that \"you cannot marry \nhigh church music and a burden for souls.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI have never known a Fundamentalist (and I came out of a \nFundamentalist background) who was not convinced that he had ALL of \nthe truth. All you need to do is ask. The centerpiece of the \nFundamentalist's faith is his Scofield Bible, that is, the true \ncard-carrying Fundamentalist. All Scofield Bibles have the same page \nnumbering. \u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some accurate evaluations of the fundamentalist evangelical \nand the moderate evangelical, given by persons who are evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nScientist Richard Bube: \"The evangelical is committed to the entire \ntruth or God even if he is not sure what all the details are. The \nfundamentalist is sure or what all the details are.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSociologist David Moberg: \"Fundamentalists have rigid views, assuming \nthat there is only one correct interpretation of the past, future and \nunclear events and details in the Bible, while evangelicals are \nopen...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Vernon Grounds, who retired as president of Conservative Baptist \nSeminary, Denver: \"Fundamentalism is not enough fun, too much damn \nand too little mental. \"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Ed. Yamauchi, teacher, talks about fundamentalism's \"dogmatically \nhostile attitude toward science.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  Joe Bayly, popular evangelical columnist: \"Fundamentalists vote \nRepublican. Some evangelicals vote Democrat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Hatfield, former congressman: \"The evangelical is one who has \nhad a life- changing experience with Jesus Christ at such a depth \nthat it affects all areas of life, intellectual, emotional, social, \nas well as spiritual. ...The Fundamentalist is one whose experience \nwith Christ is primarily focused on personal salvation, often to the \nexclusion of deep intellectual, social and emotional growth.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamentalists, like most extreme right-wing groups, have a \nbrainwashing effect on their adherents, especially the young. I grew \nup in a fundamentalist setting, was trained in many of their ways. I \nwould have cut your throat for Jesus' sake and received a great deal \nof praise for my dedication. It can be very hard to change. Many have \nrecognized this. In 1985 Fundamentalists Anonymous was formed to help \ndissatisfied fundamentalists get out of the movement and deal with \nthe internal struggles that can accompany such a departure. They now \nhave at least 28 chapters throughout the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Liberal\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps we should see one extreme against the other and then look at \nthe middle. The liberal evangelical is still to be understood in \ncontext. He is not the same as an unbeliever who rejects the faith \nand the person and work of Christ.\u0014\nThe liberal evangelical is one who, while holding the basic tenets of \nthe faith, believes that our basic thrust should be social action. He \nis the one who marches in the streets against further defense \nspending because he thinks we are spending too much money aimed at \nkilling people. He would be marching in protest against the Viet Nam \nwar or any other war. He would be writing letters and attending \nrallies supporting amnesty for deserters.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe would probably be one volunteering to work in soup kitchens and \nalmost certainly would be one opposing capital punishment on any \ngrounds. His greatest secondary commitment is to ''...as you did it \nunto one of the least of these my brethren, you did it unto me\" \n(Matt. 25:40).\u0014\n\u0014\nSojourners and The Other Side magazines are examples of the \nconservative's \"liberal\" side. NOW PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS A VAST \nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS LIBERAL AND A CLASSIC LIBERAL SUCH AS ROBERT \nALLEY, OF THE UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND FAME, HARRY EMERSON FOSDICK AND \nOTHERS. The classic liberal disavows the scripture as authoritative \nin any manner. He generally regards it as meaningless myth and \nsuperstitious pious pap. He does not accept any of the five \nfundamentals of the faith in any form. Fortunately few of them remain \nin the evangelical framework, and those that do are an embarrassment \nto believers everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fundamentalist, on the other hand, wants anyone who disagrees \nwith him to be seen as a classic liberal. It just isn't so. Before we \ngo any further, then, please understand the difference between an \nevangelical liberal and a classic philosophical liberal. As a Muslim, \nin referring to the Ayatollah Khomeni and mainline Islam, said to me \nin Srinagar, Kashmir, \" All fingers are not alike.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Moderate\u0014\n\u0014\nHe/she is absolutely willing, without reservation, to espouse the \nfive fundamentals proposed by the Fundamentalists. Moderates do \ninsist, however, that by \"inerrant\" you do not mean \"literally \ninerrant.\" \"Literal\" means \"that which is of exact meaning, verbatim, \nfollowing the exact words or letter, scrupulously to the letter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe moderate is not willing to accept an interpretation of the Bible \nthat is \"scrupulously word for word\" for two reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\n(1) It is contrary to the nature of basic communication. Most people, \nwhen they speak or write, are not trying to draw up a contract. They \nare simply trying to convey a basic thought. To insist that every \nword of every sentence be dictionary precise is simply not experience \nor common sense. I heard recently of a church that burned. Actually, \none room and part of another was damaged. Am I then going to conclude \nthat the person who told me was lying about it? It is, from a \nscrupulously word-for-word perspective, a deliberate untruth. But no \nintelligent person would read it that way. Poetic language is called \npoetic language because, in fact, it must not be interpreted \"word \nfor word.\" To interpret the Bible \"word for word\" is to cheapen its \nmessage and beauty.\u0014\n\u0014\n(2) The facts do not support a \"scrupulously word for word\" rendering \nof the text. To be a literal inerrantist, you MUST (you do not have \nan intellectually honest alternative) believe that the world is flat, \nthree-storied, and square, with a hood over the top of it NOW. The \nperson who says, \"I believe the Bible is literally true, but I don't \nbelieve the earth is flat, three-storied, and square\" is either \nintellectually dishonest or they are irrational. The ultimate test of \na fundamentalist is to ask him, \"Do you believe the first eleven \nchapters of Genesis are literally true?\" Now, hear what I said, and \ndon't hear what I didn't say...\"Do you believe that they are \nliterally true?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nI believe that the first eleven chapters of Genesis are true, \nabsolutely true in what they teach, but not literally true. If you \nbelieve they are literally true, you have no alternative but to \nbelieve the earth is only 4000 years old. Little children know better \nthan that. Xian, China has a written history of over 5000 years. You \nhave no alternative but to believe that the entire universe came into \nexistence in seven days. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn doing my Emergency Medical Technician training a few years ago, I \nwas utterly amazed and embarrassed to find that several people in the \nclass, because of their reading of Genesis 2, thought that women had \none less rib than men. This is not intended to be funny; it is the \nsad truth I am telling you.\u0014\n\u0014\nModerates are not willing to agree that every part of scripture is \ncrystal clear and that there are no question marks as to what they \nmean or how they are to be interpreted. Moderates insist that the \nscripture came to us in history (and that, in my opinion, is one of \nits greatest evidences of God's inspiration) and must be seen in that \nlight. There is no other way you can explain or accept Psalm 137:9 \n\"Happy shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against \nthe rock!\" Don't tell me to accept that literally as coming from my \nHeavenly Father. That is immoral, illegal, and criminal in any way \nyou look at it if it has to be interpreted literally or even \npoetically. My Heavenly Father does not enjoy or allow us to enjoy \nbashing little babies' heads against the rocks for any reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nModerates insist that the revealing power of the Holy Spirit brings \nNEW LIGHT to the scripture to make it alive and allow it to speak to \nevery generation. Now don't misread me, please. The truth doesn't \nchange, but often our understanding of it does. Fundamentalists are \nnot willing to grant that. \"The Old Time Religion\" rules out anything \nnew. I believe the Bible is as fresh as the morning dew and that God \nhas truth to unfold to us that we have never dreamed of.\u0014\n\u0014\nModerates know and are willing to admit that what has so often been \n\"the truth and nothing but the truth\" has turned out to be misguided \nat best and a lie at worst. Pull out sermons of hundreds of the \npreachers of the 18th and 19th centuries and find them \"proving by \nthe book\" that slavery was right and furthermore \"of God.\" What \nlooked like truth to them was nothing more than theological garbage. \u0014\n\u0014\nTake our Regular Baptist forefathers and their interpretation of a \nfew verses of the Bible about predestination, for another example. \nThey fought missions on the basis of that interpretation and the \nSunday School, but they were wrong. They meant well, but they were \nwrong, and the Spirit of God eventually made that clear to the \nbelievers who were gathered around them. But AT THE TIME (1787) they \nruled the day.\u0014\n\u0014\nModerates can see that there are many contradictions in the text of \nscripture but see them in the larger context of the word and do not \nfind them a problem. Fundamentalists cover them up or try desperately \nto explain them away. You should have seen the notes I had as a young \npreacher to explain away why in one gospel Jesus said \"Don't take \nanything with you\" and in another account of the same experience said \n\"Take a staff with you.\" Or why in one he tells the healed not to \ntell anyone, and in another account of the same event he says \"Go \nshow yourself to the priests.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2 Sam. 10:18 David is reported to have killed 700 Aramean chariot \nwarriors, but in the 1 Chronicles 19:18 account of the same battle, \nhe killed 7000.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inscription on the cross is slightly different in all of the \ngospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew, Mark, and Luke record that Jesus cleansed the Temple at the \nend of his ministry; John says it was a beginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn three of the gospels, the roof through which the crippled man was \nlowered to the feet of Jesus was a typical Palestinian roof made of \nmud and sticks. But in Luke's gospel, the Gentile author wrote that \nthe roof was made of tile, the kind of roof he and his people knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nGen. 17:35 records that Ishmael was 13 years old when Isaac was born. \nGen. 21:14-15 indicates he was only a baby in Hagar's arms when he \nwas driven in to the wilderness.\u0014\n\u0014\nLev. 11:6 and Deut. 14:7 are biologically untrue. A rabbit does not \nchew his cud. The mustard seed (Mark 4:21) is not the smallest of \nseeds.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this designed to put down the Bible? Absolutely not! It is \ndesigned to put down the Fundamentalist pharisaism that will not look \nat the facts, and it was designed to remind you that one of the chief \nreasons Jesus was crucified was because he challenged the verbal \ninerrancy of his day. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me put it bluntly: Moderates are people of faith, but they are \nnot willing to check their brain at the schoolhouse door or in the \nvestibule of the church. They believe with all their hearts that \nJesus died to take away our sin, not our intelligence. They do not \nconfuse faith with gullibility, and they are willing to stand before \nthe judgment bar of God with their faith and do so with a clear \nconscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the differences within evangelicalism simply put. I am \nconvinced that they are the truth as I see it and as I experienced it \nas a Fundamentalist. Is it worth fighting over? I would normally say, \n\"No! Not really.\" But this time it is. Why? Because the \nFundamentalists have gained control of the machinery to turn every \nagency of the Southern Baptist Convention into an extreme right \ngroup. That is bad enough. Extreme right groups come and go, wax and \nwane in their popularity, but when you change institutions it's hard \nto get them back in the middle of the road. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome correction was necessary in the direction of some of our \nseminaries, but that was minor, and you don't throw the baby out with \nthe bathwater.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy call to Southern Baptists is for them to become knowledgeable \nabout what has happened in our denomination and not let it move into \nour state convention of into our churches.  Freedom to think was \nexpensive to get, but only God knows what it will cost to have to get \nit back.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Dr. Fred R. Skaggs  1986\u0014",

    "title": "EDITH STEIN GASSED AT AUSCHWITZ",
    "words": "Edith Stein Gassed at Auschwitz\u0014\n \u0014\nBORN JEWISH, Edith Stein had drifted into atheism. Studying to become \na teacher in the early twentieth century, she found only a great \ninward emptiness. She took a class in psychology, hoping to find \nmeaning, but was disappointed because her teachers believed only in \nthose things which could be defined and studied statistically. and \nscientifically. \u0014\n\u0014\nCertain that there had to be more to human beings than chemicals, \nelectrical impulses, and tissues, Stein searched through literature \nand philosophy for answers and discovered the work of Edmund Husserl. \nHusserl taught that mental and spiritual events are real and that \nmany things can be understood only by intuition. It seemed to be what \nStein was looking for. She became Husserls assistant. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut while studying at the University of Gttingen, she met Christians \nand found their thought richer than Husserls. A Christian widow \nasked her to organize her late husbands papers, in which Stein read \nmany references to Christ. To understand these, Stein read the New \nTestament. Now convinced Jesus was divine, she wrestled with which \nchurch to join. Reading the autobiography of fiery Spanish mystic \nTeresa of Avila convinced her to adopt Catholicism. She became a nun, \ntaking as her new name Teresa, Blessed by the Cross. Her family \nrejected her. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the coming of World War II, Stein saw that she endangered fellow \nnuns in her convent by remaining in Germany, since she was ethnically \nJewish. She moved to the Netherlands, followed by her sister Rosa, \nwho had also converted to Christianity. \u0014\nEdith Stein could have escaped the gas chamber. The Catholic church \nhad found a place for her in Switzerland. However, none could be \nfound for Rosa. Stein loyally stayed with her sister, so both were in \nthe Netherlands on 2 August 1942 when the Nazis arrested Catholic \nJews. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis arrest was in retaliation against the Catholic bishops of the \nNetherlands, who a week before had read their people a letter \nprotesting persecution of Jews. This letter also included a telegram \nfrom ten other Christian denominations. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo SS officers knocked on the Carmelite convent door at 5:00 pm. \nStein was working on her book The Science of the Cross. Thinking the \nofficers had come about visas, the prioress sent Stein downstairs to \nspeak with them. She was ordered to be ready to leave in five \nminutes. In the street a crowd gathered, calling the act an outrage. \nRosa grew disoriented. Edith touched her hand and said, Come, Rosa, \nwere going for our people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nazis whisked them to police headquarters and around midnight \nsent them to a camp at Amersfoort. The next night they were \ntransported to Westerbork. From there they were shipped to Auschwitz \nwith many others, arriving on this day, 9 August 1942. An SS doctor \nseparated out whomever he considered fit for work. Edith, Rosa, and \ntwo hundred and sixty two other Jews were immediately driven to two \ncottages where they were told to undress so they could shower and be \ndeloused. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Steins entered one of the cottages. Curiously, they noticed it \nhad no windows. Some of the group panicked, guessing what lay in \nstore. As many as possible were shoved inside. Anyone who balked was \nshot on the spot. Guards bolted shut the air-tight doors and \ndischarged Zyklon-B gas into the room through ceiling vents. Within \ntwenty minutes all 264 were dead. \u0014\n\u0014\nEdith Stein's life and writings, centered on the cross, have inspired \nmany Christians. In October 1998, Pope John Paul II declared her a \nsaint.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAugust 9,1945\u0014\n\u0014\nThe United States drops an atomic bomb on Urakami (Nagasaki), killing \nmany Christians. One who survived was Fujie. She found her cousin \nSojiro so burned she could only guess who he was from the shape of \nhis lips. Ah, Fujie, he said. Take me to the church...I want to \nconfess to the father. I want the sacrament. After helping him to \nthe priest, she went back to search for her mother but discovered \nthat the elderly woman, who had spent much of her time in prayer, had \nbeen vaporized.\u0014",

    "title": "ELIZABETH WRIGHT OVERCAME FEARSOME OBSTACLES",
    "words": "ELIZABETH EVELYN WRIGHT OVERCAME FEARSOME OBSTACLES TO EDUCATE HER \nFOLK\u0014\n\u0014\nELIZABETH EVELYN WRIGHT was frail and sickly all her life. Indeed, \nshe died when just thirty-four years old. However, she made her few \nyears count to the full. Despite violent opposition, she left a \nlegacy of unconquered faith and astonishing accomplishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWright was born in Georgia shortly after the Civil War freed slaves \nand her early education was, at best, defective. Her first teacher \ncould not even teach her to read. Little provision was then made to \neducate blacks in the South. As both her mother, Virginia, a \nCherokee, and her father, Wesley Wright, an African American, had \nbeen slaves, her prospects did not look good.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when Elizabeth Wright was ten, her family moved to a town \nwith a better-trained teacher. She eagerly imbibed knowledge. Then \ncame a coincidence that set the course of her life. When she was \nfourteen, as she sat under a tree,  gusts of wind lifted and tossed a \npiece of newspaper out of a ditch, bringing it by little hops close \nto her. Curious, she picked up the animated scrap and read an \nadvertisement for Tuskugee Industrial School in Alabama. Enthralled, \nshe showed her teacher. The kind lady contacted Tuskugees founder, \nBooker T. Washington, in Wrights behalf and also raised funds to \nassist the girl to go to school. Wright herself took odd jobs and \nsaved every penny she could.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer family, however, was dead set against the project. Wrights \nteacher had to plead with them again and again before they \nreluctantly agreed to allow the now fifteen-year-old girl to travel \nalone to the southern school.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Tuskugee, Wright was impressed by the schools educational model. \nI was at Tuskegee only a short time before I made up my mind to try \nand be the same type of woman as Mr. Washington was of a man. \nTuskugee required its students to earn their keep through work. \nWrights health was so frail it crumbled under the regimen. It \nappeared she would have to drop out. Fortunately for her, Judge \nGeorge W. Kelley of Massachusetts provided her a scholarship. She \ncould stay. She bent every energy to learning how Tuskugee was \noperated with the idea of founding a similar institute to provide \npractical education to black children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eight years that followed after she left Tuskugee were years of \nhardship and disappointment. She immediately set up a school in South \nCarolina. With no salary and little or nothing to eat, she trudged \ndusty roads in shabby clothes, seeking support and funds while her \nclose friend Hattie Davidson taught a few pupils. Time after time \nWrights foes burned her buildings or raised opposition. Several \ntimes she had to retire to a sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, to \nregain her health.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, in 1897, conditions came together in Denmark, South \nCarolina, allowing Wright to realize her dream. Despite the \nopposition of a local pastor, she was able to found an industrial \nschool on the lines of Tuskugee. Popular state senator S. G. Mayfield \nassisted her, knowing full well he would never be voted to higher \noffice once he helped establish a school for blacks. In 1901 Ralph \nand Elizabeth H. Voorhees began making large financial contributions \nto the work. The following year, the school was renamed Voorhees \nIndustrial School in honor of its benefactors.\u0014\n\u0014\nWright emphasized Christianity. I was a Christian when I went to \nTuskegee and the prayer-meetings on Friday evenings strengthened me \nand helped to prepare me for the religious work which I have to do \nfor the students of this school, she wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1906 Wright married the schools bookkeeper, Martin Menafee. She \nenjoyed her marriage only a few months. Weakened by years of hunger, \noverwork, and mental stress, her health failed. She traveled again to \nBattle Creek, where, after a failed operation, she died on this day, \n14 December 1906. Her body was brought back to Voorhees for \ninterment. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "ELIZA GEORGE DIDN'T HAVE IT EASY, BUT PERSISTED IN GOD'S WORK\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Eliza Davis George was in her late sixties, the Baptist mission \nthat was sponsoring her work in Liberia forcibly retired her. She \nconsulted the Lord and was sure he wasnt ready for her to retire. \nAnd so Eliza George convinced admirers to set up clubs to support her \nand returned to Sinoe County, Liberia. Despite a hideous sore on one \nleg that never healed, she continued to trek from village to village \ninto her nineties. With characteristic good humor, she described \nwalking as traveling by ankle express.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizas work in Liberia can be said to have begun in 1911. \nHardworking and determined, she had become a teacher at a Christian \ncollege in Texas. On this day, 2 February 1911, a mission-minded \nspeaker challenged the school in chapel. Eliza had a vision of \nAfricans passing before the judgment seat of Christ, weeping and \nmoaning, But no one ever told us You died for us. She immediately \ndeclared her intention to go to Africa. Faculty members attempted to \ndissuade her: plenty of work remained to do in America. One even told \nher You dont have the money, and we ministers stand between you and \nthe people to keep you from getting the money!\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Eliza was nothing if not stubborn where the Lords will was \nconcerned. It would take her two years to convince the college to \nrelease her from her job and to convince a Baptist mission to support \nher. In a moving appeal, she even won over her chief opponent. \nFinally in 1913 she sailed for Liberia, underfunded but determined to \nwin souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the colony, well-wishers tried to convince her to settle in the \ncapital, Monrovia. She insisted on going where need was greater, two \nhundred miles away, although conditions would be far more difficult \nfor her. With fellow missionary Susie Taylor, she founded an \nindustrial school to teach practical skills as well as reading, \nwriting, and arithmetic. Within two years, she had over fifty \nstudents and had seen over one thousand African villagers come to \nChrist. Wracked by continual fever, Taylor returned to the United \nStates, leaving Eliza alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring World War I, Eliza suffered from a lack of funding and \nsupplies. Often she and her students were reduced to scavenging for \nwild growths they could scarcely gag down. When her mission \ndisbanded, she was able to remain in Africa only by marrying G. \nThompson George, a missionary doctor. He proved to be an alcoholic. \nWhen Eliza found it repugnant to have marital intimacy with him, he \nturned to other women. Nonetheless, he enabled her to continue her \ngospel work and relieved her of many managerial demands during their \ntwenty-one-year marriage until he died in 1939.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn those early decades, every time the pair started a work, they had \nto leave it. When they returned, the buildings would be eaten by \ntermites or reclaimed by jungle. However, the seeds of faith planted \nin Elizas students persisted, and eventually her young people became \npreachers, teachers, and missionaries, assistants in many endeavors.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1940, desperate for the money to pay her bills, she learned that \n$200 had been mistakenly sent to Monrovia. With two young students, \nshe trekked the two hundred miles to Monrovia, following the hot \nsands of Liberias coast. By the time she arrived exhausted at her \ndestination, her mind was sometimes wandering. She learned that the \nmoney had been returned to the United States. No course was open to \nher but to turn around and begin the long trek back. By diligent \nprayer she got through those difficult days.\u0014\nShe was over seventy when she built her last station on land \nconsidered cursed by the local tribe. It proved to be her most \nsuccessful and lasting work. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the greatest miracles of her life happened when she was in her \nseventies. A Liberian doctor told her she had to return the United \nStates at once or lose her sight. She prayed and checked the post \noffice. A sum sufficient for travel had arrived. Although the \npassenger ship had left two days earlier, a cargo vessel agreed to \ntake her. She arrived in time and her surgery was successful.  \u0014\n\u0014\nNew missionaries came to Africa to replace her when she was in her \nnineties. They expected to find her brittle and overbearing. Instead \nthey found a woman full of good humor and deep spirituality, still \nfasting and praying as she faced needs.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Every Pilgrim's Story, by John Bunyan\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL    May 3, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotaations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel. Pilgrim made it safely to the \nCelestial City by heeding and believing that message.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan, John. Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.

    "words": "EMPEROR THEODOSIUS DEFINED THE CONTENT OF CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to \nour Clemency and Moderation should continue to profess that religion \nwhich was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter.\" \u0014\n .\u0014\nOn this day, 27 February 380 (or the 28th), Emperor Theodosius \ndecreed that one and only one version of Christianity was \nacceptablethe version held by Damasus, bishop of Rome and Peter, \nBishop of Alexandria. Theodosiuss edict proceeded to define what \nwould be considered true Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, \nlet us believe in the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy \nSpirit in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the \nfollowers of this law to assume the title of Catholic Christians. . . \n.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nArians and other adherents to false doctrines attacked the full \ndivinity of Christ. This is what Theodosius opposed. Anyone who \ndeviated from trinitarian Christianity was a heretic and subject to \npenalties:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"... but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish \nmadmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious \nname of heretics and shall not presume to give to their conventicles \nthe name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the \nchastisement of the divine condemnation and in the second the \npunishment of our authority that in accordance with the will of \nHeaven we shall decide to inflict.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn actuality, Theodosiuss bark was worse than his bite. He did not \npersecute individual heretics, although he confiscated the church \nbuildings of heretical groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheodosius was born in 347 into a Spanish Christian family. His \nfather was a successful Roman general and young Theodosius assisted \nas an aide in his wars. He demonstrated leadership when he led an \narmy that defeated the Sarmatians in battle in 374. When his father \nfell a victim to court intrigues, Theodosius withdrew to his family \nestates, but Emperor Gratian summoned him to court in 378. Theodosius \nquickly proved his military ability with another defeat of the \nSarmatians. In January 379, Gratian named him co-emperor.\u0014\n\u0014\nOperating primarily from Thessalonica, Theodosius saw that he could \nnot expel the Goths, and instead brought them under Roman \nsovereignty. In an attempt to settle religious disputes, he defined \nthe nature of Catholicism and called the Council of Constantinople \nwhich ratified his statement. He succeeded Gratian as emperor, and \nfought various usurpers to control the entire Roman Empire. He was \nthe last man to unite the east and west empires under one head.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most famous events of his life was a massacre at \nThessalonica in 390, after one of his generals was assassinated \nthere. Theodosius was in Milan at the time, and Milans renowned \nbishop, Ambrose, required him to do penance as a result of the \nmassacre before he could be readmitted to Communion. Theodosius \nreturned to the East soon afterward, but the rise of new rivals and \nan attempt to restore paganism in the West forced him to march again. \nHe died at Milan in 395 just a few months after a victory at Frigidus \nsecured his claim to be sole emperor. He was not yet fifty years old. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe empire split between his two sons immediately after his death. \nHis son Arcadius and grandson Theodosius II, reigning over the \nEastern Empire, also oversaw church councils, but his granddaughter \nPulcheria proved to be the most capable of his offspring. As regent \nto her younger brother Theodosius II and then as one of his \ncounselors, she defended Christian doctrine against monophysites and \nNestorians. Becoming empress in 450, she ruled with her husband \nMarcian and influenced the Council of Chalcedon that issued \nauthoritative declarations on the nature of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "An Antidote To A Contorted Picture Of The Past: Examining The \nLegacy Of My Old Kentucky Home\u0014\nby Edited Press Release|03.09.2022|\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did a minstrel song about the slave trade become a beloved \nmelody, a celebratory anthem, and an integral part of American \nfolklore and culture? In her trenchant new book, My Old Kentucky \nHome: The Astonishing Life and Reckoning of an Iconic American Song \n(Knopf; May 3, 2022), acclaimed historian Emily Bingham, explores the \ncompelling history of Stephen Foster's 1853 My Old Kentucky Home, \nwhich tried to present slavery as carefree while also telling a \nwrenching story of a man sold to die in the sugarcane fields of the \nDeep South. The songfor years sung by white men in blackface \nentertaining white audienceswas a sensation and has been with us \never since.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor almost two centuries, its lyrics and meaning have been protested, \naltered, mythologized in thousands of performancesfrom Bing Crosby \nto Bugs Bunny to John Prine and Prissy in Gone with the Windand \nenshrined as the state song of Kentucky. Every year at the world's \nmost important horse race, the Kentucky Derby, My Old Kentucky Home \nis sung by tens of thousands of nostalgic fans, almost all of them \nunknowingly conjuring a mythic version of a brutal past.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn My Old Kentucky Home, Bingham, a Louisville-native who grew up \ndown the road from the Churchill Downs racetrack, offers a deeply \nresearched and incisive biography of one of America's most iconic \nmelodies. In this rich, resonant history, we see the enduring ability \nto forget and deny the realities of slavery, and Bingham, by casting \nan unflinching eye on our cultural inheritance, leads us to the \npromise of a reckoning.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ&A With The Author, Emily Bingham\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Old Kentucky Home will be played at the start of this year's \nKentucky Derby, as it has been for many generations. What will you be \nthinking and feeling when you hear it this Spring?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo many times I remember getting teary-eyed singing along with My \nOld Kentucky Home on Derby Day. The historian Ira Berlin wrote that \nMemories  do not evoke skepticism  they demand loyalty. But we \nmust question them. I love so much about the Derby: the excitement of \nthe parties, placing bets, and those tremendous, gleaming horses. \nWhen I learned that My Old Kentucky Home was about slavery, I was \nembarrassed and confused. This book came from digging into the life \nstory of my state anthem, asking how and why we celebrate a song \nabout the selling of human beings. Traditions are about more than \ninertia. They often involve profit and a kind of emotional power. I \nhave come to believe that this sonic monument provides, for some of \nus, an almost tribal sense of wellbeing before the horses take off in \nthe longest continuously held sporting event in the nation. I wish \nChurchill Downs would choose another sound to accompany the horses' \nparade to the post; I think I know why they cling so hard.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fans who sing the song at Churchill Downs aren't representative \nof Kentucky as a whole. They are almost entirely white and wealthy \nenough to afford tickets to the race. What would you tell them about \nwhat the song represents?\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople from all over the country and the world come to Louisville for \nthe Derby. It's a dress-up event in the clubhouse, Millionaire's Row, \nand the posh skybox called The Mansion, but it's affordable for the \ninfield crowd, who will hear the stately pre-race anthem even if they \ndon't see a racehorse. The Kentucky Derby is a bucket list event and \neveryone is invited to put on a hat. This book is about a song with \nincredibly broad reach. Even before it was the quintessential Derby \nsong, My Old Kentucky Home crisscrossed the nation and circled the \nglobe with blackface minstrels, America's most notable \nnineteenth-century cultural invention. Created by Stephen Foster, a \nwhite man, about a Black Kentuckian sent from his family to die in \nthe Deep South, white men in black makeup sang it on stages \neverywhere. Audiences found it charming, sentimental, even amusing. \nIf we read all three of Foster's stanzas, the horrific words in no \nway match the breathless pre-race excitement. What role has the \nleadership and culture of Churchill Downs played in cementing the \nsong's importance over the years?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's hard to imagine My Old Kentucky Home having such wide currency \nif it weren't officially re-enshrined each year at the Kentucky \nDerby. Many people think it was written for the Derby's inauguration \nin 1875, but by then it was already old and Foster was cold in his \ngrave. Churchill Downs appears to have adopted it in 1931, after \nKentucky opened a tourist site to honor the song and made it the \nstate anthem. It was a time of Jim Crow laws, Confederate monuments \nin courthouse squares, and Gone with the Wind romance. Foster's \nfamiliar tune helped Colonel Matt Winn, the track director and \nimpresario, parlay a second-rate race for 3-year-olds into a charming \nand exotic destination event full of traditional southern \nhospitality. Generations of racetrack publicists ever since have \npuffed My Old Kentucky Home to the media and to racegoers as a \nreflection of the region's beauty and authenticity.\u0014\n\u0014\nFOR FULL ARTICLE, SEE WORD/DOCUMENTS/EXAMING MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME\u0014",

    "title": "ENDING HUMAN SACRIFICE",
    "words": "Ending Human Sacrifice\u0014\nChristian History Institute\u0014\n\u0014\nALL EARLY PEOPLES sacrificed human beings. One has only to remember \nAgamemnons sacrifice to angry Artemis of the most beautiful thing he \npossessed, his daughter Iphigenia. But this was a story of the Greek \nIron Age, no more present to the Romanized world into which Patrick \nwas born than public executions are to ours. For us, it is a strain \nto find any surviving elements of sacrificecut flowers, Christmas \ntrees, vigil lights, and the Mass may be the last vestigesbut in the \nRoman world animal sacrifices were still offered.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that at some point in the development of every culture, \nhuman sacrifice becomes unthinkable, and animals are from then on \nsubstituted for human victims. The story of the binding of Isaac in \nGenesis may constitute symbolically just such a turning point in the \nhistory of the Jewswhen Abrahams God tells him it is no longer \nrequired that he sacrifice his only son but may substitute a ram \ninstead. The Irish had not reached this point and were still \nsacrificing human beings to their gods when Patrick began his mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey sacrificed prisoners of war to the war gods and newborns to the \nharvest gods. Believing that the human head was the seat of the soul, \nthey displayed proudly the heads of their enemies in their temples \nand on their palisades; they even hung them from their belts as \nornaments, used them as footballs in victory celebrations, and were \nfond of employing skull tops as ceremonial drinking bowls. They also \nsculpted headsboth shrunken, decapitated heads and overbearing, \nimpassive godheadsand a favorite motif was the head of a tri-faced \ngod, for three was their magical number, and gods and goddesses often \nmanifested themselves as three.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Irish would have said here [in Christ] is a story that answers \nour deepest needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do human beings do these things? The psychological mechanism is \nnot far to find, since there is probably not a readereven the most \nconvinced atheistwho has not offered from time to time an \noldfashioned quid pro quo prayer: if you let me pass this exam, I \nwill return to church; if you make sure my wife doesnt learn of my \ninfidelity, I will give my next bonus to charity. The theologythe \nview of godthat lies behind these imprecations is of an arbitrary \ntrickster, a bad parent who can be coaxed, flattered, and \nmanipulated. If belief in such a god is strong and primitive enough, \nit is easy to see how it can lead to human sacrifice: Here, take him, \nnot me!The impassive godhead demands someones blood. Let it not be \nmine! And if we study the faces of the Celtic gods, we can have no \ndoubt that only blood could satisfy most of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do human beings do these things?

Let it not be \nmine! And if we study the faces of the Celtic gods, we can have no \ndoubt that only blood could satisfy most of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut we delude ourselves about the complex history of religious \nfeeling if we think that all sacrificehuman includedcan be reduced \nto this base motive. Whatever the Irish felt, we feel. For all the \nterror of the Celtic cosmos and the blood thirstiness of the Celtic \ngods, no human society could hold together for long if it understood \nsacrifice only along the lines of the savage tribe in King Kong, \noffering terrified beauties to the Beast.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis caricature is belied by the most direct evidence of human \nsacrifice that we have found to datethe prehistoric corpses of \nTolland Man, Grauballe Man, the Borremose Man, dug out of Danish bogs \nin the 1950s, and an even more intriguing discovery recently made in \na remote English bog. The Danish bodies may be Celtic; the English \nonea man discovered in 1984 and dug out of the peat of Lindow Moss, \nan ancient bog south of Manchestercertainly is, and may even be \nIrish.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese bodies all owe their amazing state of preservation to the \nchemical properties of the peat, which has leatherized the skin but \nleft it otherwise intact, so that we can see every physical \ndetaileven smiles lines around the eyesjust as we could have in \nlife. All the bodies were sacrificed, and all the faces are at peace. \nIn other words, all went willingly, one might almost say happily, to \ntheir sacrificial deathslike Isaac, trusting to the last in the \ngoodness of the sacrificing priest and, even more important, in the \ngoodness of the father god.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Lindow Man was a sacrifice there can be little doubt. His hands \nare uncalloused, his nails beautifully manicured. Thus, he was an \naristocrat, though, strangely, he cannot have been a warrior, for his \nbody shows no evidence of the scars of battle. Indeed, leaving aside \nfor the moment the marks of his elaborate execution, he appears to be \nwithout blemish of any kind. According to British archaeologists Anne \nRoss and Don Robins, he was a druid prince who had come from Ireland \nabout A.D. 60, as the Romans were asserting their control and \nexpunging druidism. He offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods for \nthe defeat of the Romans. Ross and Robins even think they know his \nnameLovernius, the Fox-Man. Certainly, he had dark red hair and a \nfull beard (like a druid, unlike a bushily mustached warrior) and \nwore around his left forearm a circlet of fox fur, the naked mans \nonly adornment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most conclusive evidence that the bog men were sacrificed is the \nstory their bodies tell of the manner of their deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nEach submitted himself naked to an elaborate, ritualized Triple \nDeath. In the case of Lindow Man, for instance, his skull was \nflattened by three blows of an ax, his throat garroted by a \nthriceknotted sinew cord, his blood emptied quickly through the \nprecise slitting of his jugular. Here is the ancient victim of \nsacrifice, the offering made out of deep human need. Unblemished, \nraised to die, possibly firstborn, set aside, gift to the god, food \nof the god, balm for the people, purification, reparation for all-for \nsins known and unknown, intended and inadvertent. Behold gods lamb, \nbehold him who takes away the sins of all.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick declared that such sacrifices were no longer needed. Christ \nhad died once for all. Id bet he quoted Paul, his model, who in his \nletter to the church at Philippi recited this mysterious poem about \nsacrifice, the oldest Christian hymn of which we have record:\u0014\n\u0014\nThough he possessed divine estate \u0014\nHe was not jealous to retain \u0014\nEquality with God. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe cast off his inheritance, \u0014\nHe took the nature of a slave \u0014\nAnd walked as Man among men. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe emptied himself to the last \u0014\nAnd was obedient to death \u0014\nTo death upon a cross. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, therefore, God has raised \u0014\nhim up \u0014\nAnd God has given him the Name \u0014\nwhich-is-above-all-names, \u0014\n\u0014\nThat at the name of Jesus all \u0014\nIn heaven high shall bow the knee \u0014\nAnd all the earth and depths \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd every tongue of men proclaim \u0014\nThat Jesus Christ is Lord \u0014\nTo the glory of the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, the Irish would have said, here is a story that answers our \ndeepest needsand answers them in a way so good that we could never \neven have dared dream of it. We can put away our knives and abandon \nour altars. These are no longer required. The God of the Three Faces \nhas given us his own Son, and we are washed clean in the blood of \nthis lamb. God does not hate us; he loves us. Greater love than this \nno man has than that he should lay down his life for his friends. \nThat is what Gods Word, made flesh, did for us. From now on, we are \nall sacrificesbut without the shedding of blood. It is our lives, \nnot our deaths, that this God wants. But we are to be sacrifices, for \nPaul adds to the hymn this advice to all: Let this [same] mind be in \nyou, which was also in Christ Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom How the Irish Saved Civilization by Thomas Cahill, copyright  \n1995 by Thomas Cahill.

    "title": "EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY",
    "words": "EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the sixteenth century, Calvinism became the leading form of \nProtestant faith in the Netherlands. In 1591 a Calvinist minister in \nAmsterdam, James Arminius (Jacob Harmenszoon), preached on Romans 7. \nInstead of interpreting it as Pauls post-salvation experience as \nmost Calvinists did, he took it as a pre-salvation experience. This \nset off a theological quarrel. Later, as a theologian at the \nUniversity of Leyden, Arminius quietly highlighted some areas of \nCalvinism that he felt were biblically questionable. Among the ideas \nhe suspected of error was the teaching that Christ died only for the \nelect. This led to a war of words with Leydens other theologian, \nGomarus, who held a strict interpretation of Calvinism. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther ministers adopted Arminiuss ideas and the theological quarrel \nbecame a public controversy in which the leading political parties \ntook sides. Although Arminiuss views had been held by major \ntheologians since the earliest days of church history, his followers \nwere persecuted for them. Arminius himself died in 1609 never having \npublished his teachings as a systematic theology. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be up to others to develop the train of thought he started. \nHis immediate followers became known as Remonstrants after they wrote \na letter reproaching the majority Calvinist position. Foremost among \nthe Remonstrants was Simon Biscopp, better known by his Latinized \nname, Episcopius. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Amsterdam a few years before the start of the controversy, he \nstudied to become a minister, attending the University of Leyden \nwhere he showed proficiency as a theologian. The magistrates would \nhave given him a church, but they felt that in his youthful zeal he \nhad sided too vehemently with Arminius in debates over \npredestination. Episcopius left Leyden to study at Franeker but, by \nhis advocacy of the Arminian position there, he earned the enmity of \nLubertus, Franekers theology professor. Episcopius found it \nexpedient to withdraw from school for a while. Eventually he \ncompleted his training.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of his views, authorities appointed Episcopius as minister \nto the church in Bleyswyck in 1610. The following year he gained \nattention for his wit as a delegate for the Remonstrant side in a \npublic conference of six Remonstrant and six anti-Remonstrant \nministers. In 1612, Gomarus having retired, Episcopius won \nappointment to the theological vacancy at the University of Leyden. \nEpiscopius and Polyander, the other theologian (a Calvinist), agreed \nto mute their theological differences for the good of the school.\u0014\nOutside the school, however, differences between Remonstrants and \nanti-Remonstrants intensified. A mob plundered the house of \nEpiscopiuss eldest brother. Episcopius himself barely escaped \nstoning by a mob on one occasion. In another incident he was chased \nby a blacksmith brandishing a red-hot iron. In 1618 the Synod of Dort \nexiled Episcopius and twelve other Remonstrants from the territories \nof Holland. During his exile, he wrote The Remonstrants Confession \nof Faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nEpiscopius resided in Antwerp and France until 1626 when persecution \nagainst the Remonstrants relaxed and he could safely return to \nHolland. He became pastor of a Remonstrant church in Rotterdam and \nmarried a widow, Maria Pesser Niellius, soon afterward. In 1634 he \nbecame the theological professor of the newly-founded Remonstrants \nSeminarium in Amsterdam. His Theological Institutions, published \nafter his death, was the first systematic theology from the Arminian \nperspective, although it had deep roots in the teachings of the Greek \nfathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nCalvinist theologians falsely accused Episcopius of Socinianism. \nSocinians deny that Christ existed before his human birth, reject the \ndoctrine of the Trinity, and do not believe in Gods omniscient \nforeknowledge. Actually Episcopius rejected all these errors. Today, \nhe is accused of Subordinationism, a view that Christ is not equal to \nGod the Father in his being and attributes. The other main complaint \nagainst Episcopius was that he was too caustic and sarcastic in his \nattacks on opposing theologians. Not many controversialists can \nescape that charge. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1641 Maria died after a short illness. Late the following year \nEpiscopius could not pass urine because of severe kidney disease and \nstones. At times he lapsed into stupor and blindness. Although his \nkidneys resumed their function twice during succeeding months, his \noverall condition worsened. While conscious he was often in great \npain but bore his suffering bravely and expressed deep confidence in \nChrist, his redeemer. The indomitable theologian died in Amsterdam on \nthis day 4 April 1643 and was buried four days later beside his wife.\u0014",

    "title": "EGYPT CLAIMS MARK (GOSPEL OF) AS FOUNDER",
    "words": "EGYPT CLAIMS MARK THE GOSPEL WRITER AS A FOUNDER\u0014\n \u0014\nA young man named John Mark resided with his mother Mary in \nJerusalem. She was well-to-do. We know this because Christians \ngathered in her large home and she had at least one servant girl. The \napostle Peter knew the place. When an angel released him from prison \none night, he headed to Marys house. There he informed Jerusalems \nChristians of his escape and hurried away to hide (Acts 12:519). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible mentions John Mark several times. He had a cousin, \nBarnabas, a Levite. When the church at Antioch commissioned Paul and \nBarnabas to carry the gospel into Asia Minor, Mark accompanied them \nas long as they hugged the coast. But he deserted them when they \nturned inland. (Acts 13:5,13) Later, Barnabas wanted to take Mark \nalong on a second trip, but Paul balked. The two quarreled and \nseparatedone of two incidents in which Paul and Barnabas disagreed \nwith each other. (The other had to do with eating with Gentiles. \nGalatians 2:13) Barnabas took Mark to Cyprus while Paul partnered \nwith Silas (Acts 15:3640). Over time, Pauls breach with Mark \nhealed. In two of his last letters, Paul mentioned Mark as a coworker \n(Philemon 1:24; 2 Timothy 4:11.).\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter also mentioned a Mark whom he described as his son (1 Peter \n5:13). This would suggest he had mentored him in the faith. Early \nChristians said this Mark was the same as John Mark. As Peter would \nhave known John Mark from his visits to Marys home, the \nidentification is likely. Mark is said to have served as a translator \nto Peter in Rome (Babylon 1 Peter 5:13) and wrote down Peters \naccount of the life of Christ. This has come to us as the Gospel \naccording to Mark.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Gospel of Mark nowhere identifies its author, (FRS: the \ngospel wasn't named for over 100 years)  the church has connected it \nwith his name at least since the second century. Because most of \nMarks content appears in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, some think \nMark compiled his work from theirs. Modern critics put Marks account \nfirst and say the other two worked from his short account. A big \ndifference is that Mark did not report Jesuss sermons in depth.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was Mark doing during the years between his appearances in the \npages of the Bible? A strong African tradition says that because he \nwas born in Cyrene (a city in modern Libya he returned to North \nAfrica to plant churches and to found the see of Alexandria. There he \ninfuriated pagans who dragged him through the city at the end of a \nrope, killing him.\u0014\n\u0014\nJerome gave his death as 25 April 62 (the sixth year of Nero). This \nis the date followed by the Vetus martyrologium romanum. But Jerome \nmay have mistaken Marks temporary departure from Alexandria for the \ntime of his death. In the last letter Paul wrote, around AD 67, he \nasked Timothy to bring John Mark (2 Timothy 4:11.) He would not have \ndone so if Mark had been dead for five years. A stronger tradition \nplaces Marks death on this day, 26 April 68.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs with many Bible figures, we can only conjecture Marks life and \ndates from a few clues and traditions. Marks story encourages us, \nhowever, because after a rocky start, he became a faithful and \nreliable witness for Jesus. His Gospel has blessed the entire world.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELCIAL OPPOSITION TO ABORTION",
    "words": "The tangled web of evangelical opposition to abortion while believing \nin original sin, eternal conscious torment and the mysterious age of \naccountability\u0014\nRICK PIDCOCK  |  MAY 10, 2022  BAPTIST NEWS GLOBAL\u0014\n\u0014\nFew topics enflame conservative evangelicalisms self-righteous ire \nlike the topic of abortion. Weve all seen social media posts from \nfriends that depict or describe abortion procedures in the most \ngraphically violent ways in order to shock us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWho could possibly be in favor of violently dismembering the most \nhelpless among us? The Democrats, of course, they say.\u0014\nNo matter what candidate the Republican Party nominates, many \nconservative evangelicals assume that to withhold a vote for a \nRepublican politician is to vote for the inhumanity of violence \ntoward babies. And thus, the conservative evangelical conscience is \nbound to empowering the Republican Party, while Democrats are \ndemonized as inhumane.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe inhumanity of the lake of fire\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, nothing brings cool-headed mindfulness to a conversation \nlike the dread of eternal conscious torment. While there has been a \ngrowing intrigue among some Christians in the idea of ultimate \nredemption  the teaching that everyone has been reconciled to God \nand will one day be fully healed by love and accept their \nreconciliation  there are more who believe in annihilationism  the \nidea that all non-Christians will be punished in the afterlife by a \nliteral death of ceasing to exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the overwhelming majority of conservative evangelicals in the \nUnited States believe in eternal conscious torment  the idea that \nall who do not accept the evangelical theology of penal \nsubstitutionary atonement will be punished for all eternity in the \ntorments of a lake of fire and brimstone thats even more terrifying \nthan hell itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo reflect the pro-life movements apparent affinity for utilizing \ngraphically violent language, this means that billions of humans will \nbe writhing and flailing while screaming and gnashing their teeth as \nfire and brimstone engulf their skin and worms crawl in and out of \ntheir bodies that were designed specifically and exclusively to feel \nthe most infinite measure of physical pain to the fullest degree \npossible for all eternity, all while conservative evangelicals sing \nsongs and receive pleasures forevermore.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way conservative evangelicals in the pro-life movement think \nabout abortion in light of that reality becomes an exercise in mental \ngymnastics that destroys the humanity of us all, as well as the \nhumanity of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nOriginal sin and aborted babies\u0014\n\u0014\nConservative evangelicals in the pro-life movement believe life \nbegins at conception, and therefore conception is the birth of the \nsoul. So whenever death happens after conception, their theology \nteaches that the soul will spend eternity either in heaven or hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey also believe in the doctrine of original sin, which teaches that \nall humans, as physical descendants of Adam, inherit the sinful \nnature and death that were introduced into the cosmos through Adam in \nthe Garden of Eden. Even many evangelicals who accept evolution often \nfigure out some way to uphold this idea of original sin, despite the \nabsence of a universal ancestor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the question that gets raised is whether original sin would \ncondemn aborted fetuses to an eternity in hell before they ever took \na breath.\u0014\n\u0014\nWould a blastocyst soul that dies three days after conception with no \nconsciousness suddenly wake up with a fully developed human body \nburning in eternal conscious torment? One might assume that even the \nmost inhumane among us wouldnt imagine or accept such a fate for \nanyone. But for those who believe in original sin and eternal \nconscious torment, the eternal destiny of an aborted fetus creates a \nquite disturbing theological conundrum. Do you reject your theology \nin the embrace of your humanity? Do you suppress your humanity while \ngrasping on to your theology? Or do you reconsider your theology?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Christians throughout history have said\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Augustine, who coined the term original sin in the fourth \ncentury, argued that infants are held by the guilt of original sin, \nand concluded that infants who die without being baptized will be \ninvolved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, \ngreatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will \nnot be involved in condemnation.  Accordingly, also the Lord himself \n(wishing to remove from the hearts of wrong-believers that vague and \nindefinite middle condition, which some would provide for unbaptized \ninfants  as if, by reason of their innocence, they were embraced in \neternal life, but were not because of their unbaptized state, with \nChrist in his kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of his, which \nshuts their mouths: He that is not with me is against me.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo for Augustine, all fetuses and babies who die without being \nbaptized will experience a mild form of eternal conscious torment, \nwhatever that possibly could mean, which would include all aborted \nfetuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, the church bishop St. Fulgentius argued in the fifth \ncentury that children who either begin to live in the womb of their \nmothers and who die there or, already born from their mothers, pass \nfrom this world without the Sacrament of Holy Baptism  must be \npunished with the endless penalty of eternal fire. Even if they have \nno sin from their own actions, still, by their carnal conception and \nbirth, they have contracted the damnation of Original Sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin taught a similar concept regarding even infants bringing \ntheir condemnation with them from their mothers womb because they \nhave the seed implanted in them. Nay, their whole nature is, as it \nwere, a seed-bed of sin.  Infants who are to be saved (and that some \nare saved at this age is certain) must, without question, be \npreviously regenerated by the Lord  they must either remain \nunaccepted and hated by God, or be justified.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalvin differed from Augustine in that he believed God could save \nthose God elected to save at any age, without distinction. But for \nbabies of non-Christian parents, Calvin argued, The children of the \nreprobate, whom the curse of God pursues, are liable to the same \nsentence because Isaiah does not speak of innocent children, but of \nflagitious and unprincipled children.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe concluded: I again ask how it is that the fall of Adam involves \nso many nations with their infant children in eternal death without \nremedy unless that it so seemed meet to God? Here the most loquacious \ntongues must be dumb. The decree, I admit, is dreadful; and yet it is \nimpossible to deny that God foreknew what the end of man was to be \nbefore he made him, and foreknew, because he had so ordained by his \ndecree.  For why, pray, should it be made a charge against the \nheavenly Judge, that he was not ignorant of what was to happen?\u0014\n\u0014\nModern pop Calvinists on the eternal destiny of aborted fetuses\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven how so many modern conservative evangelical pop-Calvinists \nidolize the likes of Augustine and Calvin, what are they saying \nregarding the eternal fate of aborted fetuses?\u0014\n\u0014\nChrissy Stroop tells the story of one of her former Christian school \nteachers, who was asked about the fate of aborted babies. She \nobserved: Mr. Henderson began to choke up and shed a few tears. The \nlogic of his extreme Calvinist worldview compelled him to believe \nthat miscarried and aborted babies wind up in hell. But he was \nclearly deeply troubled by the thought. Something in him must have \nfelt that God sending aborted babies to hell was horrifyingly unjust, \nand yet Mr. Henderson could not shake the ultimate source of abuse in \nCalvinist thinking  Calvinisms insistence that whatever God does is \ngood by definition, regardless of our doubts and moral intuitions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut other conservative evangelical Calvinists do not share the \nconflicted conscience Mr. Henderson had. According to Reformation 21: \nA type of sentimentalism can enter into our thinking that isnt \nactually grounded in Gods word or his character. The Reformed \ndoctrine of original sin, which usually includes imputed guilt, \nessentially means that there is no such thing as an innocent child in \nthe eyes of God. All infants are guilty and corrupt before God, at \nconception, because of original sin. Those who go to hell are not \nthere simply because of what they did, but because of who they are.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir concern about opening the door for infants to spend eternity in \nheaven rather than burning in hell is that people have made similar \narguments for universalism, annihilationism and homosexual unions. \nAnd so they conclude, Once we grasp that God could, based upon his \nrighteous nature, and because infants are guilty in Adam (i.e., \noriginal sin), send these children to hell, we are faced with the \ntrue horror of abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Piper agrees with Augustine and Calvin about their inherited \nguilt through original sin, affirming, I do believe they are in a \nsinful condition when they die. My view is not based on how cute or \ninnocent they are.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Piper recognizes the conundrum this view creates for conservative \nevangelicals. For most evangelicals, fetuses who die have a 100% \nchance of spending eternity in heaven. But if they are born, \nespecially in families who are willing to have an abortion, the \npercentages going to heaven after death drastically reduce. Would it \nnot, under those odds, be an act of mercy to abort babies when they \nhave a 100% chance of avoiding eternal conscious torment rather than \nletting them live and rolling the dice in a game of life where their \nchances of going to heaven after they die fall to very slim?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo this question, Piper says, If Christians were to buy the \nargument, Sure, that is fine. You can go ahead and take the lives of \ninfants in the womb because they are going to go to heaven, then we \ncan just go around and kill all the 1-year olds and guarantee they go \nto heaven  kill all the 2-year-olds and guarantee that they go to \nheaven  and we will draw the line maybe around, I dont know, 3 or \n4. That is a horrific position to take, and it is a big deal.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his views that all babies carry a guilt deserving of eternal \nconscious torment, Piper ultimately believes all babies who die, \nincluding through abortion, will go to heaven after death. Yet he \nalso believes the vast majority of those who are born will burn in \nhell. Still in the face of those drastically reduced odds, he says \nabortion is wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptists and the age of accountability\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason John Piper draws the hypothetical logical line for killing \nchildren at 4 years old is that many evangelicals believe in the age \nof accountability, which is the idea that everyone who dies prior to \nsome undefined age where they have the mental capacity to understand \nand reject penal substitutionary atonement gets to heaven. But at \nsome point during one day in everyones life, a switch supposedly \ngets flipped to where suddenly theyll burn in hell forever if they \ndie without embracing evangelical theology. Whether that happens when \nthe kid wakes up one morning, in the middle of their lunch, or while \ntheyre playing with their Legos is unknown. But its a big deal to \nconservative evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptists debated how Calvinism and the age of accountability \napplies to infants in a Calvinism Advisory Committee that was set up \nby Frank Page, former president of the SBCs Executive Committee, in \n2013. According to their report, Most Southern Baptists believe that \nthose who die before they are capable of moral action go to heaven \nthrough the grace of God and the atonement of Christ, even as they \ndiffer as to why this is so.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome members such as Steve Lemke, who was then provost at New Orleans \nBaptist Theological Seminary, argued that children are not morally \naccountable until they are capable of moral action.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Calvinists on the committee, such as Al Mohler and Danny Akin, \nhad written in 2009: We are born marked by original sin, and thus we \ncannot claim that infants are born in a state of innocence. Still, \nthey argued that the Bible teaches that judgment will be based on \nwhat we do in the body, and concluded that heaven will be filled \nwith those who never grew to maturity on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn MacArthur on abortion as the Great Commission\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, what becomes even more problematic for conservative \nevangelical views on abortion than their theology of hell is their \ntheology of heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn MacArthur posed the question: When you think about the fact \nthat heaven is going to be populated by people from every tongue and \ntribe and nation, as it says in the book of Revelation, how could \nthat happen? Because the gospel hasnt necessarily in every era of \ntime gone to every tongue and tribe and nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen many Christians think about Revelations vision of people from \nevery tongue, tribe and nation being in heaven one day, they tend to \nsee it as the result of the gospel spreading through the Great \nCommission where Jesus told his disciples to make disciples as they \ngo into all the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut MacArthur doesnt see the Great Commission as the catalyst for \nsuch a vision. Instead, he sees abortion and infant death as the \ncause. High mortality rates in non-Christian, third world, and false \nreligion environments produce people for heaven, he explains. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I think God has been gathering little ones from every tongue and \ntribe and nation around the world throughout human history.\u0014\nTo women who have had an abortion, MacArthur says, When you aborted \nthat baby, although it was sinful to do that, it was wrong to do \nthat, that baby went immediately into the presence of the Lord. The \nworst that you could do brought about the best that could ever happen \nto that life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd thus, MacArthur concludes that the best illustration I know of \n(grace) is God sovereignly, graciously saving infants that die or \nfetuses that are aborted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lost humanity of the conservative evangelical pro-life movement\u0014\n\u0014\nNoticeably absent in this article have been any reflections by women. \nTheir concerns, fears and perspectives are nowhere to be heard. Other \nthan the reflections of Chrissy Stroop, every quote has been from \npowerful men sharing their theological theories either to justify \ntheir God burning fetuses for eternity while claiming that Democrats \nare the inhumane ones, or to attempt to wiggle out of the death \nchamber theyve theologically boxed themselves into.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at least MacArthur is honest about his theology. According to \nMacArthurs conservative evangelical theology applied in the pro-life \nmovement, abortion is the greatest evangelistic tool there is. In \nfact, its the mechanism by which Revelations vision of heaven \nbecomes fulfilled. So by opposing abortion, evangelicals are \ndramatically increasing the number of souls who will eventually burn \nfor eternity who couldve been in heaven for eternity, and they are \nalso working against the fulfillment of the Great Commission.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, they counter that by saying Christians are responsible to \nsave unborn babies despite whatever eternity those children grow up \nto have. But what kind of totally screwed up God do you have to have \nthat would set up this scenario that requires his followers to rescue \nfetuses that wouldve spent an eternity in heaven so they can be kept \nalive long enough to be able to burn in hell? That is certainly not a \nGod who became a human baby, because a God who strips us of our \nhumanity would be inhumane.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe entire conversation is nonsense. Its impossible to take the \nleast bit seriously. And it totally ignores the rich conversations we \ncould be having by listening to the cries of women all across our \ncountry who have very real concerns about their bodies and their \nfutures.\u0014\n\u0014\nA belief in eternal conscious torment ruins the possibility of having \nany humane conversations because its fundamentally inhumane to the \nmost infinite degree. Drop that concept, and then maybe we can talk \nabout abortion with a modicum of humanity and common sense.

    "words": "EPIPHANIUS, ICONOCLAST AND CHURCH FATHER\u0014\n \u0014\n[Icon of St. Epiphanius, who vehemently opposed icons]\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN USE OF ICONS was creeping into the church, many Christians \nopposed them. In a famous instance, one bishop entered the church of \nBethel in Judea, saw a curtain depicting a saint and ripped it down. \nThat bishop was Epiphanius of Cyprus (also known as Epiphanius of \nSalamais).\u0014\n\u0014\nEpiphanius hated heresy so much that he wrote two books against the \nspiritual errors of his day. In these he sought to establish the \northodox position against no fewer than eighty errors. He especially \ntook to task false teachings about the Trinity and Resurrection. He \nhad no use for Arianism, which denies the full divinity of Christ, or \nfor Sabellianism, the teaching that God the Father, Son, and Holy \nSpirit are merely one person. (Orthodoxy teaches they are three \npersons in one Godhead.) \u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote: \u0014\n\u0014\n[T]he Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are co-essentialthree \nentities, one essence, one Godhead. This is the true faith which we \nhave received from the ancients, the faith of the prophets, Gospels \nand apostles, which our fathers and bishops confessed when they met \nat the Council of Nicaea in the presence of the great and most \nblessed emperor, Constantine.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first book was Ancoratus (The Well-Anchored) and was followed by \na more extensive response to heresy, the Panarion (Medicine Chest). \nThe first is especially interesting because it includes the baptismal \ncreed his church used in Salamais. The second is invaluable because \nexcerpts from it are often our only source of information regarding \nsects and people of the fourth century. It dealt with some heresies \nby hearsay, but it also provided historical background on heresies \nsuch as Arianism and Marcionism and on the teachings and scriptures \nof the Samaritans.  Epiphanius also wrote an introduction to the \nBible with a history of Scripture texts and some details of biblical \narchaeology. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore bishops selected him to lead the church in Salamais, \nEpiphanius had been a monk given to strict ascetic practice. He was \ngifted with wonderworking. To escape attention, he went into the \nSpanidrion desert (Egypt). While a captive of bandits, he won one of \ntheir number to Christ. The man followed Epiphanius and recorded his \nlife and miracles. After Epiphaniuss flight to the Pathysian desert \n(in Judea) to avoid being made bishop of Lycia, men came out to him \nin the wilderness and he established a monastery over which he \npresided for thirty years. Eventually he went to Cyprus, which \nhappened to be in need of a bishop, and he was induced to accept the \nposition. He was so famed that many outsiders sought his counsel.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of his life, Epiphanius was embroiled in controversy \nwith the patriarchs John of Jerusalem and John Chrysostom, both of \nwhom he accused of embracing errors found in Origens writings. He \ntraveled to their sees to confront them in person. It was on his \nreturn voyage from visiting Chrysostom that he died. On this day, 12 \nMay 403, the remains of Epiphanius were laid to rest in a new church \nhe had built within his own see. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 787, the Seventh Ecumenical Council authorized the use of icons. \nDespite Epiphaniuss opposition to them, the same council considered \nhis writings of such worth it named him a father and teacher of the \nChurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay 13, 403\u0014\n\u0014\nBurial of St. Epiphanius of Salamis in a new church he had built. An \nOrthodox bishop, he had opposed the use of icons that was creeping \ninto the church, famously tearing down a curtain that depicted one. \nIn his writings he had rejected Arianism and cataloged eighty other \nheresies. He also wrote directives for the translation of the Bible. \nThe Seventh Ecumenical Council (787) while authorizing the use of \nicons, will name him a father and teacher of the Church.\u0014",

Smith or Andrae Crouch. If you had lived toward \nthe end of the nineteenth century, Edwin O. Excell might have come to \nmind. He was right up with Ira D. Sankey, P. P. Bliss, Daniel B. \nTowner, and other major Christian singers/songwriters. Even today the \naverage Christian has probably sung Count Your Blessings to the \ntune Excell wrote, or Since I Have Been Redeemed for which he wrote \nboth the words and the tune.

Although he was Sam \nP. Joness vocalist for twenty years, he also worked with Gipsy Smith \nand several other preachers. Dwight L.

Not only did he \nassemble and publish collections, he printed hymnals for Protestant \ndenominations. As if that were not enough, he collaborated with \nproducers and distributors of Sunday school material and led singing \nat Chatauqua camps. Often he led volunteer choirs of hundreds who had \nnever sung together before. He shared the gift of gospel music in \nalmost every state and province of English-speaking North America, a \nmajor figure in nineteenth-century Christian outreach.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone of this happened by chance. Born in Ohio at the tail end of \n1851, he attended public schools in Ohio and Pennsylvania. He became \na diligent worker who worked as a plasterer and bricklayer to pay his \nbills. But music was his love and he constantly sought opportunities \nin the field. Some of his early public singing was for U. S. Grants \npresidential campaigns, but he also taught in rural singing schools \nand became a church choirmaster. Singing in revival services, he \nbecame more focused on sacred song. \u0014\nUntil he sang in a revival series for J. B. Esty, he was himself \nunconverted. After his change of heart, he determined to focus all \nhis musical energies on church music and attended sessions of George \nF. Roots Normal Music Institutes to improve his knowledge. \nEventually he moved to Chicago, a center of music publishing. \u0014\n\u0014\nExcell devoted the rest of his life to Christian work, first in \nassociation with Sunday schools and then in evangelistic singing and \npublication of Christian music. He wrote over a thousand tunes and \nissued close to one hundred hymn collections. He helped many younger \nmusicians get into print and broke the virtual monopoly the owners of \nthe Gospel Hymns series had on the field. \u0014\nWhile working with evangelist Gipsy Smith in Louisville, Kentucky, he \nbecame ill. He returned to Chicago for medical care and died there on \nthis day, 10 June 1921.

She came of age at Mount Vernon, serving Mrs. Washington, \nas her most prized, enslaved person, in part because she was an \nexpert seamstress and sewer. When George Washington was elected \nunanimously as President of the United States, the Washingtons made \nthe decision to take seven enslaved people with them to New York, the \nsite of the nations first capital, and Ona Judge was one of those \nenslaved people. She was 15 or 16 years old when she was forced to \nleave her family behind to serve the first First Lady. She moved to \nNew York and later to Philadelphia, where she continued to serve Mrs. \nWashington at the Washingtons executive home.\u0014\n\u0014\nOna Judge made the decision to escape, upon hearing that she would be \ngiven away as a wedding gift to Martha Washingtons granddaughter, \nwho was known for having a volatile temper. On May 21, 1796, she \nwalked out of the Washingtons home in Philadelphia while they were \neating supper and never returned.

She died free in New \nHampshire, though she was legally the property of Washingtons heirs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy examining Onas story, we get an opportunity to reimagine the \nfounding of the nation through the eyes of people who helped to build \nit, and who were prevented from experiencing the ideals central to \nthe revolution. These ideals centered on freedom, democracy, \nequality, and never found their way to people like Ona Judge. People \nlike George Washington and the other founders were flawed. They were \nbrilliant.

Text books\u0014\nwere not limited to any particular church press and were generally \npaperback editions.\u0014\nThe variety of material was refreshing and even though the same \ngeneral matter might be\u0014\ntouched on in two books, the approach and treatment were different. \nAssignments were\u0014\nmade for each individual to present the material for an evening. This \napproach stimulated\u0014\nbetter assignment of responsibility, encouraged discussion, provoked \nfuller participation.\u0014\nDr. Skaggs led but did not dominate the discussion yet kept the \nremarks on the subject.\u0014\nIncluded in the class were two ladies in their forties, two young \nladies in their late teens or\u0014\nmaybe 20 and myself, 55 years old. He used the variety of attitudes \nrepresented by this\u0014\ndiverse group to bring out in extremely frank, provocative and \nhelpful discussion. Facts\u0014\ncould be examined and conclusions revealed without embarrassment \nunder his careful\u0014\ndirection. The course presented the Christian view of the family, \nlove, courtship, sex\u0014\nrelationships, the problems of old age, etc. All were presented in \nthe bright clear light of\u0014\nbiblical criticism and we saw what principles lay behind Christian \npositions. From the      \u0014\ncourse, those who attended were able to deal more adequately with \nleading others to\u0014\naccept Christian principles rather than lean on the insecure \nadmonition, nice girls dont \u0014\ndo things like that.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Dr. Skaggs direction of the class period assured that the \ntime was well spent in\u0014\nlearning. Currently, I serve as Manager of Supply and Distribution \nfor Mobil Chemical Company,\u0014\nand was an officer in the Navy in World War II. I have been exposed \nto college classroom\u0014\nteaching, corporate instruction and at least ten separate Bible \nclasses at the University of \u0014\nRichmond. Without hesitation I believe manner of presentation and \nsubject matter itself to \u0014\nhave been a real help to me in my relationship within my own family \nand gives me a wider \u0014\nunderstanding of what position the church must take today to \neffectively survive this \u0014\nso called new morality era.\u0014\n         \u0014\n        An assignment for an outside paper was made whereby each \nperson was assigned\u0014\na denomination to investigate to determine what publications, \nperiodicals, films, pamphlets,\u0014\netc. have been produced by that denomination and to critique these \nfor the benefit of the\u0014\nclass. This study had to be accomplished as an independent effort. In \naddition to the\u0014\nindividuals enlightenment, the sum of the efforts of all was \nsignificant.\u0014\n         \u0014\n       Dr. Skaggs is a learned man, skilled in teaching and \nstimulating others about\u0014\nhim to learn.

    "title": "EXCOMMUNICATED AND BURNED AT THE STAKE",
    "words": "THROUGH THE MARRIAGE of Anne of Bohemia to King Richard II of \nEngland, the writings of English theologian John Wycliffe reached \nBohemia and took root early in the fifteenth century. Bohemia, whose \nchurch had been founded by missionaries from the east, was not as \ntightly bound to Rome as western European nations. It even had the \nScriptures in Bohemian. Among Wycliffes champions was Jan Hus, \nrector of the University of Prague, preacher at Bethlehem chapel, and \na denouncer of the greed and immorality of the clergy along with \nsuperstitious practices of the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nWycliffes writings and Huss preaching convinced many Bohemians to \nrepudiate non-scriptural practices. After first siding with Hus, \nArchbishop Sbynko of Prague veered against the reformer, denouncing \nhim to Pope Alexander V (one of three rival popes) and \nexcommunicating him. Bohemians rioted. Alexander V died suddenly and \nJohn XXIII (a foul man later declared an anti-pope) took his place. \nHus and King Wenzel appealed to John to remove Huss excommunication, \nbut the new pope confirmed Alexanders ruling. On the advice of \nCardinal Otto Colonna (later Pope Martin V) Pope John declared Hus a \nheretic and ordered him to appear before him. Hus refused the \nsummons. In February 1411 the pope excommunicated Hus and interdicted \nPrague, an order that was published in Prague on this day, 15 March, \n1411. The interdict meant that Catholics in Prague were forbidden to \nreceive the sacraments. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat December, Pope John sent an indulgence peddler to Prague, \npromising forgiveness of sins for monetary payment. Hus and others \ndenounced this, saying repentance and contrition were all that was \nneedful for forgiveness. Riots followed. When Johns agent pronounced \na more severe excommunication on Hus, King Wenzel asked the reformer \nto leave town. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in exile, Hus wrote letters and books. He updated the old \nBohemian Bible and declared Scripture the sole standard by which the \nchurch should judge religious truth. He also compared the popes to \nanti-Christ, opposed indulgences, denied the validity of absolution \nfrom a wicked priest, scorned image worship, spurned masses for the \ndead, disputed purgatory, and rejected auricular confession (that is, \nconfession out loud to a priest). He urged that the people be given \nthe Eucharist in both the bread and the wine, rather than just the \nbread. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a letter to Christians of the town of Prachatice, he recognized \nthat he would probably be burned at the stake and uttered his most \nfamous words: Truth conquers all things. Centuries later, the Czech \nNational Assembly took the words \"Veritas omnia vincit\"\u0014\nas the national motto: Truth prevails.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Council of Constance assembled, Hus was asked to be there \nand present his views on the dissension within the Church. When he \narrived, with a promise of safe conduct, he was immediately arrested \nand put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council \nand asked to recant his views. He replied, \"I would not for a chapel \nof gold retreat from the truth!\". When he refused, he was put back in \nprison. On 6 July 1415, he was burned at the stake for heresy against \nthe doctrines of the Catholic Church. He could be heard singing \nPsalms as he was burning. Among his dying words, Hus predicted that \nGod would raise others whose calls for reform would not be \nsuppressed; this was later taken as a prophecy about Martin Luther \n(born 68 years after Hus's death). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe name \"Hus\" means \"goose\" in Bohemian (now called Czech), and he \nwas a century later referenced as a \"Bohemian goose\"  He said, \"Today \nyou burn a goose, one day a swan (Martin Luther's family icon) will \narise and call for this same reform\" (or words to that affect.)\u0014",

The \nmen thought she was dead, but she came to and assured them she was \nnot. Realizing that they could get nothing out of her, the \nauthorities condemned her to die.

    "title": "EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY",
    "words": "EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY\u0014\n \u0014\nIN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, Calvinism became the leading form of \nProtestant faith in the Netherlands. In 1591 a Calvinist minister in \nAmsterdam, James Arminius (Jacob Harmenszoon), preached on Romans 7. \nInstead of interpreting it as Pauls post-salvation experience as \nmost Calvinists did, he took it as a pre-salvation experience. This \nset off a theological quarrel. Later, as a theologian at the \nUniversity of Leyden, Arminius quietly highlighted some areas of \nCalvinism that he felt were biblically questionable. Among the ideas \nhe suspected of error was the teaching that Christ died only for the \nelect. This led to a war of words with Leydens other theologian, \nGomarus, who held a strict interpretation of Calvinism. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther ministers adopted Arminiuss ideas and the theological quarrel \nbecame a public controversy in which the leading political parties \ntook sides. Although Arminiuss views had been held by major \ntheologians since the earliest days of church history, his followers \nwere persecuted for them. Arminius himself died in 1609 never having \npublished his teachings as a systematic theology. \u0014\nIt would be up to others to develop the train of thought he started. \nHis immediate followers became known as Remonstrants after they wrote \na letter reproaching the majority Calvinist position. Foremost among \nthe Remonstrants was Simon Biscopp, better known by his Latinized \nname, Episcopius. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Amsterdam a few years before the start of the controversy, he \nstudied to become a minister, attending the University of Leyden \nwhere he showed proficiency as a theologian. The magistrates would \nhave given him a church, but they felt that in his youthful zeal he \nhad sided too vehemently with Arminius in debates over \npredestination. Episcopius left Leyden to study at Franeker but, by \nhis advocacy of the Arminian position there, he earned the enmity of \nLubertus, Franekers theology professor. Episcopius found it \nexpedient to withdraw from school for a while. Eventually he \ncompleted his training.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of his views, authorities appointed Episcopius as minister \nto the church in Bleyswyck in 1610. The following year he gained \nattention for his wit as a delegate for the Remonstrant side in a \npublic conference of six Remonstrant and six anti-Remonstrant \nministers. In 1612, Gomarus having retired, Episcopius won \nappointment to the theological vacancy at the University of Leyden. \nEpiscopius and Polyander, the other theologian (a Calvinist), agreed \nto mute their theological differences for the good of the school.\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside the school, however, differences between Remonstrants and \nanti-Remonstrants intensified. A mob plundered the house of \nEpiscopiuss eldest brother. Once Episcopius barely escaped stoning \nby a mob. In another incident he was chased by a blacksmith \nbrandishing a red-hot iron. In 1618 the Synod of Dort exiled \nEpiscopius and twelve other Remonstrants from the territories of \nHolland. During his exile, he wrote The Remonstrants Confession of \nFaith. \u0014\n\u0014\nEpiscopius resided in Antwerp and France until 1626 when persecution \nagainst the Remonstrants relaxed and he could safely return to \nHolland. He became pastor of a Remonstrant church in Rotterdam and \nmarried a widow, Maria Pesser Niellius. In 1634 he became the \ntheological professor of the newly-founded Remonstrants Seminarium in \nAmsterdam. His Theological Institutions, published after his death, \nwas the first systematic theology from the Arminian perspective, \nalthough it had deep roots in the teachings of the Greek fathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nCalvinist theologians falsely accused Episcopius of Socinianism. \nSocinians deny that Christ existed before his human birth, reject the \ndoctrine of the Trinity, and do not believe in Gods omniscient \nforeknowledge. Actually Episcopius rejected all these errors. Today, \nhe is accused of Subordinationism, a view that Christ is not equal to \nGod the Father in his being and attributes. The other main complaint \nagainst Episcopius was that he was too caustic and sarcastic in his \nattacks on opposing theologians. Not many controversialists can \nescape that charge. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1641 Maria died after a short illness. Late the following year \nEpiscopius could not pass urine because of severe kidney disease and \nstones. At times he lapsed into stupor and blindness. Although his \nkidneys resumed their function twice during succeeding months, his \noverall condition worsened. While conscious he was often in great \npain but bore his suffering bravely and expressed deep confidence in \nChrist, his redeemer. The indomitable theologian died in Amsterdam on \nthis day 4 April 1643 and was buried four days later beside his wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "zekiel was weird, but he wasnt wrong.\u0014\nAlan Bean\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible is a tough read because it was forged in hell. When the \narmies of Nebuchadnezzar stomped Jerusalem flat, the people of Judah \nlost everything in a single stroke. Thousands of innocent men, women \nand children died by the sword, disease or, worst of all, gradual \nstarvation. Multitudes were dragged off to Babylonian exile. Worst of \nall, the great temple of Solomon, the very dwelling place of Yahweh, \nwas torn down, stone by stone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs survivors struggled to find meaning in their madness, the Hebrew \nScriptures sprang to life.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Lamentations, we see the first step in the process  a bewildered \noutpouring of honest pain. In Jeremiah, we see a link between \nreligion and social justice forged. Now we come to Ezekiel.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarvin Tate, one of my seminary professors, introduced Ezekiel as \nthe weirdo of the Old Testament. Ezekiel was weird. He built a \nlittle model of Jerusalem, complete with siegeworks, to demonstrate \nwhat was in store for the Holy City. Then, he spent more than a year \nlaying on his left side to signify the 390 years of Israels sin; \nthen he laid on his right side to dramatize the 40 years of Judahs \napostasy.\u0014\n\u0014\nWeird religion\u0014\n\u0014\nEzekiels brand of religion also was weird. He started out a temple \npriest in Jerusalem, one of the sons of Zadok who were trained from \nbirth in a priestly tradition that, to modern ears, sounds pretty \nweird.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Ezekiels priestly responsibilities ended when the Babylonians \nbreached the walls of Jerusalem in 597 BCE. King Jehoiachin and his \nroyal retinue were bundled off to Babylon, a fate shared by the sons \nof Zadok. Separated from their precious temple, Zadokites like \nEzekiel were out of work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Yahweh gave him a new job, standing on the walls of Jerusalem, \nscanning the horizon for signs of danger. But how could a man in \nBabylonian exile stand sentinel on the walls of Jerusalem?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is where the visions come in. As Ezekiel sat with his fellow \nexiles by the river Chebar, he was transported in the Spirit to the \nHoly City. There he saw a fiery throne-chariot of Yahweh, the one \nwith the faces and the whirling wheels way up in the middle of the \nair. As Ezekiel looked on aghast, Yahweh rode his chariot-throne out \nof the temple and away from Jerusalem. It was Ichabod time. The glory \nhad departed.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that point on, Ezekiel lived a double life. Physically, he was \nwith the exiles in Babylon; but his spiritual habitation was on the \nwalls of Jerusalem, standing as a watchman, or sentinel.\u0014\n\u0014\nEzekiel lived a double life. Physically, he was with the exiles in \nBabylon; but his spiritual habitation was on the walls of Jerusalem, \nstanding as a watchman, or sentinel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Babylonian army eventually withdrew from Jerusalem, leaving a \nsmall force behind to keep order. Life quickly returned to normal. \nSolomons temple was still standing, and the Levites (formerly temple \nservants) assumed the role of the exiled Zadokites. Word had it that \nthe Babylonian army was gone for good.\u0014\n\u0014\nEzekiel knew better. Since Yahweh had vacated the premises, nothing \nstood between the Holy City and unmitigated disaster. Ezekiel \npreached but no one listened. Why should they? Everyone knew Ezekiel \nwas a weirdo.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, Yahweh confined his prophet to quarters. The prophet didnt utter \nanother word until a fugitive from Jerusalem arrived with the awful \nnews, The city has fallen.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly, Ezekiels tongue was loosed. A glorious future lay ahead, \nthe prophet declared, but there would be no going back to the old \nways. In the old temple, the sacrifices offered to the cruel gods of \nthe surrounding nations had turned the hearts of the people to stone. \nBut Yahweh was about to gather all his exiled people, from Babylon, \nfrom the old Assyrian Empire, and from Egypt. Yahweh, the thoracic \nsurgeon, would remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give \nthem a heart of flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen things got even weirder. Ezekiel was scooped up by the hand of \nthe Lord and plopped down in a valley of dry bones representing the \nwhole house of Israel. All Yahwehs exile children were like Hebrew \nslaves wandering in the desert. But Yahweh was about to reunite the \n12 tribes of Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nYahweh is going back to square one. New bodies, new hearts, new \nspirit, new creation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the final section of Ezekiel, the priest-prophet is carried off to \na high mountain where, weirdly, he is introduced to the city where \nYahweh dwells. A tour guide-angel familiarizes the prophet with every \ninch of Yahwehs temple in the clouds. We tend to find these passages \ntedious (and weird), but the priest-prophet cant get enough of this \nstuff.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Ezekiel notices a tiny rivulet of water trickling under the \ntemple door. As Ezekiel and his angel guide move east from the \ntemple, the water gets progressively deeper, until the prophet is \nswimming in a mighty river. When the river of life reaches the Dead \nSea, the lifeless lake brims with sea creatures. And wherever the \nriver flows, a desiccated landscape blossoms.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf stoney hearts turned Eden into a wasteland; people with hearts of \nflesh are agents of healing.\u0014",

    "title": "EVANGELICAL FATHERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO SLAVERY",
    "words": "Three Evangelical Founding Fathers and Their Complicated \nRelationships to Slavery\u0014\nA new book steers between full condemnation and men of their time \ndodges.\u0014\nROBERT W. CALDWELL III|         JUNE 21, 2024     CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\nHow should white evangelicals think about slavery and past \nevangelical heroes who affirmed its practice? A new book by historian \nSean McGever, Ownership: The Evangelical Legacy of Slavery in \nEdwards, Wesley, and Whitefield, helps us process these matters with \nhistorical accuracy and Christlike humility.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many white American evangelicals, the issue of slavery is not \nmuch of an issue at all. After all, we live in a day where every \ncountry in the world outlaws the practice (at least on paper). We are \nrightly repulsed by practices reminiscent of slave ownership, like \nhuman trafficking and sweat shops. And we celebrate past evangelical \nleaders, like William Wilberforce, who tirelessly campaigned against \nthe institution. Our denominations no longer split over slave \nownership as they did prior to the American Civil War. Slavery, we \nthankfully conclude, lies in the rearview mirror of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout denying the truth in these claims, there are two problems \nwith this assessment. First, slavery, broadly construed, is still a \nlive issue for a significant number of Americans, many of whom are \nbelievers in Christ. Just like Jews and Muslims carry with them a \nhistorical sensea communal memory, if you willof atrocities done \nto their ancestors by Christians (like pogroms and the Crusades), \nmany Black Americans carry a remembrance of their ancestors \nsubjection to slavery, segregation, and other forms of injustice. \nConsequently, they experience slavery and its aftereffects as \npainfully present realities.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, many of our white evangelical heroes have a complex \nrelationship with slavery, a fact that can complicate our \ncontemporary witness. What are white evangelicals saying when we \nhonor such historical figures as towering exemplars of Christlikeness \nwhile treating their slave ownership (if we mention it at all!) as a \nminor character blemish, something everybody was doing at the time?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Ownership, McGever helps readers confront these issues by \nexamining the ministries of Jonathan Edwards (17031758), John Wesley \n(17031791), and George Whitefield (17141770), three 18th-century \nfigures who are arguably the founding fathers of modern \nevangelicalism. Each affirmed the institution of slavery at some \npoint in their lives, yet only one (Wesley) came to change his mind \non the subject.\u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                          \nWorking within the system\u0014\n\u0014\nOwnership is divided into four sections. The first takes up the \ninfluences, regarding slavery and its place in the world, that \nEdwards, Wesley, and Whitefield inherited. The second examines how \neach was involved with the institution. The third considers how \nWesley came to oppose slavery and his actions against it. And the \nfourth reckons with the legacies of each leader in light of their \nrelationships to slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe book gives introductory biographies of each man before launching \ninto two informative chapters that provide historical context: one on \nthe history of slavery, and one surveying English and Puritan views \non the subject. Here, McGever describes the attitude that prevailed \nin much of Christianity until the 1700s. As he puts it, Slavery \nexisted in the world as a result of sin and evil, and  the best \ncourse of action was to work within that system.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards, Wesley, and Whitefield naturally adopted this outlook. In \ntheir ministerial training, as they studied the consensus found in \nEnglish and Puritan writers on slavery, they likely absorbed the \nfollowing lessons: White Christians must avoid the improper \nacquisition of slaves (man-stealing is forbidden, but enslaving \nprisoners of war or the offspring of slaves is allowable); the slave \nrelationship must be guided by Christian virtue (slaves are to be \nobedient, masters temperate); and slaves should be evangelized, but \nconversion does not imply emancipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis framework had centuries of the Western Christian tradition \npreceding it. It was thus quite natural, as each man engaged the \nsurrounding socioeconomic world, for them to participate in slavery \nto varying degrees.\u0014\n\u0014\nEdwards ministered in colonial Massachusetts and is known as \nAmericas foremost evangelical theologian. Several of his disciples \n(including one of his sons, Jonathan Jr.) were known for their strong \nstances against slavery, which they derived from Edwardss ethical \nwritings. Yet Edwards himself failed to fully appreciate the \nantislavery implications nascent in his own works.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider that he and his wife, Sarah, enslaved numerous Black \nAfricans, including Venus, a 14-year-old girl they purchased in 1731, \nand Titus, a 3-year-old boy purchased in 1756. While manumission was \nan option for handling ones estate in those daysSarahs mother, for \ninstance, arranged to free her slaves upon her death in 1740the \nEdwardses did not choose this for young Titus, who was passed on to \ntheir eldest son Timothy after their deaths in 1758.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn essence, then, Edwardss relationship with slavery followed the \ncultural norms of the day. While his writings led many to oppose \nslavery in the decades after his death, his example did not live up \nto his ideals.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefields example is even more unsettling. Early in his North \nAmerican ministry, the famous evangelist stopped short of fully \nsupporting legalized slavery in Georgia, where it had been outlawed \nsince the colonys founding in 1733.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield oversaw an orphanage in Savannah named Bethesda (house of \nmercy). Bethesda was one of the central ministries of his life, but \nthe harsh economic realities of sustaining it led him to reconsider \nslavery, viewing it as an option for addressing financial woes at the \norphanage. In time, he came to believe that Black slaves were better \nsuited to work amid hot Georgia summers than white indentured \nservants, who were far more expensive to employ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing a kind of anti-Wilberforce trajectory, Whitefield soon \nbecame a prominent proslavery lobbyist both in Georgia and England, \ncampaigning for a decade until the colony legalized slavery in 1751. \nBy his death in 1770, he owned 49 slaves, all associated with his \norphanage. Though Whitefield was an outstanding evangelist, McGever \nreveals that he was a short-sighted businessman whose mishandling \ncompelled him to rely upon slave labor so that his beloved Bethesda \ncould survive.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf the three men, John Wesleys relationship to slavery was the most \ndistinct, and McGever devotes significant attention to his long and \nslow awakening. Wesley had no exposure to slavery until he visited \nthe Southern colonies in the mid-1730s. There, he and his brother \nCharles learned of the harsh brutalities committed by some slave \nowners.\u0014\n\u0014\nWesleys response, however, was not to call for social change but to \ndouble down on commitments to evangelize enslaved people. For almost \n40 years, as he led the Methodist movement back in England, he wrote \nnothing on the subject. As McGever suggests, this silence reveals a \nmajor blind spot in his social conscience.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Wesley had a gift that neither Edwards nor Whitefield enjoyed: \nlong life. (The latter pair both died in their mid-50s.) When Wesley \nwas almost 70, he began seriously reading antislavery works, and over \nthe next two decades his views changed. He first opposed all forms of \nslave acquisition and called for slave traders to immediately quit \ntheir jobs. In his mid-80s, he came to champion full emancipation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough we should be grateful that one of our evangelical founding \nfathers made the journey to antislavery views, it is stunning to note \nthat it took him 50 years to complete the process, a testimony to the \nfact that sinful cultural norms are extremely difficult to eradicate \nfrom society.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                   \nTheir blind spots, and ours\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGever excels at narrating the history of Edwards, Whitefield, and \nWesley with an irenic tone. While he is clear that their proslavery \nactions are contemptable, he issues no fiery condemnations. Instead, \nwe come to the humble realization that they were deeply flawed \nChristians like the rest of us. They may have ascended to the heights \nof theological acuity, sanctified holiness, and evangelical \nproclamation, but they did so as individuals who also participated in \na system fraught with moral conundrums and evil. They are, in a \nsense, failed heroes, and we should acknowledge this complexity while \ntelling their stories.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, Ownership gives readers a profound historical sense, a \nrecognition that, even among the best of us, social and cultural \nconventions shape believers in ways that future generations might \nfind troubling. When history is written this way, we naturally ask \nourselves, What are my ethical blind spots, and those of my church \nand tribe?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the last chapter, McGever leads readers in an exercise of \nself-reflection patterned after the books fourfold framework: Have \nwe inherited cultural influences that are biblically and ethically \nproblematic? How are we letting these influences shape our thoughts \nand behaviors? What actions can we take to love others in more \nChristlike ways? What kind of legacy do we seek to leave for \nposterity?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile applying history in this manner is not without its pitfalls, \nMcGever recognizes that humble self-examination, inspired by failed \nheroes, is a beneficial exercise for individual Christians and for \nthe church at large. Sinful hearts are infinitely resourceful, and \nsinful patterns are remarkably resistant to change. The lessons of \nMcGevers book should aid the church as it pursues the Reformation \nemphasis of semper reformanda, always reforming according to the \nWord of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert W. Caldwell III is associate professor of church history at \nSouthwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is the author of \nTheologies of the American Revivalists: From Whitefield to Finney.\u0014",

During this time, evangelism was conducted \nmainly in homes, in the context of worship and Christian education. \nItinerant evangelists were rarely found in the early centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Roman society, it was generally expected that everyone would \nparticipate in a cult, but few people thought it necessary to believe \nin pagan gods, like Mars or Venus. The satiric Roman poet Juvenal \nwrote, \"These things not even boys believe, except such as are not \nyet old enough to have paid their penny for a bath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the second century, nearly every popular \nreligionespecially Mithraismaligned itself in some way with solar \nmonotheism. Thus Christians often talked of the similarities and \ndifferences between the sun god and the Light of the World.\u0014\n\u0014\nApologists attempting to defend the truths of Christianity sometimes \nargued with a uniquely Roman mind. Clement of Rome (died c. 97), for \nexample, tried to prove the Resurrection by comparing it to the story \nof the phoenixa mythological bird alleged to be reborn from its \nashes every 500 years. Clement wrote as if all reasonable people \nbelieved in the phoenix story.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity, when it eventually prevailed, often \"baptized\" \npaganism: it established churches on old shrines, like the churches \nof San Clemente and Santa Prisca in Rome. The Church of Santa \nPudenziana in Rome is named, not after a martyred Christian (as the \nlegend goes) but after the Roman senator, Pudens, who originally \nowned the land.\u0014",

    "words": "Ethical lapses are major source of damaged ministries\u0014\n\u0014\nIn their book Ministerial Ethics: Moral Formation for Church Leaders \n(Baker Books), Joe E. Trull and James E. Carter talk about the \nimportance of ethical issues for pastors and church leaders:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ministerial ethics can no longer be assumed, if ever they were. In a \ncity not far from where one of us lives, the pastor of one of the \nfastest growing churches in the South was arrested for drug \nsmuggling. He confessed to flying cocaine from Colombia for $50,000. \nThe minister, whose church had led the state in the number of \nbaptisms for several years, was sentenced to three years in prison \nand fined $10,000.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A regional magazine in a metropolitan area in the Southwest featured \na cover story titled \"Thy Neighbors' Wives,\" which chronicled the \nsexual affairs of a megachurch's pastor. The article claimed that the \ncharismatic leader was obsessed with wealth, power, and status. \"One \nbeautiful woman was not enough,\" said a deacon, referring to the \nminister's wife. \"He was set up as an ideal man. He was adored and he \nate it up.\" (D Magazine, July 1989)\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The saddest chapter in these two tragic stories was the final one. \nNeither fallen minister seemed remorseful when exposed, nor did he \nappear repentant when sanctioned. After a brief absence, they both \nestablished new independent congregations in the same cities where \nthey had previously pastored . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The present crisis in ministerial ethics is both a reflection of our \ntimes and an influence on our society. Ethical failure in the pulpit \naffects the pew. At the same time, clergy morals seem to mirror the \ngeneral decline in morality among the laity. Our day is fraught with \npolitical cover-ups, insider trading on the stock exchange, corporate \nscandals, and media manipulation. Numbed by it all, people are seldom \nshocked when they hear of an immoral minister . . .\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A study of the dismissals of Southern Baptist pastors by Norris \nSmith, a specialist in the area of forced terminations, revealed that \n'immorality' was a leading cause of dismissals, second only to a \n'lack or abuse of communication.' The survey defined 'immorality' as \n'sexual misconduct, substantive lying, and the misuse or embezzlement \nof church funds.' Smith pointed to a lack of accountability and of \nclear professional guidelines among pastors as contributors to their \nethical failure.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Evangelicals critical of campaign appeal to churches\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo evangelical leaders have publicly criticized efforts by President \nBush's re-election campaign to access the membership directories of \nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a July 2 Baptist Press story, \"Bush-Cheney '04 has \nprovided coalition coordinators with a sheet asking them to give \ntheir church directories to the campaign, talk to church groups about \nthe re-election effort and distribute 'Voter Guides' in the churches. \nThe instructions consist of 22 responsibilities and the deadlines by \nwhich they should be completed prior to the Nov. 2 election.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm appalled that the Bush-Cheney campaign would intrude on a local \ncongregation in this way,\" said Richard Land, president of the \nSouthern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. \"It's one \nthing for the church to have a voter registration drive, to seek to \ninform church members on public policy issues, to encourage church \nmembers to fulfill their Christian duty and vote, and to encourage \nthem to vote their values, beliefs and convictions. It's another \nthing entirely for a partisan campaign to ask church members to bring \nin church directories for use as contact lists by the campaign and to \nseek to come into the church and do a voter registration drive and \ndistribute campaign literature.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA leader in the National Association of Evangelicals had a similar \ntake. Richard Cizik, vice president of governmental affairs for the \nNAE, says it sounds like \"an overzealous campaign worker . . . \nstepped over the line of appropriate behavior . . . When party \nofficials, whether Republican or Democrat, do that, it's simply the \nobligation of church members to determine what is appropriate, \nethical and legal and to say, 'No.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe request for church directories to be given to the campaign \ndisturbed Land the most, he said. If he were a pastor, Land said, he \nwould tell members from the pulpit that for them to give their \ndirectories to a campaign is a \"violation of the trust of your fellow \nchurch members and of the body collectively, just as it would be \ninappropriate to share it with a marketing group.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLand added, \"I am fearful that it may provoke a backlash in which \npastors will tell their churches that because of this intrusion the \nchurch is not going to do any voter registration or voter education, \nand that would be tragic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe NAE's Cizik said his advice is for \"everyone, especially pastors \nand church leaders . . . to determine where the bright line of the \nlaw is and take one step back. That way no one can accuse the church \nof engaging in partisan politics or, for that matter, party officials \nof inappropriately targeting churches.\" (Click here to read the full \nstory.)\u0014\n\u0014\nhttp://www.baptistpress.com/bpnews.asp?ID=18624\u0014",

    "title": "EVEN EINSTEIN HAD HIS OFF DAYS",
    "words": "Even Einstein Had His Off Days\u0014\nBy SIMON SINGH\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished: January 2, 2005, New York Times\u0014\n\t\u0014\nLondon\u0014\n\u0014\nWE have now entered what is being celebrated as the Einstein Year, \nmarking the centenary of the physicist's annus mirabilis in 1905, \nwhen he published three landmark papers - those that proved the \nexistence of the atom, showed the validity of quantum physics and, of \ncourse, introduced the world to his theory of special relativity. Not \nbad for a beginner.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's not that I'm so smart,\" Einstein once said, \"It's just that I \nstay with problems longer.\" Whatever the reason for his greatness, \nthere is no doubt that this determination allowed him to invent \ncourageous new physics and explore realms that nobody else had dared \nto investigate.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat he was not, however, was a perfect genius. In fact, when it came \nto the biggest scientific issue of all - the origin of the universe - \nhe was utterly wrong. And while we should certainly laud his \nachievements over the next 12 months, we may learn a more valuable \nlesson by investigating Einstein's greatest failure.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story starts in the late 19th century, when the scientific \nestablishment believed in an eternal and unchanging universe. This \nwas a neat theory of cosmology, because a universe that had always \nexisted did not raise any awkward questions, such as \"When was the \nuniverse created?\" and \"What (or Who) created it?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEinstein grew up in this era, and was similarly convinced that the \nuniverse had existed for an eternity. However, when he developed \ngeneral relativity (his theory of gravity) in 1915, he became aware \nof a tricky problem. Gravity is an attractive force - it attracts \ncoins to the ground and it attracts comets toward the sun. So why \nhadn't gravity caused the matter in the universe to collapse inward \non itself?\u0014\n\u0014\nGravity seemed to be incompatible with an eternal, unchanging \nuniverse, and Einstein certainly had no sympathy for the alternative \nview of a collapsing universe, stating that: \"To admit such a \npossibility seems senseless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIsaac Newton had run into the same problem with his own theory of \ngravity some 250 years earlier. He too believed in an eternal \nuniverse, yet he knew that gravity would have to cause its collapse \nafter a finite time. His solution was to propose that God was \nresponsible for keeping apart all the celestial objects, adjusting \ntheir positions from time to time as part of his cosmic curatorial \nresponsibilities.\u0014\n\u0014\nEinstein was reluctant to invoke God, so his solution was to fiddle \nwith his theory of general relativity, adding an antigravity force \nalongside familiar gravity. This repulsive force would counteract \ngravity over cosmic distances, thereby maintaining the overall \nstability of the universe. There was no evidence for this antigravity \nforce, but Einstein assumed that it had to exist in order to provide \na platform for eternity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough everything now seemed to make sense, there were some \ndissenters. A small band of renegade cosmologists suggested in the \n1920's that the universe was not eternal but had been created at a \nfinite moment in the past. They claimed it had exploded and expanded \nfrom a small, hot, dense state into what we see today. In particular, \nthey argued that it had once been compacted into a primeval super \natom, which had then ruptured and exploded. This model, which has \nsince developed into the Big Bang theory, did not require any \nstabilizing antigravity because it proposed a dynamic, evolving \nuniverse.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Big Bang model was initially ridiculed by the scientific \nestablishment. For example, one of its pioneers, Georges Lematre, \nwas both a cosmologist and an ordained priest, so critics cited his \ntheology as his motivation for advancing such a crackpot theory of \ncreation. They suspected that the model was Lematre's way of \nsneaking a Creator into science. While Einstein was not biased \nagainst Lematre's religious background, he did call the priest's \nphysics \"abominable.\" It was enough to banish the Big Bang model to \nthe hinterlands of cosmology.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, in 1929 Einstein was forced to eat humble pie. Edwin Hubble, \nworking at Mount Wilson Observatory in Southern California, showed \nthat all the distant galaxies in the universe were racing away from \none another as though they were debris from a cosmic explosion. The \nBig Bang model seemed to be correct. And, while it would take several \ndecades before the theory was accepted by the scientific \nestablishment, Einstein, to his credit, did not fight on. \"This is \nthe most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which \nI have ever listened,\" he said, and even called his repulsive force \nthe biggest blunder of his career.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1931, Einstein paid a visit to Hubble at Mount Wilson, where he \nrenounced his own static cosmology and endorsed the expanding \nuniverse model. His support was enough for The New York Times to \nembrace the mavericks, running an article with the headline \"Lematre \nSuggests One, Single, Great Atom, Embracing All Energy, Started The \nUniverse.\" Hubble's hometown newspaper in Missouri, The Springfield \nDaily News, preferred to focus on its local hero: \"Youth Who Left \nOzark Mountains to Study Stars Causes Einstein to Change His Mind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt might seem that Einstein emerges from this story as a flawed \ngenius, one who was not perfect. In fact, there is a twist to the \ntale, one that implies he was perhaps better than perfect.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf gravity pulls everything together, then the expansion of the Big \nBang should be slowing, because all the receding galaxies would be \nattracted to one another. In 1998, however, when astronomers tried to \nmeasure this deceleration, they were astonished to find that the \nuniverse is in fact accelerating. The galaxies are apparently moving \napart faster and faster as time passes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the best explanation scientists can come up with? The \nexistence of an antigravity force. Theorists call this repulsive \neffect \"dark energy,\" but it is exactly the sort of force that \nEinstein posited to maintain the stability of the universe. \nAntigravity is now back in fashion some seven decades after he \nabandoned it. It seems that even when Einstein thought he was wrong, \nhe turned out to be right.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, as we celebrate the Einstein Year, let's also bear in mind the \nfact that he was prepared to admit that he was wrong. Perhaps \nhumility, more than anything, is the mark of true genius.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimon Singh is the author of \"Fermat's Enigma\" and the forthcoming \n\"Big Bang: The Origins of the Universe.\"\u0014",

All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it possible for a nation to remain peaceful and united with more \nthan one variation of Christianity in the country? To many in the \nsixteenth century the answer was a resounding NO. There had been one \nchurch throughout the middle ages, and the toleration of any other \nreligion seemed unthinkable. Both before and after the Reformation, \nwar had followed the rise of sects. As the ideas of the Protestant \nReformation spread throughout Europe, governments as well as the \nchurch were affected as each adopted one form or another of faith. \nMost government leaders believed that allowing more than one sect \nwould threaten the unity of a country.\u0014\nNantesModern Nantes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was the situation in sixteenth century France. For over sixty \nyears the country had tried to find a political solution to the \ncountry's religious divisions. Persecutions, wars, and massacres \ndisrupted the country as Catholics tried to maintain their majority \nfaith while the Huguenots (as French Protestants were called) \nattempted to worship freely and even to seize power.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1572, backed by the king, Catholic forces used the royal wedding \nof the Huguenot Henry of Navarre--in line for the throne--as a \npretext to rid the city of the Protestants that they detested. During \nthe St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre that resulted, 10,000 or more \nProtestants were butchered in Paris and similar massacres followed \nthroughout the provinces. The pope had a medal stamped to honor the \natrocity.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrance's internal wars intensified after the Massacre; kings were \nassassinated; and finally Henry of Navarre himself succeeded to the \nthrone. The Catholics of France, who were in the majority, absolutely \nrefused to be ruled by a Huguenot. In order to bring peace to France, \nHenry adopted the Catholic faith. \"Paris is worth a mass,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe did not forget his Huguenot roots, however. On this date, April 13 \n1598, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, legally recognizing the \nProtestants. Huguenots were allowed to worship privately anywhere in \nFrance and were allowed public worship in specific places. In many \nways the edict was unworkable, for it allowed the Huguenots political \nand military control of parts of the country, making them almost a \nnation within a nation. The Huguenots also gained complete civil \nliberties. Under the Edict of Nantes, the Protestants enjoyed \nreligious freedom and prospered in France for a time. However, piece \nby piece the Catholic majority chipped away at the agreement's \npromises until finally, over eighty years later, King Louis XIV \nrevoked the Edict altogether, again trying to establish one religion \nfor his country.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven after it was revoked, the Edict of Nantes remained an important \nmemorial to freedom of conscience and religious liberty.\u0014\n\u0014\nSource:\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014",

    "title": "EASY EDDIE'S SON -- THIS IS A HERO",
    "words": "Many years ago, Al Capone virtually owned Chicago. Capone wasn't \nfamous for anything heroic. He was notorious for enmeshing the windy \ncity in everything from bootlegged booze and prostitution to murder. \u0014\n\u0014\nCapone had a lawyer nicknamed \"Easy Eddie.\" He was his lawyer for a \ngood reason. Eddie was very good! In fact, Eddie's skill at legal \nmaneuvering kept Big Al out of jail for a long time. To show his \nappreciation, Capone paid him very well. Not only was the money big, \nbut also Eddie got special \u0014\ndividends. For instance, he and his family occupied a fenced-in \nmansion with live-in help and all of the conveniences of the day. The \nestate was so large that it filled an entire Chicago City block. \u0014\n \u0014\nEddie lived the high life of the Chicago mob and gave little \nconsideration to the atrocity that went on around him. \u0014\n \u0014\nEddie did have one soft spot, however. He had a son that he loved \ndearly. Eddie saw to it that his young son had the best of \neverything: clothes, cars and a good education. Nothing was withheld. \nPrice was no object. \u0014\n \u0014\nDespite his involvement with organized crime, Eddie even tried to \nteach him right from wrong. Eddie wanted his son to be a better man \nthan he was. Yet, with all his wealth and influence, there were two \nthings he could not give his son; he couldn't pass on a good name and \na good example. \u0014\n \u0014\nOne day, Easy Eddie reached a difficult decision. Easy Eddie wanted \nto rectify wrongs he had done. He decided he would go to the \nauthorities and tell the truth about Al \"Scarface\" Capone, clean up \nhis tarnished name and offer his son some semblance of integrity. \u0014\n \u0014\nTo do this, he would have to testify against The Mob, and he knew \nthat the cost would be great. So, he testified. Within the year, Easy \nEddie's life ended in a blaze of gunfire on a lonely Chicago Street. \nBut in his eyes, he had given his son the greatest gift he had to \noffer, at the greatest price he would ever pay. \u0014\n \u0014\nPolice removed from his pockets a rosary, a crucifix, a religious \nmedallion and a poem clipped from a magazine. The poem read: \u0014\n \u0014\nThe clock of life is wound but once \u0014\nAnd no man has the power \u0014\nto tell just when the hands will stop, \u0014\nat a late hour or an early hour. \u0014\nNow is the only time you own. \u0014\nLive, love, toil with a will. \u0014\nPlace no faith in time. \u0014\nFor the clock may soon be still. \u0014\n \u0014\n--------------------------------------------------\u0014\n \u0014\nSTORY NUMBER TWO \u0014\n \u0014\nWorld War II produced many heroes. One such man was Lieutenant \nCommander Butch O'Hare. He was a fighter pilot assigned to the \naircraft carrier Lexington, in the South Pacific. \u0014\n \u0014\nOne day his entire squadron was sent on a mission. After he was \nairborne,  he looked at his fuel gauge and realize that someone had \nforgotten to top off his fuel tank. He would not have enough fuel to \ncomplete his mission and get back to his ship. \u0014\n \u0014\nHis flight leader told him to return to the carrier. Reluctantly, he \ndropped out of formation and headed back to the fleet. As he was \nreturning to the mother ship he saw something that turned his blood \ncold, a squadron of Japanese aircraft were speeding their way toward \nthe American fleet. \u0014\n \u0014\nThe American fighters were gone on a sortie, and the fleet was all \nbut defenseless. He couldn't reach his squadron and bring them back \nin time to save the fleet. Nor could he warn the fleet of the \napproaching danger. There was only one thing to do. He must somehow \ndivert them from the fleet. \u0014\n \u0014\nLaying aside all thoughts of personal safety, he dove into the \nformation of  Japanese planes. Wing-mounted 50 caliber's blazed as he \ncharged in, attacking one surprised enemy plane and then another. \u0014\n \u0014\nButch wove i and out of the now broken formation and fired at as \nmany  planes as possible until all his ammunition was finally spent. \nUndaunted, he continued the assault. He dove at the planes, trying to \nclip a wing or tail in hopes of damaging as many enemy planes as \npossible and rendering them unfit to fly. Finally, the exasperated \nJapanese squadron took off in another direction. Deeply relieved, \nButch O'Hare and his tattered fighter limped back to the carrier. \nUpon arrival he reported in and related the \u0014\nevent surrounding his return. The film from the gun-camera mounted on \nhis plane told the tale. It showed the extent of Butch's daring \nattempt to protect his fleet He had, in fact, destroyed five enemy \naircraft.. \u0014\n \u0014\nThis took place on February 20, 1942, and for that action Butch \nbecame the Navy's first Ace of W.W.II, and the first Naval Aviator to \nwin the Congressional Medal of Honor. A year later Butch was killed \nin aerial combat at the age of 29. \u0014\n \u0014\nHis home town would not allow the memory of this WWII hero to fade, \nand today, O'Hare Airport in Chicago is named in tribute to the \ncourage of this great man. The next time you find yourself at O'Hare \nInternational, give some thought to visiting Butch's memorial-- \ndisplaying his statue and his Medal of \u0014\nHonor. It's located between Terminals 1 and 2. SO WHAT DO THESE TWO \nSTORIES \u0014\nHAVE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER? \u0014\n \u0014\nButch O'Hare was Easy Eddie's son!\u0014",

B. \nKnight, a white man she had been hired to care for, had held her \nagainst her will and threatened to shoot her. She said she grabbed a \ngun and shot him when he raised a metal bar to strike her. She was \nconvicted by an all-white, all-male jury.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Baker's grandnephew, Roosevelt Curry, has led the family's effort \nto clear her name.\u0014",

    "title": "ETHIOPIA: THE COUNTRY BLESSED BY GOD",
    "words": "\"Although scarcely known by Westerners, the Ethiopian church offers \none of the most heroic success stories in Christianity,\" writes \nPhilip Jenkins in The Next Christendom (Oxford, 2002). Jenkins was \nthinking, perhaps, of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians' tenacious \nsurvival in the face of Islamic conquest during the Middle Ages. But \nEthiopians endured persecution from Europeans too. In 1936, \nMussolini's army captured the capital, Addis Ababa, and the following \nyear expelled all Protestant missionaries from the country, including \nthose from the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM). SIM missionaries feared \nfor the fledgling ministry they had started in southern Ethiopia. \nThey had hoped to create an indigenous church that propagated and \nsupported itself. But the work was less than ten years old andstill \nsmall and seemingly reliant on the missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith only 150 members, the church faced an uncertain future and \nsuffered harsh persecution by the Italians, who saw it as potentially \nsubversive. Despite these circumstances, however, the church thrived \nand developed its own local character under the occupation. Popular \nsongs reveal the intense emotion of this period. One Christian \nimprisoned by the Italians sang, \"Why should we not suffer a little \nwhile here and now  We will reign with him through all eternity.\" \nAnother songwriter proclaimed, \"The medicine is Jesus.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the occupation SIM received no word from Southern \nEthiopia. Then in 1941, a former SIM missionary, Laurie Davidson, \narrived along with the liberating British army and relayed the \nunthinkable news: The struggling remnant of 150 had grown into a \nchurch of around 10,000 believers.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour years later, he reported on the Walamo congregation in \nparticular, which had continued to expand: \"The membership today \nstands at somewhere around 15,000 baptized believers, and its \nremarkable history comes a grand second to that recorded in the book \nof the Acts of the Apostles.\" Describing the unique organization and \nworship style of the Walamo Christians, Davidson commented, \"Let it \nbe emphasized that this organization is wholly indigenous, and was \nbuilt up when there was no missionary in their country to exercise \nwhat he loves to think of as his indispensable guidance to the work \nof God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough missionaries eventually returned, the church retained much \nof its indigenous character and independence and grew into the Kale \nHeywet (\"Word of Life\") Church. It now numbers over 4 million \nbelievers-the largest evangelical church in Ethiopia today. As with \nthe Chinese church under Communism and other indigenous Christian \ncommunities around the world, a church left alone in the heat of \npersecution did not die but exploded in growth and came into its own.\u0014",

    "words": "Among Eastern European Jews in the early 1900s, the world of sacred \nand scholarly learning belonged only to men. In the movie Yentl, a \nyoung, unmarried woman named Yentl (Barbara Streisand) has such an \ninsatiable appetite for learning and sacred wisdom that she leaves \nhome, changes her name, masquerades as an older boy, and gets \naccepted into a Talmudic academy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a scene near the beginning of the movie, before she masquerades as \na boy, Yentl is in a Jewish outdoor market selecting a book from a \nbook wagon. The bookseller finishes with another customer, then turns \nto Yentl and says, \"You're in the wrong place, miss. Books for women \nare over here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'd like to buy this one, please,\" Yentl says.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bookseller takes the book from her, saying, \"Sacred books are for \nmen!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why?\" she asks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's the law, that's why.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Where's it written?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Never mind where. It's a law.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, if it's a law, it must be written somewhere. Maybe in here. \nI'll take it.\" Yentl grabs for the book, but the bookseller \nimmediately grabs it back.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Miss, do me a favor,\" he says, picking up another book. \"Do yourself \na favor. Oh, here, a nice picture book. Girls like picture books.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYentl asks, \"What if I told you it's for my father?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why didn't you say?\" responds the bookseller, selling her the book \nshe wanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the next scene, Yentl is in the kitchen reading a thick book and \ncooking a fish on the stove. Her father is in an adjoining room \ntutoring a student in the Talmud. He asks the student questions, and \nYentl quickly answers them out loud from the kitchen.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who is strong?\" her father asks the student.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He who controls his passions,\" Yentl answers, though her father \nignores her.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Concentrate. Try, David,\" he asks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He who controls his passions,\" Yentl repeats.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm trying,\" the student says. \"He who\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He who controls his passions!\" Yentl yells.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe student asks, \"Yentl knows Talmud?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think that's enough for today,\" the father declares.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the next scene, over a game of chess, Yentl tells her father she \nenvies students of the Talmud. They discuss life and the mysteries of \nthe universe while \"I'm learning to tell a herring from a carp!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHe tells her that men and women have different obligations \"and don't \nask why,\" but he finally gives in to Yentl's requests for another \nstudy session. Yentl is happy as she gets a large book from a \nwell-stocked bookshelf. The father tells her to close the shutters.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs she's doing this she asks, \"If you don't have to hide studying \nfrom God, then why from the neighbors?\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why? Because I trust God will understand. I'm not so sure about the \nneighbors.\" He reflects on her desire for learning: \"Questions, \nquestions. Even when you were little. Does a goat have a soul? What \nwas before the universe?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThey laugh together, but he is very tired and goes to bed. Yentl, \nalone, takes a prayer shawl, puts it above her head in front of a \nbright lamp. Her upper body is mystically silhouetted as she prays: \n\"God, oh merciful Father, I'm wrapped in a robe of light, clothed in \nyour glory, that spreads its wings over my soul. May I be worthy.\"\u0014",

    "title": "EVIDENCE FOR CHRISTIANITY - BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Evidence for Christianity contains hundreds upon hundreds of solid \narguments and established, credible, and need I add irrefutable facts \nthat successfully demonstrate and prove (yes, prove) not only the \nvalidity of both the Old and New Testaments, but the existence of God \nas Yeshua the Nazarene.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is, however, one major-and I do mean major-problem within this \npublication: The chapter on Messianic prophecies is so lacking in \nclarity that I fear Talmudic scholars trained in the `refutation of \nChristianity' will ultimately laugh in triumph when they read the \nchapter by itself. Joshua McDowell only lists about 50 prophecies, \nmany of which outwardly have nothing to do with the Messiah when \napplied in modern Rabbinical context of the OT (although McDowell \ndoes list many interpretations from Targum, which satisfactorily \ndemonstrate the ancient Hebrew exegesis of these Scriptures) McDowell \nfails to list all of the Messianic prophecies, and doesn't analyze \nthe ostensive modern-Judaic responses and arguments to Christian \nScripture usage; arguments of which, may I add, have all been refuted \nby many, many Christian and Messianic Jewish scholars unsurpassed in \ntheir fields, some of whom were even trained Talmudists. Unless you \nexplain why Messianic prophecy in the OT is interpreted the way it is \nby Christians and Messianic Jews (and there are numerous legitimate \nreasons), Rabbis will ultimately accuse the NT of twisting and \nperverting Scripture, which in actuality is not the case at all. \nSimply listing references from Targum is not enough-there are plenty \nof Messianic prophecy interpretations in Gemara that can definitely \nbe used to counter rabbinical claims that Yeshua is not Messiah. \nMcDowell also fails to explain why the majority of Jews today \ndisbelieve that Yeshua is Messiah. Unless all of these aspects, \narguments, and refutations are compiled, Messianic prophecy \ncorrelated into the NT looks abysmally foolish to the trained \nrabbinical scholar. For this reason, I must deduct a star. \nFortunately, there are many arguments and historical proofs scattered \nthroughout this compilation that, if organized, would lead rabbis \ndown the serious road of doubt, if not lead them to renounce \nRabbinism altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy trying to discredit the information within this compilation, \natheists would be attempting to undermine years and years of \nhistorical and archeological facts obtained from an overwhelming \nnumber of secular sources. This work also contains a great assortment \nof philosophical and theological arguments for Christ Yeshua being \nGod as well, although I quiver at the works of many modern Christian \ntheologians and pseudo-apologetics: Many skeptics, whether atheist or \nJudaic, argue the question \"If filled with God's Holy Spirit why \ndon't Christians have sound, irrefutable answers to all inquiries?\" \nThe answer: most Christians haven't even scratched the surface, let \nalone have been truly baptized by the Holy Ghost. Besides, many \nChristian scholars are unfamiliar with the Talmud and the Jewish \narguments against Christ. Although this compilation is sound for the \nmost part, the author could have done so much more to prove the \nexistence of Christ to Jewish unbelievers. Overall, I'm satisfied \nwith this scholarly work; it will indubitably frustrate skeptics and \natheists alike. My experience in Christ Yeshua precludes any \npossibility of Him not being God anyway.\u0014",

The public record is bulging \nwith the lengthy litany of his vile and unforgivable atrocities: \ngenocidal assaults against the Kurds; aggressive wars against Iran \nand Kuwait; use of internationally banned weapons like nerve gas; \nsystematic torture of countless thousands of political prisoners.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat really mattered was whether an Iraq freed from his death grip \ncould hold him accountable in a way that nurtured hope for a better \nfuture. A carefully conducted, scrupulously fair trial could have \nhelped undo some of the damage inflicted by his rule. It could have \nset a precedent for the rule of law in a country scarred by decades \nof arbitrary vindictiveness. It could have fostered a new national \nunity in an Iraq long manipulated through its religious and ethnic \ndivisions.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt could have, but it didnt. After a flawed, politicized and \ndivisive trial, Mr. Hussein was handed his sentence: death by \nhanging. This week, in a cursory 15-minute proceeding, an appeals \ncourt upheld that sentence and ordered that it be carried out \nposthaste. Most Iraqis are now so preoccupied with shielding their \nfamilies from looming civil war that they seem to have little emotion \nleft to spend on Mr. Hussein or, more important, on their own fading \ndreams of a new and better Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat might have been a watershed now seems another lost opportunity. \nAfter nearly four years of war and thousands of American and Iraqi \ndeaths, it is ever harder to be sure whether anything fundamental has \nchanged for the better in Iraq.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis week began with a story of British and Iraqi soldiers storming a \npolice station that hid a secret dungeon in Basra.

It might have been a story from the final days of Baathist \nrule in March 2003, when British and American troops entered Basra \nbelieving they were liberating the subjugated Shiite south. But it \nwas December 2006, and the wretched men being liberated were \nprisoners of the new Iraqi Shiite authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nToppling Saddam Hussein did not automatically create a new and better \nIraq.

    "title": "EINSTEIN AS A CHILD AND OTHER ISSUES OF HIS LIFE",
    "words": "Was Einstein a slow learner as a child?\u0014\n\u0014\nEinstein was slow in learning how to speak. His parents even \nconsulted a doctor. He also had a cheeky rebelliousness toward \nauthority, which led one headmaster to expel him and another to amuse \nhistory by saying that he would never amount to much. But these \ntraits helped make him a genius. His cocky contempt for authority led \nhim to question conventional wisdom. His slow verbal development made \nhim curious about ordinary things  such as space and time  that \nmost adults take for granted. His father gave him a compass at age \nfive, and he puzzled over the nature of a magnetic field for the rest \nof his life. And he tended to think in pictures rather than words.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas Einstein learning disabled?\u0014\n\u0014\nSome researchers claim to detect in Einsteins childhood a mild \nmanifestation of autism or Aspergers syndrome. Simon Baron-Cohen, \nthe director of the autism research center at Cambridge University, \nis among those. He writes that autism is associated with a \nparticularly intense drive to systemize and an unusually low drive \nto empathize. He also notes that this pattern explains the islets \nof ability that people with autism display in subjects like math or \nmusic or drawing -- all skills that benefit from systemizing.* I do \nnot find such a long-distance diagnosis to be convincing. Even as a \nteenager, Einstein made close friends, had passionate relationships, \nenjoyed collegial discussions, communicated well verbally and could \nempathize with friends and humanity in general.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid Einstein flunk math?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne widely held belief about Einstein is that he failed math as a \nstudent, an assertion that is made, often accompanied by the phrase \nas everyone knows, by scores of books and thousands of websites \ndesigned to reassure underachieving students. A Google search of \nEinstein failed math turns up more than 500,000 references. The \nallegation even made it into the famous Ripleys Believe it or Not! \nnewspaper column.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlas, Einsteins childhood offers history many savory ironies, but \nthis is not one of them. In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a \nclipping of the Ripleys column with the headline Greatest living \nmathematician failed in mathematics. Einstein laughed. I never \nfailed in mathematics, he replied, correctly. Before I was fifteen \nI had mastered differential and integral calculus. In primary \nschool, he was at the top of his class and far above the school \nrequirements in math. By age 12, his sister recalled, he already \nhad a predilection for solving complicated problems in applied \narithmetic, and he decided to see if he could jump ahead by learning \ngeometry and algebra on his own. His parents bought him the textbooks \nin advance so that he could master them over summer vacation. Not \nonly did he learn the proofs in the books, he also tackled the new \ntheories by trying to prove them on his own. He even came up on his \nown with a way to prove the Pythagorean theory.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid Einstein think in pictures rather than words?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, his great breakthroughs came from visual experiments performed \nin his head rather than the lab. They were called Gedankenexperiment \n-- thought experiments. At age 16, he tried to picture in his mind \nwhat it would be like to ride alongside a light beam. If you reached \nthe speed of light, wouldnt the light waves seem stationery to you? \nBut Maxwells famous equations describing electromagnetic waves \ndidnt allow that. He knew that math was the language nature uses to \ndescribe her wonders, so he could visualize how equations were \nreflected in realities. So for the next ten years he wrestled with \nthis thought experiment until he came up with the special theory of \nrelativity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat thought picture did Einstein use for special relativity?\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong other things, he pictured lightning striking at both ends of a \nmoving train. A person on the embankment might see the strikes as \nsimultaneous, but to someone on the speeding train they would appear \nto have happened at different moments. Because the train is speeding \nforward, the light from the strike at the front of the train would \nreach him a moment before the light from the strike at the back of \nthe train. From that he realized that simultaneity is relative to \nyour state of motion, and from that he came up with the idea that \nthere is no such thing as absolute time. Time is relative. Hence the \nspecial theory of relativity.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was Einsteins miracle year?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1905, Einstein had graduated from college but had not been able to \nget a doctoral dissertation accepted or get an academic job. So he \nwas toiling six days a week as a third-class examiner in the Swiss \npatent office. During his spare time, he produced four papers that \nupended physics. The first showed that light could be conceived as \nparticles as well as waves. The second proved the existence of atoms \nand molecules. The third, the special theory of relativity, said that \nthere was no such thing as absolute time or space. And the fourth \nnoted an equivalence between energy and mass described by the most \nfamous equation in all of physics, E=mc2.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was Einsteins personal life like at the time?\u0014\n\u0014\nHelping him check his math was a moody Serbian, Mileva Mari, who had \nbeen the only woman in his physics class at college. They had fallen \npassionately in love and had an illegitimate daughter, which he \nallowed to be given up for adoption before he ever saw her. They then \ngot married and had two boys. Eventually their relationship \ndisintegrated, and Einstein sought a divorce. He offered her a deal: \nOne of those 1905 papers, he presumed, would eventually win the Nobel \nPrize, and if she gave him a divorce he would give her the prize \nmoney. She thought for a week and accepted. Because Einsteins \ntheories were so radical, it took until 1922 before he was awarded \nthe prize and she could collect.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow was relativity received?\u0014\n\u0014\nScientists were unsure at first whether the general theory was right. \nBut Einstein proposed a dramatic experiment. At the next appropriate \neclipse, in 1919, scientists could measure how starlight passing \nclose to the sun was bent by its gravity. The six-deck headline in \nthe New York Times read: Lights All Askew in the Heavens / Men of \nScience More or Less Agog Over Results of Eclipse Observations / \nEinstein Theory Triumphs. That was back when folks knew how to write \ngreat headlines. Einsteins launch into fame contributed to the birth \nof a new celebrity age. He became a scientific supernova and humanist \nicon, one of the most famous faces on the planet. The public \nearnestly puzzled over his theories, elevated him into a cult of \ngenius, and canonized him as a secular saint.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did it take so long for Einstein to get a Nobel Prize?\u0014\n\u0014\nInitially his 1905 papers were considered baffling and unproven. He \nwas first nominated for the prize in 1910 by the chemistry laureate \nWilhelm Ostwald, who had rejected Einsteins pleas for a job nine \nyears earlier. Ostwald cited special relativity, but the Swedish \ncommittee was mindful of the charge in Alfred Nobels will that the \nprize should go to the most important discovery or invention, and \nit felt that relativity theory was not exactly either of those.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dramatic announcement in November 1919 that the eclipse \nobservations had confirmed parts of Einsteins theory should have \nmade 1920 his year. But politics intervened. Up until then, the \nprimary justifications for denying Einstein a Nobel had been \nscientific: his work was purely theoretical, and it putatively did \nnot involve the discovery of any new laws. After the eclipse \nobservations, the arguments against Einstein were tinged with more \ncultural and personal bias, including anti-Semitism. To his critics, \nthe fact that he had suddenly achieved superstar status was evidence \nof his self-promotion rather than his worthiness of a Nobel. So the \n1920 prize instead went to a scientist who was Einsteins scientific \nopposite: Charles-Edouard Guillaume, who had made his modest mark on \nscience by assuring that standard measures were more precise and \ndiscovering metal alloys that had practical uses, including making \ngood measuring rods.\u0014\nBy 1921, the publics Einstein mania was in full force, and there was \na groundswell of support for him to win the Nobel  indeed, an \nexpressed sense that it would be inexplicable if he didnt. But the \ncommittee was still not ready. The great impasse threatened to become \nembarrassing. To the rescue rode a theoretical physicist from the \nUniversity of Uppsala, Carl Wilhelm Oseen, who joined the committee \nin 1922. He realized that the whole issue of relativity theory was so \nencrusted with controversy that it would be better to try a different \ntack. So Oseen pushed hard to give the prize to Einstein for the \ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Each part of that \nphrase was carefully calculated. It was not a nomination for \nrelativity, of course. In fact, despite the way it has been phrased \nby some historians, it was not for Einsteins theory of light quanta, \neven though that was the primary focus of the relevant 1905 paper. \nNor was it for any theory at all. Instead, it was for the discovery \nof a law.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus it was that Einstein became the recipient of the 1921 Nobel \nPrize, in the words of the official citation, for his services to \ntheoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of \nthe photoelectric effect. Einstein would not, as it turned out, ever \nwin a Nobel for his work on relativity and gravitation, nor for \nanything other than the photoelectric effect.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1921, the publics Einstein mania was in full force, and there was \na groundswell of support for him to win the Nobel  indeed, an \nexpressed sense that it would be inexplicable if he didnt.

His first trip to America was to raise money for \nthe Zionist movement, and in 1933 he fled Hitler and moved to \nPrinceton. Near the end of his life, he was offered the presidency of \nIsrael, which he politely declined.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid Einstein believe in God?\u0014\n\u0014\nYes. He defined God in an impersonal, deistic fashion, but he deeply \nbelieved that Gods handiwork was reflected in the harmony of \nnatures laws and the beauty of all that exists. He often invoked \nGod, such as by saying He wouldnt play dice, when rejecting quantum \nmechanics. Einsteins belief in something larger than himself \nproduced in him a wondrous mixture of confidence and humility. As he \nfamously declared: A spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe \n a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of \nwhich we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the \npursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked directly if he believed in God, he always insisted he did, \nand explained it once this way: We are in the position of a little \nchild entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. \nThe child knows someone must have written those books. It does not \nknow how. It does not understand the languages in which they are \nwritten. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the \narrangement of the books but doesnt know what it is. That, it seems \nto me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being \ntoward God. We see the universe marvelously arranged and obeying \ncertain laws but only dimly understand these laws.\u0014",

    "words": "Embracing Change\u0014\n         \u0014\n             Business changes at breakneck speed. The world seems to \nchange\u0014\n         even faster. So why is it when change is thrust upon us, we \nso often have the impulse\u0014\n         to resist with all our might?\u0014\n\u0014\n            For illumination, we talked to Rick Maurer, author and \nleading expert on\u0014\n         change management.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            We resist change for three reasons, says Rick. The \nfirst is I dont get it,\u0014\n         which is to say, I dont understand what youre talking \nabout. The second is, I\u0014\n         dont like it This is more of an emotional reaction, \nusually based in fear. If we\u0014\n         change the way the department works, I might lose my job, or \nmy power. The third\u0014\n         reason for resisting is, I dont like you, which is to say \nI dont have confidence\u0014\n         in you to lead this change.\u0014\n\u0014\n            So the first order of business, according to Rick, is \nunderstanding these three\u0014\n         issues. Whether youre the person resisting change, or \ntrying to influence others to\u0014\n         change, you need to understand where the resistance is \ncoming from in order to\u0014\n         deal with it.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Once you understand the resistance, the next step is \ndeciding, Is this a change\u0014\n         I can influence? If its not, then its time to accept the \nchange and move on.\u0014\n\u0014\n            After all, says Rick, we only have so much energy to \nexpend. Using up that\u0014\n         energy griping about things only makes things worse:\u0014\n\u0014\n            So what tips does Rick offer for dealing with change? \u0014\n         Several.\u0014\n\u0014\n            His first suggestion is to avoid knee-jerk reactions. \nThose are the things we\u0014\n         say or do before our brain gets engaged: says Rick. And \ntheyre usually the things\u0014\n         that get us in trouble: Do you resort to sarcasm? \nCondescension? Rick suggests that you\u0014\n         learn to recognize what triggers those knee-jerk reactions \nin you. Then learn to diffuse     \u0014\n         them. Like road rage, you can learn to control yourself if \nyou just stop and think!\u0014\n\u0014\n            His second tip is to have the right intention: What \nRick means by that is, know what \u0014\n         you want to get out of the situation. If your intention is \nto let someone know that her idea is \u0014\n         stupid (and so is she), thats okay, but youre likely \ndamaging the relationship. Is that \u0014\n         what you really want? \u0014\n        \u0014\n            Or, is your intention to try and influence her, but still \nhave a good working relationship? Clarity of \u0014\n         intention will help you achieve the outcome you desire.\u0014\n\u0014\n            His third suggestion is to always listen with a \nwillingness to be changed:\u0014\n         Rick describes this as really trying to understand where the \nother person is coming from. Because          according to Rick, \nwhen someone really feels like you get it: something shifts: We \nopen \u0014\n         ourselves and open the other person to the possibility of \nbeing influenced.\u0014\n\u0014\n            When it comes to change, says Rick, We dont have a \nchoice. Everyday we get\u0014\n         older. Children grow up. Organizations shift direction. \nThats life: But heres the\u0014\n         good part according to Rick, If we can embrace that life \nreally is change rather\u0014\n         than stability and the status quo, life is going to be a lot \nmore interesting!\u0014",

    "words": "Eat, \nDrink, and Relax\u0014\nThink the Pilgrims would frown on today's football-tossing, \nturkey-gobbling Thanksgiving festivities? Maybe not.\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm sure Thanksgiving Day church services are lovely, but I have to \nadmit that I've never been to one. In my family, Thanksgiving means \nwatching parades and football games, cooking, eating, and maybe \nplaying a few games of pinochle. Aside from the pre-dinner prayer, \nit's not an overtly religious celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither was the so-called \"First Thanksgiving\" in 1621.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Separatists (only much later known as \"Pilgrims\") who founded \nPlymouth Colony in 1620 disdained most holidays. In fact, they \nrecognized only three: the weekly Sabbath, the Day of Humiliation and \nFasting, and the Day of Thanksgiving and Praise. The latter two were \nnot set on the calendar but could be proclaimed in response to God's \nperceived disfavor or favor. Because colonial life was so bound to \nthe growing cycle, though, fast days were most often called in the \nspring, when there wasn't much to eat anyway, while feast days often \naccompanied the fall harvest. Both observances occurred on \nweekdaysusually the day of special sermons known as Lecture Day, \nwhich was Thursday in Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the famous feast shared by about 50 colonists and 90 Wampanoag \nIndians was not an official Day of Thanksgiving. In the only \nsurviving firsthand account of the meal, Edward Winslow describes it \nthis way:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on \nfowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together \nafter we had gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one day \nkilled as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company \nalmost a week. At which time, among other recreations, we exercised \nour arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest \ntheir greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three \ndays we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five \ndeer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed upon our \ngovernor, and upon the captain, and others. And although it be not \nalways so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the \ngoodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you \npartakers of our plenty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch entertainments as hunting and arms exercises had no place in a \nreligious Thanksgiving observance. They did belong, however, in the \nlong tradition of harvest festivals, with which the Separatists would \nhave been quite familiar. In their native England, days of feasting \nand leisure commonly followed the harvest. Earlier harvest festivals \ninclude ancient Greek Thesmophoria, ancient Roman Cerealia, and \nJewish Sukkot.\u0014\n\u0014\n(This is not to say that the Separatists' 1621 feast had more in \ncommon with pagan Thesmophoria than with their first Christian \nThanksgiving, which they observed in 1623 to celebrate a crop-saving \nrainfall. In the Separatist worldview, shared in almost all \nparticulars by the wider Puritan community, nothing fell outside the \nexperience of faith. As Leland Ryken wrote in Worldly Saints: The \nPuritans As They Really Were (Zondervan, 1986):\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Puritanism was impelled by the insight that all of life is \nGod's. The Puritans lived simultaneously in two worldsthe invisible \nspiritual world and the physical world of earthly existence. For the \nPuritans, both worlds were equally real, and there was no cleavage of \nlife into sacred and secular. All of life was sacred.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, whether you go to church on Thanksgiving or not, the \nday can be seasoned with what Puritan divine Richard Baxter called \"a \ndrop of glory.\" As Paul and David said, \"The earth is the Lord's, and \neverything in it\" (Psalm 24:1, 1 Cor. 10:26).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman was managing editor of Christian History & Biography. \nShe is now working on a Ph.D in church history from Duke University. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2001 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014",

Maybe not.\u0014\nElesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm sure Thanksgiving Day church services are lovely, but I have to \nadmit that I've never been to one. In my family, Thanksgiving means \nwatching parades and football games, cooking, eating, and maybe \nplaying a few games of pinochle. Aside from the pre-dinner prayer, \nit's not an overtly religious celebration.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither was the so-called \"First Thanksgiving\" in 1621.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Separatists (only much later known as \"Pilgrims\") who founded \nPlymouth Colony in 1620 disdained most holidays. In fact, they \nrecognized only three: the weekly Sabbath, the Day of Humiliation and \nFasting, and the Day of Thanksgiving and Praise. The latter two were \nnot set on the calendar but could be proclaimed in response to God's \nperceived disfavor or favor. Because colonial life was so bound to \nthe growing cycle, though, fast days were most often called in the \nspring, when there wasn't much to eat anyway, while feast days often \naccompanied the fall harvest. Both observances occurred on \nweekdaysusually the day of special sermons known as Lecture Day, \nwhich was Thursday in Massachusetts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the famous feast shared by about 50 colonists and 90 Wampanoag \nIndians was not an official Day of Thanksgiving. In the only \nsurviving firsthand account of the meal, Edward Winslow describes it \nthis way:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on \nfowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together \nafter we had gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one day \nkilled as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company \nalmost a week. At which time, among other recreations, we exercised \nour arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest \ntheir greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three \ndays we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five \ndeer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed upon our \ngovernor, and upon the captain, and others. And although it be not \nalways so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the \ngoodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you \npartakers of our plenty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch entertainments as hunting and arms exercises had no place in a \nreligious Thanksgiving observance. They did belong, however, in the \nlong tradition of harvest festivals, with which the Separatists would \nhave been quite familiar. In their native England, days of feasting \nand leisure commonly followed the harvest. Earlier harvest festivals \ninclude ancient Greek Thesmophoria, ancient Roman Cerealia, and \nJewish Sukkot.\u0014\n\u0014\n(This is not to say that the Separatists' 1621 feast had more in \ncommon with pagan Thesmophoria than with their first Christian \nThanksgiving, which they observed in 1623 to celebrate a crop-saving \nrainfall. In the Separatist worldview, shared in almost all \nparticulars by the wider Puritan community, nothing fell outside the \nexperience of faith. As Leland Ryken wrote in Worldly Saints: The \nPuritans As They Really Were (Zondervan, 1986):\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"Puritanism was impelled by the insight that all of life is \nGod's. The Puritans lived simultaneously in two worldsthe invisible \nspiritual world and the physical world of earthly existence. For the \nPuritans, both worlds were equally real, and there was no cleavage of \nlife into sacred and secular. All of life was sacred.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, whether you go to church on Thanksgiving or not, the \nday can be seasoned with what Puritan divine Richard Baxter called \"a \ndrop of glory.\" As Paul and David said, \"The earth is the Lord's, and \neverything in it\" (Psalm 24:1, 1 Cor. 10:26).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nElesha Coffman was managing editor of Christian History & Biography. \nShe is a Ph.D in church history from Duke University. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2001 by the author or Christianity Today International/\u0014",

Barack Obama recently received an endorsement from a \ncontroversial religious leader who promotes hate toward certain \ngroups. Ironically, Sen. John McCain was endorsed by another \nreligious leader who also promotes hate toward certain groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, both candidates were endorsed by proponents of \ndifferent forms of religious extremism. One endorsement drew \nimmediate criticism, the other did not.\u0014\n\u0014\nSen. Obama's endorsement came from Nation of Islam leader Louis \nFarrakhan. Farrakhan is well known for his anti-Semitic views as well \nas other extreme positions concerning homosexuality and race in \nAmerican culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the final debate between Senators Clinton and Obama, Tim \nRussert pressed the Illinois senator about the endorsement. Obama \nreplied that he had long denounced Farrakhan's anti-Semitism as well \nas other extremist views. Sen. Clinton urged Obama to \"reject\" the \nendorsement, which upon reflection he did.\u0014\n\u0014\nSen. McCain's endorsement came from John Hagee, pastor of a sprawling \nmega-church in San Antonia, Texas. And although many of Hagee's views \nare every bit as extreme as Louis Farrakhan's, there has hardly been \na ripple of controversy about the endorsement. In fact, McCain stood \nbeside Hagee during the endorsement and received it gladly and with \ngratitude.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese two religious leaders are like mirror images of each other. \nEven though they work out of different religious traditions and \nreflect divergent world views, some of their positions are eerily \nsimilar.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor instance, both men have unique theories about Hurricane Katrina \nand the destruction of New Orleans.\u0014\n\u0014\n Farrakhan believes the levies were deliberately sabotaged to allow \nflood waters to destroy mostly black neighborhoods. He accuses the \ngovernment of deliberately trying to undo New Orleans.\u0014\n\u0014\nHagee, on the other hand, believes God sent Hurricane Katrina to New \nOrleans to punish the city for hosting a Gay Pride parade the week \nbefore the storm.\u0014\n\u0014\n Both men also have interesting positions on Israel. Farrakhan, for \nhis part, has referred to Jewish people as \"bloodsuckers,\" and \nJudaism as a \"gutter religion.\" The Nation of Islam leader blames \nIsrael for the war in Iraq arguing the whole issue is really about \nIsraeli security.\u0014\n\u0014\nHagee's anti-Semitism is more nuanced. As part of his end-time \ntheology he believes that the United States must offer unconditional \nsupport for the state of Israel. Hagee also advocates an immediate \nstrike against Iran. He believes the final battle of Armageddon will \nbegin once a war with Iran has started.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Jesus will come. And anyone who has not embraced Jesus as the \nMessiah will perish. That, presumably, would include all Jewish \npeople who have not embraced Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\n In addition to this passive-aggressive stance toward Israel, Hagee \nis also virulently anti-Catholic. He has referred to the Roman Church \nas \"The Great Whore,\" \"an apostate church\" and \"the anti-Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Donahue, president of the Catholic League, says that Hagee \"has \nwaged an unrelenting war against the Catholic Church.\" He wonders if \nMcCain will \"reject\" or \"denounce\" these views.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn general, significant problems exist when political candidates are \nendorsed by religious groups. Elected officials are supposed to serve \nall the people, not just the ones who pray in a certain way.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when endorsements, religious or otherwise, come from groups that \npromote prejudice and hate, then critical concerns arise. Elected \nofficials and especially the president must have the courage and the \ncharacter to reject and denounce extremist views, no matter how many \nvotes it may cost them.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo good can from those who promote hate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJames L.

However, she saw no \ncontradiction between being a devout, practicing Muslim and a devout, \npracticing Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt one level, such twisted logic would hardly seem to warrant what \nJane Austin called the \"compliment of rational opposition.\" However, \nin our live-and-let-live culture, many will leap to Redding's \ndefense, celebrating her openness and sensitivity while denouncing \nthe Episcopal Church for revoking her priestly office. I, by \ncontrast, am thankful to live in a nation where one is free to \nbelieve and practice as one chooses, and I am thankful for a church \nthat recognizes the confession \"Jesus is Lord\" is the irreducible \nminimum of Christian faith and practice.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem here isn't that Redding wants to be sensitive and open. \nThere was no one more sensitive and open to others, especially those \ndifferent from himself, than Jesus. The problem is putting \nChristianity and Islam into a blender and coming out with a spiritual \nsmoothie does violence to both religions. While I am no expert on \nIslam, I do know the core confession of the Christian faith is that \nJesus is God's truly divine, truly human one-of-a-kind Son. Thus, for \nChristians, Jesus is the decisive clue to ultimate reality. For \nMuslims, Muhammad is. This is a fork in a road that leads to two very \ndifferent understandings and experiences of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBottom line, it all comes down to Easter: If Jesus is just another \nprophet on the order of Muhammad, who died for keeps and lives on \nmerely as a memory or spiritual influence, then one can make of \nChristianity whatever one will. But if Jesus was truly raised, \nleaving his empty tomb behind like the spent cocoon of a newborn \nbutterfly, then he is Lord of a new creation, a new kingdom, a new \nworld. Sin and death are put on notice; the dawn of God's new day has \nbroken.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the day, Christians must love and respect their Muslim \nneighbors not because religiously speaking, these two faiths are more \nor less the same, but because their Easter Lord told them that in his \nname and for his sake, they could do no less.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob Setzer Jr. is pastor of First Baptist Church of Christ in Macon, \nGa.\u0014",

    "words": "(Matthew 19:1-6) In His statement did Jesus grant any ground \nfor divorce and\u0014\n         remarriage? Scholars are divided as to their question. Some \ndeny\u0014\n         that Jesus did so teach. They base their position on the \nclaim that\u0014\n         the words except it be for fornication are not genuine \nwords\u0014\n         of Jesus, but are a later addition by some scribe to tone \nclown\u0014\n         Jesus words. They point to the fact that in a similar \nstatement\u0014\n         recorded in Luke 16:18 he omits this statement as found in\u0014\n         Matthew 5:32. And that Mark in reporting the incident under\u0014\n         consideration does not include the exception as recorded in\u0014\n         Matthew (cf. Mark 10:11-12).\u0014\n\u0014\n         However, in both instances the argument against  Matthew's\u0014\n         accounts is one from silence which is the weakest of all \narguments.\u0014\n         Because Jesus did not say except it be for fornication\" in \nLuke\u0014\n         16:18 is no ground for contending that that He did not say \nit in\u0014\n         Matthew 5:32 and 19:9. The teachings are on entirely \ndifferent\u0014\n         occasions. The reasoning about the argument from silence also\u0014\n         holds as between Matthew and Mark. Certainly there is good  \u0014\n         manuscript authority for the genuineness of Matthew's usages.\u0014\n         They appear in some of the best manuscripts. The exception \nphrase\u0014\n         is in keeping with even the most conservative school of \nJewish\u0014\n         thought (Shammai) as to the meaning of Deuteronomy 24:1\u0014\n\f      McNeile argues against the genuineness of these \"saving \nclauses\"\u0014\n         because Matthew would not represent Jesus as siding with the \u0014\n         school of Shammai. A. T. Robertson comments tersely, \"Why \nnot,\u0014\n         if on this point Shammai agreed with Jesus? In fact it is\u0014\n         reasonable that Jesus would use this exception, if He agreed \nwith it,\u0014\n         since the original question involved for every cause.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n         But there is yet another thought which clears up the apparent\u0014\n         discrepancy between Matthew and Mark. In Matthew 19:9 this\u0014\n         statement is clearly directed to the Pharisees. But in Mark \n10:11-12\u0014\n         the statement is directed to the disciples \"in the house\" \n(Mark 10:10)\u0014\n         at a later time. They asked Jesus to explain His teachings\u0014\n         concerning marriage and divorce. Since they had heard Him \nstate\u0014\n         the exception, which was accepted generally among the Jews,\u0014\n         there was no point in repeating it to them. \u0014\n\u0014\n                   Hobbs, An Exposition of the Gospel of Matthew, pp. \n258-259\u0014\n\u0014\nThe above argument--especially the last paragraph--is a poor defense \nof the \"saving clause.\"\u0014",

    "words": "By JON GAMBRELL, Associated Press Writer Jon Gambrell, Associated \nPress Writer   \u0014\n\u0014\nTEXARKANA, Ark. 7/25/09  Tony Alamo, a one-time street preacher who \nbuilt a multimillion-dollar ministry and became an outfitter of the \nstars, was convicted Friday of taking girls as young as 9 across \nstate lines for sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlamo stood silently as the verdict was read, a contrast to his \noccasional mutterings during testimony. His five victims sat looking \nforward in the gallery. One, a woman he \"married\" at age 8, wiped \naway a tear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm just another one of the prophets that went to jail for the \nGospel,\" Alamo called to reporters afterward as he was escorted to a \nwaiting U.S. marshal's vehicle.\u0014\n\u0014\nShouts of \"Bye, bye, Bernie\"  Alamo was born Bernie Lazar Hoffman  \ncame from a crowd gathered on the Arkansas side of the courthouse, \nwhich straddles the Texas-Arkansas border.\u0014\n\u0014\nJurors were convinced Alamo had had sex with the girls when they were \nunderage, but deliberated for more than a day to ensure that they \nconsidered everything, jury foreman Frank Oller of Texarkana said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That was the evidence. That was proven,\" Oller said. \"We came up \nwith a full decision that we are quite satisfied with.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDefense lawyer Don Ervin said the evidence against the 74-year-old \npreacher was insufficient and that the preacher would appeal. He also \nsaid Alamo's criminal history  he served four years in prison on \u0014\ntax charges in the 1990s  \"will hurt him\" at sentencing in six to \neight weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We believe he will face the rest of his natural life in prison,\" \nsaid Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner. The penalties on the 10 \ncharges total 175 years in prison, she said, and violations of the \ncentury-old Mann Act also carry fines of up to $250,000 each.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe five women, now age 17 to 33, told jurors that Alamo \"married\" \nthem in private ceremonies while they were minors, sometimes giving \nthem wedding rings. Each detailed trips beyond Arkansas' borders for \nAlamo's sexual gratification.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlamo never testified. Though he announced to reporters that he \nwanted to, his lawyers told him he should not directly challenge \ntheir testimony and the attorneys argued to jurors that the girls \ntraveled for legitimate church business.\u0014\n\u0014\nState and federal agents raided Alamo's compound last Sept. 20 after \nrepeated reports of abuse. Defense lawyers said the government \ntargeted Alamo because it doesn't like his apocalyptic brand of \nChristianity. Alamo has blamed the Vatican for his legal troubles, \nwhich include a four-year prison term for tax evasion in the 1990s.\u0014",

    "words": "John Edwards ran for his party's presidential nomination for the 2004 \nelection and again for 2008. He did not win either nomination, but he \nwas John Kerry's vice presidential running mate for 2004. In 2008, he \nadmitted publicly to having an extramarital affair with a campaign \nworker. In the book Resilience, his wife, Elizabeth, writes about how \nher husband's adultery affected her.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she and John were first married, she had pointedly asked him to \nbe faithful. Her fear of having an unfaithful husband was formed to a \nlarge degree by seeing what her mother had experienced. Her mother \nsuspected that her husband had been unfaithful, and though she never \nconfronted him about it, she lived with a nagging, painful \nuncertainty for many years. Elizabeth learned about this as a \nteenager when reading her mother's journal, which she found one day \nin their home. Seeing how even the suspicion of unfaithfulness had \ntormented her mother's heart stamped Elizabeth's own heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven so, she had great confidence in John's love for her. She had not \nbeen a suspicious wife. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in \n2005, John stood by her during her treatment. In 2006, Elizabeth \nencouraged him to travel without her when necessary to pursue his \npolitical dreams. At this time Elizabeth did not know that soon after \nbeginning the campaign her husband had begun an ongoing adulterous \nrelationship with another woman. Then, on December 30, 2006, almost a \nyear after beginning the ongoing affair, John admitted to his wife of \n28 years that he had been unfaithful on one occasion.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter I cried and screamed, I went to the bathroom and threw up. And \nthe next day John and I spoke. He wasn't coy, but it turned out he \nwasn't forthright either  . So much has happened that it is \nsometimes hard for me to gather my feelings from that moment. I felt \nthat the ground underneath me had been pulled away. I wanted him to \ndrop out of the race, protect our family from this woman, from his \nact  . I was afraid of her  .\u0014\n\u0014\nspent months learning to live with [what I thought was] a single \nincidence of infidelity. And I would like to say that a single \nincidence is easy to overcome, but it is not. I am who I am. I am \nimperfect in a million ways, but I always thought I was the kind of \nwoman, the kind of wife to whom a husband would be faithful. I had \nasked for fidelity, begged for it, really, when we married. I never \nneed flowers or jewelry; I don't care about vacations or a nice car. \nBut I need you to be faithful. Leave me, if you must, but be faithful \nto me if you are with me.\u0014\n\u0014\nElizabeth Edwards, Resilience         (Broadway Books, 2009)\u0014",

For New Testament writers, Christ is the \nChristian Passover victim (1 Cor.\u0014\n         5-7), and the Gospel presentation has often a Passover \nbackground; see Luke 2.41 and the\u0014\n         synoptic passion narrative (Matt. 26.2 par.), according to \nwhich the Last Supper appears to be\u0014\n         a Passover. In John there are three Passovers: John 2:13, \nwhich is associated with the cleansing\u0014\n         of the Temple; John 6, where the feeding of the five \nthousand has paschal and eucharistic\u0014\n         echoes (the synoptic accounts may also have a paschal \norigin);John 11-13; 18:28,39;and 19.23\u0014\n         37, where Jesus dies on the cross according to this Gospels \nchronology at the time when the\u0014\n         Passover lambs were being slaughtered in preparation (19.31) \nfor the feast. Christ is thus the\u0014\n         eternal paschal lamb; see John 19.36 (cf. Exod.12.46) and \nJohn 1.29, 36.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Easter is therefore the Christian Passover, celebrated for \nsome time on the night of fourteenth\u0014\n         ot the Jewish month Nisan (Passover night) on whatever day \nof the week that date fell. This\u0014\n         custom continued long in Asia Minor (as in Celtic Britain), \nwith those maintaining it being called\u0014\n         Quartodecimans (fourteeners), but in Rome Easter was \nobserved on a Sunday from a date\u0014\n         that is difficult to determine but earlier than 154 CE, when \nPolycarp of Smyrna, a Quartodeciman,\u0014\n         on a visit discussed the different observances with \nAnscetus, head of the Roman church.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The transfer of Easter to the first day of the week was no \ndoubt because Sunday had become\u0014\n         the Christian weekly day for worship. That this was owing to \nthe Lords resurrection on Sunday\u0014\n         is not provable but suggested strongly by the New Testament \nevidence and the absence of any\u0014\n         convincing alternative theory. The first day of the week \nmarks the discovery of the empty tomb\u0014\n         (Matt. 28.1 par.), while on the same evening the meal \nrecalls the Last Supper (Luke 24.39). See\u0014\n         also John 20.1, 19 and r6, the last being the Sunday a week \nlater, and Acts 20.7, which again\u0014\n         suggests the custom of a Sunday evening Eucharist. Paul \ncalls the Eucharist the Lords supper\u0014\n         (i Cor. 11.20); the word for Lords recurs in the New \nTestament only in Revelation 1:10 in\u0014\n         the Lords day. It was probably the Lords because it \nwas the day for the Lords supper or\u0014\n         Eucharist, at which the Loid had been physically present \nbefore his crucifixion, and especially on\u0014\n         the day of his resurrection and subsequent days (to which \nActs 1:4 and 10.41 probably refer),\u0014",

Rumors circulated that the \nfire had been started by the emperor himself26-year-old Nero.\u0014\n\u0014\nNero had become emperor ten years before, and almost from the \nbeginning, the teenage emperor had gorged himself with eroticism. He \narranged the murders of his mother, wives, rivals, and enemies. At \nthe same time, he won praise for his artistic and athletic pursuits. \nHe began thinking himself a god, though he was actually \"a degenerate \nwith swollen paunch, weak and slender limbs, fat face, blotched skin, \ncurly yellow hair, and dull gray eyes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe arson rumors began because Nero had been wanting to raze and \nrebuild large portions of Rome, planning to rename the city for \nhimself. A fire, people assumed, was just what the emperor had \nordered. To divert blame, Nero pointed a finger at Christians. \nTacitus wrote that the followers of Christ \"were put to death with \nexquisite cruelty, and to their sufferings Nero added mockery and \nderision. Some were covered with skins of wild beasts, left to be \ndevoured by dogs; others were nailed to crosses; numbers of them were \nburned alive; many, covered with inflammable matter, were set on fire \nto serve as torches during the night.\" Peter and Paul, according to \ntradition, were among the martyrs.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what of the young emperor himself? Four years later he died, too, \ntrembling and terrified in a cold cellar four miles from Rome while \nhiding from his own army.

    "words": "Examining Infant Baptism \nfrom Another Perspective\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Jim Somerville\u0014\nSeptember 21, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just can't accept infant baptism.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThat's what people often tell me after they've heard all my arguments \nfor welcoming Christians from other denominations into our membership \nwithout rebaptizing them. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo them, baptism is believer's baptism by immersion, and therefore \ninfant baptism is no baptism at all since it isn't (usually) by \nimmersion and since an infant is incapable of making a profession of \nfaith. They say, \"We're not rebaptizing these people; we're baptizing \nthem!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the argument starts all over again.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut at the end of it, I rarely have the feeling that I have been \nunderstood. So let me see if I can put it another way, a way that \nwould make sense to lifelong Baptists, and let's talk about those \npeople Baptists often place at the opposite end of the Christian \nspectrum  Catholics.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Baptists baptize believers by immersion; Catholics baptize infants \nby sprinkling.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. As Baptists, we do not believe that infant baptism is sufficient \n(as some Catholics apparently do). We do not believe that it \"saves\" \nthe child or \"washes away the taint of original sin.\" We believe that \nsalvation requires our faith as well as God's grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. This is why we wait to baptize until a child is old enough to \nprofess his faith. Then baptism becomes a celebration of salvation in \nwhich the gift of God's grace is received through the believer's \nfaith. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. This is why we believe that infant baptism  on its own  is \nunacceptable.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut (and you knew it was coming), when infant baptism is followed by \nan extended period of Christian formation, by a confirmation process \nin which children learn what it means to believe in Jesus and belong \nto the church, and by a public opportunity to claim their baptism and \nprofess their faith, then it becomes one piece of a process whereby \nthe grace of God that was celebrated in baptism is received through \nfaith. As Paul might put it: grace + faith = salvation (Ephesians \n2:8).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I can't accept infant baptism either, \nnot on its own, but I can accept it as part of a process of authentic \nChristian discipleship. Understood in that way, it is almost \nidentical to our own practice of baby dedication, and I don't think \nany of us want to do away with that. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we mean when we say \"I can't accept infant baptism\" is that we \ndon't believe water, by itself, does anything for that child, but we \nneed to carry that thinking all the way out. Water, by itself, \ndoesn't do anything for the person who gets into our baptistry, \neither. It's just water. We use it as a symbol of God's grace and our \nsurrender to it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat makes me think that being a Christian is a matter of the heart \nand not a matter of how much water was used or when it was applied.\u0014\n\u0014\nJim Somerville is pastor of First Baptist Church in Richmond, Va.\u0014",

    "words": "October 20, 1349 \u0014\nErrors of the Flagellants\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes God want our blood? People who do not properly understand the \nfull pardon offered by Christ's atonement may try to appease God by \ntheir own sufferings. Some attempt desperate remedies. This was the \ncase with the flagellants, bands of men who flogged themselves \npublicly.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the tide of monasticism came monks who whipped themselves or \neach other for their errors. One who was especially noted for this \npractice was Peter Damien, who hoped to suppress his lusts by \nscourging himself. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring a dreadful plague in 1259, common folk of Europe took up the \nidea. God was angry at the world. Something had to be done to turn \naway his wrath. Gangs of men gathered to flog themselves for their \nown sins and the sins of the world. Stripped to the waist they \nmarched in processions, sometimes numbering ten thousand penitents, \nwhipping themselves until they bled. When religious authorities \nopposed the movement, it died out in 1261, only to rear its head in \nuglier forms later.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the black plague swept Europe, killing a quarter or more of the \npopulation, it brought terror. Bands of hysterical flagellants sprang \nup again. Among the errors taught by flagellants was that Christ was \nabout to destroy the world but that the Virgin Mary had interceded \nand won a reprieve for any man who would join them for 33 days. As \ntheir blood flowed, they claimed it was mingling with Christ's blood \nto save the world and that their penitence would preserve the world \nfrom perishing. Many other manias also emerged during this period, \nsuch as uncontrollable dancing and Jew hunts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe flagellants flourished into the fourteenth century. Following an \noutbreak of the whippings in France, the University of Paris appealed \nto the pope to suppress the heresy. On this day, October 20, 1349, \nafter careful inquiry, Pope Clement VI sent letters to the bishops in \nWestern Europe condemning the practice and teachings of the \nflagellants. Even this measure did not fully succeed. Groups of \nflagellants appeared again and again over the next century and a \nhalf. Public flagellation occurred in Italy until the nineteenth \ncentury and in Mexico, South America, the Philippines and other \ncountries into the twentieth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\"Flagellants.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

And the same year King Edmund fought \nagainst them and the Danes had the victory; and they slew the King \nand overran the entire kingdom.\" That is all that the Anglo-Saxon \nChronicle, written within twenty years of the events, had to say \nabout King Edmund's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDanish invaders killed Edmund on this day, November 20, 869. Within \nthirty years, the common people had fixed him firmly in mind as a \nmartyr and a saint. A special coin was minted for him. His burial \nsite became a place of pilgrimage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Chronicle may have said little and Asser's famous Life of Alfred \nnot much more, but popular accounts said a great deal. According to \nstories that were embellished as the years went on, Edmund was a \ngodly English king--so godly that he even memorized David's Psalms to \nguide him in governing his people with justice.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Danes invaded in 866, Edmund struggled to hold his little \nstate against them. He built a dike that held them back for a few \nyears. But when he repulsed the Danish chiefs Hinguar and Hubba, they \ngathered a larger force against which he could not stand. The Danes \ninsisted on terms of surrender that, as a Christian, Edmund could not \naccept. Realizing that his armies could not defeat the invaders and \nnot wanting to be the cause of a pointless massacre of his own men, \nEdmund sent them home. While making his own escape, he was overtaken \nby Danes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Have you seen Edmund?\" they asked. Not wishing to lie, Edmund \nresponded with a riddle. His identity was soon recognized, however, \nand he was taken before the Danish chief Hinguar (also called \"Ivar \nthe Boneless\" or Ingvar).\u0014\n\u0014\nAgain he refused to submit to pagan conditions. He said that his \nfaith was dearer to him than life, and that he would never purchase \nhis life by offending God. Infuriated, the Danes beat him with \nsticks, then tied him to a tree and tore his flesh with whips. Next \nthey shot arrows into him until he looked like a \"thistle covered \nwith prickles.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Danish leader finally whacked off the young king's head with an \naxe. Having been crowned king on Christmas day in 855 at fourteen or \nfifteen years of age, Edmund died while still in his mid twenties.\u0014\n\u0014\nSupposedly the Danish leader flung the head into some brambles. \nLater, when the English crept out of hiding, they found a wolf \nprotecting the head.\u0014\n\u0014\nBury St. Edmund, to which the king's body was eventually moved, \nbecame a major English religious center.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Edmund the Martyr.\" http://www.pitt.edu/~eflst4/stedmund.html\u0014\nFile notes from biographies on Alfred the Great.\u0014\n\"King Edmund the Martyr.\" \nhttp://www.saint-edmunds.org/stedmundhistory.htm\u0014\n\"Legend of St. Edmund.\" http://www.burystedmunds.freeserve.co.uk/ \nSurvivalKit/Motto.htm\u0014\n\"Lives of Sts Edmund and Fremund.\" Canon of John Lydgate Project. \nhttp://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/edmund/intro/int3.htm\u0014\nPhillips, G.

On Dec. 26, 1862, thirty-eight doomed Dakota Indians \nwailed and danced atop the gallows, waiting for the trapdoors to drop \nbeneath them. The square scaffold, built here to accommodate the \nlargest mass execution in United States history, swayed under their \nweight. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt seemed that the purpose of the singing and dancing was only to \nsustain each other in their last ordeal, a witness observed. As the \nlast moment rapidly approached, they each called out their name and \nshouted in their native language: 'I'm here! I'm here!' \u0014\n\u0014\nThirty-seven of the men were among the most ferocious followers of \nthe Dakota leader Little Crow, according to the federal government. \nThey stood accused of killing approximately 490 settlers, including \nwomen and children, in raids along the Minnesota frontier. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut one man, historians say, did not belong there. A captured Dakota \nnamed We-Chank-Wash-ta-don-pee, often called Chaska, had had his \nsentence commuted by President \\Abraham Lincoln days earlier. Yet on \nthe day after Christmas 1862, Chaska died with the others. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a case of wrongful execution, Gary C. Anderson, a history \nprofessor at the \\University of Oklahoma and Little Crow biographer, \nsaid last week in an interview. These soldiers just grabbed the \nwrong guy, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the story of the mass execution in Mankato is well-known \nlocally, scholars say the case of Chaska  spared by Lincoln, then \nwrongfully executed  has been long overlooked by the federal \ngovernment and all but forgotten even by the Dakota. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, an effort to keep the story alive is taking root on campuses and \neven on Capitol Hill as the 150th anniversary of the execution, in \n2012, approaches. Commemorative events will include symposiums, \nmuseum exhibits, monument re-dedications, book publications and an \noriginal symphony and choral production.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word\\My Documents\\execution 150 years ago\u0014",

    "words": "December 16, 340 \u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius, Vercelli's Bold Bishop\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nNo sooner had the church found freedom from outside persecution in \nthe Roman Empire than it experienced divisions from within. Emperor \nConstantine made Christianity legal. Where before a bishop had to be \na lover of Christ willing to die for truth under dreadful tortures, \nnow the post was coveted by many as a position of prestige, influence \nand easy money. Side by side with honorable church leaders, heretics \nrose to power.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foremost of the early heresies was Arianism, a doctrine that for \nall practical purposes denied the divinity of Christ. It had many \npowerful backers. The harmony of the empire was endangered while the \nchurch wrangled over the true nature of the Son of God. So \ntroublesome did the squabble become, that Constantine called the \nfirst of the great church councils. Held at Nicea in 325, its \nchampions were Cyril of Alexandria and his protg Athanasius. The \ncouncil declared that scripture teaches that Christ is truly God and \nof the same substance and duration as God the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius (not the famous church historian) grew up during these years \nof religious strife. He was born in Sardinia. After his father died \nin prison, a martyr for the faith, Eusebius was reared in Rome, where \nhe was ordained as a lector --a person with responsibility to \npublicly read the scriptures. Later he served at Vercelli in \nPiedmont, Italy. He was so zealous that when the bishop of Vercelli \ndied, Eusebius was unanimously chosen by the local congregation to \ntake his place. Julius I, bishop of Rome, consecrated him on this \nday, December 16, 340.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe council of Nicea, held in 325, had barely checked the spread of \nArianism. The heresy would not go away. Liberius, bishop of Rome, \nsent Eusebius to Arles to urge Emperor Constantius (a son of \nConstantine) to convoke another council to settle the issue once for \nall. Constantius called a synod at Milan. At first Eusebius was of a \nmind not to attend. He saw plainly that the emperor was going to side \nwith the Arians and that they would condemn Athanasius, whom they \nhated for his role in drafting the Nicean creed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe emperor pressed Eusebius to attend. However, when the bishop \nappeared, he was not permitted into the assembly for ten days until \nthe condemnation of Athanasius was drawn up. Eusebius refused to join \nin condemning Athanasius. Instead, he attempted to have all present \nsign the Nicene Creed, but the creed was torn out of the hands of one \nof his allies, and his pen was broken. Constantius banished Eusebius \nalong with two other bishops who bravely resisted the majority.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, it was a pagan emperor, Julian the Apostate, who ended \nEusebius's exile. Eusebius returned to Milan in 361 from Egypt, his \nthird place of imprisonment. For the last ten years of his life, he \ntraveled widely, preaching the truth and seeking to restore the \nNicene creed throughout the length and breadth of the Roman Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Eusebius of Vercelli.\" New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious \nKnowledge.

    "words": "December 20, 1899 \u0014\nEvangelist Martyn Lloyd-Jones\u0014\n\u0014\nCardiff is a seaport and the capital of Wales--a city graced with \nmany historic buildings and overlooked by a castle on a hill. A town \nof fewer than 2,000 people in 1801, its population multiplied into \nthe hundreds of thousands in the 19th century. Martyn Lloyd-Jones \ncontributed to that population boom when he was born in Cardiff on \nthis day, December 20, 1899.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn's childhood had at least one highlight: In January, 1910, his \nhome caught on fire while he and his brothers were sleeping. All of \nthem could easily have lost their lives. The family did lose almost \neverything they owned and their shaky finances never recovered. As a \nresult, Martyn set out with real determination to succeed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe entered a London medical school, completing all his exams at such \na young age that he had to wait for his degree until his age caught \nup with his education. He became the chief clinical assistant of a \nleading physician, Sir Thomas Horder. Horder described Martyn as \"the \nmost acute thinker that I ever knew.\" Martyn faced the prospect of a \nbrilliant and financially rewarding career. But something happened to \nchange that.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn had joined a Calvinist Methodist church when he was \nfifteen-years-old. Around 1924, he began to seriously consider his \nspiritual condition. \"For many years I thought I was a Christian when \nin fact I was not. It was only later that I came to see that I had \nnever been a Christian and became one.\" Reading the Bible for himself \nand pondering its meaning, he eventually realized that \"What I needed \nwas preaching that would convict me of sin and ... bring me to \nrepentance and tell me something about regeneration. But I never \nheard that. The preaching we had was always based on the assumption \nthat we were all Christians...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn asked Christ to become master of his life. As soon as he had \nmade that decision, he was overwhelmed with a longing to return to \nWales to share his new-found faith with the folks back home.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe took a small church in Aberavon, Wales. Local doctors snubbed him, \nthinking he was going to poach on their patients. But Martyn wanted \ninstead to win souls. He preached clear, analytical messages. Working \nmen and women came to know Christ. Notorious alcoholics converted to \nChrist. Other churches invited him to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years after Martyn came to Aberavon, a local doctor asked for \nhelp with a difficult medical case. Martyn diagnosed the problem at \nonce and proved completely right. After that, demands for his medical \nassistance increased to the point that they almost threatened his \npastoral work.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis name became increasingly well-known. G. Campbell Morgan, another \npastor with a powerful ministry, invited him to come to Westminster \nChapel. Martyn accepted the Westminster invitation in 1938. \nPublication of his powerful sermons made him internationally famous. \nHe died in 1981.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\"Cardiff.\" Britannica. 1967.\u0014\n\"Cardiff, Wales Area -- December 1999.\" \nhttp://www.electricrainbow.com/welshpages/\u0014\nCatherwood, Sir Fred. \"Dr. D.

    "words": "February 12, 1865 \u0014\nEx-Slave Henry Garnet Addressed U.S. House\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 12, 1865, the galleries of the United States \nHouse of Representatives were packed. Black and white alike vied for \na place where they might share in the historic moment. For the first \ntime in the history of the Republic, a black man--and an ex-slave at \nthat--was about to address the House of Representatives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was President Lincoln who asked Presbyterian minister Henry \nHighland Garnet to deliver a sermon in the United State House of \nRepresentatives. Other national leaders had added their \nencouragement. Now Henry stood poised to give one of the two most \nimportant speeches of his life. He had delivered the other speech 22 \nyears earlier, in 1843.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn a slave in Maryland in 1815, he escaped with his father and \nother family members when he was nine years old. Quakers helped them \non their way to freedom. Eventually the fugitives settled in New \nYork, where Henry got an education. Unable to find work, he went to \nsea, despite a leg injured when he was fifteen (eventually it had to \nbe amputated at the hip). On his return from a voyage to Cuba, he \nfound that his home had been raided by slave hunters and his sister \nseized. His father escaped by leaping from an upstairs window, \nFurious, the boy bought a bowie knife and stalked the streets, bent \non revenge. Friends coaxed him to lie low. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1835, Henry had even more reason to be angry. With thirteen other \nblack students he was admitted to Noyes Academy in Canaan New \nHampshire. On July 4th, they spoke up for the abolition of slavery. \nThis angered local whites. A few weeks later, the whites dragged the \nschool house into a swamp. Although seriously ill, Henry had to flee. \nHe crossed the mountains into New York where he could take a \nsteamboat; Friends spread their coats on the deck to cushion him. He \nwas bedridden for two months. \u0014\nAfterward, he was invited to study for the ministry. Even before his \nordination he began to pastor a church. Later, he became a \nPresbyterian missionary to Jamaica. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was at the Negro National Convention in Buffalo, New York in 1843, \nthat Henry made the first speech that brought him to national \nattention. He called on America's four million slaves to revolt. \"You \nhad far better all die--die immediately, than live slaves...\" he \ncried. \"If you must bleed, let it all come at once--rather die \nfreemen, than live to be the slaves.\" Slaves were not allowed to keep \nGod's laws, he taught.

    "title": "EVERY PILGRIM'S STORY BY JOHN BUNYAN",
    "words": "February 18, 1678 \u0014\n\u0014\nEvery Pilgrim's Story, by John Bunyan\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most popular book of the Christian world, next to the Bible \nitself saw publication on this day, February 18, 1678. It is a story \nof fantastic creatures and deadly dangers. In his many adventures, \nthe hero battles with a raging dragon, flounders in a bog from which \nhe is unable to extricate himself, and is chained in a castle, \nhostage to despair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story is Pilgrim's Progress, authored by John Bunyan while he lay \nin prison for preaching without a license and for other offenses \nagainst the established church. Since its publication, it has never \nbeen out of print. The book made him famous in his own day and has \nbeen a help to Christians for centuries since.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hero is a pilgrim, a man named Christian, whom we first meet \nsearching for truth and for relief from a terrible load he carries on \nhis back. This load is sin. At the foot of the cross the load tumbles \noff. Freed, Christian hastens by a path narrow and hard toward an \neternal city which is pointed out to him. Along the way he meets a \ngreat variety of vividly pictured individuals, some who help and some \nwho hinder him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd of course, there are giants and dragons: an almost medieval \npanoply of fearsome or winsome dangers. There is Doubting Castle, the \nValley of Shadow and Vanity Fair, all of which the pilgrim must pass.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in allegory, many phrases from the book have come into common \nuse. The narrative itself is larded with biblical quotaations. In the \nmargins John Bunyan cited his scripture references.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only English-speaking Christians but also those from the rest of \nthe world have benefited from the tale. Often it is the first book \nmissionaries translate when they complete the Bible in a native \nlanguage. It has been turned into African, European and Asian tongues.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurprisingly, the Chinese Communist government also printed the book \nand 200,000 copies sold out in three days.\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan's pilgrim and all those others who reach the celestial city \nsteadfastly hold one belief: that salvation is of Christ alone. As \nHopeful says, \"I believed that ...without the righteousness of this \nChrist all the world could not save me; and therefore thought I to \nmyself, If I leave off [praying to know Christ], I die, and can but \ndie at the Throne of Grace. And withal, this came into my mind, If it \ntarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \nSo I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis remains the Christian gospel. Pilgrim made it safely to the \nCelestial City by heeding and believing that message.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBunyan, John. Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.

She became certain that \nmonasticism was not the way taught in Scripture. With the help of \nmilkmaids she escaped and became a follower of peaceful Menno Simons. \nShe was one of the first Reformation women ministers, probably a \ndeaconness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1549, Catholic authorities arrested her. When they found her Bible \nthey knew they had the person they were looking for. Mistakenly, they \nthought she was the wife of Menno Simons. When they tried to get her \nto take an oath at her interrogation, she refused, saying Christ had \ntaught that our yes should mean yes and our no mean no.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe record of her inquisition shows that the examiners asked her to \ninform on those whom she had taught. Knowing that this would lead to \ntheir arrest, she refused.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, my Lords, do not press me on this point. Ask me about my faith \nand I will answer you gladly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We will make it so tough that you will tell us,\" they threatened.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she would not reveal who had baptized her or whom she had \ntaught, they questioned her beliefs. She insisted that church \nbuildings were not the house of God, for our bodies are the temple of \nthe Holy Spirit. She denied that the New Testament spoke of the bread \nand wine as a sacrament but rather as the Lord's Supper. Asked if she \nwere saved by baptism, she replied, \"No, my Lords. All the water in \nthe sea cannot save me. All my salvation is in Christ, who has \ncommanded me love the Lord, my God, and my neighbor as myself.\" She \ndenied that priests have authority to forgive sins--only Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill refusing to reveal who had baptized her, she was taken to the \ntorture chamber and said, \"So far we have treated you gently. Since \nyou won't confess, we will put you to the torture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA man named Mr. Hans applied screws to a thumb and fingers until \nblood spurted from under her fingernails. Still she wouldn't give \naway her friends, but her agony was so great that she cried aloud to \nChrist and received relief. So they lifted her skirt to apply torture \nto her shins. She pleaded that she had never allowed anyone to touch \nher body and they promised to respect her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they crushed her leg bones with screws until she fainted. The \nmen thought she was dead, but she came to and assured them she was \nnot. Realizing that they could get nothing out of her, the \nauthorities condemned her to die. Rather than burn her, as was \ncustomary, they tied her in a bag and drowned her on this day, March \n27, 1549.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

It may not sound \nagainunless a congregation numbering 58 souls in a good week can \ncome up with $30,000.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's no easy amount to raise. We absolutely considered taking it off \nand capping the roof, but voices within the congregation want their \nbell, their tower. It's symbolic. It's part of our church,\" says \nLikens, who volunteers as St. Mark's junior warden in charge of \nmaintenance.\u0014\nNationwide, church steeples are taking a beating, and the bell tolls \nfor bell towers, too, as these landmarks of faith are hard hit by \neconomic, social and religious change.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteeplejacks, who specialize in clambering up to build or repair the \nsoaring structures, see weather-struck, maintenance-deprived steeples \nchipped, leaking, even tilting.\u0014\n\u0014\nArchitects and church planners say today's new congregations meet in \nretooled sports arenas or shopping malls or modern buildings designed \nto appeal to contemporary believers turned off by the look of \nold-time religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteeples may have outlived their times as signposts. People hunting \nfor a church don't scan the horizon; they search the Internet.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Mark's, which has no website, has never needed to tell the 22,000 \npeople in Wadsworth where it was because, Likens said, \"everyone in \ntown knows this is the church with the bell tower.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But everyone also knows the Episcopal Church and congregations as a \nwhole aren't growing,\" he says. \"In fact, they are sliding and they \nare aging like St. Mark's. That adds to our decision dilemma: Where \ndo you want to put your money as a congregation? Are we better off \ndoing outreach programs?

The \nolder steeples, \"built with top-notch lumber and a lot of heart,\" are \nholding up structurally, and more often need only cosmetic fixes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn more recent decades, Hardin said, \"church builders went a little \nhaywire.

We saw \nthat cell phone companies are using innovative methods  to disguise \ntheir equipment and bring in cell coverage without unsightly towers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch leaders located a company ready to deal, negotiated the design \nand \"now we have a steeple, hiding two cell antennas, that gives us a \nreally big profile on the horizon.

    "words": "April 30, 311 \u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Galerius Issues Edict of Toleration\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes when a person nears death and stares into the face of \neternity, he or she becomes more religious or makes moral changes, \nperhaps hoping to influence his or her future beyond the grave. That \nseems to have been the case with Roman Emperor Galerius when he \nissued an Edict of Toleration on this day, April 30, 311.\u0014\n\u0014\nGalerius was the son of a Greek shepherd who became a Roman soldier. \nHe rose in power and authority to become a junior ruler with \nDiocletian. When Emperor Diocletian began his great persecution of \nChristians in 303, Galerius instigated the action, convincing \nDiocletian that Christians were dangerous enemies of the empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nGalerius himself issued another edict in 304 requiring everyone in \nthe empire to sacrifice to the gods of the empire on pain of death or \nforced labor. Persecutors imprisoned churchmen, destroyed precious \nBible manuscripts, and executed hundreds of Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Diocletian abdicated, Galerius became senior emperor in 305. He \ncontinued his cruel persecution, which was so widespread and intense \nthat it became known as the great persecution. However, Christianity \nsimply would not go away. Even Galerius recognized the impossibility \nof snuffing out the illegal religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he became ill. A Christian writer named Lactantius said that \nGalerius' body rotted and was eaten by maggots while he writhed in \nagony. Apparently Galerius' conscience connected his persecution of \nChristians with his present misery. He seems to have seen his illness \nas a judgment from the Christian God. At any rate, his edict \nmentioned only Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe edict began by justifying his murder. \"Amongst our other measures \nfor the advantage of the Empire, we have hitherto endeavored to bring \nall things into conformity with the ancient laws and public order of \nthe Romans. We have been especially anxious that even the Christians, \nwho have abandoned the religion of their ancestors, should return to \nreason.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNoting that some Christians had betrayed their faith out of fear \nwhile others endured torture, Galerius decided illogically that \"we, \nwith our wonted clemency, have judged it wise to extend a pardon even \nto these men and permit them once more to become Christians and \nreestablish their places of meeting...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGalerius added that \"...it should be the duty of the Christians, in \nview of our clemency [mercy], to pray to their god for our welfare, \nfor that of the Empire, and for their own, so that the Empire may \nremain intact in all its parts, and that they themselves may live \nsafely in their habitations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer seems to be the point of the edict. Galerius wanted Christian \nprayers. Did he hope for a miracle? If so, he was disappointed. He \ndied a week after issuing the edict.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis successor, Emperor Maximinus, tried to counteract the edict but \ndid not succeed to any great extent in his short rule.

    "title": "EXECUTIONS WERE MLADLIC'S SIGNATURE",
    "words": "Executions Were Mladic's Signature, and ownfall\u0014\nBy DAVID ROHDE and JOHN F. BURNS 5/26/2011   New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nWith video cameras capturing the moment, Gen. Ratko Mladic's \nbodyguards handed out chocolates to Bosnian Muslim children, \npromising terrified women that the violence was over. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one will be harmed, the Bosnian Serb commander said on July 12, \n1995, gently patting a young boy on the head. You have nothing to \nfear. You will all be evacuated. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs he spoke, thousands of his soldiers formed a vast cordon around \nthe town of Srebrenica, a United Nations-protected safe area that \nhad just fallen to his forces. Over the next 10 days, his soldiers \nhunted down, captured and summarily executed 8,000 men and boys from \nthe town. Women were raped. And pleas for restraint from the \ninternational community were mocked. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver 500 victims of the Srebrenica genocide were boys under the age \nof 18, said Hasan Nuhanovic, a survivor from Srebrenica whose \nfather, mother and brother were executed by Mr. Mladic's forces. \nThey were 16, 17 years old when they were executed. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe mass executions around Srebrenica became Mr. Mladic's ghastly \ntrademark  and his undoing. The anger and humiliation felt in \nWashington and in European capitals prompted the international \ncommunity to act against Bosnian Serb forces after years in which \nSerbian forces systematically pushed Muslims and Croats out of areas \nthey claimed belonged to the Serbian ethnic group. Within weeks, NATO \nairstrikes reversed the course of the war. Within months, a peace \naccord had been signed and Mr. Mladic was a fugitive. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early 1990s, Mr. Mladic supported President Slobodan Milosevic \nof Serbia as he reignited ethnic divisions and tried to turn the \nmajority of the country into a Greater Serbia dominated by ethnic \nSerbs. In time, fighting erupted between Yugoslavia's three main \nethnic groups  Orthodox Christian Serbs, Roman Catholic Croats and \nMuslim Bosnians  in a series of overlapping civil wars. \u0014\n\u0014\nSrebrenica was not the general's first act of brutality. The massacre \nwas the culmination of years of worsening cruelty that began with the \nsiege of Sarajevo in 1992, the longest in modern warfare. The \nfour-year bombardment killed 10,000 people, including an estimated \n1,500 children. In Sarajevo, Mr. Mladic embraced a frightening form \nof warfare where a heavily armed military unleashed artillery and \nsniper fire on civilians. His forces were also accused of using \nsystematic rape as a weapon of war. \u0014\n\u0014\nA professional army conducted a campaign of unrelenting violence, \nwar crimes prosecutors said in the opening statement of a 2003 trial \nof one of Mr. Mladic's subordinates. There was nowhere safe for a \nSarajevan, not at home, at school, in a hospital, from deliberate \nattack. \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in a suburb of Sarajevo, Mr. Mladic grew up in a household \nhaunted by the ethnic divisions that the Yugoslav dictator, Josip \nBroz Tito, managed to suppress for decades. Mr. Mladic's father was \nkilled in an attack against ethnic Croat forces allied with Nazi \nGermany that included some Bosnian Muslims. An infant at the time, \nMr. Mladic never knew his father. German records showed that hundreds \nof thousands of Serbs died during the occupation, and Mr. Mladic had \nmade it his mission to avenge them.\u0014",

    "words": "Drew Dyck\u0014\n\u0014\nExodus from the Church?\u0014\n\u0014\nA debate on the state of the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\n[Editor's Note: While commentators warned against the imminent threat \nof an evangelical theocracy in the United States (remember?), \nAmerican evangelicals themselves were wondering what to make of a \ngrowing number of reports claiming that young people are dropping out \nof church at an unprecedented rate. For the moment, theocracy-talk \nhas faded into the background. Worries about the state of the faith \nhave not subsided. This week we feature a debate between Drew Dyck \nand Byron Johnson. Drew argues that there is \"a move away from \nChristian commitment among young Americans.\" Byron contends that such \nconcerns are based on misinformation. They respect each other even as \nthey vigorously disagree.]\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious beliefs are elusive targets for researchers. No survey or \nstudy can probe the heart of a person, much less the mind of God. So \nwhen it comes to assessing how many young people are joining or \nleaving the faith, we're dealing educated guesses. To steal the \nApostle Paul's beautiful phrase, \"we see through a glass darkly.\" \nStill, a number of recent studies provide important clues about the \nemerging generation's pattern of beliefand it's not a pretty \npicture. Several indicators point to a move away from Christian \ncommitment among young Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nResults from the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) \nreleased in 2009 showed that the percentage of Americans claiming \"no \nreligion\" almost doubled in less than two decades, climbing from 8.1 \npercent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2008. The \"Nones,\" as the media \ncalled them, were most numerous among the young: a whopping 22 \npercent of 18- to 29-year-olds claimed no religion, up from 11 \npercent in 1990. The study also found that 73 percent of Nones came \nfrom religious homes; 66 percent were described by the study as \n\"de-converts.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome assessments have been more dramatic. At the May 2009 Pew Forum \non Religion and Public Life, political scientists Robert Putnam and \nDavid Campbell presented research from their book American Grace. \nThey reported that \"young Americans are dropping out of religion at \nan alarming rate of five to six times the historic rate (30 to 40 \npercent have no religion today, versus 5 to 10 percent a generation \nago).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInquiries into levels of church involvement have revealed a \ncorresponding decline. President of Rainer Research, Sam Rainer \nwrites reports that \"70% of young adults drop out (of church) between \nthe ages of 18 and 22.\" The Barna Group estimates that 80 percent of \nthose reared in the church will be \"disengaged\" by the time they are \n29. Of course disengagement from the church is not tantamount to \napostasy. Yet for young dropoutswho are less likely than their older \ncounterparts to seek out alternative forms of Christian communityan \nextended absence from church may also spell trouble for their \nChristian beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome view the departure from church as a hiatus, a matter of \n20-somethings slapping the snooze on Sunday mornings, as the \nprominent sociologist Rodney Stark claims. In this view the trend is \na reversible, life-phase phenomenon. Once members of the younger \ngeneration start establishing careers, getting married, and having \nchildren, they'll come back.\u0014\nI'm not so sure. Those sociological forces that drive adults back to \nreligious commitment are now being delayed late into the 20s and even \ninto the 30s, making an eventual return to faith more unlikely. Plus, \nas Putnam and Campbell report, today's young adults are abandoning \nreligion at a greater rate than the young adults of yesteryear.\u0014\n\u0014\nA note of caution is needed. Research on this topic has been abused. \nThe trend has been exaggerated by Christians to sell books and \nconferences, and cited by detractors to sound triumphant predictions \nof Christianity's imminent demise. The trend does not pose an \nexistential threat to Christendom, especially when you factor in the \nflorescence of faith in the Global South. At the same time, the North \nAmerican church would be wise to guard against complacency. If large \nnumbers of our young people are leaving the Christian faith of their \nyouth, now is the time for an informed and faithful response.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrew Dyck is managing editor of Leadership Journal and author of \nGeneration Ex-Christian: Why Young Adults Are Leaving the Faith  and \nHow to Bring Them Back (Moody).\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2011 Books & Culture\u0014",

    "title": "EUSEBIUS, 1ST CHURCH HISTORIAN",
    "words": "May 30, 339 \u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius, 1st Church Historian\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nSuppose you are a survivor of an outlawed organization whose origins \ngo back to around 1700, seventy-six years before America became an \nindependent nation. \"Tell the story of your people,\" you are urged.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is, your people were an illegal group. In fact, the \ngovernment tried to exterminate them! Their leaders were captured and \nkilled and many letters and books burned. They left no public \nfestivals, no monuments--very little by which historians ordinarily \ntrace history. And to make your task more challenging, your people \nwere scattered over most of the known world. How could you possibly \nput together their story? That is the kind of task Eusebius tackled.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis people were the Christians who had been persecuted for almost \nthree hundred years. A measure of peace came to the believers when \nConstantine became emperor. At last the story of the church could be \ntold.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius was the one for the job. He had already prepared a \nchronology of the Bible and early church, trying to establish the \ndates of Christ's death and the events that followed. This was a \ndifficult undertaking because many different calendars were in use at \nthe time and he had to match up events recorded under one system to \nevents recorded under others.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius' ten-volume history is our best authority for early \nChristian history. We owe him a special debt because he quotes from \nmany sources that no longer exist. We are blessed that he showed \ninterest in a broad range of material. He traced the lines of \napostolic succession in key cities. Thus we know how the church \nprogressed in the big towns. The church has always been nourished \nwith the blood of martyrs. Eusebius told the stories of many who \nsuffered for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was also interested in debates over which books should be in the \nBible and he gave us various views of the matter. Because of this we \nknow a good deal about how we got the New Testament. Eusebius also \ntraced the threads of heresy. Through him we know of challenges to \northodoxy in the early centuries of the faith. Above all, Eusebius \ndescribed how God preserved the church and poured his grace upon it. \nEusebius even followed the woeful fate of the Jews and their \nstruggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nLate in life, Eusebius was invited to become bishop of Antioch. He \nturned down the offer. His backers appealed to the Emperor to compel \nhim to accept. Instead, Constantine praised Eusebius for refusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius died on this day, May 30, 339. He was seventy-four years \nold. In addition to all his other writings, he left behind him \ncommentaries on Isaiah and on the Psalms, a geography of the Bible, \nand a concordance of the Gospels. He wrote books to clear up \ndifferences in the Gospels. Finally he produced an account of the \nMartyrs of Palestine whom he had personally known. But his history \nremains his most important contribution to the church, and the one by \nwhich his name will always be remembered, for it gave us our past.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

Eliza Hewitt may have \nwondered that.\u0014\n\u0014\nEliza was born on June 28, 1851in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \nEducated in the local school system, she graduated as valedictorian \nof the Girl's Normal School that she attended. She became a teacher \nin the public schools of her city.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then came misery. Her career screeched to a halt when she was \nforced to bed with a painful spinal problem. (One of her descendants \nhas contacted us and said her debilitating condition was caused by a \nreckless student striking her with a piece of slate.) Lying in bed, \nshe could have been bitter. Instead, she studied English literature \nand began to sing and write:\u0014\n\u0014\nSing the wondrous love of Jesus; sing his mercy and his grace. \u0014\nIn the mansions bright and blessed he'll prepare for us a place.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of her lines came into the hands of Professor John R. Sweney. He \nwrote her asking for more, and set a few of her songs to music, \nincluding one of the better known: \"Will there be any Stars in My \nCrown?\" He and William J. Kirkpatrick published her first hymns.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe remember Eliza Hewitt today because of those hymns. Had she never \nbeen bed-ridden, she might not have written them. Among the best \nknown are, \"Give Me Thy Heart, Says the Father Above,\" \"When We All \nGet to Heaven,\" \"Sunshine in My Soul,\" \"Will there be any Stars in My \nCrown?\" and \"More About Jesus Would I Know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLater Eliza's well-being improved, although she suffered \nre-occurrences for the rest of her life. Despite her health problems, \nshe was deeply interested in Sunday school work, and superintended a \nSunday school for the Northern Home for Friendless Children. This was \nfollowed by similar work in the Calvin Presbyterian Church. At one \npoint, she had a class of 200!\u0014\n\u0014\nEliza died in 1920.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nClippings, including the Companion to Baptist Hymnal; Dictionary \nHandbook to Hymns for the Living Church and an unidentified newspaper.\u0014\n\"Eliza Edmunds Hewitt.\" Cyberhymnal.http://www.cyberhymnal.org\u0014\nHall, Jacob Henry.

Thompson was urgent. \"Not \nmany men come out to the meetings. I think they would come if they \nknew you were going to speak.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEric did not like to speak in public. He was shy. But he did not say \nanything to D. P. Thompson of this. He looked at his feet a couple \nmoments then looked up and answered, \"yes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's how he wound up on the platform, making his appeal to people \nto turn their lives over to God. He didn't chew them out for doing \nwrong. Instead, he spoke of God's love and support as he had \npersonally experienced it.\u0014\n\u0014\nEric had needed that support. His parents were missionaries in far \noff China. For much of his life he had had to stay behind in Scotland \nwithout them. There he had shown great ability as a scholar and as an \nathlete. He and his brother Rob were noted rugby players and when \nEric began to run and win races, his picture was frequently in the \nnewspapers. People began to speak of him as an Olympic Games \ncontender. He trained hard for the opportunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you've seen the movie Chariots of Fire, you have thrilled at Eric \nLiddell's stand for principle. It almost cost him his chance at \nOlympic gold, for the 100 meter was his best race. But he dropped \nout, rather than run in the qualifying heats on a Sunday.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead he preached in a Paris church that day while starting guns \npopped in the stadium. Nevertheless, Eric captured an unexpected \nbronze in the 200 meter and worked his way through the qualifying \nheats for the 400 meter. His trial times were not spectacular. It did \nnot seem he could beat the other fine contenders.\u0014\n\u0014\nEric crouched ready to run. It was on this day, July 11, 1924.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefeat or victory today, he would accept it. He had told the crowds \nwho came to hear him speak that he did not ever question what God \nbrought his way. \"I don't need explanations from God. I simply \nbelieve him and accept whatever comes my way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gun cracked. Eric was out of his crouch and running, head tilted \nback, arms flailing. If this had been a sprint, he could not have \nflown faster. When the finish tape drew taut across his chest, he was \nfive meters ahead of his nearest rival. Eric had won the gold in 47.6 \nseconds, a world record!\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Eric Liddell, however, this was not the ultimate race. His whole \nlife was a race: a race for the kingdom of heaven. He sailed two \nyears later to China as a missionary and was still running his race \nfor God when he died on February 21, 1945 of a brain tumor and \ntyphoid in a Japanese prison camp. (The Japanese had rounded up all \nforeigners at the beginning of World War II.) By then, everyone in \nthe camp had come to know his courage, his love and his smile as he \ntried to make conditions in the camp the best they could be.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nBrooke, Tal.

    "title": "EIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN YOU'RE UNSURE",
    "words": "Harold Camping's prediction that the end of time would come this past \nMay 21 is thankfully fading from memory. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, most of us know it is but a matter of time before we will be \nfielding questions that result from the prophecies, prognostications \nand presumptive pronouncements made by other religious celebrities \nand misguided headline seekers.\u0014\n\u0014\nI love our national guarantee of the freedom of religion. That \nprovision of freedom also guarantees any American the right to make \nan idiot out of themselves in the name of religion, often confusing \nand implicating innocent bystanders.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither life used to seem simpler, or maybe I was just simpler. Time \nhas changed all of that, especially with regard to faith and action.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese days, I find some solace in answering a set of self-imposed \nquestions when I am in doubt about a belief or action.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it biblical?\" \u0014\nI am glad we Baptists and many others see ourselves as \"people of the \nbook.\" I affirm the Bible as the supreme written authority for \nChristian faith and practice.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean that all Scripture is literally relevant in \ntoday's world. For example, God's people no longer receive directives \nto slaughter their enemies. I see no need to apply certain biblical \nsocial norms and, in doing so, attempt to marginalize women. Slavery \nis certainly a sin and most of us don't \"take up serpents\" to testify \nto our faith.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it logical?\" \u0014\nIn other words, does it pass the test of intelligence or common \nsense? The largely concocted and outdated conflict that many \nbelievers and educated people assume exists between faith and reason \nneeds to subside.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome educated folks need to realize that all Christians aren't \nmindless. Some Christians need to realize that all educated folks \naren't out to undermine the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, I know that I believe, live, say and preach some things that \nmay seem illogical. I tithe, pray and preach a gospel of grace I \nbelieve was made possible by the death and resurrection of a Jewish \nman 2,000 years ago. Yet, I still must put the logic test to \nquestions and concerns that come my way.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it beneficial?\" \u0014\nI don't want to be a strict pragmatist, but actual or potential \nresults are relevant. Inherent to faith is the notion that some \nlong-term results of current beliefs and actions can't be fully \npredicted.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdmittedly, to tie faith and action only to results is short-sighted. \nHowever, to divorce faith and action from significant results is to \nignore the obvious.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it moral?\" \u0014\nThe Bible speaks to many moral issues  sometimes directly and \nsometimes by inference. Issues like war, the role of women, slavery \nand many other matters demand careful thought to determine a sound \nChristian ethic.\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, many believers seem to make decisions based more on the \npotential profitability, popularity, pleasure or power gained by an \naction or belief in question. Of all people, Christians should \nconsider the morality of an action or belief as primary. That moral \nstandard is rarely easy or convenient.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it loving?\" \u0014\nJoseph Fletcher's book, \"Situation Ethics,\" caused such a stir close \nto a half century ago that he will never be forgiven by many moral \ntraditionalists. His contention that doing the most loving thing was \nthe equivalent of doing the right thing, even if traditional morality \nhad to be ignored, was shocking.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe his teachings opened the floodgates for some who were flush \nwith hormones and short on understanding his intent. Possible \nmisinterpretations of his work notwithstanding, one will rarely or \nnever go wrong if one does the most loving thing in a given situation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it legal?\" \u0014\nMost of us know that breaking the law is sometimes necessary to do \nthe right thing. Additionally, we are challenged to bring about \nchanges in a legal system that is unjust or immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe law of the land does not trump the word of the Lord, but the law \ndoes matter. Breaking the law in God's name should not be done \nlightly.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it respectful?\" \u0014\nI sometimes find myself trying to help churches that have been badly \ntreated by pastors. Admittedly, change agents sometimes fail because \nof unwieldy churches. On the other hand, change agents sometimes fail \nbecause of disrespectful methodology.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowers of Jesus must sometimes do things like drive money changers \nfrom the temple. However, most pastoral ministry will be more \nfruitful and faithful doing such radical things as an exception \nrather than as the rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Is it Christ-like?\" \u0014\nThis is the question that matters most to me. The other questions are \nnot exactly subordinate to this one. Rather, the other questions are \naids in answering this key question.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would like to think I am walking a path toward Christ-likeness. \nHowever, I know I \"see through the mirror dimly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome religious leaders seem to see God's will clearly at all times, \neven before it happens. I am not one of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore often than not, I see God's will in retrospect. However, I do \nfind the above questions most helpful to me as I try to live the \nKingdom life.\u0014\n\u0014\nReggie Warren\u0014",

In fact, the \ngovernment tried to exterminate them! Their leaders were captured and \nkilled and many letters and books burned. They left no public \nfestivals, no monuments--very little by which historians ordinarily \ntrace history. And to make your task more challenging, your people \nwere scattered over most of the known world. How could you possibly \nput together their story? That is the kind of task Eusebius tackled.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis people were the Christians who had been persecuted for almost \nthree hundred years. A measure of peace came to the believers when \nConstantine became emperor. At last the story of the church could be \ntold.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius was the one for the job. He had already prepared a \nchronology of the Bible and early church, trying to establish the \ndates of Christ's death and the events that followed. This was a \ndifficult undertaking because many different calendars were in use at \nthe time and he had to match up events recorded under one system to \nevents recorded under others.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius' ten-volume history is our best authority for early \nChristian history. We owe him a special debt because he quotes from \nmany sources that no longer exist. We are blessed that he showed \ninterest in a broad range of material. He traced the lines of \napostolic succession in key cities. Thus we know how the church \nprogressed in the big towns. The church has always been nourished \nwith the blood of martyrs. Eusebius told the stories of many who \nsuffered for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was also interested in debates over which books should be in the \nBible and he gave us various views of the matter. Because of this we \nknow a good deal about how we got the New Testament. Eusebius also \ntraced the threads of heresy. Through him we know of challenges to \northodoxy in the early centuries of the faith. Above all, Eusebius \ndescribed how God preserved the church and poured his grace upon it. \nEusebius even followed the woeful fate of the Jews and their \nstruggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nLate in life, Eusebius was invited to become bishop of Antioch. He \nturned down the offer. His backers appealed to the Emperor to compel \nhim to accept. Instead, Constantine praised Eusebius for refusing.\u0014\n\u0014\nEusebius died on this day, May 30, 339. He was seventy-four years \nold. In addition to all his other writings, he left behind him \ncommentaries on Isaiah and on the Psalms, a geography of the Bible, \nand a concordance of the Gospels. He wrote books to clear up \ndifferences in the Gospels. Finally he produced an account of the \nMartyrs of Palestine whom he had personally known. But his history \nremains his most important contribution to the church, and the one by \nwhich his name will always be remembered, for it gave us our past.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

The enthusiastic missionary was \nborn in Connecticut in 1810. Determined to get an education, he cut a \ndeal with his parents: if they would help him through college, he \nwould pay off the mortgage on their farm with his first earnings. His \nfather said he'd more likely spend his first years paying off college \ndebts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy economizing and working at tables; by singing on the side and \nteaching music, Brown not only graduated debt-free, but with $50 \nextra in his pocket. He soon found teaching positions that paid off \nthe family mortgage, too. Because of these experiences as an \nentrepreneur, Brown always respected businessmen. He recognized the \nimportance of economics to missions and later wrote a book on \neconomics in Chinese, seeing it as crucial to the development of \nChina.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of his life, Brown would be a Christian educator, and a bold one, \ntoo. In one of his first jobs as a school master, he learned that \nbullies had hauled the previous master outside and tossed him into \nthe snow. On his first day in school, he looked the boys in the eyes, \nsaying he had probably been misinformed, that they may have been \nslandered, but if they were going to try anything, now was the time. \nNone of them stepped forward then or afterwards.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater in China, he had mud slung at him and was pierced by a bandit's \nspear. Yet he persisted undaunted in his efforts to teach and preach. \nHe had gone to China because a group of English and American \nbusinessmen operating there saw the inhabitants' need for the gospel. \nThey subscribed a large sum of money to open a school. Brown took the \npost on a few days' notice when asked. He quickly contacted Elizabeth \nBarrett, whom he loved, and asked her to marry him. The two were wed \nwithin a week and left for China a few days later.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter seven years, the couple returned to the United States because \nof Elizabeth's health. Brown pastored a Dutch Reform church, farmed, \nand ran a school. He was noted for his passionate appeals to all to \naccept Christ. \"I would rather try to save souls than be the emperor \nof the Russias,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Perry forced Japan open, Samuel and Elizabeth were among the \nfirst Protestant missionaries to the Land of the Rising Sun. Brown, \nthe oldest, was almost fifty. At first the government viewed his \nteaching with suspicion, but finding that he never used the classroom \nas a political forum, they stopped spying on him.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring troubled times, Brown refused diplomatic immunity. This brave \nmove led the Japanese to compare him with their Samurai. Indeed, his \nability to inspire young men and impart his faith resulted in him \nbeing known as the greatest of the early Christian schoolmen in that \ncountry.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to developing methods for training Orientals, one of \nBrown's main accomplishments was to head the committee that \ntranslated the New Testament into Japanese. Furthermore, his \npreaching prepared a strong group of converts which became the \nnucleus of the first Japanese Protestant church at Yokohama. Near the \nend of his life, he also established Japan's first Protestant \ntheological seminary, operating it out of his own home in Tokyo at \nthe start. He died on this day June 20, 1880.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAnderson, Gerald H. \"Brown, Samuel Robbins.\" Biographical Dictionary \nof Christian Missions.

When Evangeline died on this day, July \n17, 1950, she had put her 85 own years to good use.\u0014\nThe youngest daughter of William and Catherine Booth (founders of the \nSalvation Army), she was born in 1865, the same year that it was \nfounded. Her name was taken from the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, in \nwhich little Eva St. Claire was a Christian heroine.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline inherited her parents' flair for ministry and \nsalesmanship. She began preaching at the age of fifteen. Given her \nown leadership post two years later, she won the nickname \"White \nAngel of the Slums.\" Sometimes, she wore the same tattered clothes as \nthe flower girls in order to minister to them. Full of tact, charm, \ninventiveness and good spirits--not to mention good looks, she had a \nknack for solving problems and dramatizing the Salvation Army cause. \nIn fact, she became an Army troubleshooter. General William Booth \nsent Eva in when persecutions broke out or a local branch of the Army \nwas in disarray. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the American leaders of the Salvation Army disagreed with \nGeneral William Booth (splitting to found the Volunteers of America) \nit was Evangeline whom the general sent to solve the organization's \nwoes. She succeeded. Eventually, she was appointed leader of the \nAmerican work and became an American citizen. In 1934, she became \ngeneral of the world wide movement, a position she held for five \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangeline's style was to work herself to exhaustion for weeks or \nmonths, rest a few days, and then begin the cycle over again. \nNonetheless, she enjoyed life thoroughly. She rode horses and loved \ndiving. Horses weren't her only rides: she was the first prominent \nSalvationist to try a bicycle. Another means of relaxation was \nplaying musical instruments such as the harp.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her travels, Evangeline delivered powerful lectures. Many of these \nwere gathered into a volume titled Toward a Better World. \"The better \nworld is the home as well as the sure reward for the faithful unto \ndeath. They may have dreary and disappointing experience on earth: \nhard toil for the hands, sickness of the body, anxiety at the home, \npatched clothes on the back, and, maybe, rejected love in the heart; \nbut neither principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not \nthings to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall \nclose against them the gates of THE BETTER WORLD.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong her many writings were hymns. Perhaps the most famous was \"The \nWorld for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world for God!

    "title": "EARLY CHURCH WOMEN AND HERESY",
    "words": "Early Church Women and Heresy \u0014\nOf course not only women were attracted to the heretical sects that \ndiverged from early church orthodoxy, but women were prominent in \ntheir leadership and teachings. Why might this have been?\u0014\n\u0014\nRUTH A. TUCKER AND WALTER LIEFELD\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a curious fact that women were prominent in the life and \nliterature of fringe groups [of the early church]. The Naasenes \nclaimed to have received their teachings from James, the brother of \nJesus, mediated by a woman named Marianne. Epiphanius said that the \nNicolaitans had a work they ascribed to a woman they thought was \nNoah's wife, called Noria.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Apocryphal literature names not only Thecla, in the Acts of Paul \nand Thecla, but also Marianne, alleged to have been the sister of \nPhilip, and a number of other women who were said to be prophetesses. \nThe New Testament itself had spoken scathingly of \"that woman \nJezebel, who calls herself a prophetess\" (Revelation2:20). But does \nthis mean that only deviant sects had prophetesses, or, conversely, \nthat prophetesses were always heretical?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer is clearly negative, since the canonical Book of Acts \nmentions that Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied \n(Acts 21:9). Why then were prophetesses apparently more active in \nheretical groups than in the orthodox stream of the church?\u0014\nOne can only speculate, but the following facts may have a bearing on \nthe question. In order for the deviant groups to gain adherents, it \nwas necessary for them to demonstrate their superiority over the \nestablished church. This was done, in part, by claiming truth the \northodox Christians did not possess or emphasize.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch \"truth\" had to come from a divine source, and the expected mode \nwould be prophecy. By their nature, these groups were individualistic \nand lacked the established church's corporate structure (such as it \nwas by that time). The way was open for individual prophetic \nactivity, which in these groups included the participation of women. \nIt could also be suggested that because women were increasingly \nrestricted in the developing church structure, some of the more \nstrong-minded or impulsive ones would gravitate to groups that \nallowed them more expression.\u0014\n\u0014\nGnosticism\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever the case may have been with the other sects, in Gnosticism \nthe female presence was prominent in its very theology. While the \nquestion could be asked as to why their theology became so feminized, \nfor purposes of the present survey it is more important to observe \nthat the existence of a feminine principle at the heart of their \nsystem could hardly fail to raise the female consciousness in their \nsociety. Much research has been done in this area, especially by \nElaine Pagels [in her book The Gnostic Gospels (Random, 1979)]. In a \nchapter entitled \"God the Father/God the Mother,\" Pagels assembles a \ncurious assortment of texts. They are not monolithic, but evidence a \ndiversity of attitudes toward sexual differentiation. One of these \nreveals an assumption that for women to enter the kingdom of heaven \nthey must, as Pagels puts it, \"assimilate themselves to men\":\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Simon Peter said to [the disciples]: 'Let Mary leave us, for women \nare not worthy of Life.' Jesus said, 'I myself shall lead her, in \norder to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit, \nresembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will \nenter the kingdom of heaven.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n At the heart of all this is the theological discussion among the \nGnostics themselves, according to Irenaeus, as to the feminine \nelement in Bythus, who was generally thought to be the supreme being \namong the Gnostic hierarchy. Some considered \"him\" to be sexless, \nwhile others thought he was both masculine and feminine, \"assigning \nto him the nature of a hermaphrodite\" (Against Heresies, I,XI, 5).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe feminine principle in Gnostic thought was expressed frequently \nand under a variety of names, including \"Mother,\" \"Sound,\" \"Thought \nof the Father,\" \"Image of the Invisible Spirit,\" \"Perfect Mind,\" \n\"First and Last,\" \"Thunder,\" \"Whore,\" \"Mother of All,\" \"Virginal \nBerbelon,\" and the \"Ineffable Mother who presides over heaven.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does this complex of Gnostic ideologyof which only a part is \nreproduced herefit into the whole picture of women in the early \nchurch? It has become increasingly common for students of the \nreligious literature and history of the early Christian centuries \n(including the New Testament itself) to view this from a social \nperspective. Commenting on the Gnostic views and the diversity within \nthe Christian church (e.g., Paul's teachings in comparison with the \nprominence of prophetesses in Montanism), Pagels remarks:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Such contradictory attitudes toward women reflect a time of social \ntransition, as well as a diversity of cultural influences.  In \nGreece and Asia Minor, women participated with men in religious \ncults.  In Egypt women had attained  a relatively advanced state of \nemancipation.  In Rome, forms of education had changed  [women were \nactive publicly in business and social activities].  \"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yet despite all of this, and despite the previous public activity of \nChristian women, the majority of Christian churches in the 2nd \ncentury, like the majority of the middle class, opposed the move \ntoward equality.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nMontanism\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see My Documents/Early Church Women and Heresy\u0014",

That percentage is even higher among Catholics (70 \npercent), mainline Christians (67 percent), and Protestants from the \nhistorically black tradition (72 percent). Twenty-two percent of \natheists and 56 percent of agnostics affirm at least one of the four \nNew Age beliefs. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the general population, 69 percent of women and 55 percent of \nmen believe in at least one New Age tenant. \u0014\nJust as women are more likely than men to identify with a religion \nand to engage in a number of religious practices, women also are more \nlikely to hold New Age beliefs, Claire Gecewicz, a research analyst \nat Pew Research Center, wrote. Across all four measures  belief in \npsychics, reincarnation, astrology and that spiritual energy can be \nfound in objects  larger shares of women than men subscribe to these \nbeliefs.\u0014",

The exchange \nof eggs in the springtime is a custom that was centuries old when \nEaster was first celebrated by Christians. From the earliest times, \nthe egg was a symbol of rebirth in most cultures. Eggs were often \nwrapped in gold leaf or, if you were a peasant, colored brightly by \nboiling them with the leaves or petals of certain flowers. The egg is \nnature's perfect package. It has, during the span of history, \nrepresented mystery, magic, medicine, food and omen.

The Romans, Gauls, \nChinese, Egyptians and Persians all cherished the egg as a symbol of \nthe universe. It was commonly believed that the universe developed \nfrom a great egg and that the halves of its shell corresponded to \nHeaven and earth. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith the advent of Christianity the symbolism of the egg changed to \nrepresent, not nature's rebirth, but the rebirth of man. Christians \nembraced the egg symbol and likened it to the tomb from which Christ \nrose. The shell can be seen as a nurturing, life giving tomb.

    "words": "ESCHATOLOGY \nTERMS \u0014\n\u0014\nTRIBULATION, THE GREAT. This is the period of unparalleled suffering \nthat, according to premillennial eschatology, will precede the \nestablishment of the future kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6). The trouble \nwill embrace the entire earth (Rev 3:10). Yet in a distinctive sense \nit will center upon Jerusalem and Palestine, being called by Jeremiah \nspecifically \"the time of Jacob's distress\" (Jer 30:7). \u0014\n\u0014\nIt will involve the Jewish people who will have gone back to \nPalestine in unbelief. It will also be connected with catastrophic \njudgments upon the Gentile nations because of their wickedness and \nanti-Semitism. The colossal scenes of the Revelation, beginning with \nchap. 5 and the opening of the seven-sealed book, through chap. 10, \nform a prelude to worldwide commotion prior to the Great Tribulation \nitself described in chaps. 11-18. The Great Tribulation is identical \nwith the last three and one-half years of Daniel's seventieth week of \nyears (Dan 9:24-27; Rev 11:2-3). The gigantic wars, cataclysms, \npestilences, etc., that befall the earth are actually the \nmanifestation of the risen, victorious Christ taking an open hand to \nclaim His redeemed rights to the earth in preparation for the divine \nprogram involving His people on the earth. Ps 2, in giving the order \nof the establishment of the kingdom in the ousting of Christ's \nenemies, closely interweaves the first advent and the Messiah's death \nin shame with His second advent in glory to receive the rewards of \nHis conquest over sin and death. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Tribulation will see the nations raging (Ps 2:1) and the derision \nof Jehovah (v. 4) that men should vainly imagine to set aside His \ncovenant (2 Sam 7:8-16) and His plan for the earth (Ps 89:34-37). The \nGreat Tribulation foreseen in Ps 2 is described in Matt 24:15-51. It \neventuates in the establishment of the rejected King in Zion (Ps 2:6) \nand the subjugation of the earth to the King's millennial rule (vv. \n7-9), with a present appeal to Gentile world powers to be warned by \nthe certainty of the establishment of Christ's kingdom (vv. 10-12). \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Rev 13-19, there will be the cruel reign of the \"beast \ncoming up out of the sea\" (13:1) who, breaking his covenant with the \nJews (2 Thess 2:4), will demand divine worship. This earth ruler, the \nBeast, is empowered by Satan, and the entire terrific episode of \nfighting God is made possible by the unprecedented activity of demons \n(Rev 9:1-11; 16:13-16). The terrific bowl judgments of chap. 16 are \nthe \"Lamb's\" final demonstration of power. He destroys His enemies \nand frees His redeemed earth from the domination of wicked men at His \nvisible, glorious return, and sets up the kingdom. Those who are not \npremillennialists hold that the Tribulation of Revelation was \nfulfilled in the Roman persecutions of the church or in great \ncatastrophes occurring over the last nineteen centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nANTICHRIST (Grk. antichristos, \"against Christ\"; some, \"instead of \nChrist\"). A word used only by the apostle John (epistles 1 and 2).\u0014\n\u0014\nMeaning. The Gk. preposition anti in composition sometimes denotes \nsubstitution, taking the place of another; hence, \"false Christ.\" The \nconnection in which the word is used appears to import opposition, \ncovert rather than avowed, with a professed friendliness.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nANTICHRIST\u0014\nThe Antichrist. From early times the opinion has prevailed that the \nantichrists referred to were the forerunners of an evil rather than \nthe evil itself. Some individual would arise who, by way of eminence, \nwould be fitly called the Antichrist; and who, before being destroyed \nby Christ, would utter horrid blasphemies against the Most High and \npractice great enormities upon the saints. This view is scriptural \nand came from connecting the passages in John's epistles with the \ndescriptions in Daniel and the Apocalypse of the great God-opposing \npower that would persecute the saints of the Most High; and of the \napostle Paul's \"man of lawlessness\" (2 Thess 2:3-10).\u0014\n\u0014\nSee also our Lord's own prediction respecting the last age of the \nworld (Matt 24:24) and the description of such an Antichrist (Rev \n13:1-8).\u0014\n\u0014\nIdentification. Early Christians looked for Antichrist as a person \nand not a polity or system. The general opinion of those who closely \nfollowed the Scriptures was that he would be a man in whom Satan \nwould dwell utterly and bodily, and who would be armed with satanic \nand demonic powers. In the OT he is prefigured under the \"king of \nBabylon\" (Isa 14:4); the little \"horn\" (Dan 7:8; 8:9); the king \n\"insolent and skilled in intrigue\" (8:23); \"the prince who is to \ncome\" (9:26); the willful king (11:36). In the NT he is called \"the \nman of lawlessness,\" \"the son of destruction\" (2 Thess 2:3-8); \n\"antichrist\" (1 John 2:18); and \"the beast\" (Rev 13:1-10). This \nsinister, demon-inspired leader will rise to dominate the world in \nthe end-time, persecute the saints, seek to destroy the Jew and \nbanish the name of God and His Christ from the earth, and thus take \nover. This would mean the thwarting of God's plan for the messianic \nmillennial kingdom, which involves the restoration of Israel (Acts \n1:6) and universal peace. He is destroyed by the second advent of \nChrist (Rev 19:11-16), who sets up the earthly kingdom (Rev 20:1-3). \nThis is the premillennial view. Amillennialism rejects an earthly \nkingdom in favor of Christ's ushering in the eternal state, rather \nthan His establishing another era in time. Views that identify the \nAntichrist with Muhammad (Innocent III in 1213) or with the papal \nchurch (Protestantism) can scarcely be called scriptural.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nANTICHRIST\u0014\n(In Revelation)\u0014\nIf we follow the analogy of Daniel, which has influenced the \nApocalyptist so much, the Johannine Antichrist must be regarded as \nnot a person but a kingdom. In this case it must be the Roman Empire \nthat is meant.\u0014\n(from International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia)\u0014",

She became certain that \nmonasticism was not the way taught in Scripture. With the help of \nmilkmaids she escaped and became a follower of peaceful Menno Simons. \nShe was one of the first Reformation women ministers, probably a \ndeaconness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1549, Catholic authorities arrested her. When they found her Bible \nthey knew they had the person they were looking for. Mistakenly, they \nthought she was the wife of Menno Simons. When they tried to get her \nto take an oath at her interrogation, she refused, saying Christ had \ntaught that our yes should mean yes and our no mean no.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe record of her inquisition shows that the examiners asked her to \ninform on those whom she had taught. Knowing that this would lead to \ntheir arrest, she refused.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, my Lords, do not press me on this point. Ask me about my faith \nand I will answer you gladly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We will make it so tough that you will tell us,\" they threatened.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she would not reveal who had baptized her or whom she had \ntaught, they questioned her beliefs. She insisted that church \nbuildings were not the house of God, for our bodies are the temple of \nthe Holy Spirit. She denied that the New Testament spoke of the bread \nand wine as a sacrament but rather as the Lord's Supper. Asked if she \nwere saved by baptism, she replied, \"No, my Lords. All the water in \nthe sea cannot save me. All my salvation is in Christ, who has \ncommanded me love the Lord, my God, and my neighbor as myself.\" She \ndenied that priests have authority to forgive sins--only Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill refusing to reveal who had baptized her, she was taken to the \ntorture chamber and said, \"So far we have treated you gently. Since \nyou won't confess, we will put you to the torture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA man named Mr. Hans applied screws to a thumb and fingers until \nblood spurted from under her fingernails. Still she wouldn't give \naway her friends, but her agony was so great that she cried aloud to \nChrist and received relief. So they lifted her skirt to apply torture \nto her shins. She pleaded that she had never allowed anyone to touch \nher body and they promised to respect her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they crushed her leg bones with screws until she fainted. The \nmen thought she was dead, but she came to and assured them she was \nnot. \u0014\n\u0014\nRealizing that they could get nothing out of her, the authorities \ncondemned her to die. Rather than burn her, as was customary, they \ntied her in a bag and drowned her on this day, March 27, 1549.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "EMBEZZLEMENT OF CHURCH FUNDS",
    "words": "EMBEZZLEMENT OF CHURCH FUNDS\u0014\n\u0014\nMany church leaders cannot believe that embezzlement is a risk that \nthey need to take seriously. After all, shouldn't the risk of \nembezzlement be lower in a religious organization than in any other \norganization? Unfortunately, the answer is no. In fact, religious \norganizations are at a much higher risk of embezzlement than many \nother organizations because many have not adopted effective \"internal \ncontrols\" to safeguard their resources. In many cases it is frequent \naccess to funds, rather than a need for money, that results in \nembezzlement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are many other reasons why church leaders should take the risk \nof embezzlement seriously, including the following:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tChurches that take steps to prevent embezzlement remove a source of \npossible temptation from employees and volunteers who work with money.\u0014\n\tBy taking steps to prevent embezzlement, a denomination protects \nthe reputation of innocent employees and volunteers who otherwise \nmight be suspected of financial wrongdoing when financial \nirregularities occur.\u0014\n\tBy taking steps to prevent embezzlement, a denomination avoids the \nunpleasant task of confronting individuals who are suspected of \nembezzlement.\u0014\n\tBy taking steps to prevent embezzlement, a denomination avoids the \nrisk of division among the leadership that often is associated with \ncases of embezzlement--with some persons wanting to show mercy to the \noffender and others demanding justice.\u0014\n\tBy taking steps to prevent embezzlement, a denomination reduces the \nrisk of having to tell donors that some of their contributions have \nbeen misappropriated by an employee or volunteer.\u0014\n\tBy taking steps to prevent embezzlement, a denomination reduces the \ndamage to the reputation and stature of its leaders who otherwise may \nbe blamed for allowing embezzlement to occur.\u0014\n\tChurches that take steps to prevent embezzlement help to create a \n\"culture of accountability\" with regard to funds.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is embezzlement?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe definition of embezzlement varies slightly from state to state, \nbut in general it refers to the wrongful conversion of property that \nis lawfully in your possession. The idea is that someone has legal \ncontrol or custody of property or funds, and then decides to convert \nthe property or funds to his or her own personal use.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost people who embezzle funds insist that they intended to pay the \nmoney back and were simply \"borrowing\" the funds temporarily. An \nintent to pay back embezzled funds is not a defense to the crime of \nembezzlement. Many employees who embezzle funds plan on repaying the \nemployer fully before anyone suspects what has happened. One can only \nimagine how many such schemes actually work without anyone knowing \nabout it. The courts are not persuaded by the claims of embezzlers \nthat they intended to fully pay back the funds they misappropriated. \nThe crime is complete when the embezzler misappropriates the funds to \nhis or her own personal use. As one court has noted:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe act of embezzlement is complete the moment the official converts \nthe money to his own use even though he then has the intent to \nrestore it. Few embezzlements are committed except with the full \nbelief upon the part of the guilty person that he can and will \nrestore the property before the day of accounting occurs. There is \nwhere the danger lies and the statute prohibiting embezzlement is \npassed in order to protect the public against such venturesome \nenterprises by people who have money in their control.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, it does not matter that someone intended to pay back \nembezzled funds. This intent in no way justifies or excuses the \ncrime. The crime is complete when the funds are converted to one's \nown use--whether or not there was an intent to pay them back.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if the embezzled funds are returned? The crime of embezzlement \nhas occurred even if the embezzled funds in fact are paid back. Of \ncourse, it may be less likely that a prosecutor will prosecute a case \nunder these circumstances. And even if the embezzler is prosecuted, \nthis evidence may lessen the punishment. But the courts have \nconsistently ruled that an actual return of embezzled funds does not \npurge the offense of its criminal nature or absolve the embezzler \nfrom punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey point. Even if an embezzler is caught or confesses, and then \nagrees to \"pay back\" the embezzled funds, church leaders seldom know \nif all embezzled funds are being returned. They are relying almost \nentirely on the word of a thief.\u0014\nWhy religious organizations are vulnerable\u0014\n\u0014\nMany religious organizations refuse to adopt measures to reduce the \nrisk of embezzlement out of a fear that such measures will reflect a \nlack of trust in those persons who handle funds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis publication is designed to provide accurate and authoritative \ninformation in regard to the subject matter covered.
