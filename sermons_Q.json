And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, \nis it possible that an empire can rise without his aid?\u0014\n'Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it.' \nI firmly believe this.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel AdamsAmerican patriot, leader of resistance to Britain:\u0014\n'The rights of the colonists as Christians... may be best understood \nby reading and carefully studying the institutes of the great \nLawgiver and Head of the Christian Church, which are to be found \nclearly written and promulgated in the New Testament.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick HenryAmerican orator and statesmen, influenced colonies \ntoward revolution:\u0014\nIt cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great \nnation was founded, not by\u0014\nreligionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the gospel \nof Jesus Christl For this very reason peoples of other faiths have \nbeen afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn JayAmerican statesman, first chief justice of the United States:\u0014\nProvidence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and \nit is the duty as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian \nnation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNoah WebsterAmerican lexicographer, dedicated member of Federalist \nParty:\u0014\n'The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of \nChrist and his apostles, which enjoins humility, piety, and \nbenevolence; which acknowledges in every person a brother, or a \nsister, and a citizen with equal rights. This is genuine \nChristianity, and to this we owe our free Constitutions of \nGovernment.\u0014",

Tozer, Jesus, Our Man in Glory\u0014\n\u0014\nRabbi Shlomo Carlebach: \"Full experiences of God can never be planned \nor achieved.

Saying prayers is one \nactivity among others. But prayer is an attitude of the heart that \ncan transform every activity. We cannot say prayers at all times, but \nwe ought to \"pray without ceasing\" (1 Thess. 5:17). That means we \nought to keep our heart open for the meaning of life. Gratefulness \ndoes this, moment by moment. Gratefulness is, therefore, \nprayerfulness.\u0014\nDavid Stendl-Rast, Gratefulness, The Heart of Prayer\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer is not a convenient device for imposing our will upon God, or \nfor bending his will to ours, but the prescribed way of subordinating \nour will to his. It is by prayer that we seek God's will, embrace it \nand align ourselves with it. Every true prayer is a variation on the \ntheme, \"Your will be done.\" Our Master taught us to say this in the \npattern prayer he gave us, and added the supreme example of it in \nGethsemane.\u0014\nJohn Stott, The Letters of John\u0014",

And for \nthe season, it\u0014\n                              was winter. What could they see but a \nhideous and\u0014\n                              desolate wilderness? What could now \nsustain them\u0014\n                              but the Spirit of God and his grace?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Puritanism has become a label. For some, \"what's wrong with \nAmerica\" is that too much\u0014\n    Puritanism survives to haunt and inhibit their country. Other \nAmericans, though, believe\u0014\n    the failures of our country result from the dilution of Puritan \ndiscipline and ideals.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Whether one thinks of Puritanism as bane or blessing, this is \nsure: no religious\u0014\n    experiment in the New World has had a more enduring impact upon \nour nation's\u0014\n    education, literature, sense of mission, church governance, \nethical responsibility, or\u0014\n    religious vision.\u0014\n\u0014\n    This is the story of the Puritans' mission, what they termed an \n\"errand into the\u0014\n    wilderness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Purifying the church\u0014\n    American Puritanism has its beginning in sixteenth-century \nEngland. King Henry\u0014\n    VIII (who reigned from 1509 to 1547) shook the Church in England \nloose from its\u0014\n    Roman Catholic moorings The two brief reigns that followed \nmuddied the waters:\u0014\n    during the reign of Edward VI (1547-1553) the nation veered \nsharply toward\u0014\n    Protestantism; in the reign of Mary I (1553-1558), it veered even \nmore sharply\u0014\n    back toward Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In the long reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), citizens \ncaught their collective breath\u0014\n    and tried to determine, more precisely, the character of their \nnew national church. It isn't\u0014\n    surprising that people differed-strongly, bitterly, and even \nbloodily.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Some passionately sought to make the Protestant Reformation a \nredeeming reality in all\u0014\n    of English life and culture, thus purifying it. They came to be \ncalled Puritans. The Puritans\u0014\n    wanted to rid the Church of England of all evidences of its \nhistoric Catholic connection,\u0014\n    and to let the New Testament determine church order and worship. \nAs petitioners to King\u0014\n    James I (1603-1625) put it in 1603, the true church ought not to \nbe \"governed by Popish\u0014\n    Canons, Courts, Classes, Customs, or any human invention, but by \nthe laws and rules\u0014\n    which Christ hath appointed in his Testament.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    But Puritans themselves soon split as to the method of purifying.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The Pilgrims\u0014\n    While some worked patiently to reform the church, moving it inch \nby inch and year\u0014\n    by year, others gave up hope that such a political megachurch \nwould ever\u0014\n    change. So they separated from the national church in order to \nfashion a\u0014\n    fellowship of their own, with the New Testament as their only \nguide.\u0014\n\u0014\n     People differedstrongly, bitterly, and bloodilyabout how to \nshape\u0014\n                            Protestant England.\u0014\n\u0014\n    One Separatist congregation meeting in secret in Nottingham \n(north of London)hoped that\u0014\n    the new king, James I, would be more lenient in religious matters \nthan Elizabeth had\u0014\n    been. But those hopes were dashed when James declared that all \ndissenters must\u0014\n    conform to England's worship and submit to England's bishops, or \n\"I will harry them out of\u0014\n    the land, or else worse.\" \"Worse\" clearly meant \"death,\" for \nfailure to conform to the\u0014\n    Church of England was a capital crime. Yet to conform was \nimpossible for these men and\u0014\n    women.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In 1607 the group fled to Holland, where they could worship in a \nmanner that did no\u0014\n    violence to their consciences After some years however, they \nfound that solution\u0014\n    unsatisfactory; their children, burdened with difficult labor, \nwere growing up as Dutch\u0014\n    young people, not as English.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Aware of English claims in the New World, the Pilgrims (as these \nSeparatists became\u0014\n    known) conceived the ambitious and expensive plan to start a \ncolony across the sea.\u0014\n    They received a land grant from the Virginia Company of London \nand some promise of\u0014\n    merchant support, though neither came easily. The Pilgrims had to \nprove they were not\u0014\n    radical heretics; the merchants had to be assured that some \nreturn on their investments\u0014\n    would be forthcoming.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Being \"knit together as a body in a most strict and sacred bond \nand covenant of the\u0014\n    Lord,\" the group of about 100 sailed from Plymouth, England, on \nSeptember 6, 1620. Two\u0014\n    months later, the Mayflower arrived off Cape Cod in \nMassachusetts, where these settlers\u0014\n    soon established their own Plymouth.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The Virginia Company's patent extended no farther than 41degrees \nlatitude, roughly\u0014\n    around the southern tip of Manhattan Island. The new arrivals \nthus realized they needed\u0014\n    some instrument of civil government, especially since some of \ntheir number, not sharing\u0014\n    the same religious fervor, had made \"discontented & mutinous \nspeeches.\" The resulting\u0014\n    Mayflower Compact, dated November 11, 1620, pledged the group, \n\"solemnly & mutually\u0014\n    in the presence of God and one another,\" to \"covenant, and \ncombine ourselves together\u0014\n    into a civil body politic.\" The good of the colony, not the \ninterests of any individual, was to\u0014\n    be the guiding principle.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Deathly winter\u0014\n    During that first hard winter, death reduced the contingent by \nnearly half. Many\u0014\n    continued to live aboard the ship. Only the intercession of the \nWampanoag\u0014\n    Indians, who taught them how to plant and fish, kept the \nmortality rate from\u0014\n    growing worse.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The Pilgrim migration consisted of men and women accustomed to \nlabor in the field. So\u0014\n    that first spring, crops were planted, houses built, and game \nsuccessfully hunted. No\u0014\n    prolonged \"starving time\" haunted Plymouth as it had the earliest \nsettlers in Virginia. Nor\u0014\n    did the Indians attack this vulnerable group; instead they \nassisted them, joining in their\u0014\n    ceremonies and feasts, including the much mythologized first \nThanksgiving.\u0014\n\u0014\n    William Bradford, who was elected governor thirty times between \n1622 and 1656, proved\u0014\n    to be a steady hand in directing the colony, as well as an able \nhistorian of its courage and\u0014\n    trials.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Great migration\u0014\n    England's King Charles I, who ruled from 1625 to 1649, asserted \nhis authority over\u0014\n    Parliament, church, and people with even more vigor than his \nfather, James I. His\u0014\n    archbishop, William Laud, repressed all religious dissent. Those \nPuritans who had\u0014\n    not separated from the Church of England now labored for reform \nwith increasing\u0014\n    difficulty, and they sensed the odds of success were against \nthem. They faced the\u0014\n    hard alternative of conforming, at great cost to their \nconsciences, or defying, at\u0014\n    great cost to their lives and fortunes. They likewise chose that \nother way out:\u0014\n    migration to the New World.\u0014\n\u0014\n    When, in 1629, Charles dissolved a Parliament that tried to \nrestrain his autocratic power,\u0014\n    Puritans in the Church of England saw little hope. Just weeks \nbefore Charles's action,\u0014\n    some Puritans had applied for a charter under the name of the \nMassachusetts Bay\u0014\n    Company. With such a document in hand, the time seemed ripe for a \nmigration. John\u0014\n    Winthroplawyer, Puritan, and soon-to-be first governor of the \nMassachusetts Bay\u0014\n    Colonynoted that God \"hath disposed the hearts of so many of his \nwise and faithful\u0014\n    servants, both ministers and others, not only to approve of the \nenterprise but to interest\u0014\n    themselves in it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n        The weighty task of Puritan government was to see that in both\u0014\n            behavior and belief people did nothing to offend God.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The sheer number of people involved distinguished this colony \nfrom earlier English efforts.\u0014\n    About 700 sailed with Winthrop in March 1630, another 300 \nfollowed soon thereafter, and\u0014\n    another 1,000 before the year was out. The decade of the I630s, \nproducing what has been\u0014\n    called the Great Migration, saw the population of Massachusetts \nBay soar to nearly\u0014\n    9,000. Thus, the colony did not lack labor, skills, productive \nfarmers, and infusions of new\u0014\n    blood.\u0014\n\u0014\n    City upon ahill\u0014\n    What set Massachusetts apart from Virginia was its adherence to \ncertain ideas\u0014\n    that have been termed \"the New England mind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    In 1630, while still aboard the ship that brought them across the \nocean, John\u0014\n    Winthropthough a laymanpreached a sermon entitled \"A Model of \nChristian Charity.\"\u0014\n    Just as one would avoid shipwreck at sea, said Winthrop, so they \nmust avoid similar\u0014\n    calamity on land. The only way to do that was to follow \"the \ncounsel of Micah, to do\u0014\n    justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with our God. For this end, \nwe must be knit together\u0014\n    in this work as one man.\" If they would so conduct themselves, \n\"the Lord will be our God\u0014\n    and delight to dwell among us.\" They were \"entered into covenant \nwith [God] for this\u0014\n    work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Winthrop saw the Puritan venture as a way of demonstrating how \nnations could prosper\u0014\n    and be blessed. God, Winthrop said, would \"make us a praise and \nglory,\" so much so\u0014\n    that \"men will say of succeeding plantations: 'the Lord make it \nlike that of New England.\"'\u0014\n    In short, \"we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a \nhill, the eyes of all people\u0014\n    are upon us.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    The weighty task of government, then, was to see that the \ncovenant was not broken, that\u0014\n    in both behavior and belief the Puritan settlers did nothing to \noffend God. The covenant\u0014\n    bound them to know the will of God, as revealed in the Bible, and \nto follow that will as\u0014\n    faithfully as human frailty would permit.\u0014\n\u0014\n    To help men and women follow God, ministers were chosen to \ninterpret and enforce his\u0014\n    will. Meeting houses were built in every town for collective \npraise and collective obedience.\u0014\n    Church members, no less than pastors, must study their Bibles, \nexamine their souls, and\u0014\n    make straight their paths. The whole \"fellowship of the saints\" \nbore responsibility for the\u0014\n    integrity of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Each congregation, though, directed its own affairs, hiring or \nfiring ministers and setting\u0014\n    standards for church membership. Neither bishop nor synod ruled \nover them. Thus, the\u0014\n    Puritans later assumed the denominational name of \nCongregationalists.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Sunday was a day not for recreation and sport (as James I \nbelieved), but for worship and\u0014\n    meditation. Puritans, however, did not give attention to other \nholy days, or saints' days,\u0014\n    even Christmas, for these were lingering elements of the papal \ncalendar. They did not\u0014\n    kneel at the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for that suggested \nthe bodily presence of\u0014\n    Christ in the Communion elements. Nor did they hear confession or \ntreat marriage as a\u0014\n    sacrament.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Worship must be as simple at it is sincere. No priest or bishop \nshould stand between the\u0014\n    believer and his or her God; no altar should suggest that the \nsacrifice of Christ had to be\u0014\n    repeated; no statues or pictures or stained glass windows should \ndistract the worshiper\u0014\n    from concentrating upon God and the Sacred Word; no Book of \nCommon Prayer should\u0014\n    tell one what or how or when to pray.\u0014\n\u0014\n     To keep \"the New England Way\" pure and undefiled, they sometimes\u0014\n         had to purge, sometimes persecute, sometimes even hang.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Above all, no one should suggest that salvation could be earned: \nit was a gift of God's\u0014\n    grace, wholly unmerited and freely given to those whom God \nelected to save. In that, as in\u0014\n    all other dimensions of life, the Almighty Creator, not the \nfickle objects of that creation,\u0014\n    was in charge. This doctrine of predestination, often \nmisconstrued as a mindless fatalism,\u0014\n    was to the Puritans a comforting trust in the sovereignty of a \nloving Cod.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Christian Harvard\u0014\n    Literacy in New England was high (though many could not write, \nwriting and \"doing\u0014\n    sums\" being a more advanced stage of education). For Puritans, \nwho put so much\u0014\n    stake on the Bible, reading was fundamental to Christian \neducation. Mothers were\u0014\n    initially the chief teachers of reading and writing in the home. \nSoon every New\u0014\n    England town had its grammar school for boys, while less formal \n\"dame schools\"\u0014\n    watched over the education of the girls.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In an astonishing act of daring, the Puritans, even in the first \ndecade of their colony,\u0014\n    founded a college, which would soon take the name of Harvard. \nPatterned after Cambridge\u0014\n    University, from which most Puritan ministers had graduated, \nHarvard College faithfully\u0014\n    reflected the Puritan community. The \"rules and precepts\" of 1646 \nstipulated that every\u0014\n    student \"shall consider the main end of his life and studies to \nknow God and Jesus Christ\u0014\n    which is eternal life.\" The Bible was to be read twice a day, \nwith all students expected to\u0014\n    be \"ready to give an account of their proficiency therein.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Harvard, though designed for the training of ministers, also \noffered education in the\u0014\n    classics of antiquity, Renaissance languages, Aristotelian \nphysics, and natural and moral\u0014\n    philosophy. When a site for the infant college was selected \nacross the Charles River from\u0014\n    Boston, the town was called Cambridge, in memory of the Puritans' \nEnglish past and with\u0014\n    large hopes for their American future.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The Puritans had left England to escape bishops and cleanse \nthemselves of an impure\u0014\n    worship. In Massachusetts Bay, the Puritans intended to recreate \nthe New Testament\u0014\n    church, to fashion what they had hoped the Church of England \nwould turn out to be. They\u0014\n    came not for freedom of religion in the abstract but for their \nfreedom of religion in\u0014\n    particular. They never intended to found a colony where all \nreligious dissidents of whatever\u0014\n    persuasion, or none, would flock.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Far from it, they did their best to keep \"the New England Way\" \nconsistent, pure,\u0014\n    undefiled. To do this, education was not enough; they sometimes \nhad to purge,\u0014\n    sometimes persecute, sometimes even hang.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Dangerous dissent\u0014\n    Orthodoxy was never as complete as the clergy and the magistrates \nwould have\u0014\n    wished. From the beginning Baptists and Quakers lived in and \naround the colony.\u0014\n    Banishments and hangings only slowed their growth.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In addition, many Puritans, like all Europeans of the time, \npracticed magic, followed\u0014\n    astrological charts, and kept ancient superstitions alive-much as \npeople do today. Such\u0014\n    popular religion did not reject Puritan orthodoxy; it merely \nsupplemented it. The\u0014\n    supernatural world could not be confined to the prayers of the \nclergy or the explicit\u0014\n    promises of Scripture. Signs and portents, visions and wonders, \nfortunes told and\u0014\n    illnesses strangely cured, private rituals to ensure the \nfertility of fields and marriage-these\u0014\n    lived side-by-side with Puritan orthodoxy.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Most troublesome were people who directly challenged Puritan \northodoxy. One such\u0014\n    challenger, Roger Williams, argued that (1) the Puritan churches \ncould not claim to be\u0014\n    part of the Church of England while trying all the while to \ntransform it; (2) the civil\u0014\n    government had no business enforcing church rules or punishing \nits detractors; (3) all\u0014\n    Puritan settlers were trespassers because they had not purchased \nthe land from Indians.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Williams presented a bill of indictment so threatening that the \nGeneral Court of\u0014\n    Massachusetts determined in October 1635 that \"the said Mr. \nWilliams shall depart out of\u0014\n    this jurisdiction within six weeks\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    Winter refugee\u0014\n    But where to go, with winter approaching, with a pregnant wife \nand a 2-year-old\u0014\n    daughter? Williams eventually struck out on foot, walking south \nthrough January's\u0014\n    bitter cold, until he crossed the Bay Colony's boundaries. For \nfourteen weeks, he\u0014\n    wrote, \"I knew not what neither bed nor bread did mean.\" He \naccepted meager\u0014\n    fare from the Narragansett Indians, whose language he had learned \nand whose\u0014\n    confidence he had won.\u0014\n\u0014\n    At last, Williams came to Narragansett Bay, where he bought some \nland from the natives\u0014\n    and named his settlement Providence, \"in a sense of God's \nmerciful Providence unto me\u0014\n    in my distress.\" And so the colony of Rhode Island was born, one \nopen to those of any\u0014\n    religious persuasion or none.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Another dissenter, Anne Hutchinson, posed an even greater threat \nto Massachusetts\u0014\n    Puritanism. A midwife and member of Boston's congregation, \nHutchinson wanted to take\u0014\n    orthodoxy farther than it was willing to go. Salvation was by \nfaith, not works, all agreed.\u0014\n    But orthodoxy declared that after salvation, good works gave \nevidence of that salvation.\u0014\n    Hutchinson challenged that assumption.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In doing so, Puritan leaders felt she broke the essential bond \nbetween morality and\u0014\n    religion, thereby threatening to undermine the very foundation of \nPuritan society. She was\u0014\n    branded an \"antinomian,\" literally one who is against the law.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Worse, during her trial, Hutchinson admitted to having heard \n\"voices,\" private revelations\u0014\n    beyond the public revelation of the Bible. For Puritans, this was \nthe ultimate presumption\u0014\n    to be so arrogant as to claim that God spoke directly to her. She \nwas denounced as an\u0014\n    enthusiast-literally, one filled with God, or at least proudly \npretending to be.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In 1637 the General Court brought Hutchinson to trial. John \nWinthrop, speaking for the\u0014\n    Court, noted that she had \"spoken diverse things  very \nprejudicial to the honor of the\u0014\n    churches and the ministers thereof.\" Moreover, she had \n\"maintained a meeting and an\u0014\n    assembly  that has been condemned by the General Assembly.\" \nFurthermore, she had\u0014\n    said things and done things not \"comely in the sight of God, nor \nfitting for your sex.\" The\u0014\n    Court concluded, \"She shall be banished out of our liberties and \nimprisoned till she be\u0014\n    sent away.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    With her family and a significant number of supporters, \nHutchinson fled to Rhode Island,\u0014\n    where they continued to worry the authorities in Massachusetts. \nIn 1643, after she and\u0014\n    her family moved to Long Island, a marauding band of Mohawks \nabruptly ended her life.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Waning zeal\u0014\n    As the decades passed, the Puritans' original zeal began to wane. \nMinisters began\u0014\n    preaching a type of sermon, the \"jeremiad,\" in which they \nlamented the loss of\u0014\n    original fervor and exhorted people to amend their ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n       By 1679, ministers felt that God no longer looked with favor \nupon\u0014\n                              New England.\u0014\n\u0014\n    The issue of declining religious fervor came to a head in the \n1660s over the issue of\u0014\n    church membership. Initially, church membership in Massachusetts \nwas limited to those\u0014\n    who had a direct experience of the saving grace of God and who \nappeared before the\u0014\n    church to tell of their wondrous conversion. By the 1660s, \nhowever, many of these\u0014\n    converts' children, who had been baptized as infants, failed to \ntell of such conversions.\u0014\n    Thus they could not be full members allowed to participate in the \nLord's Supper.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Then, these people, though not full members themselves, brought \ntheir children to be\u0014\n    baptized. To accept such a third-generation child for baptism was \nto relax the rigid rules of\u0014\n    membership; on the other hand, to reject such an infant would \nreduce the scope and\u0014\n    influence of the church over a growing society.\u0014\n\u0014\n    After much harsh debate, many churches adopted the so-called \n\"Half-Way Covenant,\"\u0014\n    broadening the parameters of the church to include these \nchildren, but at cost to their\u0014\n    pure principles.\u0014\n\u0014\n    By 1679, Massachusetts ministers were so concerned about \ndeclining faith, they felt that\u0014\n    God had a controversy with his people, that he no longer looked \nwith favor upon New\u0014\n    England. They petitioned the General Court to call a \"Reforming \nSynod.\" There the\u0014\n    ministers testified to Sabbath breaking, \"Sinful Heats and \nHatreds,\" and most of all \"A\u0014\n    public spirit  greatly wanting in most of men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    William Bradford's compact and John Winthrop's sermon seemed, if \nnot forgotten,\u0014\n    certainly forsaken.\u0014\n\u0014\n    When in 1691 the witchcraft episode at Salem erupted, it seemed \nto provide further\u0014\n    evidence that Satan's dominion was enlarging as the face of God \nturned away from New\u0014\n    England.\u0014\n\u0014\n    A generation later, a wave of revivalism gave hope that the \ndecline of Puritanism had been\u0014\n    arrested or even reversed. This Great Awakening of the 1740s, \nrecalling the vision and\u0014\n    zeal of the 1630s, inspired many to confession of sin and godly \nrepentance. But it was\u0014\n    not enough.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Indeed, the Awakening, by dividing the friends of the revival \nfrom its foes, shattered the\u0014\n    unity of the clergy and of the churches. The New England Way, \nwhich had held for more\u0014\n    than a century, would henceforth be a personal option, but no \nlonger a pervading social\u0014\n    norm.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Dr. Edwin S. Gaustad is professor emeritus of history and \nreligion at the University of California\u0014\n    Riverside, and author of A Religious History of America (Harper & \nRow, 1990).\u0014",

It is \nlike an aged man reclining under the shadow of an oak which he has \nplanted.\u0014\nVoltaire\u0014\n\u0014\nIn February 1778, Voltaire returned for the first time in 20 years to \nParis, among other reasons to see the opening of his latest tragedy, \nIrene. The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old, and he \nbelieved he was about to die on 28 February, writing \"I die adoring \nGod, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting \nsuperstition.\" However, he recovered, and in March saw a performance \nof Irene, where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his \ndeathbed have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible \nto establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies \nrelated that he repented and accepted the last rites given by a \nCatholic priest, or that he died under great torment, while his \nadherents told how he was defiant to his last breath..According to \none story, his last words were \"Now is not the time for making new \nenemies.\" It was his response to a priest at the side of his \ndeathbed, asking Voltaire to renounce Satan.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of his well-known criticism of the Church, which he had \nrefused to retract before his death, Voltaire was denied a Christian \nburial, but friends managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of \nScellires in Champagne before this prohibition had been announced. \nHis heart and brain were embalmed separately.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 11 July 1791, the National Assembly of France, which regarded him \nas a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought \nback to Paris to enshrine him in the Panthon. It is estimated that a \nmillion people attended the procession, which stretched throughout \nParis. There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, \nand the music included a piece that Andr Grtry had composed \nspecially for the event, which included a part for the \"tuba curva\" \n(an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but \nrecently revived under a new name.)\u0014\n\u0014\nA widely repeated story that the remains of Voltaire were stolen by \nreligious fanatics in 1814 or 1821 during the Pantheon restoration \nand thrown into a garbage heap is false. Such rumours resulted in the \ncoffin being opened in 1897, which confirmed that his remains were \nstill present.\u0014",

    "words": "from The First Days of Jesus: The Story of the Incarnation by Andreas \nKstenberger and Alexander Stewart.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestioning the Virgin Birth\u0014\n(A fundamentalist view)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew 1:22-23, the Gospel writer interrupts the flow of the \nnarrative in order to comment on how Jesuss unusual supernatural \nconception, issuing in the virgin birth, served as a fulfillment of \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthews first fulfillment quotation comes from Isaiah 7:14. On the \nsurface, it seems like a straightforward fulfillment of prophecy, but \nreaders have raised three main issues that we need to address. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, philosophically, what is the likelihood that Jesus is the \nresult of a virginal conception? Second, theologically, does a virgin \nbirth contradict the Christian belief that Jesus was fully human? \nThird, historically, is Jesuss birth a legitimate fulfillment of \nthis passage in Isaiah? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe first question has to do with the possibility of the miracle \nitself and is easier to address; the second question deals with the \ntheological reason for a virgin birth, while the third question \nconcerns the originally intended meaning of Isaiahs reference to a \nyoung woman conceiving a son.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas It Possible?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only reason to doubt the possibility of the miracle itself would \nbe a prior commitment to philosophical naturalism, that is, the \nbelief that the material world is all that exists and that there is \nno such thing as God or supernatural intervention. From this \nperspective, miracles just dont happen. This worldview assumes that \nscience can explain everything, but such an approach demands more \nfrom science than it can produce. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf one, however, acknowledges the existence of a God powerful enough \nto create all that exists, there remains no reason to doubt that such \na God could intervene in history in this supernatural kind of way. \nThis is indeed the God who is presupposed on every page of the Bible \nand who has been worshiped and served by human beings from the \ncreation of the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nCould a God who spoke the universe with its countless galaxies into \nexistence be unable to cause a virgin to conceive? Although atheists \ncommonly embrace philosophical naturalism, the majority of the \nworlds population finds atheism unsatisfactory. Some things science \ncannot and will never be able to explain. The virgin birth is a \nmiraculous event, and we have no reason to think God could not or did \nnot supernaturally provide what was necessary for Jesus to be fully \nhuman even without the contribution of a human father.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas It Necessary?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo why is the virgin birth theologically important? John Frame \nhelpfully summarizes the main reasons:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe virgin birth is doctrinally important because of: (1) The \ndoctrine of Scripture. If Scripture errs here, then why should we \ntrust its claims about other supernatural events, such as the \nresurrection? (2) The deity of Christ. While we cannot say \ndogmatically that God could enter the world only through a virgin \nbirth, surely the incarnation is a supernatural event if it is \nanything. To eliminate the supernatural from this event is inevitably \nto compromise the divine dimension of it. (3) The humanity of Christ. \nThis was the important thing to Ignatius and the second century \nfathers. Jesus was really born; he really became one of us. (4) The \nsinlessness of Christ. If he were born of two human parents, it is \nvery difficult to conceive how he could have been exempted from the \nguilt of Adams sin and become a new head to the human race. And it \nwould seem only an arbitrary act of God that Jesus could be born \nwithout a sinful nature. Yet Jesus sinlessness as the new head of \nthe human race and as the atoning lamb of God is absolutely vital to \nour salvation (Rom. 5:1819; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; 7:26; 1 Pet. \n2:2224). (5) The nature of grace. The birth of Christ, in which the \ninitiative and power are all of God, is an apt picture of Gods \nsaving grace in general of which it is a part. It teaches us that \nsalvation is by Gods act, not our human effort. [1]\u0014\n\u0014\nViewing the virgin birth as part of Gods initiative in salvation \nreminds us to cast it in a long line of supernatural births. \nReflecting upon our discussion of the seed of the woman from \nGenesis 3:15 in the last chapter, we see that barrenness and other \nobstacles constantly threatened the progression of the seed and that \nGod often intervened supernaturally to ensure the seeds survival. \n(Sarahs conception of Isaac and Rebeccas conception of Jacob and \nEsau come immediately to mind.) \u0014\n\u0014\nJesuss virgin birth thus represents the final and most supernatural \nbirth in the succession of births in fulfillment of Gods promise \nimmediately following the fall in the book of Genesis (Genesis 3:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nIs It a Legitimate Fulfillment of Prophecy?\u0014\n\u0014\nMoving from a theological to a historical question requires a closer \nlook at the original context of Isaiahs reference to the virgin \nconceiving a son in Isaiah 7:14. \u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 740 and 732 BC, Syria and Israel tried to force king Ahaz of \nJudah to join their military coalition against Assyria. When he \nrefused to join their alliance, they invaded with the intention of \ndeposing him and setting up a king in Judah who would join their \nside. Rather than trusting God, Ahaz appealed to Assyria for help. \nAssyria did help but at a very high cost: in essence, Judah became a \nvassal state of Assyria and was forced to pay heavy tribute. This \nseries of events is known as the Syro-Ephraimite War.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of this crisis, the prophet Isaiah came to King Ahaz \nwith a word of encouragement and an invitation to trust God: Be \ncareful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint. . \n. . It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass. . . . If you \nare not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all (Isaiah 7:4a, 7b, \n9b).\u0014\n\u0014\nAhaz, however, doubted God and did not think God would deliver. In \nAhazs mind, his only hope was Assyria. Ahaz refused to trust God or \nreceive a sign of Gods commitment to rescue, and Isaiah responded:\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold the virgin \n[almah] shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name \nImmanuel. He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse \nthe evil and choose the good. For before the boy knows how to refuse \nthe evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will \nbe deserted. (Isaiah 7:1416)\u0014\n\u0014\nGods sign to Ahaz in Isaiah 7:14 likely had an immediate fulfillment \nthat directly related to the original historical situation in the \nSyro-Ephraimite War. The Hebrew word translated virgin, almah, \ndenotes a young woman who in most contexts in the Old Testament was \nalso an unmarried virgin. [2] The young woman could have been a \nmember of the royal family but was more likely the prophetess of \nIsaiah 8:3. Given the flow of the narrative, Isaiahs own son \nprobably fulfilled the prophecy. The parents might easily have given \nthe child two names, particularly when they chose the names \nsymbolically as signs or portents.\u0014\n\u0014\nPointing to Jesus\u0014\n\u0014\nHow does a historical fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiahs day \nrelate to Matthews use of Isaiah 7:14 in Matthew 1:23 to refer to \nJesus? \u0014\n\u0014\nTo answer this question, it is important to look at the birth of one \nmore child in the context following Isaiah 7. Isaiah 9:1-7 is linked \nto the prior prophecies by reference to the birth of a son, but \nunlike the previous passages, the description of the child here \neasily and quickly leads to a picture of one who is more than human \nand will accomplish a deliverance that extends far beyond the \noriginal historical context of the Syro-Ephraimite War. \u0014\n\u0014\nSignificantly, the translators of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek \nin the Intertestamental period translated the Hebrew word almah with \nthe Greek word parthenos, a much more specific term for virgin. \nThis may indicate that even before Jesus was born, Jewish readers \nviewed the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 in light of Isaiah 9:17 and \nthought that the birth of the promised child would be supernaturally \naccomplished in the latter time. Matthew clearly knew the further \nprophecy in Isaiah 9:17, because he later invoked part of this \npassage to describe Jesuss ministry in Galilee in Matthew 4:15-16.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this leads us to interpret Isaiahs reference to the virgin \nconceiving a child in terms of double fulfillment. The prophecy makes \ncomplete sense in its original historical context, but other factors \nwithin the contextthe name Immanuel and the description of the child \nin Isaiah 9:67also point forward in time to the birth of another \nchild. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus was the true and final embodiment of Immanuel, God with us, \nthe one who would sit on the throne of David and over his kingdom, \nto establish it and uphold it with justice and with righteousness \nfrom this time forth and forevermore.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotes: \u0014\n[1] John M. Frame, Virgin Birth of Christ, in Evangelical \nDictionary of Theology, ed. Walter A. Elwell, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, \nMI: Baker Academic, 2001), 124950. \u0014\n[2] The ESV Study Bible expresses this matter well: Although some \nclaim that the word translated virgin (Hb. almah) refers generally \nto a young woman, it actually refers specifically to a \nmaidenthat is, to a young woman who is unmarried and sexually \nchaste, and thus has virginity as one of her characteristics (see \nGen. 24:16, 43; Ex. 2:8, girl).\u0014\n\u0014\nAndreas J.

    "words": "Questions the court should ask the bakers lawyer\u0014\nBrett Younger      Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most famous bakery in Lakewood, Colo., is focusing on birthday \ncakes for a while. In 2012, Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig walked \ninto Masterpiece Cakeshop to purchase a cake for their wedding \nreception. The owner refused to serve them because they are a \nsame-sex couple.\u0014\n\u0014\nJack Phillips lawyers will soon be before the Supreme Court. Their \nargument is that Christians should be allowed to discriminate against \nthose who do not agree with their interpretation of the Bible. \nPhillips is now a favorite of the right-wing for standing up for \nChristian business owners right to say who should be married.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Colorado Civil Rights Commission thinks it would be simpler to \ntreat everyone equally under the law. They argue that acting like a \nbigot is not a right, and that since Phillips shop serves the public \nhe has to serve all the public.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost assume that the Supreme Courts job in this case is to decide if \nreligious beliefs are a license to discriminate, but there is another \nway to look at this. If Phillips is really committed to biblical \nlaws, then he should be committed to all of them. Instead of asking \nif it should be legal to run a heterosexuals only bakery, we should \nask who else a biblical legalist should turn away. Refusing to make \ndevils food cakes for gay couples may not be enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for the weddings of divorced \npeople? Jesus never mentions gay people, but he says, Whoever \ndivorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits \nadultery (Matthew 19:9). If Phillips is claiming a Christian \nexemption from U.S. law, how can the baker enforce shaky \ninterpretations of a few obscure texts and ignore the words of Christ?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for people who are overweight? \nThe glutton shall come to poverty (Proverbs 23:21). Should the \nbakery be encouraging sinful behavior?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for people with tattoos? You \nshall not  tattoo any marks upon you (Leviticus 19:28). Recognizing \ntattooed customers is easier than recognizing gay customers.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for witches? You shall not \npermit a female sorcerer to live (Exodus 22:18). The bakerys order \nform could include the question, Are you a female sorcerer?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for people who work on the \nSabbath? Whoever does any work on [the Sabbath] shall be put to \ndeath (Exodus 35:2). This suggests you should not make a cake for \nthem, though it might be OK if the cake is for a last meal.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Masterpiece Cakeshop make cakes for people who wear jewelry (1 \nTimothy 2:9), own a gun (Isaiah 2:4), or say the Pledge of Allegiance \n(Matthew 5:34-35)?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. \nColorado Civil Rights Commission on Dec. 5. The Court should not let \nprejudiced people use the name Christian as an excuse to act in \nopposition to Gods love. Christians should be the first in line to \nargue for equality for all.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Christians go to court to defend their own bigotry, they should \nbe forced to admit the inconsistency of what they claim to believe. \nCitizens are allowed to have deeply held beliefs that make no sense, \nbut citizens should not get to discriminate.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious freedom is the freedom to worship without fear of \npersecution. Religious freedom is not the freedom to decide who gets \nangel food cake.\u0014",

    "words": "10 Quotes about the Incarnation of Jesus \u0014\n \u0014\nWhat is the incarnation of Jesus? The Lexham Bible Dictionary says \nthat though the term incarnation does not appear in the Bible, \nChristian tradition has long held that Jesus is God incarnate: the \nSecond Person of the Trinity descended from heaven and became human. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a mystery that once a year, come December, believers around the \nworld remember with awethat God would humble himself and become \nflesh through the Holy Spirit (John 1:14).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Christmas, contemplate this mystery through the eyes of 10 \nfellow believers throughout the ages.\u0014\n***\u0014\nThough creation may be a majestic organ of praise, it cannot reach \nthe compass of the golden canticleincarnation! There is more melody \nin Jesus in the manger than in the whole sublime oratorio of the \ncreation. There is more grandeur in the song that heralds the birth \nof the babe of Bethlehem than there is in worlds on worlds rolling in \nsilent grandeur around the throne of the Most High.\u0014\nCharles Spurgeon (18341892)\u0014\n\u0014\nGrace has not a body to appear visibly. Yes, but Christ appeared; and \nwhen he appeared it was as if grace and love had been incarnate, and \ntook a body. So that grace and mercy most of all shines in the \nincarnation of Christ.\u0014\nRichard Sibbes (15771635)\u0014\n \u0014\nThe best of all is, God is with us!\u0014\nJohn Wesley (17031791)\u0014\n\u0014\nTo you who were a castaway, banished from the realms of paradise, \ndying of your weary exile, reduced to dust and ashes, without further \nhope of living, by the incarnation of the Word was given the power to \nreturn from afar to your maker, to recognize your parentage, to \nbecome free after slavery, to be promoted from being an outcast to \nsonship: so that you who were born of corruptible flesh may be reborn \nby the Spirit of God and obtain through grace what you had not by \nnature, and, if you acknowledge yourself the son of God by the spirit \nof adoption, dare to call God Father.\u0014\nLeo the Great (ca. 400461)\u0014\n\u0014\nWe must never forget that though our Lord was God and man at the same \ntime, the divine and human natures in him were never confounded. One \nnature did not swallow up the other. The two natures remained perfect \nand distinct. The divinity of Christ was never for a moment laid \naside, although veiled. The manhood of Christ, during his lifetime, \nwas never for a moment unlike our own, though by union with the \nGodhead, greatly dignified. Though perfect God, Christ has always \nbeen perfect man from the first moment of his incarnation. He that is \ngone into heaven and is sitting at the Fathers right hand to \nintercede for sinners is man as well as God.\u0014\nJ. C. Ryle (18161900)\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was he who created the worlds; it was he who interposed of old \ntime in the affairs of the world and showed himself to be a living \nand observant God, whether men thought of him or not. Yet this great \nGod condescended to come down on earth from his heavenly throne and \nto be born into his own world; showing himself as the Son of God in a \nnew and second sense, in a created nature, as well as in his eternal \nsubstance.\u0014\nJohn Henry Newman (18011890)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis only-begotten Son of God for our sins came down from heaven upon \nearth and took upon him this human nature of like passions with us \nand was begotten of the holy virgin and of the Holy Ghost, and was \nmade man, not in seeming and mere show, but in truth; nor yet by \npassing through the virgin as through a channel; but was of her made \ntruly flesh, and truly nourished with milk, and did truly eat as we \ndo, and truly drink as we do. For if the incarnation was a phantom, \nsalvation is a phantom also.\u0014\nCyril of Jerusalem (ca. 315386)\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was not only a distance between us and God by reason of \nimpurity but a difference by reason of enmity. God is a God of \nglorious majesty, and we are poor creatures; God is a God of pure and \nimmaculate holiness, and we are sinful creatures, lapsed and fallen \nunder the guilt of sin, and deserving of punishment. There was our \ngreat trouble and grievance, and nothing comfortable could we expect \nfrom him. But when God is willing to come among us, and take our \nnature, and die for a sinful world, there is a foundation laid for \nhis being with us, to help us, and bless us upon all occasions.\u0014\nThomas Manton (16201677)\u0014\n\u0014\nJoin, all you joyful nations,\u0014\nThe acclaiming host of heaven!\u0014\nThis happy morn\u0014\nA Child is born,\u0014\nTo us a Son is given:\u0014\nThe messenger and token\u0014\nOf Gods eternal favor,\u0014\nGod has sent down\u0014\nTo us his Son,\u0014\nA universal Savior!\u0014\nCharles Wesley (17071788)\u0014\n\u0014\nGod would have his eternal, his only-begotten Son to be incarnate, to \ntake our nature on himto be made man. What is his design in this \nincomprehensible work of his wisdom, love, and power? Indeed, in the \nfirst place, it was for the redemption of the Church, by the \nsacrifice of himself and other acts of his mediation. But there is \nthat which is more general and comprehensive, and wherein all the \nconcerns of the glory of God do center. And this was that he might \ngather all things into one in himthat the whole creation, especially \nthat which was to be eternally blessed, should have a new head given \nunto it, for its sustenance, preservation, order, honor, and safety.\u0014\nJohn Owen (16161683)\u0014",

    "title": "QUIRINUS, BISHOP OF SISCIA DROWNED FOR HIS FAITH",
    "words": "In the early fourth century, when Quirinus, bishop of Siscia (in \nmodern Croatia), learned that Maximus, the local magistrate, had \nordered his arrest, he fled town. Maximuss men overtook him and \nbrought him before the magistrate. Maximus asked him why he fled. \nQuirinus replied that Jesus had ordered his disciples When they \npersecute you in one town, fly to the next.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaximuss interest in Quirinus was not arbitrary. Emperor Diocletian, \nat the instigation of his co-ruler Galerius, had cracked down on \nChristian leaders throughout the Roman Empire. They hoped that by \ncutting off Christian leadership the church would crumble. In \ncompliance with the imperial order, Maximus now commanded Quirinus to \nsacrifice to the Roman gods.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuirinus refused: \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be a sacrilege. The gods whom you serve are nothing. My God, \nwhom I serve, is in heaven and earth, and in the seas and everywhere; \nbut He is higher than all because He contains all things in Himself; \nall things were created by Him, and by Him alone do they subsist. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe magistrate threatened torture. Quirinus replied that torture \nwould be more a matter for glory than for grief. And so Maximus had \nhim beaten, promising to make him a priest of Jupiter if he would \nrenounce Christ. But the bishop responded that he was already acting \nas a priest by offering the sacrifice of suffering to God: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I scarce feel my torments, and am ready to suffer still greater, \nthat my example may show those whom God has committed to my care the \nway to the glory we wish for.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nImprisoned, Quirinus converted some of his guards. So he was sent to \nAmantius, the nearest governor, who could carry out a sentence of \ndeath. Amantius loaded him with chains and exhibited him in towns \nwhere crowds mocked and jeered at the old man.\u0014\n\u0014\nEventually he brought Quirinus to his (the governors) residence at \nSabaria (in modern Poland). After reading the transcript of \nQuirinuss trial before Maximus, Amantius asked if it was correct. \nQuirinus said it was. I have confessed the true God at Siscia, I \nhave never worshiped any other. Him I carry in my heart and no man \nshall succeed in separating me from Him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmantius ordered the bishop drowned. On this day, 4 June 308 (or \n309), executioners tied a stone around Quirinuss neck and dumped him \ninto the River Raab (known as the Rba today). Quirinus did not sink \nat once, but preached and prayed as he drifted downstream. His final \nprayer was,\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is no new thing, O all-powerful Jesus! for thee to stop the \ncourse of rivers, or to cause a man to walk upon the water, as thou \ndidst thy servant Peter: the people have already seen the proof of \nthy power in me; grant me now to lay down my life for thy sake, O my \nGod!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians buried Quirinus. He was mentioned in various old texts and \nmartyr lists, and the Roman Christian poet Prudentius (348c. 413) \nwrote a hymn in his honor. LEGENDS said his stone floated until his \nfinal prayer and that he sat on it while he preached.\u0014\n\u0014\nJUNE 4, 308\u0014\n\u0014\nQuirinus, bishop of Siscia, after imprisonment, tortures, and mockery \nis drowned in a river (in the region that will become Poland) where \nhe preaches until he sinks.\u0014",

    "title": "QUESTIONS ABOUT \"THE PASSION\"",
    "words": "Questions About The Passion\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Ewing Roberts\u0014\n02-20-04 \u0014\n\u0014\nSince I havent seen Mel Gibsons \"The Passion of the Christ,\" I can \nonly ask questions. I have lots of them:\u0014\n\u0014\n--Does it honor Jesus or exploit Jesus? \u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Niebuhr in his critique of liberalism wrote, \"A God without \nwrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through \nthe ministrations of a Christ without a Cross.\" Do we have here a \nChrist on a cross who will bring convicted sinners into the kingdom, \nor do we have a Passion that will leave viewers devastated by guilt, \nshame and pity?\u0014\n\u0014\n--What is Mel Gibsons point of view? \u0014\n\u0014\nTo transfer the gospel to any other medium--be it a Passion play, \nfilm or sermonrequires a point of view that controls artistic or \nhomiletical decisions. What is Gibsons? He told Diane Sawyer on \nABCs \"Primetime Live\" that Jesus was \"beaten for our iniquities.\" A \nHebrew scholar tells me the text of Isaiah 53:5 does not support this \ntranslation, but it may explain Gibsons concentration on violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe film's theology apparently is based on a penal substitution view \nof the atonement. Does any one atonement theology do justice to the \nfull, rich meaning of the death of Jesus?\u0014\n\u0014\n--What about the violence? \u0014\n\u0014\nWords from two old hymns inform my reaction to film clips I have \nseen. \"I love to tell the story of Jesus and his love,\" not \"of Jesus \nand his flogging.\" \"Teach me the slow of heart to move by some clear \nwinning word of love,\" not by spattering blood. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut after seeing the film, will I have feelings like those of Morris \nChapman, president and CEO of the Southern Baptist Executive \nCommittee. He told Baptist Press: \"I have been unable to erase from \nmy mind the scene of the beating given Jesus by Roman guards. It was \ngruesome. It jarred my sensibilities. The sight of Jesus' back after \nthe cat of nine tails had torn bit by bit into His flesh was almost \nunbearable. It was so real I was almost certain the audience around \nme had given a collective gasp, sinking into their seats, shrinking \nfrom the horror of such excruciating pain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do Gibsons violent images compare with others in Christian art, \nhymns and devotional literature? Does he isolate or contextualize the \nviolence? In an effort to put in context the films violence The \nWorship Leader Magazine tried to distinguish various types of \nviolence in the media: suggestive violence, gratuitous violence, \nfictive violence, realism, virtual violence and comic violence. This \nlist omits sado-masochistic violence, pornographic violence and the \nviolence that sears the spirit and leaves an indelible impression.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scourging and crucifixion were horribly violent, but does Gibson \nhonor or inflate the gospel account? Matthew, Mark and John devote \nonly one verse to the scourging of Jesus; Luke does not mention it. \nCarrying the cross to Golgotha occupies one verse in Matthew, Mark \nand John, and just six in Luke. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Gospels never mention a single fall by Jesus, he falls \nmany times in Gibsons version. Again his interview with Diane Sawyer \nis revealing. After her comment on his \"choreography of pain,\" Gibson \nspoke proudly of the way he filmed Jesus falling \"almost like a \nballeta lyrical fall.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n--What about the charges of anti-Semitism? \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Foxman, head of the Anti-Defamation League and author of \nNever Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism, knows anti-Semitism \nwhen he sees it. He says the movie is not anti-Semitic, but that it \n\"has the potential to fuel anti-Semitism, to reinforce it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the urging of critics Gibson did remove the sub-title translation \nof the chilling blood curse from Matthew 27:25: \"His blood be upon us \nand upon our children.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of his claims that the film is not anti-Semitic Gibson does \nnot seem to understand the painful Jewish experience history of \nPassion plays and Good Friday observances.\u0014\n\u0014\nGibson needs a consciousness-raising on anti-Semitism similar to the \nmoment in his film.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What Women Want.\" Gibson plays a womanizing playboy. Then an \naccident with a hair dryer and a bathtub shocks him into a state \nwhere he can hear what women think and want. I do not want Gibson to \nbe zapped, but I would welcome a similar transformation on this point.\u0014\n\u0014\n--Is the film true to the Gospels? \u0014\n\u0014\nGibson claims it is, but some viewers report that he draws on the \n19th century German mystic and nun, Ann Katherine Emmerich, author of \nThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. She is the source of \nthe scene in which Jews, not Romans, make the cross in the court of \nthe Jewish high priest, of all places. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are reports of other non-biblical moments. Jesus is pushed off \na bridge and kept by his chains from hitting the stream. Pilates \nwife and Jesus mother have a meeting.\u0014\n\u0014\n--What effect will the film have on interreligious relations? \u0014\n\u0014\nWill the film set Jewish-Christian relations back 30 years or more? \nOr will it present an opportunity to learn more about what both \nunites and divides us. Rabbi Charles Aria of Baltimores Institute \nfor Christian and Jewish Studies writes, \"If Jews and Christians use \nThe Passion as a springboard for deepening our conversations, this \ncontroversy in the end can help us to provide good news for both \ncommunities.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat impact will \"The Passion of the Christ\" have on Protestant and \nCatholic relations? Evangelicals are working closely with a \npre-Vatican II Catholic, a remarkable union when many of them would \nagree with Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological \nSeminary in Louisville, Ky. He said recently on CNN's Larry King \nShow, \"I believe the Roman Church is a false church and teaches a \nfalse gospel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGibson has taken conflicting theological positions, neither of which \nwill please evangelicals. When the Herald Sun in Australia asked the \nstar if Protestants are denied eternal salvation, he answered \"There \nis no salvation for those outside the Church.\" But later Gibson \nseemed to embrace universalism when he told Diane Sawyer: \"Its \npossible for people who are not even Christians to get into the \nkingdom of heaven. Its just an easier ride where I am.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n--Where can we get good background on the film? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Institute of Christian and Jewish Studies Web site has many \nresources. Shanta Premawardhana, longtime Baptist pastor in Chicago \nand now associate general secretary for interfaith relations at the \nNational Council of Churches, has prepared a free bulletin insert at \nthe NCCs Web site.\u0014\n\u0014\n--What is the best we hope for from the film? \u0014\n\u0014\nThat not a single Jew will be insulted or harmed in any way because \nof it; that no one of any faith or no faith will suffer emotional \ndamage from its heavy dosage of violence; that Christians will deal \ncarefully with the films theological issues and its evangelistic \npotentiality; and that all viewers will leave the theater resolved in \nthe words of the Hebrew prophet Micah, \"to do justice, love kindness, \nand walk humbly with our God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Ewing Roberts is associate scholar at the Institute for \nChristian and Jewish Studies and pastor emeritus at Woodbrook Baptist \nChurch in Baltimore.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso see:\u0014\n\u0014\nResources on Mel Gibsons Upcoming The Passion\u0014\nEvangelical Leader Hopes Web Site Will Prompt Passion Postscript\u0014\nNCC Offers Guide for Reflecting on The Passion\u0014\nGibson Discusses The Passion on Primetime\u0014\nGibson Says Episcopalian Wife Might Go to Hell, Column Reports\u0014\nBGCT Theater Ad Plays Off Gibsons Passion Controversy\u0014\nThe Passion Outreach\u0014\nGibsons Passion Will Open Wide\u0014",

The reality is that we must \nfind peace through strength. . . . \"I urge you to beware the \ntemptation of pride, the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves \nabove it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the \nfacts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to \nsimply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove \nyourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil. \n... \"I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in \nhuman history whose last pages even now are being written.\" Speech to \nthe National Association of Evangelicals, March 1983 (He wrote six \nyears later that \"I could not in good conscience today call the \nSoviet Union an evil empire.\")\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and \nEastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate . \n. . open this gate . . . tear down this wall.\" June 1987 speech at \nBrandenberg Gate in Berlin. Remarks addressed to Soviet leader \nMikhail Gorbachev\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, \nfaith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would \ngrant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next.

    "words": "Quotations Track Churchs Anti-Woman Legacy\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel De La Torre\u0014\n02-25-05\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not giving permission for a woman to teach or to tell a man \nwhat to do. A woman ought not to speak, because Adam was formed first \nand Eve afterwards, and it was not Adam who was led astray but the \nwoman who was led astray and fell into sin. Nevertheless, she will be \nsaved by childbearing (1 Ti 2:12-15).\u0014\n\u0014\nClement of Alexandria (150?-215?): Every woman should be filled with \nshame by the thought that she is a woman.\u0014\n\u0014\n Tertullian (160?-220?): Woman is a temple built over a sewer, the \ngateway to the devil. Woman, you are the devils doorway. You led \nastray one whom the devil would not dare attack directly. It was your \nfault that the Son of God had to die; you should always go in \nmourning and rags.\u0014\n\u0014\n Ambrose (339-97): Adam was deceived by Eve, not Eve by Adam. It is \nright that he whom that woman induced to sin should assume the role \nof guide lest he fall again through feminine instability.\u0014\n\u0014\n Jerome (345?-420): If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, \nthen it is bad for him to touch one, for bad, and bad only, is the \nopposite of good.\u0014\n\u0014\n John Chrysostom (349-407): Amongst all the savage beasts none is \nfound so harmful as woman.\u0014\n\u0014\n Augustine (354-430): Woman was merely mans helpmate, a function \nwhich pertains to her alone. She is not the image of God but as far \nas man is concerned, he is by himself the image of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n ________: Nothing is so powerful in drawing the spirit of a man \ndownwards as the caresses of a woman.\u0014\nPope Gregory I (540-604): Woman is slow in understanding and her \nunstable and naive mind renders her by way of natural weakness to the \nnecessity of a strong hand in her husband. Her use is two fold; \nanimal sex and motherhood.\u0014\n\u0014\n John Damascene (645-750): Woman is a sick she-ass ... a hideous \ntapeworm ... the advance post of hell.\u0014\n\u0014\n Thomas Aquinas (1225-74): [Woman] was made only to assist with \nprocreation.\u0014\n\u0014\n ________: Such is the subjection in which woman is by nature \nsubordinate to man, because the power of rational discernment is by \nnature stronger in man.\u0014\n\u0014\n ________: Woman is [a] defective and misbegotten male [probably \ndefected due to] some external influence, such as that of a south \nwind, which is moist.\u0014\n\u0014\n Malleus Maleficarum (1486): When a woman thinks alone, she thinks \nevil.... They are feebler both in mind and body. It is but surprising \nthat they should come more under the spell of witchcraft.\u0014\n\u0014\n Martin Luther (1483-1546): Women should stay at home, keep house \nand bear children. If a woman dies from childbearing, let her die. \nThat is all she is here for.\u0014\n\u0014\n ________: The word and works of God is quite clear, that women were \nmade either to be wives or prostitutes.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Calvin (1509-64): Thus the woman, who had perversely exceeded \nher proper bounds, is forced back to her own position. She had, \nindeed, previously been subject to her husband, but that was a \nliberal and gentle subjection; now, however, she is cast into \nservitude.\u0014\n\u0014\n________: Woman, by nature (that is, by the ordinary law of God) is \nformed to obey; for the government of women has always been regarded \nby all wise persons as a monstrous thing, and therefore, so to speak, \nit will be a mingling of heaven and earth, if women usurp the right \nto teach.\u0014\n\u0014\n John Knox (1513-72): Woman was made for only one reason, to serve \nand obey man.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wesley (1703-91): Wife: Be content to be insignificant. What \nloss would it be to God or man had you never been born.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist Convention (1998): A wife is to submit herself \ngraciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the \nchurch willingly submits to the headship of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n SBC (2000): While both men and women are gifted for service in the \nchurch, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by \nScripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel A. De La Torre (today): Why would a smart, gifted woman be \nattracted to a Christianity defined by men attempting to preserve and \njustify their patriarchal authority?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow might our faith have developed differently if the church had \nchosen instead to take St. Paul at his word that in Christ Jesus \nthere is neither male nor female?\u0014\n\u0014\nMiguel De La Torre, a Cuban American, is professor of theologies of \nliberation at Hope College in Holland, Mich. He is a graduate of \nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary and a former Baptist pastor in \nKentucky. His column also appears in the Holland Sentinel.\u0014",

    "words": "From Biblical Archaeology, May/June, 2006, p. 24\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestion Authority!\u0014\n\u0014\n         MICHAEL D. COOGAN\u0014\n\u0014\n         BEWARE OF AN ARGUMENT BASED ON AUTHORITY.\u0014\n         In the interrelated disciplines of Biblical archaeology and \u0014\n         Biblical studies, as well as in contemporary\u0014\n         social debates, the argument from authority is often\u0014\n         used to make a weak argument. Dont accept it\u0014\n         without looking behind (or under) it.\u0014\n\u0014\n          For example, the Bible says that under Joshuas\u0014\n         leadership Jericho fell to the Israelites (Joshua\u0014\n         6). In the 1930s the British archaeologist Sir John\u0014\n         Garstang, excavating at Tell es-Sultan (Old Testa-\u0014\n         ment Jericho), asserted that he had found evidence\u0014\n         for Joshuas destruction of Jericho in the ruins of\u0014\n         the citys fortifications, which he dated to about\u0014\n         1400 B.C.E. So, he concluded, the Bible was right:\u0014\n         \u0014\n             In a word, in all material details and in date the\u0014\n             fall of Jericho took place as described in the\u0014\n             Biblical narrative...The link with Joshua and the\u0014\n             Israelites is only circumstantial but it seems to be\u0014\n             solid and without a flaw.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Garstangs conclusion is still quoted over and over\u0014\n         again in sermons and in blogs, and even in some\u0014\n         scholarly books: The Bible is true, and a distin-\u0014\n         guished archaeologist proved it! Unfortunately,\u0014\n         Garstangs knowledge of stratigraphic excavation\u0014\n         and ceramic chronology (the dating of strata by\u0014\n         the pottery found in them) was not very advanced,\u0014\n         even for his time. In the 1950s, Dame Kathleen\u0014\n         Kenyon redug at Tell es-Sultan and corrected\u0014\n         Garstangs dates. The ruined walls that he had\u0014\n         dated to the 15th century were in fact over a thou-\u0014\n         sand years earlier, long before Joshuas time, when-\u0014\n         ever that was.2 Yet Garstang continues to be cited,\u0014\n         not because of the merits of his arguments, but\u0014\n         because of the weight of his eminence (enhanced\u0014\n         by his having been knighted), especially when his\u0014\n         views about the Bibles veracity are shared by those\u0014\n         quoting him. The same cautionary attitude applies\u0014\n         to the interpretation of the Bible more generally.\u0014\n         Knowledge increases, interpretations change. Bibli-\u0014\n         cal interpretation is a conversation, a debate, that\u0014\n         has been going on for millennia, and one often\u0014\n         learns most from those with whom one disagrees.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Bible says is often regarded as decisive in\u0014\n         contemporary debates about such issues as abortion,\u0014\n         assisted suicide, the status of women, same-sex rela-\u0014\n         tionships, capital punishment and war and peace.\u0014\n         The problem is that the Bible is often inconsistent,\u0014\n         so much so that Shakespeare observed, even the\u0014\n         Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose (Merchant\u0014\n         of Venice I.iii). No individual believer or community\u0014\n         of faith has ever fully followed every Biblical teach-\u0014\n         ing because the Bible does not speak with one voice.\u0014\n         It incorporates many different views of different\u0014\n         Biblical writers. In the Ten Commandments, God\u0014\n         (or is it Moses, or a later Biblical writer or editor?)\u0014\n         proclaims that he punishes children for the sins\u0014\n         of their parents to the third and fourth generation\u0014\n         (Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 5:9). That would seem\u0014\n         to be an unequivocal statement, especially because,\u0014\n         we are told, God does not change his mind the way\u0014\n         human beings do: God is not a human being, that\u0014\n         he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change\u0014\n         his mind (Numbers 23:19). Yet Jeremiah emphati-\u0014\n         cally disagrees: All shall die for their own sins\u0014\n         (Jeremiah 31:30), as does Ezekiel: A child shall not\u0014\n         suffer for the iniquity of a parent, nor a parent suf-\u0014\n         fer for the iniquity of a child (Ezekiel 18:20). Both\u0014\n         prophets concur that God punishes only the person\u0014\n         who sins. That would seem to be an obvious prin-\u0014\n         ciple of justice, yet it is not accepted as such in the\u0014\n         Decalogue. Given such multiplicity of views, it is not\u0014\n         surprising that both sides in debates on social issues\u0014\n         often enlist the Bible to support their positions.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Whether it concerns the Bible itself or the inter-\u0014\n         pretation of the Bible or of archaeological data,\u0014\n         there is almost always more than one perspective.\u0014\n         Professors, preachers and bloggers who cite only the\u0014\n         authorities that support their own presuppositions\u0014\n         mislead their audiences. Just because something is\u0014\n         written on your computer screen, in a book, in the\u0014\n         Bible or even in this magazine doesnt mean that its\u0014\n         the only possible view or even that its trtie. As one\u0014\n         eminent Jewish Christian authority put it, Judge\u0014\n         for yourselves! (1 Corinthians 11:13).\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Michael D.

    "title": "QUESTIONS ABOUT HELL",
    "words": "Papers like this help to make teaching fun!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following is an actual question given on a Purdue University \nchemistry mid-term. The answer by one student was so \"profound\" that \nthe professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, \nof course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well:\u0014\n\u0014\nBonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or \nendothermic(absorbs heat)?\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's \nLaw(gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or \nsome variant.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne student, however, wrote the following:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, \nwe need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the \nrate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume \nthat once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering \nHell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world \ntoday. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of \ntheir religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of \nthese religions and since people do not belong to more than one \nreligion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of \nsouls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of \nchange of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order \nfor the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume \nof Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis gives two possibilities:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls \nenter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase \nuntil all Hell breaks loose.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls \nin Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell \nfreezes over.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa \nduring my Freshman year that, \"It will be a cold day in Hell before I \nsleep with you,\" and take into account the fact that I slept with her \nlast night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that \nHell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this \ntheory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not \naccepting any more souls and is, therefore, extinct ... leaving only \nHeaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which \nexplains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting \"Oh, my God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTHIS STUDENT RECEIVED THE ONLY \"A\"\u0014",

    "words": "Questions About a Rising Suicide Rate\u0014\nPublished: September 7, 2007, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nA sharp jump in suicide rates among young Americans has left \nresearchers puzzled as to the cause and wondering what lessons to \ndraw from it. Some researchers are even suggesting that regulatory \nwarnings about the safety of antidepressant drugs might have \ntriggered the problem, leading doctors and their patients to shun \npotentially life-saving medications.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new findings on suicide rates among 10- to 24-year-olds, reported \nyesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are a \nstartling reversal. From 1990 to 2003, the rate fell by more than 28 \npercent, from 9.48 to 6.78 suicides per 100,000 young people. From \n2003 to 2004, the rate jumped back up to 7.32 per 100,000, an \nincrease of 8 percent, the largest single-year rise in 15 years. \nWhether this is a short-lived increase or the start of a long-term \nupward trend is not yet clear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most provocative interpretation is that the upsurge was \ninadvertently caused by regulatory warnings. An article published in \nthe American Journal of Psychiatry this week argued that, after \nAmerican and European regulators issued warnings that antidepressants \nmight increase the risk of suicide in young people, there was a \ndecrease in antidepressant prescriptions for children and adolescents \nin the United States and the Netherlands  and an increase in suicide \nrates among youngsters in both countries. The article acknowledges \nthat there was only a small decrease in prescription rates in this \ncountry but speculates that some of the most vulnerable youths may \nhave been left untreated.\u0014",

To many adults, children are just a nuisance. But the \npoint is that they're a nuisance (if they are) because they matter. \nThey disturb our organized adult world because they are real people.\u0014\nN. T. Wright, Matthew for Everyone: Part Two\u0014\n\u0014\nBLESSED are those who number babies and animals among their friends; \nin their embodied innocence, such small creatures keep us simple.\u0014\nMargaret Guenther, Holy Listening: The Art of Spiritual Direction\u0014\n\u0014\n[THE ONLY OBSERVATIONS worth making are those that sink in upon you \nin childhood. We don't know we're observing, but we see everything. \nOur minds are relatively blank, our memories are not crammed full of \nall sorts of names, so that the impressions we gather in the first \ntwelve years are enormous and vivid and meaningfulthey come laden \nwith meaning, in a way that experience does not later on.\u0014\nJohn Updike, interview with Philip Yancey in Image journal\u0014\n\u0014\nIT SHOULD BE NOTED that children at play are not playing about; their \ngames should be seen as their most serious-minded activity.\u0014\nMichel de Montaigne, Essays\u0014\n\u0014\nALL MEMBERS of the congregation share in the responsibility of \neducating and nurturing children.  Christian education of children \ndepends upon adults who actively and intentionally mentor children in \npractices of faith, and upon the ability of children to have access \nto and participate in the community's practices.\u0014\nJoyce Ann Mercer, Welcoming Children\u0014\n\u0014\n\"CHILDREN aren't coloring books. You don't get to fill them with your \nfavorite colors.\"\u0014\nKhaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner\u0014\n\u0014\nWE GAZE at the future through the window of our children; how we \nshape them shapes the future. And they will be shaped, by the world \nif not by us. Each small face harbors the same question, unanswered \nby self-help books and talk shows.  Who am I and why am I here?\u0014\nSallie Tisdale, \"Grace,\" in God Is Love: Essays from Portland Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN WE HAVE CHILDREN, we know they will need us, and maybe love us, \nbut we don't have a clue how hard it is going to be. We also can't \nunderstand when we're pregnant, or when our relatives are expecting, \nhow profound and dicey it is to have a shared history with a child, \nshared blood, shared genes, even humor. It means we were actually \nhere, on earth, for a time, like the Egyptians with their pyramids, \nbut with kids, it's an experiment: you wait and see what will come of \nit, and with people, that almost always means a mess.\u0014\nAnne Lamott, Grace (Eventually): Thoughts on Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nBIRD LEAVES the nest, child leaves the home / It's so hard, this \nletting go.\u0014\nLori Lieberman, \"Letting Go\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2008 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Rather be openhanded and \nfreely lend him whatever he needs.  Be careful not to harbor this \nwicked thought: The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is \nnear, so that you do not show your needy brother and give him \nnothing.  He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be \nfound guilty of sin.

And that total surrender is obedience.  If I \nbelong to God, if I belong to Christ, then he must be able to use \nme.  That is obedience.  Then we give wholehearted service to the \npoor.  That is service.  They complete each other.

Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest \nnot what evil shall be upon the earth\u0014\nEccl 11:12, (KJV)\u0014\n\u0014\nLove of brother means voluntary poverty... It also means \nnonparticipation in those comforts and luxuries which have been \nmanufactured by the exploitation of others.... If our jobs do not \ncontribute to the common good, we pray God for the grace to give them \nup... this would exclude jobs in advertising, which only increases \npeoples useless desires, and in insurance companies and banks, which \nare known to exploit the poor in this country and others.

Kauffman | posted 6/30/2008\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nONE OF the oldest of human needs is having someone to wonder where \nyou are when you don't come home at night.\u0014\nMargaret Mead\u0014\n\u0014\nHOME IS the place where, when you have to go there,\u0014\nThey have to take you in.\u0014\nI should have called it\u0014\nSomething you somehow haven't to deserve.\u0014\nRobert Frost, from \"The Death of the Hired Man\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSOMEHOW each self needs a \"place\" in order to be a self, in order to \nfeel on a deep level that it really exists. We are, apparently, \nrootless beings at bottom. Unless we can establish roots somewhere in \na place where we are at home, which we possess to ourselves and where \nour things are, we feel that we float, that we are barely there at \nall.\u0014\nLangdon Gilkey, Shantung Compound\u0014\n\u0014\nHOME has to do with where one senses one belongs, where one's roots \nare, where one's being can thrive. There is nothing worse than a \nfeeling of homelessnessof not being able to find home.\u0014\nJohn Killinger, 365 Simple Gifts from God\u0014\n\u0014\nREAL ESTATE ADS offer houses for sale, not homes. A house is a \ngarment easily put off or on, casually bought and sold; a home is \nskin. Merely change houses and you will be disoriented; change homes \nand you bleed. When the shell you live in has taken on the savor of \nyour love, when your dwelling has become a taproot, then your house \nis a home.\u0014\nScott Russell Sanders, Staying Put\u0014\n\u0014\nBECAUSE home will always be here  it is in your shoe wherever you go.\u0014\nBarbara Stafford-Wilson, at Graywolfpress.org\u0014\n\u0014\nWHEN A MAN leaves home, he leaves behind some scrap of his heart.\u0014\nFrederick Buechner, Godric\u0014\n\u0014\nWE SLEEP to time's hurdy-gurdy; we wake, if we ever wake, to the \nsilence of God. And then, when we wake to the deep shores of time \nuncreated, then when the dazzling dark breaks over the far slopes of \ntime, then it's time to toss things, like our reason, and our will; \nthen it's time to break our necks for home.\u0014\nAnnie Dillard, Holy the Firm\u0014\n\u0014\nWE CAN NEVER go home again. Nor can we ever forget or stop longing. \nAllen Wheelis, The Way We Are\u0014\n\u0014\nA MAN TRAVELS the world over in search of what he needs, and returns \nhome to find it.\u0014\nGeorge Moore, The Brook Kerith\u0014\n\u0014\nALMIGHTY GOD, our heavenly Father, who settest the solitary in \nfamilies: We commend to thy continual care the homes in which thy \npeople dwell.  Turn the hearts of the parents to the children, and \nthe hearts of the children to the parents; and so enkindle fervent \ncharity among us all, that we may evermore be kindly affectioned to \none another; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\u0014\nThe Book of Common Prayer\u0014",

It embraces everything.\u0014\nIt is ethics. It is honor.\u0014\nEmily Post\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I do good, I feel good; when I do bad, I feel bad.\u0014\nThats my religion.\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln\u0014\n\u0014\nNon-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the\u0014\ngoal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other\u0014\nliving beings, we are still savages.\u0014\nThomas Alva Edison\u0014\n\u0014\nNever let your sense of morals get in the way of doing\u0014\nwhats right.\u0014\nIsaac Asimov\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good ended happily and the bad unhappily. That is\u0014\nwhat fiction means.\u0014\nOscar Wilde in The Importance of Being Earnest\u0014\n\u0014\nWe ought always to deal justly, not only with those who\u0014\nare just to us, but likewise to those who endeavor to\u0014\ninjure us; and this, for fear lest by rendering them evil\u0014\nfor evil, we should fall into the same vice.\u0014\nHierocles\u0014\n\u0014\nGood people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly,\u0014\nwhile bad people will find a way around the laws.\u0014\nPlato\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main object of conciliation lies in reaching a solution\u0014\nto a case based upon morals and with a warm\u0014\nheart.\u0014\nConfucius\u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the following. We humans are social beings.\u0014\nWe come into the world as the result of others actions.\u0014\nWe survive here in dependence on others. Whether we\u0014\nlike it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives\u0014\nwhen we do not benefit from others activities. For this\u0014\nreason it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness\u0014\narises in the context of our relationships with others.\u0014\nNor is it so remarkable that our greatest joy should\u0014\ncome when we are motivated by concern for others. But\u0014\nthat is not all. We find that not only do altruistic\u0014\nactions bring about happiness but they also lessen our\u0014\nexperience of suffering. Here I am not suggesting that\u0014\nthe individual whose actions are motivated by the wish\u0014\nto bring others happiness necessarily meets with less\u0014\nmisfortune than the one who does not. Sickness, old\u0014\nage, mishaps of one sort or another are the same for us\u0014\nall. But the sufferings which undermine our internal\u0014\npeace, anxiety, doubt, disappointment these things are\u0014\ndefinitely less. In our concern for others, we worry less\u0014\nabout ourselves.When we worry less about ourselves an\u0014\nexperience of our own suffering is less intense.\u0014\nWhat does this tell us? Firstly, because our every action\u0014\nhas a universal dimension, a potential impact on others\u0014\nhappiness, ethics are necessary as a means to ensure that\u0014\nwe do not harm others. Secondly, it tells us that genuine\u0014\nhappiness consists in those spiritual qualities of\u0014\nlove, compassion, patience, tolerance and forgiveness\u0014\nand so on. For it is these which provide both for our\u0014\nhappiness and others happiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama\u0014\nin Ethics for a New Millennium\u0014\n\u0014\nIn law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others.\u0014\nIn ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.\u0014\nImmanuel Kant\u0014\n\u0014\nTheft, incest, infanticide, patricide, have all had a place\u0014\namong virtuous actions. Can anything be more ridiculous\u0014\nthan that a man should have the right to kill me\u0014\nbecause he lives on the other side of the water, and\u0014\nbecause his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have\u0014\nnone with him?\u0014\nBlaise Pascal\u0014\n\u0014\nNo one ever became extremely wicked suddenly.\u0014\nJuvenal\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there are going to be people out there making war on\u0014\nother people, dont you think its a good idea for some\u0014\nof those people to at least follow a code of ethics? Not\u0014\nhonor but something you can pin down and be sure\u0014\nof, something with the same rules for everybody.\u0014\nMercedes Lackey\u0014\n\u0014\nA people that values its privileges above its principles\u0014\nsoon loses both.\u0014\nDwight D.

    "words": "Evil being the root of mystery, pain is the root of knowledge. \u0014\nSimone Weil, First and Last Notebooks \u0014\n\u0014\nEven as false is found with true, so is evil mingled with good, on \naccount of the great variety of these matters of action, wherein good \nis often hindered by evil, and evil has the appearance of good. \u0014\nThomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae \u0014\n\u0014\nEvil is neither suffering nor sin; it is both at the same time, it is \nsomething common to them both. For they are linked together; sin \nmakes us suffer and suffering makes us evil, and this indissoluable \ncomplex of suffering and sin is the evil in which we are submerged \nagainst our will, and to our horror. \u0014\nSimone Weil, \"Some Thoughts on the Love of God\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe God who died in the Holocaust was not the true God, but the god \nof secular humanism. \u0014\nEugene Borowitz, Lecture, 1992 \u0014\n\u0014\nOf two evils we should always choose the less. \u0014\nThomas  Kempis, Imitation of Christ \u0014\n\u0014\nTake away all evil, and much good would go with it. God's care is to \nbring good out of the evils which happen, not to abolish them. \u0014\nThomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae \u0014\n\u0014\nThe world in which we live lies in the power of the Evil One, who \ndoes not allow any space for grief and mourning, who fills every \nlittle space with things to do, people to meet, business to \naccomplish, products to be made. \u0014\nHenri Nouwen, New Oxford Review, June, 1992\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deepest tragedy of human life is that evil, the wrong that we do \neach other under God, plays itself out and is felt over time in the \nvery ways social systems develop.... Evil is the consequence of \ndisparities of power because where disparity of power is great, \nviolence or control by coercion is the predominant mode of social \ninteraction. Evil... is the active or passive effort to deny or \nsuppress another's power of being in relation. \u0014\nBeverly W. Harrison, Making the Connections \u0014\n\u0014\nAs people who have been given the Spirit, the breath of divine love, \nwe are called to resist the Evil One who clutches our world in his \ndestructive claws. This is not, however, a struggle of power against \npower, or weapon against weapon; it is the sacred contest of weakness \nagainst power, vulnerability against callousness, forgiveness against \nrevenge, tears against cynicism, and, yes, mourning against the stoic \nbearing of our fate. \u0014\nHenri Nouwen, New Oxford Review, June, 1992 \u0014\n\u0014\n... \"God's plan\" is often a front for men's plans and a cover for \ninadequacy, ignorance and evil. \u0014\nMary Daly, Beyond God the Father \u0014\n\u0014\nTo get power over is to defile. To possess is to defile. \u0014\nSimone Weil, First and Last Notebooks \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a man is deprived of the power of expression, he will express \nhimself in a drive for power. \u0014\nJose Arguelles\u0014\n\u0014\nThe conflict of good and evil seems inevitably bound up with \nself-realization, precisely because goodness is not the caricature of \ngoodness we know as goody-goodness,... Goodness is instead a rising \nto being as it is. Goodness does not banish evil, does not offer us \nimmunity from suffering. \u0014\nAnn Ulanov, Picturing God \u0014\n\u0014\nThe story of Dracula tells a mythic truth. Its characters are symbols \nof human experience; its actions are our actions. We have within \nourselves all these figures, struggling with the forces of good and \nevil, the ultimate conflict of opposites at war in human existence \nDracula represents our own will to power. \u0014\nLinda Schierse Leonard, On The Way to The Wedding \u0014\n\u0014\nNo one, who like me, conjures up the most evil of .those half-tamed \ndemons that inhabit the human breast, and seeks to wrestle with them, \ncan expect to come through the struggle unscathed. \u0014\nSigmund Freud, Dora \u0014\n\u0014\nThe world is not mad. It is only the people in it who are mad. \u0014\nC. Judson Herrick \u0014\n\u0014\nToday the very existence of the species is threatened because the \nantagonisms characterizing man have been largely divorced from his \nbiological needs and activities. \u0014\nTright Burrow, Toward Social Sanity and Human Survival \u0014\n\u0014\nThe unconscious is not just evil in nature, it is also the source of \nthe highest good: not only dark but also light, not only bestial, \nsemihuman and demonic but superhuman, spiritual, and in the classical \nsense of the word, divine. \u0014\nC.G. Jung, The Practice of Psychotherapy \u0014\n\u0014\nWe do not think with our minds but with our prejudices. \u0014\nTright Burrows, Toward Social Sanity and Human Survival\u0014\n\u0014\nI have no doubt that evil exists and that we humans are capable of \nabsolute destructiveness. And I have spent enough time in silence to \nknow that my own impulses, perceptions and addictions often lead me \nastray. I believe in sin, not only as making mistakes or being \ncompelled by addiction, but also as hard, calculated meanness. But I \nhave also prayed. My life of prayer has always been stumbling and \nfitful. But it has convinced me of some basic truths. We are in love. \nGod is absolutely and always present... \u0014\nGerald G. May, M.D. The Awakened Heart \u0014\n\u0014\nThe real problem is in the hearts and minds of men. It is not a \nproblem of physics but of ethics. It is easier to denature plutonium \nthan to denature the evil spirit of man. \u0014\nAlbert Einstein \u0014\n\u0014\nWe hear much today about \"one world,\" but not enough about one human \nspecies. At least we do not always act, at home or abroad, as if we \nbelieved this proved biological fact. \u0014\nA.S. Carlson, physiologist\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat all schoolchildren learn, Those to whom evil is done Do evil in \nreturn. \u0014\nW.H. Auden, \"September 1, 1939\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no \ndistinctly native American criminal class except Congress. \u0014\nMark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sin against the Holy Spirit is the sin against new life, against \nself-emergence, against the Holy fecund innerness of each person. It \ncan be committed quite easily against oneself as against another. \u0014\nM.C. Richards, Centering \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a white man in Africa by accident looks into the eyes of a \nnative and sees the human being (which it is his chief preoccupation \nto avoid), his sense of guilt, which he denies, fumes up in \nresentment and he brings down the whip. \u0014\nDoris Lessing, The Grass is Singing \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are in every man, at every hour, two simultaneous postulants, \none towards God, the other towards Satan. \u0014\nCharles Baudelaire, Mon Coeur Mis a Nu \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is hell? Hell is oneself. Hell is alone, the other figures in it \nMerely projections. \u0014\nT.S. Eliot, The Cocktail Party\u0014\n\u0014\nAll things are enslaved which serve things evil. Percy Bysshe \nShelley, Promethius Unbound \u0014\nThe greatest of evils and the worst of crimes is poverty. \u0014\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, Major Barbara \u0014\n\u0014\nThe attempt to make human beings despise themselves ... is what I \ncall hell. \u0014\nAndre Malraux, Man's Fate \u0014\n\u0014\nThe belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men \nalone are quite capable of every wickedness. \u0014\nJoseph Conrad, Under Western Eyes \u0014\n\u0014\nMan's capacity for evil, then, is less a positive capacity, for all \nits horrendous activity, than a failure to develop man's most human \nfunction, the imagination, to its fullness, and consequently a \nfailure to develop compassion. \u0014\nDenise Levertov, The Poet in the World \u0014\n\u0014\nIf the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, \u0014\nhe has created him in his own image and likeness. \u0014\nFyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamozov \u0014\n\u0014\nAll that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of \nthings, all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and \ncakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all \nevil; to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified in Moby Dick. \u0014\nHerman Melville, Moby Dick\u0014",

The \nearly Christians themselves reply: We exist because of Jesus' \nresurrection.  There is no evidence for a form of early Christianity \nin which the resurrection was not a central belief. Nor was this \nbelief, as it were, bolted on to Christianity at the edge. It was the \ncentral driving force, informing the whole movement.\u0014\nN. T. Wright, The Challenge of Jesus\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not experiences that create faith, but faith that creates \nexperience. The firm lodestone of faith is not provided by the inner \nexperiences of the Spirit, good and important though these are, but \nby the community with Christ, in the living and dying and rising \nagain with him.\u0014\nJrgen Moltmann, The Source of Life\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't preach Jesus' story in light of my experience as some sort of \nhelpful symbol or myth that is helpfully illumined by my story. \nRather, I am invited by Easter to interpret my story in the light of \nGod's triumph in the resurrection. Only because we worship a \nresurrected Lord can we risk preaching.\u0014\nWilliam H.

Christ died in precisely the same way that so \nmany other thousands of God's children had already died and would die \nin the futuremany because of their loyalty to him.

    "words": "For the last 3 years an architectural firm in Denver, Colorado, has \nhad a \"quiet time\" for its employees.  Sixty minutes of silence are \nset aside each day at midmorning for thinking and planning. It has \nproven to be an essential feature for the staff of 25 who work \ntogether in one large open room.  One employee said that at first the \nidea didn't sound very good to them.  But now, having discovered its \nbenefits, they have become very protective of their quiet time.  They \nhave found it to be an important aid in realizing one of the firm's \ngoals, which is to have an atmosphere of \"integrity and calmness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  Daniel is a good example of someone who achieved on a personal \nlevel a calmness and integrity that made his life effective for God.  \nHe successfully countered the strain of his demanding activities by a \nregular habit of being quiet before the Lord three times a day.  \nThere was a direct relationship between Daniel's habit of prayer and \nthe personal courage, uncompromising character, and spiritual power \nthat marked his life.  It was during these quiet times that he \nacknowledged his dependence on the Lord and asked Him for help--help \nthat would deliver him alive out of the lions' den.\u0014",
