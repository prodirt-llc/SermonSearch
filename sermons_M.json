Roots, not only awareness of spiritual ancestors, but the \nmodel of persons with faith and spiritual experience.  Mary knew who \nshe was, how she related to God, and how she fit into the world.  \n\"She inspires me to examine both her tradition (Judaism) and my own \n(Catholicism) as sources of nourishment and vision--and not to \nabandon them for something more novel or trendy.\"  Vision, as modern \nChristians need personal vision to set them apart from the world and \nto direct and move their lives; and that visions can be trusted, and \nvisions grow out of one's roots.  \"Human beings need roots and \nwings.\" And, as Mary had to, man can learn to let go.\u0014\n\u0014\n     \"Mary can teach men a thing or two\" by Kenneth Guentert.

Usually such prejudice in journalists has \nits roots in early life experiences that somehow turned them against \nGod. Media people like to consider themselves pluralists, but a \nsignificant number of them grew up in the church only to reject the \nfaith later. Their antagonism toward religion often reflects their \ndesire to justify their liberal views. Christians themselves are \npartly to blame for the way the press misrepresents Christianity.  \nToo many of those who say they believe in God live as if He didn't \nreally exist.  Only 11% of Christians read the Bible daily.  How can \na generation that is Biblically illiterate expect to have the mind of \nChrist?  Only through a deeper commitment to the Lord and to our \nfamilies, more faithful Bible study, and more fervent prayer can we \nhave the kind of spiritual power that even the secular media cannot \nignore.\u0014\n      \"Meet the press\" by Cal Thomas.

    "words": "\"Those who have trained themselves in dogged pursuit of their \nassignment reach it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   What is the most important trait for a pastor wanting to lead a \ngrowing church?  Perseverance.\u0014\n   The New Testament word hypomeno is best translated \"patiently \nenduring\" or \"overcoming difficulties.\"  This unglamorous definition \nmay disappoint the leader hoping to build a successful church with \nhis skills, charisma, or intelligence. Nevertheless, those who \n\"doggedly pursue what God has shown them\" are more likely to reach \ntheir pastoral goals than those who rely on natural abilities.\u0014\n   Perseverance is characterized by three elements:  resilience, \nlearned optimism, and opportunism.\u0014\n   Resilience is the ability to bounce back. Where does it come \nfrom?  It comes from charged batteries, from a well-guarded emotional \nand physical reserve, and from the ability to laugh at oneself.  It \nalso comes from a good dose of realism that expects obstacles.\u0014\n   The person with learned optimism has \"an eye for what is going \nright.\"  Those who focus on failures and problems will not be able to \nhang in there.  Those who make a habit of thanking God for the things \nthat are going well will approach each day with a renewed \nperspective.  One pastor suggested, \"If you thank God 150 times a day \nbefore you hit the office, God will do great things.\"  Build times of \nprayer and praise into your daily schedule to balance all the \ntrouble- shooting meetings.\u0014\n   Opportunism enables the pastor to see opportunities in the midst \nof problems.  However pressing the problems, take time to consider \nnew ideas.  \"A dose of renewed vision resolves more issues than a \nchurch vote.\"\u0014\n   In summary, Christian leadership is not for sprinters. Rather, it \nis for plodders, for marathoners, who can keep moving forward toward \na dream.\u0014\n @Z:E\u0014\n\u0014\n      \"Marathon leaders\" by Doug Murren.

Willingness to accept \nmoral absolutes also is more predominant among Republicans (74%) than \nDemocrats(66%) or Independents (64%).\u0014\n\u0014\n   Though relativism is usually associated with universities, it is \nnoteworthy that \"acceptance of moral absolutes now is more widespread \namong those who are college educated than among those whose schooling \nended with high school graduation or earlier.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   More men believe in moral absolutes than women(73% versus 63%). \nThe difference between ages is not as great as might be expected, \nwith 69% of 18- 34 year-olds expressing a belief in moral absolutes \nas opposed to 72% of those age 65 and older.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Moral absolutes returning\" by George H.

    "words": "Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, heir to one of Europes \nleading families, was destined for high duties in 18th Century \nEurope. Since 1662 all males in the Zinzendorf clan bore the title of \ncount in the Holy Roman Empire; thus young Nicolaus Ludwig became at \nbirth Count Zinzendorf. His mother recorded his birth in the family \nBible, noting on May 26, 1700 in Dresden the \"gift of my first-born \nson, Nicolaus Ludwig,\" asking \"the Father of mercy\" to \"govern the \nheart of this child that he may walk blamelessly in the path of \nvirtue  may his path be fortified in his Word.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n           Six weeks after his birth, his father died of \ntuberculosis. He was raised by three womenhis mother; her sister, \nAunt Henrietta; and his grandmother. Only the latter two were close \nto him in his childhood for his mother remarried when he was three. \nZinzendorf went to live with Aunt Henrietta and Lady Gersdorf on the \nlatters estate. It was a crucial move. The young count grew up in an \natmosphere bathed in prayer, Bible reading and hymn-singing. His \ndearest treasure next to the Bible was Luthers Smaller Catechism. In \nchildlike sincerity he wrote love letters to Jesus and tossed them \nout of the window of the castle tower. When Swedish soldiers overran \nSaxony, they entered the castle at Gross-Hennersdorf and burst \"into \nthe room where the six-year-old count happened to be at his customary \ndevotions,\" notes John Weinlick in Count Zinzendorf. \"They were awed \nas they heard the boy speak and pray  the incident was prophetic of \nthe way the count was to move others with the depths of his religious \nexperience the rest of his sixty years.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n             All of his life, the young count would point to one \nexperience which influenced him most. In the art museum at \nDusseldorf, he encountered the Savior. Seeing Domenico Fetis Ecce \nHomo (\"Behold, the man\"), a portrait of the thorn-crowned Jesus, and \nreading the inscription below it\"I have done this for you; what have \nyou done for me?\" Zinzendorf said to himself, \"I have loved Him for a \nlong time, but I have never actually done anything for Him. From now \non I will do whatever He leads me to do.\" In Dresden, he opened his \napartment for informal religious services on Sundays and soon \nattracted \"a growing circle of adherents.\" A dominant theme of life \nthenand for all his adult yearswas that he considered himself a \npilgrim.\u0014\n\u0014\n              By 1731 the count was rarely involved with affairs of \nstate, but one such event figured decisively in the sending of \nmissionaries. That year he received an invitation to the coronation \nof Christian VI in Copenhagen and not being inclined to accept, he \nsubmitted the matter to the congregation, and to the lot. When \nprevailing opinion indicated \"go,\" he consented with a strong \npremonition that something special lay in store. \u0014\n\u0014\n               In Copenhagen he took part in the expected round of \nsocial events and even was accorded the medal of the Order of the \nDanebrog for distinguished service; but that \"something special\" came \nwhen he met a black man. Anthony Ulrich had been brought to Europe \nfrom St. Thomas and since arriving had found Christ as his Savior. \nWith Zinzendorf and David Nitschmann he passionately pled for someone \nto go to the Danish West Indies with the gospel, to share with the \nblack slavesamong whom were his sister and brotherthe glad news of \nsalvation. It was not that the church did not already exist there; it \ndid, but only for the benefit of the whites. \u0014\n\u0014\n                This lead to the beginning of the famous Moravian \nmissions the following year. By 1760 no fewer than 226 Moravian \nmissionaries had been sent out from the little flock that Zinzendorf \nled. As the great visionary, the tireless pilgrim, Zinzendorf, lived \nout his last days at Herrnhut. Weak and nearing death on May 8, 1760, \nhe said to Bishop David Nitschmann at his bedside: \u0014\n\u0014\n              \"Did you suppose in the beginning that the Savior would \ndo as much as we now really see, in the various Moravian settlements, \namongst the children of God of other denominations and amongst the \nheathen? I only entreated of him a few of the firstfruits of the \nlatter, but there are now\u0014\nthousands of them. Nitschmann, what a formidable caravan from our \nchurch already stands around the Lamb!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n             The following day Count Zinzendorf breathed his last and \njoined the caravan of those adoring the Lamb upon his throne. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Zinzendorf joins the ranks of godly men who's lives \nwere profoundly influenced by the spiritual mentoring received from \nwomen. Where would the world be without women like Hannah, Mary, \nElizabeth, and the women who nurtured Nicholas Ludwig Zinzendorf?\u0014",

    "words": "Several weeks into the bus boycott, exhausted from attempting to be a \npastor and to direct the Montgomery Improvement Association (the \nboycott organization's name) at the same time, after a relentless \nstream of harassing and obscene phone calls, Martin Luther King \nfinally got his first genuine death threat: \"Just as I was about to \ndoze off, the telephone rang. An angry voice said, 'Listen, nigger, \nwe've taken all we want from you; before next week you'll be sorry \nyou ever came to Montgomery.'\" He got out of bed and went to the \nkitchen to make some coffee. He\u0014\nbegan thinking of how he could get out of this involvement without \nappearing to be a coward.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this state of exhaustion, when my courage had all but gone, I \ndecided to take my problem to God. With my head in my hands, I bowed \nover the kitchen table and prayed aloud. The words I spoke to God \nthat midnight are still vivid in my memory. \"I am here taking a stand \nfor what I\u0014\nbelieve is right. But now I am afraid. The people are looking for \nleadership, and if I stand before them without strength and courage, \nthey too will falter. I am at the end of my powers. I have nothing \nleft. I've come to the point where I can't face it alone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that moment I experienced the presence of the Divine as I had \nnever experienced Him before.It seemed as though I could hear the \nquiet assurance of an inner voice saying: \"Stand up for \nrighteousness, stand up for truth; and God will be at your side \nforever.\" Almost at once my fears began to go. My uncertainty \ndisappeared. I was ready to face anything. \u0014\n\u0014\n          (Martin Luther King, Strive Toward Freedom: The Montgomery \nStory (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1958), pp. 178-179)\u0014",

For the \nnext four or five hours, the two sides exchanged gunfire almost \ncontinuously.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Finally about noon, about an hour after the shooting from inside \nthe home stopped, agents sent Willie Woodberry -- who had been hired \nby the Barkers to cook -- into the home.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                          As Woodberry walked onto \nthe porch, he\u0014\n                                        yelled, \"It's me Ma, don't \nshoot.\" Woodberry\u0014\n                                        found Ma and Fred dead.

Watkins chased Fontenot out of the house \nand tried to shoot him in the head, but the gun did not go off. \u0014\nWatkins said he drove away, thinking he was out of bullets, then \nrealized his gun had only misfired and that he had more rounds. He \nthen drove back to the house, where he shot his wife to death while \nshe talked to a 911 dispatcher.\u0014",

    "title": "MICROSOFT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM",
    "words": "By Matt Richey \u0014\n\u0014\nALEXANDRIA, VA (Dec. 20, 1999) -- Recently, a friend of mine told me \nthat all you need to know about Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) is that they \nhave $19 billion in liquid cash and another $15 billion in strategic \ninvestments. He has a point. And a lot of times in this space, we \nlook at quantitative evidence, especially in the financial \nstatements, to verify whether a company is making the rules in its \nindustry. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut cash hoards, gross margins, and flow ratios are really just the \nend result of business excellence on a more qualitative level -- \nattributes such as a well-planned strategy, good managerial skills, \nand a productive workplace. The only problem with studying these \nqualitative factors is that they're difficult to ascertain without \ninsider knowledge. One alternative way of obtaining this type of \ninsight, however, is through some of the well-written books about \nRule Makers. Today, let's take a peek inside the Microsoft corporate \ncampus through the eyes of David Thielen, author of T he 12 Simple \nSecrets of Microsoft Management. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book, published this year, explains in plain language (and just \n175 pages) Microsoft's management style and corporate culture. \nAlthough the book is written primarily for business managers seeking \nto emulate Microsoft's success, I think we as investors can learn a \nlot of useful info. The author, Mr. Thielen, worked at Microsoft as a \nsenior software developer on Windows 95 and several other projects. \nIn his words, \"Microsoft's management style is its core strength,\" \nand \"Microsoft's management strength is why it will continue to \ndominate.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHere goes with a few of the main ideas on each of Microsoft's 12 \nsecrets: \u0014\n\u0014\n1. Total World Domination \u0014\n\u0014\nSome companies focus on the bottom line. In contrast, Thielen \nforcefully asserts that every single Microsoft employee is \nsingle-mindedly focused on winning 100% of their target market, \nwhatever it might be. Microsoft's culture is one of maximizing \nlong-term profits by, in the near term, capturing market share in \nstrategic markets. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. The Top Five Percent \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Thielen, \"One of the enjoyable things about working at \nMicrosoft is that even the least talented are pretty damn smart, the \naverage are superb, and the best leave you trying every day to match \ntheir work.\" Microsoft rigorously attempts to hire only the smartest \npeople, those who are within the smartest 5% of the total population. \nBut don't confuse smarts with knowledge. Knowledge is for books on a \nshelf. Microsoft seeks individuals who can turn on their brains and \nreally think. These are the types of people who create new ideas, \ncatch errors quickly, and come up with a more efficient way of doing \nthings. In essence, by hiring the smartest people, Microsoft goes a \nlong way toward ensuring a highly productive workforce. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Bet the Company \u0014\n\u0014\nWinning in the game of business is about being willing to make bets \nat good odds. In the early 1990s, Bill Gates bet the company on \nWindows. In 1996, Bill bet the company on the Internet. By all \nindications, the principle of \"betting the company\" is \ninstitutionalized within Microsoft management. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. Require Failure \u0014\n\u0014\nAt most companies, to succeed is good, but to fail is unacceptable. \nThis type of policy means that, as a risk/reward scenario, the risk \nof failure vastly exceeds the reward of success. Thus, most companies \nsuffer from a workforce that pursues a course of failure avoidance. \nIn contrast, at Microsoft, failure is expected, and even required \nbecause risking failure is the only way to push the envelope. As a \nresult, Microsofties relentlessly pursue success without fear of \nfailure. And if they fail, they understand that the key is to fail \nquickly and not waste time. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Managers Are Qualified \u0014\n\u0014\nAt Microsoft, the most important qualification for a manager is \nexpertise in the functional area over which (s)he is managing. \nAccording to Thielen, \"Managers at Microsoft fully understand the \nwork the people who report to them do. Almost without exception, \nthose managers could do the job of any individual doing the core work \nfor their team.\" For example, managers of marketing teams are great \nmarketers; managers of sales teams are excellent sales people; and, \nmanagers of programming teams are expert programmers. This principle \napplies all the way up to Bill Gates, who is an expert at programming \n-- Microsoft's core competency. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. Perform, Perform, Perform \u0014\n\u0014\nPerformance is all that matters at Microsoft, so much so that excuses \nare flat-out irrelevant. In fact, Microsoft is so stubbornly focused \non performance that Thielen even describes the company as \"heartless\" \nand \"unfair.\" But the end result of this single-minded concern for \nsuccess is that Microsoft performs like a champion sports team. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. \"Shrimp vs. Weenies\" \u0014\n\u0014\nEven with its billions upon billions in cash, Microsoft is as frugal \nas Ebeneezer Scrooge. It's a company that buys canned weenies for \nfood, not shrimp. Until last year, even Bill Gates and his \nsecond-in-command Steve Ballmer flew coach. (For scheduling reasons, \nthe company purchased its first corporate jet.) Bucking the trend of \nmost large, wealthy corporations, Microsoft remains in start-up mode \nwhere tight budgets are the rule. When you sit back and think about \nit, this frugality is less surprising and even explai ns how a \ncompany can come to accumulate such great hoards of cash. \u0014\n\u0014\n8. Size Does Matter \u0014\n\u0014\nI, for one, am guilty of describing Microsoft as a \"software \nbehemoth.\" But Thielen takes a different view: \"Microsoft is not a \nsingle, large company; rather it is a collection of small, \nindependent companies. The primary job functions at Microsoft are \ncreating, testing, marketing, and selling software. And, amazingly \nenough, these functions are largely performed separately for each and \nevery project.\" Thereby, Microsoft largely avoids the bureaucracy \nthat weighs down so many large companies. Thus, Microsoft retains the \nindependence and agility of a small company, while also benefiting \nfrom the financial resources, marketing muscle, and overall strategic \ndirection of a large, powerful corporation. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. Bill is Watching \u0014\n\u0014\nBill Gates and Microsoft's other senior executives really understand \nwhat's happening in their organization. Every month, the lead manager \non every project e-mails a status report to Bill and the other key \nmanagers, providing an update on the project's status and any major \nproblems. In addition, every Saturday morning, Bill calls every \nsingle vice president and spends half an hour discussing the issues \nin each department. According to Thielen, \"Bill's approach, his \nphilosophy, and his strategic vision permeates the entire company.\" \nAnd because Bill Gates has such a deep understanding of programming \nand technology, he's able -- and willing -- to communicate down \nthrough the ranks and even grill the software developers who actually \nperform the work. Thielen concludes, \"Because Bill understands what \nis happening throughout the company, [his] decisions are generally \nthe correct ones for the strategic direction of the company.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n10. Esprit de Corps \u0014\n\u0014\nAgain alluding to Microsoft being less like a big company than it \nappears, Thielen asserts that Microsoft has esprit de corps like that \nof a start-up where everyone involved is focused on a common goal. \nMicrosofties take great pride in their work, partly because they have \na great deal of freedom in how they go about their jobs. Pranks, \njokes, and games are all part of the atmosphere. It's a work hard, \nplay hard culture. \u0014\n\u0014\n11. Stop the Insanity \u0014\n\u0014\nThe plague of most big companies is bureaucracy and stupid rules. \nThielen gives the example of an un-named high-tech company that sent \na four-page memo to all of its employees on proper security badge \nprocedure, including infinitesimal details on how and where to wear \nthe badge. To that, Thielen states, \"Does Microsoft manage to avoid \nthis type of inane garbage? By and large, yes.\" Unlike most \ncompanies, Microsoft actually assumes its employees are smart \n(perhaps based on principle #2). Rules at Microsoft are few and far \nbetween, and the ones that exist tend to make sense. Having only a \nfew important, logical rules means that employees actually remember \nand follow them. \u0014\n\u0014\n12. Home Away From Home \u0014\n\u0014\nMicrosoft has a simple way of maximizing its employees' productivity: \nIt allows each individual's office to be as individualized as one \ndesires. That means making the office more like home. Everything from \nreal offices (not cubicles) to windows in most offices, from free \nsoft drinks to no dress code, from an open supply room to \nanything-goes work hours. Quite simply, these policies improve \nemployee morale, and thus increase overall productivity. \u0014\n\u0014\nConclusion\u0014",

    "words": "February 25, 2000\u0014\n\u0014\n  HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Republican presidential battle surfaced in a\u0014\n  personal legal dispute when cosmetics entrepreneur Georgette \nMosbacher\u0014\n  suggested her ex-husband Robert Mosbacher stopped making alimony\u0014\n  payments in part because she backed John McCain over his friend \nGeorge W.\u0014\n  Bush.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Georgette Mosbacher filed suit this week in U.S. District Court in \nHouston,\u0014\n  seeking resumption of the monthly $32,064 payments the couple \nagreed to in\u0014\n  June 1997 as part of a settlement that preceded their divorce in \nApril 1998\u0014\n  after 15 years of marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Earlier this month Robert Mosbacher, a wealthy Texas oilman and \nformer\u0014\n  U.S. Commerce Secretary under former President George Bush, father \nof\u0014\n  Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said the payments would cease because his\u0014\n  ex-wife had broken part of the agreement that bars them from making\u0014\n  \"disparaging statements\" about each other.\u0014\n\u0014\n  A letter sent to Georgette Mosbacher's attorney on Feb. 15 said the \nmost\u0014\n  recent breach of that clause occurred in a Jan. 31 article in the \nNew York\u0014\n  Observer in which she discussed her life and her fund-raising work \nfor the\u0014\n  McCain presidential campaign.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Georgette was also quoted in the article as saying that she felt \nbetrayed by her\u0014\n  former husband, saying he had left her for another woman and \nreferring to him\u0014\n  as \"the man who threw the hand grenade in my life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n  She said she respected both Bush and McCain but had felt compelled \nto\u0014\n  support McCain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination \nafter reading\u0014\n  about how he overcame his ordeal as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Her suit, filed on Tuesday, suggested that the ending of the \nalimony payments\u0014\n  might have been politically motivated.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Plaintiff has a constitutional right to support the candidate of \nher choice as\u0014\n  vociferously as she wishes, regardless of her ex-husband's wishes,\" \nit said.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Robert Mosbacher has denied that politics are involved in the \ndispute. \"John\u0014\n  McCain is an old friend of mine and I like him,\" he was quoted as \nsaying in\u0014\n  Thursday's Houston Chronicle.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Georgette Mosbacher contends that her comments were truthful and \ntherefore\u0014\n  did not amount to disparagement and that Robert Mosbacher's attempt \nto\u0014\n  invoke that clause of their agreement is an unconstitutional \ninfringement of her\u0014\n  right of free speech.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Her suit is due to be heard by U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in \nHouston on\u0014\n  June 12.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Celebrated during her Washington years for her lively personality \nand striking\u0014\n  red hair, Georgette Mosbacher later built a career in the cosmetics \nindustry.\u0014\n\u0014\n  She has also written two books: \"It Takes Money, Honey -- A \nGet-Smart\u0014\n  Guide to Financial Freedom\" and \"Feminine Force -- Release the Power\u0014\n  Within to Create the Life You Deserve.\"\u0014",

Many a man has \nfelt\u0014\nextreme frigid temperatures for a long period based on a poor present\u0014\ndecision. As a veteran of these wars, I'm still not sure what to buy \nmy\u0014\nwife, but I'll pass on what not to buy her:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Don't buy anything that plugs in. Anything that requires \nelectricity is\u0014\nseen as utilitarian.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Don't buy clothing that involves sizes. The chances are one in \nseven\u0014\nthousand that you will get her size right, and your wife will be \noffended\u0014\nthe other 6999 times. \"Do I look like a size 16?\" she'll say. Too \nsmall a\u0014\nsize doesn't cut it either: \"I haven't worn a size 8 in 20 years!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Avoid all things useful. The new silver polish advertised to save\u0014\nhundreds of hours is not going to win you any brownie points.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Don't buy anything that involves weight loss or self-improvement. \nShe'll\u0014\nperceive a six-month membership to a diet center as a suggestion \nthat's\u0014\nshe's overweight.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Don't buy jewelry. The jewelry your wife wants, you can't afford. \nAnd the\u0014\njewelry you can afford, she doesn't want.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. And, guys, do not fall into the traditional trap of buying her \nfrilly\u0014\nunderwear. Your idea of the kind your wife should wear and what she \nactually\u0014\nwears are light years apart.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Finally, don't spend too much. \"How do you think we're going to \nafford\u0014\nthat?\" she'll ask. But don't spend too little. She won't say \nanything, but\u0014\nshe'll think, \"Is that all I'm worth?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHerb Forst in Cross River, NY, Patent Trader, in Reader's Digest, \nPage 69\u0014\n_______________________\u0014",

The music\u0014\nstarts to get too loud, one of your old girlfriends from high school\u0014\nbecomes a grandmother.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifties, you have a minor surgery -- you'll call it a procedure, but\u0014\nit's a surgery.\u0014\n\u0014\nSixties, you'll have a major surgery, the music is still loud, but it\u0014\ndoesn't matter because you can't hear it anyway.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeventies, you and the wife retire to Fort Lauderdale. You start \neating\u0014\ndinner at 2:00 in the afternoon, you have lunch around 10:00, \nbreakfast\u0014\nthe night before, spend most of your time wandering around malls \nlooking\u0014\n\u0014\nfor the ultimate soft yogurt and muttering, \"How come the kids don't\u0014\ncall? How come the kids don't call?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eighties, you'll have a major stroke, and you end up babbling with\u0014\nsome Jamaican nurse who your wife can't stand, but who you call mama.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny questions?\u0014\n\u0014\nBilly Crystal, dialogue from the movie \"City Slickers.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Several years ago a couple of reporters conducted an experiment on the\u0014\nstreets of Miami, Florida. They printed up a copy of the Bill of \nRights\u0014\nin the form of a petition, put it on a clipboard, and then stopped\u0014\npeople on the sidewalk and asked them to sign it. As you know, the \nfirst\u0014\nten amendments to the United States Constitution are the Bill of \nRights,\u0014\nand they were adopted and put into effect in December of 1791. The\u0014\nreporters were surprised at people's reaction when asked to add their\u0014\nnames to the so-called petition. Most people glanced at the document,\u0014\nshook their heads, and walked on by without signing. Several people\u0014\nbecame angry with the reporters and accused them of being radical\u0014\nenemies of the American way of life. In fact, the experiment ended \nwhen\u0014\nthe reporters found themselves surrounded by a dozen or so passers-by\u0014\nwho were shaking their fists at them and calling them subversive\u0014\nCommunists who ought to be thrown in jail.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the experiment demonstrated is what we already know. Many \ncitizens\u0014\nof the United States pay lip service to their country and its \nheritage.\u0014\nThey claim to be loyal and patriotic in every way. They say they are\u0014\nproud to belong to a country as great as ours. And yet at the same \ntime\u0014\nthey haven't the vaguest notion what the United States Constitution\u0014\nactually says, and they consider the Bill of Rights to be a radical,\u0014\nanti-American document. In other words, these people claim \ncitizenship,\u0014\nbut they have not internalized the basic meaning of being a citizen.\u0014\nThey claim the privilege, but they will not eat and drink the ethos of\u0014\nUnited States of America.\u0014",

Dad is sitting in his chair with an ice pack on his \nhead. Mom\u0014\nis in a bathrobe and her hair in rollers. The floor is a virtual \nmountain of\u0014\ntorn wrappings, boxes, and bows. Junior is reaching in his stocking \nto be\u0014\nsure that there is no more candy. In the background we see a table \nwith a\u0014\nthoroughly picked turkey still sitting there. The caption on the \ncartoon\u0014\nreads simply: The morning after.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, perhaps we feel a little that way. Perhaps we feel somewhat let \ndown.\u0014\nIf you feel that way it is quite understandable. Over the past weeks \nour\u0014\nemotions have been wound tighter than a toy doll. Our festivities \nhave led\u0014\nup to near fever pitch. And then, suddenly, it is all over. Is it any \nwonder\u0014\nthat it is somewhat of a let down. Psychiatrists even have a word for \nit.\u0014\nThey call it Christmas-slump.\u0014\n\u0014\nA number of years ago, when Lou Holtz was at the University of \nArkansas, he\u0014\nwas taking his team to play a bowl game in Tempe, Arizona. The game \nwas to\u0014\nbe played on Christmas day. He was asked how he felt about playing a \ngame on\u0014\nChristmas, rather than being with his family. The coach answered \ncandidly:\u0014\n\"I would rather be in Tempe. After all, once you have been to church, \nhad\u0014\nChristmas dinner, and opened the presents, Christmas is the most \nboring day\u0014\nof the year.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIs it possible to lose the spirit of Christmas that quickly? Let us be\u0014\ncandid that as we take down the decorations for another year, there \nis a\u0014\nsinking emptiness and an emotional let down. My Mom long ago gave up \nlive\u0014\nChristmas trees in favor of artificial. I remember trying as a child \ntrying\u0014\nall the tricks to keep it alive. We put aspirin in the water, then we \nwould\u0014\ntry sugar, but regardless of the solutions the tree would always \nwither.\u0014\nWhy? because it had been cut off from its roots.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay be that is our problem this morning. Maybe we have trouble making\u0014\nChristmas last because we have become cut off from our roots. Or, to \nput it\u0014\nanother way, maybe our celebration of Christmas is not deeply rooted \nenough.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we deeply root our celebration of Christmas so it will last? \nThis\u0014\nmorning, I would like to propose two ways.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. We need to be Serious about our (Christmas) Tradition.\u0014\n2. We must be Vigilant about Christmas.\u0014",

Wisch \nsentenced her to 30 years in prison. She could be eligible for parole \nin about five years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Jones testified at the hearing that she thought \nthe 2 years she spent in custody awaiting trial had been punishment \nenough.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"You think that's enough for his life?\" \nprosecutor Lisa Callaghan asked Jones on\u0014\ncross-examination.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"Yes,\" Jones answered.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    About 11 a.m. May 3, 1998, two employees at John \nPeter Smith Hospital saw Jones get out of the front passenger seat of \na car, open the back door and pull a child out.

Jones' \nboyfriend, Darron Wynn, had whipped him with an electrical cord, \nbeaten him with a hanger and a belt, smashed him into a wall and \nburned him with cigarettes before smothering him with a pillow, \naccording to testimony at Jones' sentencing hearing. Wynn is serving \na life sentence for Jason's murder.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Tarrant County Medical Examiner Nizam Peerwani \nsaid there were too many injuries to count, the pre-sentence report \nstates. He characterized the injuries as \"absolutely horrendous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"The child was brutally and sadistically beaten \nover a period of time,\" the report quotes Peerwani as saying.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    The report says that Jones had no significant \ncriminal history or substance abuse problems and that her family was \nwilling to support her in any way possible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    However, the report states, she \"does not fully \ntake responsibility for her role in the death of her son. ... The \ndefendant admitted that she could have protected Jason more than she \ndid. She stated that she could have protected him by `being more \naware.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Child Protective Services had received complaints \nbefore Jones met Wynn that she abused and neglected her children, \naccording to the report.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"She is incapable of protecting her children from \nthe men she so easily brings into her life,\" the report states. \n\"Instead, when these men abuse her children, she protects the men. \nAny child for  which the defendant might be responsible is at high \nrisk of severe abuse or neglect.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Defense attorney Larry Moore presented witnesses \nwho said Jones' mother, who died when Jones was about 7, physically \nabused her. When Jones was about 10, she was gang-raped, witnesses \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Throughout her life, Jones has attracted \nunemployed, dominating, sometimes-abusive men, some of whom beat her \nchildren, according to witnesses. She was able to leave the men only \nwith her family's help, witnesses said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Psychologist Raymond Finn, who testified for the \ndefense, said Jones dropped out of school in the eighth grade and is \n\"not very bright.\" That, coupled with her history of abuse, gave her \na proclivity for dating unsavory men, including Wynn, Finn said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Jones probably knew that Wynn was abusing her \nson, but if she left him, she would be giving up her own sense of \nsecurity, Finn said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    The morning her son died, Jones said, she was \ntaking a bath when Wynn brought Jason to her and said he wasn't \nacting right. That's when she first noticed that her son had welts \nfrom his forehead to his feet, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"He was, like, in a daze,\" Jones said. \"He was \nbreathing, but he wasn't responding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Jones said she went to a pay phone and tried to \ncall her brother and sister, but couldn't reach them. She returned to \nthe apartment, but by then, Jason wasn't breathing, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Wynn called his grandmother, who came to Jones' \napartment and took her and her son to the hospital, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Callaghan, who prosecuted the case with Sharon \nJohnson, asked Jones why she didn't try to do more to help her son \nonce she realized he was hurt. Jones said she was \"confused and had a \nlot of things running through my mind.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    \"So,\" Callaghan responded. \"So what?

Within \nmonths, Citizens'\u0014\n                Councils, comprising white community leaders in \nnearly every\u0014\n                town, had spread across the state, all determined to \npreserve\u0014\n                \"an unsullied race.\" Before long, the councils were \noffering\u0014\n                high school students cash prizes for the best essays \npromoting\u0014\n                segregation. For third graders learning to read, the \ncouncils\u0014\n                recommended these lines: \"Negroes use their own \nbathrooms.\u0014\n                They do not use white people's bathrooms . . . This \nis called our\u0014\n                Southern Way of Life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                That was the kid stuff. Grownups who strayed from \nSouthern\u0014\n                orthodoxy paid dearly--as was made clear last week \nwhen the\u0014\n                state of Mississippi unsealed more than 124,000 pages \nof secret\u0014\n                files maintained during the civil rights era by a \nstate agency\u0014\n                that lied, spied, and broke the law in hopes of \naverting racial\u0014\n                change.\u0014\n\u0014\n                The State Sovereignty Commission's papers show a \nracist\u0014\n                regime striving grimly yet sometimes comically \nagainst the\u0014\n                inevitable. Agents circulated reports of illegitimate \nbirths by\u0014\n                women involved in civil rights work, took note of the \nreligious\u0014\n                beliefs and sex lives of \"outside agitators,\" and \nrecorded license\u0014\n                tags of cars outside suspicious meetings--information \nthat was\u0014\n                routinely relayed to the white employers of black \nparticipants.\u0014\n                After cops halted a \"blonde, blue-eyed Jew\" hauling \nused books\u0014\n                to a \"freedom school\" for black children, an agent \nreported that\u0014\n                the load contained a bevy of suspect volumes, among \nthem\u0014\n                The Bobbsey Twins.\u0014\n\u0014\n                When Korean War veteran Clyde Kennard tried in 1959 to\u0014\n                become the first black at Mississippi Southern \nCollege,\u0014\n                constables stopped his car and planted illegal liquor \nin it--a\u0014\n                frame-up that a commission agent reported to \nheadquarters\u0014\n                with keen satisfaction. Soon Kennard was hit with \nanother\u0014\n                charge--hiring someone to steal five bags of chicken \nfeed. The\u0014\n                thief got off, but Kennard drew a seven-year prison \nsentence.\u0014\n                He was freed after four years, just before he died of \ncancer at\u0014\n                36.\u0014\n\u0014\n                Who's white. Mississippi's color line, while rigid, \nwas not always\u0014\n                clear. A Jasper County school board tried to block two\u0014\n                boys--ages 6 and 7--from a white school, claiming \nthey weren't\u0014\n                really white. Under state law, anyone more than one \neighth\u0014\n                black was deemed black. For four years, the boys \nstayed home\u0014\n                while the commission probed their family tree. Agents \nfinally\u0014\n                concluded that the youngsters were only 1/32 or, at \nmost, 1/16\u0014\n                black--or white enough for an all-white school.\u0014\n\u0014\n                While investigators sorted bloodlines, the \ncommission's PR\u0014\n                operation sent speakers across America to extol the \nbenefits of\u0014\n                segregation. One of the busiest was Ross Barnett, the \ngovernor\u0014\n                whose 1962 effort to keep the University of \nMississippi all white\u0014\n                ended in a two-fatality riot. Historian James Silver, \nan Ole Miss\u0014\n                professor in the '60s, once wrote that Barnett \nessentially made\u0014\n                only one speech: \"racism overlaid with double talk.\" \nA tape of a\u0014\n                1963 address shows a bewildering exchange at Western\u0014\n                Michigan University.\u0014\n\u0014\n                Q: \"I'm wondering if you consider Negroes people in\u0014\n                Mississippi.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                Barnett: \"I would say that the Negroes, the Indians, \nthe Eskimos,\u0014\n                and all the whites--90 percent of them are against \nKennedy in\u0014\n                Mississippi.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                Among the many changes in a generation is this one: A\u0014\n                onetime member of the Sovereignty Commission now \nserves on\u0014\n                President Clinton's special panel on race.

Americans are gobbling up \nnature's\u0014\n                      remedies for everything from obesity to \ndepression\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Amanda Spake \u0014\n\u0014\n                      S ara Sullivan woke up one Sunday with a \nsearing pain in her chest. When the paramedics\u0014\n                      arrived, they thought Sullivan was suffering a \nheart attack. Her heart was racing so fast that\u0014\n                      it couldn't pump enough blood and oxygen to her \nbrain. In the ambulance, she felt herself\u0014\n                      passing out. \"I thought about my five kids,\" \nthe 34-year-old housewife recalls, \"and then I\u0014\n                      said to myself, 'This is it. I'm going to die.' \n\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Sullivan regained consciousness, emergency \nroom physician Rebecca Bigoney\u0014\n                      walked into her room with a bottle of diet \npills that Sullivan's husband had shown the\u0014\n                      doctor, a popular ephedra-based supplement. \n\"You know this stuff can kill you?\" Bigoney\u0014\n                      asked.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Labeling on the product warned her to \"seek \nadvice\" from her doctor if she had \"heart or\u0014\n                      thyroid disease,\" but her physician did not \nthink the herbal remedy would harm her. Even\u0014\n                      though she'd had surgery five years earlier to \nfix a rapid and irregular heartbeat, Sullivan\u0014\n                      had been symptom free ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That's no longer true. \"It's not certain, but \nSara's history suggests that the ephedra caused a\u0014\n                      recurrence,\" says Bigoney. Since her scare in \n1999, she has been back to the emergency\u0014\n                      room six times because of chest pain, a racing \nheart, loss of consciousness, or other cardiac\u0014\n                      symptoms. \"Her heart,\" says her attorney, Mary \nAnn Barnes of Charlottesville, Va., \"has\u0014\n                      never returned to normal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sullivan is one of an estimated 123.5 million \nAmericans who try herbs, vitamins, minerals,\u0014\n                      enzymes, amino acids, and thousands of other \n\"natural\" potions and products to treat a\u0014\n                      variety of ills. Many, like Sullivan, are \ntrying to lose weight, but supplements are also being\u0014\n                      marketed to prevent cancer, lift mood, build \nmuscle, and improve sleep, joints, memory,\u0014\n                      concentration, immune function, and sex.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not since the early 1900s, when tonics and \nelixirs made from alcohol, opiates, cardiac\u0014\n                      depressants, and other toxic substances were \nsold as \"natural\" cures for ailments like\u0014\n                      meningitis, have so many bought so much with so \nlittle sound science behind it. The U.S.\u0014\n                      Food and Drug Administration has over 2,900 \nadverse-event reports about ephedra, ginkgo,\u0014\n                      St.-John's-wort, ginseng, and thousands of \nother supplements; these include 104 deaths.\u0014\n                      For every adverse event in its files, the FDA \nestimates \u0014\n\u0014\n                      100 more go unreported. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Congress's General Accounting Office estimates \nthat consumers spent about $31 billion in\u0014\n                      1999 on dietary supplements and \"functional \nfoods,\" like AriZona Rx Memory Mind Elixir or\u0014\n                      Kava Kava Corn Chips. A recent survey shows \nthat 63 percent of consumers took a vitamin,\u0014\n                      mineral, or herbal supplement in the past three \nmonths. Many take all of them at once.\u0014\n                      What's more, only about a third of patients \ntell their doctors they're taking supplements.\u0014\n                      Even if they do, laments Stephen Piscitelli, a \ndrug researcher at the National Institutes of\u0014\n                      Health, \"We don't know anything about these \nproducts in terms of their pharmacology.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      That's because, unlike with prescription drugs, \nthe FDA requires no scientific studies on\u0014\n                      safety and effectiveness before dietary \nsupplements are put on the market. Michael\u0014\n                      McGuffin, president of the American Herbal \nProducts Association, argues that premarket\u0014\n                      testing is unnecessary. \"These products are \ntested by years and years of use,\" he contends. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In some cases that may be true, but a growing \nnumber of doctors are concerned about\u0014\n                      consumers mixing and concentrating vitamins, \nherbs, and traditional remedies for daily\u0014\n                      use. Rossanne Philen of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention cites the case of\u0014\n                      chaparral, a therapeutic tea used safely by \nAmerican Indians. But when supplement makers\u0014\n                      put the plant's leaves in capsules as an \nantioxidant, chaparral can become a potent liver\u0014\n                      toxin. Equally problematic is what one \nscientist calls \"a total lack of quality control\" in the\u0014\n                      industry. Though some in the industry have \nadopted quality standards, remedies\u0014\n                      adulterated with unapproved drugs, pesticides, \nheavy metals, and carcinogens do end up\u0014\n                      on store shelves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Short-handed. The FDA has a tough time getting \neven demonstrably harmful supplements\u0014\n                      off the market. The agency's dietary supplement \neffort, says the FDA's Joseph Levitt,\u0014\n                      \"operates on a shoestring.\" Congress, which \nbenefits mightily from the nutrition industry\u0014\n                      (box, Page 49), has been stingy with funds, \nmaking meaningful oversight unmanageable.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ephedra products have been among the most \ncontroversialand lucrativeof all\u0014\n                      supplements. More than 1,200 complaints about \nthe hundreds of ephedra products on the\u0014\n                      market fill FDA files, including reports of 70 \ndeaths. Supplement trade groups counter that\u0014\n                      2 billion to 3 billion doses of ephedra are \ntaken yearlyevidence, they say, that the vast\u0014\n                      majority is being used safely. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others aren't so sure. Michael Hoffstetter, a \nVirginia neurologist, says he has seen four\u0014\n                      patients in the past year who had catastrophic \nreactions to these diet supplements. Three\u0014\n                      patients suffered strokes; one, a 24-year-old \nwoman, is still in rehab, and another in her 40s\u0014\n                      is seriously disabled; one died. The fourth, \nVeronica Golmon, was 17 years old when she\u0014\n                      began taking several ephedra products, \nrecommended by three high school-age friends.\u0014\n                      She blacked out while driving and hit a utility \npole, the result, says Hoffstetter, of cardiac\u0014\n                      irregularities. \"I thought I was burning fat,\" \nGolmon says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most consumers are a lot like both Golmon and \nSullivan. A survey by Prevention magazine\u0014\n                      shows that their major sources of information \narein this orderfriends and family,\u0014\n                      magazines, product labels, and advertising. \nDoctors are low on the list. More than half of\u0014\n                      those surveyed are confident that labels are \naccurate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      More or less. It's a false confidence. The \nUniversity of Arkansas College of Pharmacy\u0014\n                      studied the labeling of ephedra supplements and \nfound that half the products varied by\u0014\n                      more than 20 percent from the amount of \nephedrine alkaloids listed on the label. More\u0014\n                      disturbing, says Bill Gurley, associate \nprofessor of pharmacy, was their variability. \"Some\u0014\n                      bottles were subpotent and others superpotent,\" \nhe says. Gurley also found that three\u0014\n                      contained only ephedrineimpossible, he says, \nif the supplements really came from herbs.\u0014\n                      \"If you're making a product from synthetic \nephedrine, then you're making a drug.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      That's exactly what the FDA believed Chemins \nCo. was making when it produced a\u0014\n                      weight-loss product called Formula One. The \ncompany and CEO James Cameron were\u0014\n                      fined $4.6 million, and Cameron is now serving \na 21-month jail sentence for spiking\u0014\n                      supposedly \"all natural\" Formula One with \nsynthetic ephedrine and caffeine, both drugs. At\u0014\n                      least nine deaths were linked to Formula One, \nwhich Chemins stopped producing in 1994,\u0014\n                      after a number of lawsuits against the product. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lawsuits abound, in fact, when it comes to \nephedra. Last week, a $4 million settlement was\u0014\n                      reached in a Texas case against Next Nutrition, \nbrought on behalf of a young man who,\u0014\n                      after using what he said was \"Ultimate Orange,\" \nsuffered a stroke, had a portion of his brain\u0014\n                      removed, and remains permanently disabled. \nJames Frantz, a California attorney, recently\u0014\n                      sued on behalf of 13 clients who suffered \nstrokes, brain damage, seizures, and death,\u0014\n                      allegedly related to the popular ephedra \nsupplement Metabolife 356. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"No merit.\" \"There's no medical evidence that \nshows Metabolife is anything but safe and\u0014\n                      effective when used as directed,\" says Tony \nKnight, a spokesperson for the company, which\u0014\n                      had sales of $1 billion in 1999. \"These claims \nare baseless and these lawsuits have no\u0014\n                      merit.\" The company cites a just completed \nstudy of 167 people done by Carol Boozer,\u0014\n                      director of energy metabolism at New York's \nObesity Research Center and endocrinologist\u0014\n                      Patricia Daly of York, Pa. Over six months the \nsubjects who took a generic ephedra/caffeine\u0014\n                      supplement lost twice as much weight as the \ngroup taking a placebo. Some supplement\u0014\n                      takers had small blood pressure increases and \nhigher heart rates, but no arrhythmias, says\u0014\n                      Boozer.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The FDA recently asked five independent \nphysicians to evaluate 140 of its adverse-event\u0014\n                      reports. These reports, submitted by consumers, \nhave been criticized by the GAO and the\u0014\n                      supplement makers because data in them are \nincomplete. Among those 140 cases,\u0014\n                      Georgetown University's Raymond Woosley found \n104 descriptions of strokes, heart attacks,\u0014\n                      seizures, hypertension, and more that were \nlikely or probably related to ephedra. There\u0014\n                      were 10 reports of cardiac arrest and sudden \ndeath. Woosley concluded that, given these\u0014\n                      side effects, ephedra supplements shouldn't be \nused without medical supervision.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Medical supervision means, among other things, \navailability by prescription onlya\u0014\n                      suggestion that turns ephedra executives \napoplectic. \"People are allergic to peanut butter, too, but should \npeanut butter be sold with a prescription?\" asks Metabolife's Mike \nRothmiller. \"People can make informed decisions.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But some of FDA's experts wonder if that's \ntrue. In a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nNeal Benowitz of San Francisco General Hospital and an FDA\u0014\nreviewer noted that nearly half of the FDA's serious cases were \ncardiovascular events; 26\u0014\npercent of all the cases led to permanent disability or death. \"These \nfindings indicate the\u0014\nneed for a better understanding of individual susceptibility to the \nadverse effects of such\u0014\ndietary supplements,\" Benowitz concludes. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Benowitz's article has been attacked by the \nindustry. \"The only cases I know where people [who took ephedra] \ndied, they had severe coronary artery disease or they took \noverdoses,\" says San Francisco pathologist Steven Karch, who has been \na consultant to the Ephedra Education Council. What concerns the FDA \nreviewers, however, is the unknown number of people with underlying \nor undiagnosed medical conditions who take ephedra and suffer \ncatastrophic health events as a result.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ephedra supplements are raising the greatest \nworry in the medical community right now, but other natural remedies \nalso concern scientists. Among them: St.-John's-wort. Andrea started \ntaking this herbal antidepressant after a friend sent her a magazine \narticle about its benefits. And she did indeed feel less depressed \nwhile taking the herb. But one sunny day she went for a bike ride and \nthe skin on her legs began to hurt. \"It was almost like needles in \nthem,\" she recalls. As the days got warmer, her pain\u0014\n worsened. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Geoffrey M. Bove, a pain expert at Beth Israel \nDeaconess Medical Center in Boston,\u0014\n suspected her symptoms might be the result of nerve damage. He knew \nSt.-John's-wort\u0014\n could interact with sunlight, producing oxygen molecules that damage \nthe myelin wrapped\u0014\n around nerves. If myelin is damaged, nerves can produce electrical \nactivity, which feels like\u0014\n tingling, needles, or pain. Bove suggested she stop taking the herb. \nWithin three months,\u0014\n Andrea's pain was gone, \"consistent with how long it takes myelin to \nregenerate,\" Bove says. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Scientists are only beginning to understand how \nthis popular mood-elevator works in the body. Preliminary evidence \nsuggests that the herb may interact with other drugs, rendering\u0014\nthem ineffective. Researchers at GlaxoSmithKline reported in June \nthat St.-John's-wort\u0014\nappears to affect a particular enzyme used by the body to process \ndrugs. The enzyme,\u0014\nwhich is turned on like a faucet by St.-John's-wort, flows into the \nliver, eliminating many\u0014\nprescription drugs twice as fast as normaland greatly reducing their \ncurative effects.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      These interactions can be life threatening \nunder certain circumstances. Organ transplants, for example, have \nbeen rejected because of low levels of cyclosporin, an\u0014\nimmunosuppressor, which St.-John's-wort apparently eliminates too \nrapidly from the body.\u0014\nAnd a recent study indicates that St.-John's-wort interferes with \nIndinavir, a drug critical to\u0014\nmany HIV patients' health. Scientists suspect that the drugs affected \nby St.-John's-wort may\u0014\ninclude everything from oral contraceptives and analgesics to cancer \ndrugs and antibiotics.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The American Herbal Products Association is \nrecommending that St.-John's-wort carry a warning to avoid sunlight \nand to consult a physician before mixing with prescription drugs. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ginkgo and ginseng. Other herbal supplements \nalso appear to interfere with the\u0014\nmanagement and treatment of disease. In fact, studies show that 15 to \n20 million Americans each year may be risking drug-supplement \ninteractions that could harm their health. University of Maryland \nprofessor of pharmacology Magaly Rodriguez de Bittner, who runs a \ndiabetes clinic, says that ginkgoa popular memory enhancercan \naffect insulin secretion and ginseng can reduce blood sugar among \ndiabetics. There is some evidence that a ginkgo-ginseng combination \nmay lead to modest memory and cognitive improvement, but de Bittner \nis worried about the packaging and marketing of the herbs.\u0014\n                     \u0014\n Some are now packaged as orange-flavored treats and have moved from \nthe vitamin\u0014\n shelves to the high-profile candy displays at supermarket checkout \nstands. But these\u0014\n products cannot be used like mints or chewing gum, says de Bittner. \nDiabetics on\u0014\nprescription medication may take the herbs for memory and not know \ntheir blood sugar is\u0014\nplummeting. \"They can go into a coma, not be found, and die,\" says de \nBittner, who is\u0014\nvery concerned about elderly diabetics using these popular herbs.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, older consumers may be experiencing a \ndisproportionate share of the drug\u0014\ninteraction risks, in part because they take many prescription \nmedications. Patients have\u0014\nsuffered cerebral hemorrhages and other bleeding that their doctors \nattributed to using\u0014\nginkgo with aspirin, warfarin, or Coumadindrugs often prescribed to \nprevent blood clots\u0014\nafter surgery or for heart ailments. In one recent Oregon case, a man \nwho was taking\u0014\nCoumadin began using ginkgo for his memory, according to his family, \nand died of a\u0014\ncerebral hemorrhage. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As serious as drug-supplement interactions may \nbe, the real threat is lack of quality\u0014\nassurance, says Purdue University's Varro Tyler, a leading expert on \nherbs. \"There's so\u0014\nmuch junk out there.\" Among 21 ginseng products tested by \nConsumerLab.com, for\u0014\nexample, nearly half contained high levels of toxic pesticides or \nlead, and seven provided\u0014\nless than the listed amount of ginseng. Some scientists estimate as \nmany as 25 percent of\u0014\nsupplements aimed at \"men's health,\" particularly some of the \"herbal \nViagra\" products,\u0014\ncontain bovine or other animal organs, tissues, and extracts, which \nare not covered under\u0014\nregulations that protect U.S. consumers from animal products that \nharbor \"mad cow\"\u0014\ndisease. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Phytoestrogens. Even if products are pure, \nherbal experts are troubled by the use of\u0014\n\"natural\" remedies in \"unnatural\" ways. \"Take soybeans,\" says Adriane \nFugh-Berman, a\u0014\nclinical professor at George Washington School of Medicine. Soy in \nits natural state may\u0014\nprotect against cancer and heart disease, she says. \"But what happens \nwhen you take\u0014\ngenistein, the largest group of phytoestrogens in soybeans, \nconcentrate it into\u0014\n100-milligram tablets, and sell it as a 'natural' alternative to \nhormone replacement? We\u0014\nhave no idea whether these pills cause uterine growth, breast growth, \nor tumors.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In fact, new research on concentrated genistein \nshows the compound increases both the size and number of malignant \ntumors in mice. University of Missouri nutritional scientist\u0014\nRuth MacDonald, who conducted some of the genistein studies, says, \n\"Lifelong\u0014\nconsumption of soy foods may decrease breast cancer risk,\" as it \nappears to do among\u0014\nAsian women. But the phytoestrogen supplements \"are not really \n'natural.' You are taking\u0014\nfar in excess of what you get if you were eating soyit could be \n1,000- or even 10,000-fold.\" At that dose, she believes, cancer risk \nmay increase.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Functional foods. The CDC's Philen agrees with \nMacDonald. \"We're taking these products out of their original \ncontext. Another good example is putting dietary supplements in \nthings like snack chips.\" Last July, the watchdog group Center for \nScience in the Public Interest\u0014\nurged the FDA to halt the sale of more than 75 \"functional foods\" \nproduced by Snapple,\u0014\nProcter & Gamble, R. W. Knudsen Family, and other food giants. Last \nweek the FDA wrote\u0014\nto functional food manufacturers stressing that some herbal \ningredients being added to\u0014\nfoods have not been approved as additives and are not \"generally \nrecognized as safe.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The products, some labeled as \"supplements,\" \ncontain St.-John's-wort, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, kava kava, \nechinacea, dong quai, and others. \"They shouldn't be added to foods\u0014\nany more than Viagra or Prozac,\" says CSPI's Bruce Silverglade. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many scientists are open to the idea of \nfunctional foodswhen their claims can be\u0014\nvalidated. Calcium-fortified orange juice, cereals with folic acid to \nprevent birth defects,\u0014\noat bran and psyllium approved to reduce cholesterolthese, says \nSilverglade, are truly\u0014\nfunctional foods. \"But these other products are really modern-day \nsnake oil.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So what's to be done? Certainly, there is a \nneed for a better understanding of the\u0014\npharmacology of the supplements in widespread use. NIH's National \nCenter for\u0014\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine is performing clinical trials \nof St.-John's-wort for\u0014\ndepression, ginkgo for memory loss, saw palmetto for the treatment of \nbenign prostate\u0014\nproblems, and glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin for osteoarthritis. \nA study on\u0014\nglucosamine released last week in the Lancet showed that among a \nsmall group of patients\u0014\nwith osteoarthritis, the supplement reduced some pain and slowed \njoint degeneration. Next\u0014\nyear, NIH will begin trials of ephedra.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But studies will not help Sara Sullivan. She \nand her husband of 17 years recently bought their first home. \nSuddenly, they find themselves buried under a mountain of medical \nbills, and Sullivan is afraid to look to the future. \"It's a funny \nfeeling to wake up and think, 'Is this\u0014\nthe day I'm going to die?' \"\u0014",

Soon \nafter their landing all five were\u0014\n                    murdered. Their story was told in the \nbest-selling book, \"Through Gates of\u0014\n                    Splendor.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Originally the plane was thought to have been \nwashed away in the jungle river\u0014\n                    near to which it landed. But when MAF mechanic \nBill Clapp went to Ecuador in\u0014\n                    1993, he learned that parts of it were still \nthere. A search turned up a trail of\u0014\n                    parts, and the main section still intact, Assist \nCommunications reported. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Clapp spent three weeks reconstructing the plane. \nHe said that it serves as a\u0014\n                    memorial like the stones the Israelites piled up \nafter crossing the Jordan River.\u0014\n                    \"This [plane] tells the story of five guys that \ngave their lives, but yet had an\u0014\n                    impact on tens of thousands of churches, pastors \nand missionaries, who were\u0014\n                    influenced in some way or another...it's still \nbeing used after all these years. It\u0014\n                    still speaks.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Since the murders, many of the tribe -- then \nknown as Aucas, but actually the\u0014\n                    Waorani --have become Christians. Elliot's widow \nand Saint's sister both made\u0014\n                    successful contact with the tribe after the men's \ndeaths. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     2001 charismanews.com \u0014\n\u0014\n                    (Post date: February 20, 2001)\u0014",

Among the statues Taliban says it \nis destroying are two Buddhas, one 175 feet tall and the other 120 \nfeet tall.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"We consider what the Taliban government is \ndoing extremely strange and alien,\" said Dr. Muhammad Sahli, a former\u0014\n                     president of the Islamic Center of Virginia in \nRichmond.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Also this week, the Rev.

Falwell said \nwhen it comes to applying for federal funds, \"Islam should be out of \nthe door before\u0014\n                     they knock.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     He later said he was referring to Islamic \ncountries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya, but the Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations\u0014\n                     demanded an apology, according to The Associated \nPress.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"He clearly said that Islam teaches hate,\" said \na CAIR spokesman. \"I don't think you can misinterpret this.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Falwell also said on the Internet, \"I think \nthere's clear evidence that the Islam religion, wherever it has \nmajority control - and I\u0014\n                     can name a dozen countries - doesn't even allow \npeople of other faiths to express themselves or evangelize or to \nexist in their\u0014\n                     presence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Sahli said Falwell is wrong because the only \nMuslim place that doesn't allow Christians is Mecca in Saudi Arabia.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     In reference to the Taliban, Sahli said that \nwhile the teachings of Islam are the same for everyone, \"some \nMuslims, due to\u0014\n                     ignorance or zealous feelings, misinterpret what \nIslam requires them to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Although Islam forbids the representation of God \nby images, Islam does not say to destroy the statues, Sahli said. \nAbout 95\u0014\n                     percent of the people in Afghanistan are Muslim, \nand Muslims are not worshipping the statues, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Imam Hisham Ahmed of the Islamic Society of \nGreater Richmond noted that Muslims lived in Egypt for years along \nwith the\u0014\n                     Coptics. No statues were destroyed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     He added that what the Taliban is doing is not \nin line with the Islamic teaching of tolerance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Islam is derived from the word 'peace,'\" he \nsaid. \"Everyone has the full right to believe in what they want to \nbelieve in.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Ahmed said he would never worship an idol.

Murrah Federal Building. No foreign terrorists \nor domestic militias helped him, he says. \"The truth is, I blew up \nthe Murrah Building. And isn't it kind of scary that one man could\u0014\nreap this kind of hell?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                 \"He has never expressed one ounce of remorse for the \nOklahoma City bombing,\" Herbeck tells PrimeTime, though McVeigh did \nget choked up when he spoke about once killing a gopher.\u0014\n\u0014\n                 Dirty for Dirty\u0014\n\u0014\n                 When the bomb went off, McVeigh was two blocks away. \nHe says he didn't look back and his feet were lifted off the ground \nby the blast's force.

If\u0014\nyou have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on \nstage is no\u0014\nsmall achievement for him. He was stricken with polio as a child, and \nso he\u0014\nhas braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo see him walk across the stage one step at a time, painfully and\u0014\nslowly, is an unforgettable sight. He walks painfully, yet \nmajestically, until he\u0014\nreaches his chair. Then he sits down, slowly, puts his crutches on \nthe floor,\u0014\nundoes the clasps on his legs, tucks one foot back and extends the \nother foot\u0014\nforward. Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his\u0014\nchin, nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.  By now, the \naudience is\u0014\nused to this ritual. They sit quietly while he makes his way across \nthe stage \u0014\nto his chair. They remain reverently silent while he undoes the \nclasps on his \u0014\nlegs. They wait until he is ready to play.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this time, something went wrong. Just as he finished the first few\u0014\nbars, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it snap \n-it\u0014\nwent off like gunfire across the room. There was no mistaking what \nthat sound\u0014\nmeant. \u0014\nThere was no mistaking what he had to do.  People who were there that\u0014\nnight thought to themselves: \"We figured that he would have to get \nup, put\u0014\non the clasps again, pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage \n- to\u0014\neither find another violin or else find another string for this one.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then\u0014\nsignaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he \nplayed from\u0014\nwhere he had left off. And he played with such passion and such power \nand such\u0014\npurity as they had never heard before. Of course, anyone knows that \nit is\u0014\nimpossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. I know \nthat, and you\u0014\nknow that, but that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that.  You \ncould\u0014\nsee him modulating, changing, recomposing the piece in his head.  At \none\u0014\npoint, it sounded like he was de-tuning the strings to get new sounds \nfrom them\u0014\nthat they had never made before.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room. And then\u0014\npeople rose and cheered. There was an extraordinary outburst of \napplause from\u0014\nevery corner of the auditorium. We were all on our feet, screaming and\u0014\ncheering, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated \nwhat he had\u0014\ndone.\u0014\nHe smiled, wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quiet us,\u0014\nand then he said, not boastfully, but in a quiet, pensive, reverent \ntone,\u0014\n\"You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much \nmusic you\u0014\ncan still make with what you have left.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat a powerful line that is. It has stayed in my mind ever since I\u0014\nheard it. And who knows? Perhaps that is the [way] of life-not just \nfor artists\u0014\nbut for all of us.  So, perhaps our task in this shaky, fast-changing,\u0014\nbewildering world in which we live is to make music, at first with \nall that we\u0014\nhave, and then, when that is no longer possible, to make music with \nwhat we have left.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Jack Riemer, Houston Chronicle\u0014",

    "words": "My Quilt\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I faced my Maker at the last judgment, I knelt\u0014\nbefore the Lord along with all the other souls. Before each of us \nlaid our\u0014\nlives like the squares of a quilt in many piles.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn Angel sat before each of us sewing our quilt squares together into \u0014\na tapestry that is our life. But as my angel took each piece of cloth \noff  the pile, I noticed how ragged and empty each of my squares was. \nThey were filled with giant holes. Each square was labeled with a part\u0014\nof my life that had been difficult, the challenges and temptations I \nwas faced with in everyday life. I saw hardships that I endured, \nwhich were the largest holes of all. I glanced around me.\u0014\n\u0014\nNobody else had such squares. Other than a tiny hole here and there, \nthe other\u0014\ntapestries were filled with rich color and the bright hues of \nworldly  fortune.\u0014\n\u0014\nI gazed upon my own life and was disheartened. My angel was sewing \nthe ragged pieces of cloth together, threadbare and empty, like \nbinding air.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally the time came when each life was to be displayed, held up to \nthe light, the scrutiny of truth. The others rose, each in turn, \nholding up their tapestries. So filled their lives had been. My angel \nlooked upon me, and nodded for me to rise. My gaze dropped to the \nground in shame. I hadn't  had all the earthly fortunes. I had love \nin my life, and laughter. But there had also been\u0014\ntrials of illness, and death, and false accusations that took from me \nmy world as I knew it. I had to start over many times.\u0014\n\u0014\n I often struggled with the temptation to quit, only to somehow muster\u0014\nthe strength to pick up and begin again. I spent many nights on my \nknees in prayer, asking for help  and guidance in my life. I had \noften been held up to ridicule, which I  endured painfully, each time \noffering it up to the Father in hopes that I would not melt within my \nskin beneath the judgmental gaze of those who unfairly judged me.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now, I had to face the truth. My life was what it was, and I had \nto accept it for what it was. I rose and slowly lifted the combined \nsquares of my life to the light. An awe-filled gasp filled the air. I \ngazed around at the others who stared at me with wide eyes. Then, I \nlooked upon the tapestry before me. Light flooded the many holes, \ncreating an image, the face of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen our Lord stood before me, with warmth and  love in His eyes. He \nsaid, every time you gave over your life to Me, it became My life, My \nhardships, and My struggles. Each point of light in your\u0014\nlife is when you stepped aside and let Me shine through, until there \nwas more of Me than there\u0014\nwas of you.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay all our quilts be threadbare and worn, allowing Christ to shine  \nthrough.\u0014",

    "words": "Myth Matters\u0014\n\u0014\n                      C. S. Lewis bequeathed us a method and a \nlanguage for sharing\u0014\n                      the gospel with the modern and postmodern world.\u0014\n                      By Louis A. Markos | posted 4/17/01\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As evangelical christians living at the dawn of \nthe 21st\u0014\n                      century, we often lack a method and a language \nfor\u0014\n                      addressing the challenges of our current age. \nYes, we have\u0014\n                      the will and the passion to defend our faith, \nthe biblical\u0014\n                      knowledge to support our arguments, and often \nthe Christian\u0014\n                      charity to couch those arguments in love. Yet \nfor all our\u0014\n                      passion, knowledge, and love, something in our \napproach is\u0014\n                      lacking; something about our vocabulary is \ndeficient. We\u0014\n                      seem powerless to convict, engage, and \ntransform the\u0014\n                      secular world. Consider three examples: \u0014\n\u0014\n                       The word reaches our churches, colleges, and \nseminaries\u0014\n                      that a resurgence of paganism is sweeping the \ncountry, that\u0014\n                      New Age philosophies are rampant and that the \nserious\u0014\n                      worship of Sophia (Greek for wisdom) is chanted \nin the\u0014\n                      not-so-hidden recesses of our mainline \ndenominations, and\u0014\n                      we are unsure of how to respond. Many \nevangelicals can\u0014\n                      expose the heresies that lie behind such \npractices; of\u0014\n                      apologists we have no lack. But how adept are \nwe at\u0014\n                      identifying the deeper spiritual needs that the \nNew Age\u0014\n                      seems to be meeting? How well-versed are we in \nthe tenets of\u0014\n                      paganism and their challenge to the early \nchurch? And how\u0014\n                      well do we understand that the mythical corn \ngod of pagan\u0014\n                      ritual represents a yearning that should end \nits fulfillment in\u0014\n                      the historical, incarnate God of the Bible?\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The scientific community joins forces with the \nacademy and\u0014\n                      the media to ridicule us for our belief in \nGod's creation of the\u0014\n                      world, and perhaps to sigh together in \ndisbelief that modern,\u0014\n                      educated men and women could accept as literal \nevents the\u0014\n                      miracles recorded in the Bible. Certainly we've \ngotten better at\u0014\n                      answering such critiques; we tend to be less \ninsular than we\u0014\n                      were in the past, and we sometimes manage to \nmove from\u0014\n                      defensiveness to shaping the debate. But we're \nstill fighting\u0014\n                      our battles on \"their\" turf, on a scientific \nand philosophical\u0014\n                      groundwork that was defined during the \nEnlightenment and all\u0014\n                      but completed by the end of the Victorian Age. \nScientists\u0014\n                      such as Michael Behe have done a remarkable job \nat\u0014\n                      countering modernists' data, and law professor \nPhilip Johnson\u0014\n                      has exposed the flaws in their logic, but we've \nyet to shift the\u0014\n                      playing field from the theories to the \ncompeting assumptions\u0014\n                      that underlie those theories. We've yet to \neducate ourselves,\u0014\n                      much less the culture, that many of the \n\"givens\" we take for\u0014\n                      granted (most notably, that the foundation of \nall true\u0014\n                      knowledge is material, empirical, and \nquantifiable) are as\u0014\n                      recent as they are unproven.\u0014\n\u0014\n                       The modern and postmodern literati are fast \ndethroning\u0014\n                      language and the arts as bearers of divine \nmeaningor, for\u0014\n                      that matter, of any meaning. As Christians we \nanswer by\u0014\n                      producing our own works of art: some of them \noriginal\u0014\n                      masterpieces of lasting value, but most of them \nshort-lived\u0014\n                      cannon fodder for a Christian subculture with \nplenty of surplus\u0014\n                      capital. But, again, we persist in speaking \ntheir language, in\u0014\n                      accepting their dichotomies, their theories, \ntheir values. The\u0014\n                      few literary and theoretical critiques we do \nproduce are often\u0014\n                      too arcane to reach a broader public, and tend \nto be\u0014\n                      intimidated by, and even adulatory of, the \nacademy they are\u0014\n                      critiquing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A brave few are breaking from this tendency and \nare\u0014\n                      championing a more traditional view of art that \nis grounded in\u0014\n                      the Incarnation. However, the necessary link \nbetween what\u0014\n                      happened once for all in a stable at Bethlehem \nand what\u0014\n                      occurs on a lesser level in the creation and \nappreciation of\u0014\n                      great art is little explored by evangelical \ncritics and even less\u0014\n                      put into practice by evangelical artists.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At first glance these three examples may seem \nwholly\u0014\n                      unrelated: the first, after all, concerns \ntheological issues,\u0014\n                      while the second and third are philosophical \nand aesthetic in\u0014\n                      focus and scope. But look a little closer. In \nall three cases,\u0014\n                      we catch a glimpse of a church that knows how \nto address\u0014\n                      the symptoms but seems to lack the will to face \nthe disease\u0014\n                      head on, that prunes the stunted branches so \nnicely while\u0014\n                      remaining oblivious to the rotting of the roots.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We need to dig deeper to reach those unstated \nassumptions\u0014\n                      that gird and control our contemporary world, \neven as we\u0014\n                      must broaden our perspective to encompass both \nthe\u0014\n                      multifaceted nature of the modernist and \npostmodernist ethos\u0014\n                      and the equally multifaceted critique that we \nas evangelicals\u0014\n                      must offer in response. But where shall we find \nthe methods\u0014\n                      and the language to construct such a critique?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      An Apologist Steeped in Myth\u0014\n                      The 20th century, which saw the full flowering \nand wide\u0014\n                      dissemination of modernist thought, also \nproduced one of\u0014\n                      modernism's greatest and most enduring critics: \nC. S. Lewis.\u0014\n                      Born in Belfast in 1898, Lewis spent the first \nhalf of his life as\u0014\n                      an atheist and a materialist for whom the \nGospels shared the\u0014\n                      same mythic-archetypal (nonhistorical) status \nas Greek and\u0014\n                      Norse mythology but lacked their aesthetic \nbeauty and\u0014\n                      imaginative power. Though the young Lewis loved \nall things\u0014\n                      Homeric and Wagnerian, and though he went \nthrough a brief\u0014\n                      period in which he lusted after occult \nknowledge and idolized\u0014\n                      the more esoteric poetry of William Butler \nYeats, his natural\u0014\n                      temperament was that of a skeptic and a stoic. \nHe distrusted\u0014\n                      thinking that was either emotionally charged \n(like that of his\u0014\n                      estranged father) or logically imprecise, and \ntended to isolate\u0014\n                      himself in a pristine world of books. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This twin propensity for intellectual precision \nand emotional\u0014\n                      self-protection grew during the early years of \nWorld War I,\u0014\n                      when the shy, unathletic Lewis (who bitterly \nhated the\u0014\n                      boarding school he was attending) got the \nchance to study\u0014\n                      under a private tutor. His tutor, William \nKirkpatrick (or the\u0014\n                      Great Knock, as Lewis called him) was an \nobsessively\u0014\n                      rational thinker of that old and venerable \nschool of skeptical\u0014\n                      Scotch empiricists of whom David Hume is the \ntitular head.\u0014\n                      From the very moment Lewis arrived at Great \nBookham,\u0014\n                      Surrey, Kirkpatrick beat into his head the need \nfor clear,\u0014\n                      rational thinking free from all subjective \nspeculation and\u0014\n                      emotional murkiness. Thus, when the nervous, \nfledgling\u0014\n                      Lewis, desperate to make conversation, noted \nthat Surrey\u0014\n                      was less \"wild\" than he had expected, \nKirkpatrick subjected\u0014\n                      him to an immediate, deadly serious inquisition \nabout the\u0014\n                      basis of his statement. The inquisition did not \nlast long; it\u0014\n                      quickly became apparent to Lewis that, as his \nexpectations\u0014\n                      of Surrey were wholly unfounded, and as he did \nnot even\u0014\n                      know what he meant by the word wild, his \nstatement was\u0014\n                      both illogical and meaningless and had best be \ndropped.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most students would have crumbled under such \nrelentless\u0014\n                      logic; to Lewis (who later retold the story in \nhis spiritual\u0014\n                      autobiography, Surprised by Joy) it was \"red \nbeef and strong\u0014\n                      \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein.\" Lewis \ncommitted himself to absolute clarity of thought\u0014\n                      and to assessing the assumptions on which our \nideas are\u0014\n                      based.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ironically, though Kirkpatrick was an atheist, \nhe was partly\u0014\n                      responsible for shaping the critical faculties \nof the 20th\u0014\n                      century's greatest Christian apologist. When \nLewis, after\u0014\n                      many years of intellectual soul-searching, \nfinally embraced\u0014\n                      Christian orthodoxy in 1931, he did not simply \njettison his\u0014\n                      early mental training for an emotional, \npietistic faith. Rather,\u0014\n                      he marshaled the full forces of his mind in \ndefending what he\u0014\n                      called \"mere\" Christianity (the central \ndoctrines of the\u0014\n                      Apostles' Creed that all believing Christians \nshare). In such\u0014\n                      works as Mere Christianity, Miracles, The \nAbolition of Man,\u0014\n                      and The Problem of Pain, Lewis directly \nchallenged the\u0014\n                      modernist faith in the all-pervasive \nexplanatory power of\u0014\n                      evolution, asserting that such things as \nethics, religion, and\u0014\n                      reason could not have evolved but must have had \na divine\u0014\n                      origin. Unlike so many contemporary Christian \nacademics\u0014\n                      who passively (if not unconsciously) accept the \nexisting\u0014\n                      assumptions on which their discipline is based \nand then\u0014\n                      meekly ask that God's name be mentioned now and \nthen,\u0014\n                      Lewis went on the offensive and challenged the \nassumptions\u0014\n                      themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Had Lewis brought to Christian apologetics only \nhis skills as\u0014\n                      a logician, his works would not have been as \neffective. The\u0014\n                      mature Lewis tempered his logic with a love for \nbeauty,\u0014\n                      wonder, and magic. His conversion to Christ not \nonly freed his\u0014\n                      mind from the bonds of a narrow stoicism; it \nfreed his heart to\u0014\n                      embrace fully his earlier passion for \nmythology. During his\u0014\n                      overly rational years, Lewis felt the need to \nsubmerge his\u0014\n                      youthful love for fairy stories; his newfound \nfaith in a God-Man\u0014\n                      who died and rose again reopened for him the \nenchanted\u0014\n                      world of his childhood. Apart from this dash of \nfairy dust,\u0014\n                      Lewis might have become yet another dry, overly \nsystematic\u0014\n                      thinker (an Aristotle or Aquinas); instead, he \nspeaks to us\u0014\n                      with all the power and life-changing force of a \nPlato, a Dante,\u0014\n                      and a Bunyan. Nearly all of Lewis's insights \ninto the Christian\u0014\n                      faith can be traced back to a comment made by \none of the\u0014\n                      church fathers or one of the medieval \nscholastics, but then\u0014\n                      these commentaries are seldom read, except by \nspecialists,\u0014\n                      while Lewis's works continue to sell, \nchallenge, and convict in\u0014\n                      the millions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A Universe Alive with God's Presence\u0014\n                      Lewis understood both the heart that yearns for \nGod and the\u0014\n                      mind that seeks to know him. Just as Plato's \ngreatest\u0014\n                      dialogues begin with a logical defense of, say, \nthe immortality\u0014\n                      of the soul, and then end with a myth in which \nthat rather\u0014\n                      stale doctrine leaps into vital life, so Lewis \nwas never content\u0014\n                      merely to prove the existence of God or defend \nthe necessity\u0014\n                      of a key Christian doctrine. Yes, Lewis will \nprovide us with the\u0014\n                      scholastic proof, and he will do so in what \nWordsworth called\u0014\n                      \"the real language of men,\" but he will not let \nus rest until we\u0014\n                      acknowledge and feel the overwhelming reality \nand presence\u0014\n                      of that God whom Lewis describes, variously, as \nthe hunter,\u0014\n                      the lover, and the bridegroom. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Evangelicals often find it difficult to respond \nto the growing\u0014\n                      power of the New Age in all its many \ncombinations and\u0014\n                      permutations. Many of us attended schools where \nmythology\u0014\n                      was more or less off-limits and where paganism \nas a system\u0014\n                      of thought was neither explained nor even \nacknowledged. But\u0014\n                      then, of course, there is a surprise here. Most \nof the young\u0014\n                      people who are slowly gravitating toward some \nform of New\u0014\n                      Age spirituality are themselves ignorant of \npaganism's\u0014\n                      classical past. They sense within themselves a \nspiritual\u0014\n                      vacuum and turn toward the only venue that \nseems to be\u0014\n                      speaking their language.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Often their decision to abandon traditional \nChristianity for the\u0014\n                      mystical allures of neopaganism stems less from \nan informed\u0014\n                      rejection of doctrine than from a \ndissatisfaction with the\u0014\n                      modernist world and its exclusive focus on \nobjective,\u0014\n                      empirical knowledge. To their minds, modernism \nhas killed\u0014\n                      nature and silenced the universe, and the \nchurch has done\u0014\n                      nothing to restore the cosmos to life. Here is \nan irony. In the\u0014\n                      Middle Ages, Christians held a view of the \nuniverse as a place\u0014\n                      teeming with life and meaning and purpose. \nThough the best\u0014\n                      informed of the theologians steered clear of \nany rigid\u0014\n                      determinism that would find our fates written \nindelibly in the\u0014\n                      stars, they nevertheless knew that the stars do \nhave\u0014\n                      something to do with us and that the \nGod-fashioned cosmos\u0014\n                      was not just our house but our home. Certainly \nSt. Francis of\u0014\n                      Assisi knew this, and he celebrated it in his \n\"Canticle of\u0014\n                      Brother Sun.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We post-Reformation, post-Enlightenment \nChristians are too\u0014\n                      often uncomfortable with such nature talk. On \nthe one hand,\u0014\n                      we fear that our doctrines will become diluted \nwith pagan\u0014\n                      elements, that Christianity will fade into the \nrealm of myth. On\u0014\n                      the other hand, we are suspicious of any \nlanguage that\u0014\n                      resembles pantheismnot so much because we are\u0014\n                      Christians as because we are children of a \nmodernist world\u0014\n                      that has defined nature as a thing to be \nstudied rather than\u0014\n                      loved, and the unseen world as a non-thing to \nbe explained\u0014\n                      away or, better, ignored. Our fears are not \ntotally baseless,\u0014\n                      but fears they are, and they often prevent us \nfrom\u0014\n                      understanding the deep hunger that draws so \nmany into the\u0014\n                      precincts of the New Age.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis can help us address our fears and fashion \na more\u0014\n                      effective response that strikes more closely at \nthe root of the\u0014\n                      problem. Lewis's approach, which surfaces \nthroughout his\u0014\n                      published works, is essentially twofold. As a \nliterary theorist\u0014\n                      and aesthetic historian whose works still \ncommand respect in\u0014\n                      the secular academic world, Lewis was \nresponsible for\u0014\n                      rehabilitating the reputation of medieval \nliterature and for\u0014\n                      explaining in lay terms the intricacies of the \nmedieval cosmic\u0014\n                      model that undergirds Dante's Divine Comedy. \nThose\u0014\n                      interested in the minutiae of this model are \nencouraged to\u0014\n                      read Lewis's The Discarded Image, but if you \nhave already\u0014\n                      read his Chronicles of Narnia or his Space \nTrilogy, you have\u0014\n                      already absorbed much of this model. Lewis saw \nthe need not\u0014\n                      only to explain and defend the medieval model \nbut to embody\u0014\n                      it, to give it form and substance, in his \nfictional works.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Our age cannot adequately answer the New Age \ncritique of\u0014\n                      modernist science and religion because so few \nof us know\u0014\n                      how it feels to live in a universe that is \nalive with its Father's\u0014\n                      presence. Lewis steeped himself in that more \nvibrant,\u0014\n                      old-European world that stretches from the \nancient Greeks to\u0014\n                      Samuel Johnson; indeed, he argued that the \nRenaissance\u0014\n                      never happened, that the reigning view of God, \nman, and the\u0014\n                      universe did not change (as is so often taught) \nwhen the\u0014\n                      ancient Greek texts were rediscovered around \n1500 but when\u0014\n                      the Enlightenment finally established itself \naround 1800. In a\u0014\n                      famous phrase, Lewis compared himself to a \ndinosaur, to one\u0014\n                      who still believed, embodied, and felt in his \nbones the ideals,\u0014\n                      the values, and the worldview that invigorate \nthe work of such\u0014\n                      Christian poets as Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, \nDonne, and\u0014\n                      Milton. Much has been written in the last \ndecade (and praise\u0014\n                      God for it) of the need for evangelicals to \nengage their minds\u0014\n                      more fully; Lewis would direct us toward \nanother kind of\u0014\n                      renewed engagement: the revival of our capacity \nfor wonder. If\u0014\n                      we are to win back the neopagans, we need to \nrediscover our\u0014\n                      awe at the majesty of God and his Creation, an \nawe that has\u0014\n                      little to do with the current warfare over \nworship styles and\u0014\n                      everything to do with that breathless sense of \nthe numinous\u0014\n                      that we first encountered in the nursery when a \ntimeless tale\u0014\n                      from mythology or folklore or legend ushered us \ninto the world\u0014\n                      of faerie.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Myth That Is Fact\u0014\n                      But this renewal of wonder represents only one \nprong of a\u0014\n                      Lewis-inspired response to the New Age. It is \nnot enough only\u0014\n                      to revive the part of us that yearns for myths; \nwe must also\u0014\n                      channel it properly. One of Lewis's greatest \nservices as an\u0014\n                      apologist was to demonstrate that in the person \nof Christ we\u0014\n                      encounter a figure whose life, death, and \nresurrection, far from\u0014\n                      standing in opposition to the mythic heroes of \npaganism, in\u0014\n                      fact present a literal, historical fulfillment \nof what all those\u0014\n                      earlier myths were really about. To put it \nanother way, just as\u0014\n                      Christ came not to abolish the Law but to \nfulfill it, so he came\u0014\n                      not to put an end to myth but to take all that \nis most\u0014\n                      essential in the myth up into himself and make \nit real. In\u0014\n                      \"Myth Became Fact,\" a seminal essay \nanthologized in God in\u0014\n                      the Dock, Lewis argues forcibly that \u0014\n\u0014\n                           [t]he heart of Christianity is a myth \nwhich is\u0014\n                           also a fact. The old myth of the Dying God,\u0014\n                           without ceasing to be myth, comes down from\u0014\n                           the heaven of legend and imagination to the\u0014\n                           earth of history. It happensat a \nparticular\u0014\n                           date, in a particular place, followed by \ndefinable\u0014\n                           historical consequences. We pass from a\u0014\n                           Balder or an Osiris, dying nobody knows \nwhen\u0014\n                           or where, to a historical Person crucified \n(it is\u0014\n                           all in order) under Pontius Pilate. By \nbecoming\u0014\n                           fact it does not cease to be myth: that is \nthe\u0014\n                           miracle. God is more than god, not less:\u0014\n                           Christ is more than Balder, not less. We \nmust\u0014\n                           not be ashamed of the mythical radiance\u0014\n                           resting on our theology. We must not be\u0014\n                           nervous about \"parallels\" and \"pagan \nChrists\":\u0014\n                           they ought to be thereit would be a \nstumbling\u0014\n                           block if they weren't. We must not, in \nfalse\u0014\n                           spirituality, withhold our imaginative \nwelcome. If\u0014\n                           God chooses to be mythopoeicand is not the\u0014\n                           sky itself a mythshall we refuse to be\u0014\n                           mythopathic?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      If we could understand fully all that is \nsuggested in this\u0014\n                      passage and apply it to our interactions with \nneopaganism,\u0014\n                      we would find ourselves better able to address \nthe needs of a\u0014\n                      growing segment of our society. As \nevangelicals, we are\u0014\n                      quick to say with Paul that we are not ashamed \nof the gospel;\u0014\n                      let that boldness include not only the \ndoctrinal elements of\u0014\n                      the Good News, but also its elements that \nanswer the\u0014\n                      questions posted by great myths.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The urge to return to paganism is not so much \nan offshoot of\u0014\n                      modernist thought as it is a reaction against \nmodernism's\u0014\n                      narrow focus on the material world. This puts \nChristians in the\u0014\n                      precarious position of criticizing the excesses \nof New Age\u0014\n                      thought while yet participating in its central \ngoal of restoring a\u0014\n                      spiritual focus to a society that generally \nresists any serious\u0014\n                      consideration of the supernatural.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We have to walk a fine line between the twin \nextremes of\u0014\n                      secular humanism and gnostic spiritualism; \nbetween a deistic\u0014\n                      ethos that doubts either that God speaks to or \nintervenes in\u0014\n                      the world (in any case, he has no Son) and a \nmore\u0014\n                      pantheistic ethos that rather blissfully \nasserts that we are all\u0014\n                      the mouths and eyes and hands of God. Perhaps \nthese two\u0014\n                      opposing sides of the modernist coin can help \nexplain why\u0014\n                      the academy is absolutist in its denial of the \nscientific or\u0014\n                      rational validity of all faith claims that rest \non revelation yet is\u0014\n                      strongly relativistic in gauging personal \nethical decisions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I allude partly to a phenomenon that has come \nto be known\u0014\n                      as the failure of the Enlightenment Project: \nthe failure of\u0014\n                      philosophers like Kant to refound all morality \non rational\u0014\n                      (rather than supernatural) grounds. Such \nChristian thinkers as\u0014\n                      Alisdair MacIntyre, Lesslie Newbigin, and Mark \nNoll have\u0014\n                      done a fine job demonstrating how this \nseemingly noble\u0014\n                      attempt to \"save\" morality by giving it a more \n\"secure\" basis\u0014\n                      has only resulted in a split between science \nand religion,\u0014\n                      facts and values, history and myth, observation \nand faith; this\u0014\n                      split has marginalized the voice of \nChristianity in the public\u0014\n                      sphere and rendered its doctrines, its \nperspectives, and its\u0014\n                      claims suspect. The efforts made by Christian \nscholars in this\u0014\n                      area are, I think, exhilarating and are helping \npoint the church\u0014\n                      in the right direction; here too, however, we \ncan still learn\u0014\n                      much from Lewis's apologetic approach.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Exposing Inductive Reasoning\u0014\n                      Just as Lewis was adept at delving into the \nroots of paganism\u0014\n                      and properly assessing where those roots are \ncompatible with\u0014\n                      those of Christianity, so was he equally adept \nat exposing the\u0014\n                      presuppositions upon which modernism stands. \nLewis begins\u0014\n                      by pointing out something most apologists since \nhave failed\u0014\n                      to take into account: that while traditional \nWestern/Christian\u0014\n                      philosophy rests on deductive logic, modernist \nthought\u0014\n                      systems (from science to anthropology, \neconomics to\u0014\n                      psychology) claim to rest exclusively on \ninduction. Induction\u0014\n                      is a kind of reasoning that begins with \nobserved facts and\u0014\n                      figures and then proceeds upward toward a more \nabstract\u0014\n                      hypothesis or inference, while deduction begins \nwith abstract\u0014\n                      premises and general assumptions and works its \nway\u0014\n                      downward toward a specific conclusion. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Christian thought (like the Platonic \nmetaphysics that\u0014\n                      preceded it) is deductive, for it begins with a \npriori\u0014\n                      assumptions that must be accepted as givens \nbefore logical\u0014\n                      thought can begin (e.g., the existence of God, \nthe authority of\u0014\n                      Scripture, the immortality of the soul, the \npossibility and\u0014\n                      reliability of divine revelation). In contrast, \nmodernism claims\u0014\n                      that its conclusions are based solely on \nempirical\u0014\n                      observation, that its conclusions are \n\"objective,\" unrestrained\u0014\n                      by any presuppositions.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Again and again in his writings, Lewis seeks to \nexpose\u0014\n                      modernist induction for what it most often is: \na disguised form\u0014\n                      of deduction. When a liberal theologian argues \nthat the\u0014\n                      Synoptic Gospels (all of which include Jesus' \nprophecy of the\u0014\n                      destruction of the Temple) must have reached \ntheir final form\u0014\n                      after A.D. 70 (the year the Temple was \ndestroyed), he is\u0014\n                      obscuring an assumption (namely, that \npredictive prophecy\u0014\n                      does not occur) that acts as a motivating and \ncontrolling\u0014\n                      factor in his research. Likewise, modernists \nwho continually\u0014\n                      seek \"natural\" or \"rational\" explanations for \nthe miracles of\u0014\n                      the Bible do not begin their research \nobjectively and then\u0014\n                      conclude (solely on the basis of their \nobservations) that the\u0014\n                      parting of the Red Sea was not a supernatural \nevent; rather,\u0014\n                      they begin with the unproved \"given\" that \nmiracles don't occur\u0014\n                      and thus are forced by their own \npresuppositions to formulate\u0014\n                      a \"scientific\" explanation for the miracle.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Despite the exalted claims of modernist \ninduction, Lewis\u0014\n                      writes in the first chapter of Miracles, when \nit comes to the\u0014\n                      supernatural, \"seeing is not believing. What \nwe learn from\u0014\n                      experience depends on the kind of philosophy we \nbring to\u0014\n                      experience. The result of our historical \nenquiries thus\u0014\n                      depends on the philosophical views [i.e., the a \npriori\u0014\n                      assumptions] which we have been holding before \nwe even\u0014\n                      begin to look at the evidence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Viewed alone, this passage might suggest that \nLewis was a\u0014\n                      proto-postmodernist, one who would deconstruct \nall truth\u0014\n                      claims by exposing their insecure (and \nunfounded)\u0014\n                      assumptions. He was not. If he did some \ndemolishing of\u0014\n                      modernist pretensions to the truth, it was only \nso that he (like\u0014\n                      Socrates and Plato) could follow this \ndialectical\u0014\n                      housecleaning with a renewed effort to redefine \nthe true nature\u0014\n                      and origin of man, of religion, and of reality \nitself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Indeed, in this vein, one of Lewis's most \nimportant critiques of\u0014\n                      modernism involved his questioning of the \nmodernist\u0014\n                      assumption that higher things are always copies \nof lower\u0014\n                      things, such as Marx's claim that ideology \nmerely reflects\u0014\n                      underlying economic forces; Darwin's belief \nthat more\u0014\n                      complex forms of life (like humans) evolved \nfrom lower, less\u0014\n                      complex structures; and, most important for \nLewis, Freud's\u0014\n                      insistence that love and charity are but a \nsublimated form of\u0014\n                      lust. Much of Lewis's creative and apologetic \nenergy (in both\u0014\n                      his fiction and nonfiction) was devoted to \ndemonstrating that\u0014\n                      lower things are, in fact, copies of higher, \nthat heaven is the\u0014\n                      real place and our world but the shadow.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Word Made Fiction\u0014\n                      While evangelicals have garnered many victories \nin resisting\u0014\n                      contemporary anti-Christian worldviews, one \narea has not\u0014\n                      received enough attention from evangelical \ncircles: aesthetics.\u0014\n                      Yes, we are quite aware of the ethical dangers \nof\u0014\n                      postmodernism and deconstruction; we're good at \n\"sniffing\u0014\n                      out\" Nietzsche, and events like the Columbine \nshootings have\u0014\n                      taught us that value-free education quickly \nleads to nihilism.\u0014\n                      We realize too that to attack the \nmeaningfulness of language\u0014\n                      is finally to attack both the Scriptures and \nthe classic creeds.\u0014\n                      But what often lies just outside our Christian \nradar is the\u0014\n                      threat that postmodern theories pose to the \nintegrity of the\u0014\n                      arts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such theories (that begin with the linguistic \nstudies of\u0014\n                      Ferdinand de Saussure and reach their climax in \nthe essays\u0014\n                      of Jacques Derrida) hold that the words we use \nare not\u0014",

The\u0014\n                      values that historically shaped our country's \nmoral\u0014\n                      consciousness have been shattered.

In the past one might have challenged \na moral point\u0014\n                      through reasoned argument, appealing to \ncommonly accepted\u0014\n                      standards of right and wrong. But today, as I \nhave discovered\u0014\n                      lecturing on campuses, young people have never \nbeen\u0014\n                      exposed to moral philosophy, but are \nindoctrinated instead\u0014\n                      into a perspective that treats morality as one \nof many\u0014\n                      strategies for self-development. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The upshot is that rational arguments no longer \nwork. So how\u0014\n                      do we make a difference? How do we affect moral\u0014\n                      sensibilities? A few years ago over lunch, my \nfriend Bill\u0014\n                      Bennett suggested that people today are all but \nimpervious to\u0014\n                      moral philosophy and are more likely to be \nmoved by moral\u0014\n                      literature. His point was proved when The Book \nof Virtues, a\u0014\n                      collection of classic moral stories, became a \nmega-hit. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Now there are two new books with a similar \npurpose: Vigan\u0014\n                      Guroian's Tending the Heart of Virtue: How \nClassic Stories\u0014\n                      Awaken a Child's Imagination, and for adults Os \nGuiness and\u0014\n                      Louise Cowan have edited Invitation to the \nClassics, essays\u0014\n                      by 50 Christian scholars on classic literature. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      These authors are on to something, pointing \nperhaps to an\u0014\n                      important way for Christians to engage the \ncultureby\u0014\n                      appealing to the moral imagination through \nclassic literature.\u0014\n                      Stories change us because they reach the whole \nperson, not\u0014\n                      just the cognitive faculty. As we read, we \nidentify with\u0014\n                      characters who demonstrate courage and \nself-sacrifice,\u0014\n                      vicariously making choices along with themand \nin the\u0014\n                      process, our own character is shaped. As C. S. \nLewis writes,\u0014\n                      \"I become a thousand men, yet remaining \nmyself.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many classics were composed by great Christian \nwriters and\u0014\n                      can even help draw people to faith. Louise \nCowan tells how\u0014\n                      she lost her childhood faith while in \nuniversity religion\u0014\n                      coursesonly to regain it later in literature \ncourses! Tracing\u0014\n                      the Christian themes in Shakespeare spoke to \nher heart in a\u0014\n                      way that discursive theological treatises \nfailed to do. I myself\u0014\n                      have gained from Dostoevsky's novels many of my \ndeepest\u0014\n                      convictions about ethics, crime, sin, and \ngrace. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So if we don't like the image of America we're \nseeing in the\u0014\n                      mirror, a good place to start is by changing \nourselves: Read\u0014\n                      the classics and stimulate our own moral \nimagination. Then\u0014\n                      read them to our children, and pass them on to \nour friends. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Maybe we should rethink our strategy in the \nculture war as\u0014\n                      well. Instead of hurling rhetorical grenades, \nwe should support\u0014\n                      programs for reading the classics in schools, \ngetting people\u0014\n                      to think about enduring moral and spiritual \nthemes. For too\u0014\n                      long many Christians have tried to have an \nimpact through\u0014\n                      political activism alone. The lesson of the \ncurrent scandals is\u0014\n                      that the nation's wound runs much deeper than \npolitics.\u0014\n                      Politics is an expression of a culture, and \nthrowing out a\u0014\n                      President (or censuring him) will change little \nif he is merely a\u0014\n                      reflection of America's own values. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      We must find ways to change those values, and \nChristians\u0014\n                      are uniquely equipped for the task. Our model \nshould be the\u0014\n                      church after the fall of the Roman Empire: The \nmonks\u0014\n                      carefully guarded every book they could get \ntheir hands on,\u0014\n                      whether Christian theology or Greek and Roman \nphilosophy\u0014\n                      and literature, and then taught them to the \nbarbarians. It was\u0014\n                      the monasteries that preserved the best of the \npast, and then\u0014\n                      gradually recivilized Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      More important than the outcome of the next \nelection is the\u0014\n                      preservation of the riches of our literary and \nintellectual\u0014\n                      heritage so we can recivilize the modern \nbarbarians living\u0014\n                      around us. As G. K. Chesterton wrote, \"any man \nwho is cut\u0014\n                      off from the pastis a man most unjustly \ndisinherited.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Moreover, when a culture's history is \nneglected, says Donald\u0014\n                      Drew in Human Events, \"its sign-posts and \nlandmarks\u0014\n                      disappear,\" and it loses its sense of \ndirection. As the country\u0014\n                      wrestles now with its moral identity, \nChristians have an\u0014\n                      opportunity to help it regain its moral \ndirection, and literature\u0014\n                      may be one of the best landmarks we can offer. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  1999 by the author or Christianity \nToday\u0014\n                      International/Christianity Today magazine.

The Church of Scotland is battling to halt a decline in \nmembership and to defend itself against accusations that it is no \nlonger relevant. \u0014\n\u0014\nMinisters consulted by The Sunday Times this week echoed Bishop \nHolloway's comments that Christ was \"simply an extraordinary man\". \nThe moderator said it was far more important to know the teachings of \nJesus rather than \"worry about theological debates\". \"None of our \nlanguage can express fully who Jesus is,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"To call him Son of God is a very powerful way of making clear the \nbelief that I hold that God is in Jesus in a unique way. \"But for me \nthe power of that belief would be much lessened if I were expected to \nbelieve that Jesus was the Son of God in a biological, DNA sense.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible says that Jesus was literally God's son, born through the \nVirgin Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterest in the historical Jesus has been rekindled by the BBC \nprogramme Son of God, which recreates with computer-generated imagery \nthe Judea of 2000 years ago. The BBC has also tried to recreate the \nface of Jesus, using an ancient Jewish skull as a guide. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Sunday Times contacted 200 ministers this week, evenly spread \nacross the\u0014\ncountry's presbyteries, and asked them whether they believed Jesus of \nNazareth\u0014\nwas literally the Son of God, or whether that title was a metaphor. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf those consulted, 37 said they regarded it as a metaphor, while the \nrest said they believed in the Biblical title literally. \u0014\n\u0014\nRev Ken Froude of the St Brycedale Kirk in Kirkcaldy, said: \"I \nbelieve in the Son of God in a descriptive rather than a substantive \nway. \"But there is a real and meaningful description of Jesus as the \nSon of God which has a relevant and spiritual meaning for today.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRev Ian Petrie of St Andrew's in Dundee, added: \"As a title it is \nmore metaphorical. But it doesn't make it less important. Jesus is \nmore human than we are: his humanity and divinity are greater than \nours.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nRev Russell Moffat of Dyce, Aberdeen, said: \"Jesus is not the Son of \nGod in a literal sense that God was married and his wife had a child. \nThe Son of God is a figure of speech. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe added: \"Nobody takes it literally. Christians have always believed \nthe Son of God is a figure of speech.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to the results of the survey McLellan said: \"I hope that \nall of our ministers combine sincerity with imagination. It's no \nsurprise to me that our ministers understand Christian teaching in \ndifferent ways. Theology matters but healing and loving and believing \nmatter more.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother survey this week found a third of Britons believe in the \nphysical resurrection of Jesus as described in the Bible. The study, \nin the supernatural magazine The Fortean Times, found that 33 per \ncent of people hold to the central tenet of Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdditional reporting: Louise Gray, Donna Rafferty, Louise Jones and \nRob O'Brien.\u0014",

Many a man has \nfelt\u0014\nextreme frigid temperatures for a long period based on a poor present\u0014\ndecision. As a veteran of these wars, I'm still not sure what to buy \nmy\u0014\nwife, but I'll pass on what not to buy her:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Don't buy anything that plugs in. Anything that requires \nelectricity is\u0014\nseen as utilitarian.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Don't buy clothing that involves sizes. The chances are one in \nseven\u0014\nthousand that you will get her size right, and your wife will be \noffended\u0014\nthe other 6999 times. \"Do I look like a size 16?\" she'll say. Too \nsmall a\u0014\nsize doesn't cut it either: \"I haven't worn a size 8 in 20 years!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Avoid all things useful. The new silver polish advertised to save\u0014\nhundreds of hours is not going to win you any brownie points.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Don't buy anything that involves weight loss or self-improvement. \nShe'll\u0014\nperceive a six-month membership to a diet center as a suggestion \nthat's\u0014\nshe's overweight.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Don't buy jewelry. The jewelry your wife wants, you can't afford. \nAnd the\u0014\njewelry you can afford, she doesn't want.\u0014\n\u0014\n6. And, guys, do not fall into the traditional trap of buying her \nfrilly\u0014\nunderwear. Your idea of the kind your wife should wear and what she \nactually\u0014\nwears are light years apart.\u0014\n\u0014\n7. Finally, don't spend too much. \"How do you think we're going to \nafford\u0014\nthat?\" she'll ask. But don't spend too little. She won't say \nanything, but\u0014\nshe'll think, \"Is that all I'm worth?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHerb Forst in Cross River, NY, Patent Trader, in Reader's Digest, \nPage 69\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\n   Cindy Holmes is a writer and pediatric nurse in Houston,\u0014\n   Texas. She wrote an article about a mother and child she got\u0014\n   to know at the hospital who were both suffering from full-\u0014\n   blown AIDS. The child, Tyler, was born infected with HIV. From\u0014\n   the outset he had been dependent upon all kinds of medical\u0014\n   treatment. Sometimes he needed supplemental oxygen.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But Cindy said it didn't slow him down. He was all boya\u0014\n   little dynamo. He frequently raced through his Houston\u0014\n   neighborhood with a little backpack on that held medications\u0014\n   he had to take. Sometimes he would pull an oxygen canister in\u0014\n   the little red Radio Flyer wagon, but that didn't slow him\u0014\n   down. Off he would go through the neighborhood playing like\u0014\n   children play.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Cindy Holmes got to know them best when they were confined to\u0014\n   the hospital in the last stages of their illnesses, when they\u0014\n   both were dying. When it became obvious to Tyler's mother that\u0014\n   he was probably going to die first, she decided she'd better\u0014\n   talk with him about what was going to come next.\u0014\n\u0014\n   She pulled him up into her bed, and they talked about life,\u0014\n   love, and fun. Then she brought up the topic of heaven. She\u0014\n   said, \"You know, Tyler, I was kind of hoping that you'd do\u0014\n   your growing up here, but the doctors say your body is telling\u0014\n   them that you might want to move on and grow up in heaven.\"\u0014\n   She continued, \"You know, I made a decision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Tyler asked, \"What's that, Mommy?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   She said, \"I've decided that if you're going to go live in\u0014\n   heaven, I'm going to do that too, because wherever you are,\u0014\n   that's where I want to be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few days later, Cindy Holmes was in Tyler's room. She said\u0014\n   he looked up at her and said, \"Miss Holmes, will you do me a\u0014\n   favor?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Cindy said, \"Sure, Tyler. What do you need?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   He asked, \"When I die, would you put a red shirt on me?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Cindy answered, \"Tyler, why do you want me to do that?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Tyler explained, \"Well, I'm going to grow up in heaven, and\u0014\n   I've been told it's fun over there. I'm going to have friends,\u0014\n   and I'm going to play. But my mommy is going to come over\u0014\n   there, too, and she's going to be looking for me. And if I'm\u0014\n   real busy and don't see her coming, I want her to see me. So\u0014\n   it's really important I have on something she can see. So\u0014\n   would you give me a red shirt?\" Tyler looked up from his bed\u0014\n   and continued, \"You know, heaven wouldn't be heaven without\u0014\n   Mommy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Cindy Holmes said, \"I was overwhelmed by this inexpressible\u0014\n   sense of peace that was on his face even at a time of\u0014\n   inexpressible crisis. And suddenly I understood where it was\u0014\n   coming from. His peace was the result of his mother's presence\u0014\n   with him through his life, throughout his illness, and her\u0014\n   promise that no matter where he went and no matter what\u0014\n   happened, she would still be there.\"\u0014",

There\u0014\n                                      sat five Presidents and the \ngenerals and statesmen who came to hear lessons\u0014\n                                      about mercy and justice, about \nthe temptations of vengeance and the duties of\u0014\n                                      leadership. Congress had become \na coalition government; defense is not \u0014\n                                      foreign\u0014\n                                      policy anymore, it's domestic. \nPresident Bush declared a state of emergency \u0014\n                                      and\u0014\n                                      called up the reserves; \nCongress wrote a $40 billion check. Soldiers at home \u0014\n                                      and\u0014\n                                      around the world were on high \nalert, and ready; 200 of their comrades had been\u0014\n                                      burned and buried alive at the \nvery command center of armed force. \"This nation \u0014\n                                      is\u0014\n                                      peaceful, but fierce when \nstirred to anger,\" the President said. \"This conflict was\u0014\n                                      begun on the timing and terms \nof others.

These men, the FBI \nreveals, lived middle-class lives, had degrees and\u0014\n                                      jobs and wives and kids and a \nwillingness to leave them all to kill us. Among the\u0014\n                                      casualties last week was our \nsweet certainty that anyone lucky enough to be \u0014\n                                      able to\u0014\n                                      live in America, share its \nvices and freedoms and gifts, surely would not want to\u0014\n                                      destroy it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      Colin Powell, the wartime \ngeneral, was back out front, pulling together the \u0014\n                                      support\u0014\n                                      of allies in both the hunt and \nthe fight and letting others know that from this point \u0014\n                                      on,\u0014\n                                      if you do not act as our \nfriend, we will consider you our enemy. Bush and Powell\u0014\n                                      didn't have to work hard to \nmount a coalition, though, because the bombers had\u0014\n                                      done the job so effectively. As \nmany as 500 Britons are feared to have died in the\u0014\n                                      World Trade Center, along with \nColombians, Canadians, Australians, Japanese,\u0014\n                                      Egyptians and countless others; \nthe terrorists had unified their opponents in an\u0014\n                                      instant.

We would look at time differently, know as we\u0014\n               never did before how quickly everything can\u0014\n               change, turn, end.

The rest of us are left\u0014\n               looking at each moment with less confidence, but\u0014\n               hopefully with more appreciation. Ive thought a lot\u0014\n               about time over the past two weekshow it can\u0014\n               seem frozen, or how it seems to speed up\u0014\n               sometimes.

I was always longing to be someone \nelsesomeone\u0014\n                        older, someone with more permission slips, \nmore passes,\u0014\n                        more access to the world.\u0014\n                                It wasnt all a manic rush after an \nelusive futureI\u0014\n                        discovered gardening in my 20s. Anyone who \nhas ever\u0014\n                        gardened knows that plants have their own \ntimetable; you\u0014\n                        cant speed them up. They will bloom, \nblossom, grow\u0014\n                        according to rhythms and cycles that are \nbeyond our\u0014\n                        reach. I lived in a canyon home with my \nboyfriend and our\u0014\n                        garden was on the slope of a hill. The \nmoments when I\u0014\n                        slowed down, really drank in the beauty and \nmystery\u0014\n                        around me are the moments that stand out like \nbrilliant\u0014\n                        jewels in my memory. Although I think I \nappreciate them\u0014\n                        more now, in memory, than I did then.\u0014\n                                In my 30s, something started to gnaw \nat mea\u0014\n                        feeling that I was always just off the mark, \nlooking behind\u0014\n                        or ahead, but never absorbing the present \nmoment.\u0014\n                        Unfortunately, I didnt allow myself to stay \nwith that feeling.\u0014\n                        Instead, I distracted myself with dramas, \nmost of them\u0014\n                        self-inflicted. As if life isnt dramatic \nenough. \u0014\n                                Only when I entered my 40s did I \nstart to regard time\u0014\n                        with more reverence, more respect. I began to \ncherish the\u0014\n                        moment at handjust thatwhatever it \ncontained. A\u0014\n                        hummingbird probing a flower blossom for \nnectar, a father\u0014\n                        carrying his little girl on his shoulders, \nthe glimpse of a\u0014\n                        strangers smile as we pass each other on the \nstreet.\u0014\n                        Moments are huge if you let them be. But you \nhave to\u0014\n                        crawl inside them and stretch yourself out, \ninhabit them. \u0014\n                                All of us are thinking about time \nthese daysmaybe\u0014\n                        more than we ever did. Because on a crisp \nblue morning in\u0014\n                        Manhattan, a day that signaled autumn, that \nmade New\u0014\n                        Yorkers look forward to orange leaves and \nclean winds,\u0014\n                        the world changed in an instant. There isnt \nanyone who\u0014\n                        wont remember where they were when they \nfound out that\u0014\n                        incomprehensible acts of terrorism had come \nto our soil.\u0014\n                        There probably isnt anyone who hasnt held \ntight to every\u0014\n                        moment since then, because so many are gone, \nso many\u0014\n                        are grieving, and because you just never \nknow. \u0014\n                                Ive noticed that people are walking \na little slower,\u0014\n                        making eye contact with strangers more \nwillingly. We are\u0014\n                        so much sadder and wiser than we were on \nMonday, and\u0014\n                        time seems so much more precious. \u0014\n                                Im hardly one to give advice, but I \nthink this is a good\u0014\n                        suggestion: Treat time the way Suze Orman \nsuggests we\u0014\n                        treat moneywith respect, with an attitude \nthat there is no\u0014\n                        such thing as an insignificant amount. A \ndollar isnt just a\u0014\n                        dollar; it has the potential for growing into \nmuch more. A\u0014\n                        moment isnt just a moment; lives can change \nin 60\u0014\n                        seconds. \u0014\n                                When I heard Suze Orman calculate how \nmuch\u0014\n                        money one could save just by eliminating that \ndaily latte, I\u0014\n                        thought, what if we did that with time? Is a \n$3 latte worth\u0014\n                        sacrificing tens of thousands of dollars down \nthe line if you\u0014\n                        just saved and invested that money? Of course \nnot. (Or if\u0014\n                        it is, you have a serious caffeine addiction \nand you need\u0014\n                        help.) Is agonizing and fretting over the \nmistakes you\u0014\n                        made in the past, or the things you think you \ndesperately\u0014\n                        need in the future more rewarding than \nlooking out the\u0014\n                        window at new buds on a tree? If you answer \nyes to that,\u0014\n                        you havent looked at a tree recently. Turn \noff the\u0014\n                        computer, ignore the phone, walk outside. We \nare richer\u0014\n                        for the moments that we embrace and cherish, \neven if\u0014\n                        embracing those moments means our work has to \nbe put\u0014\n                        on hold. It doesnt take long to watch the \nsun sink, or to\u0014\n                        call a loved one or a friend and ask how they \nare doing; it\u0014\n                        takes barely a moment to fold your arms \naround your\u0014\n                        child.

For instance, last April \nhe told The Associated Press in the context of\u0014\n          Palestine that ``a suicide bombing is an act of martyrdom, \nnot an act of suicide.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          The new fatwa cited the words of God in the Quran and \nauthoritative Hadith, traditions of the teachings and\u0014\n          practices of the Prophet Muhammad.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``All Muslims ought to be united against all those who \nterrorize the innocents, and those who permit the\u0014\n          killing of non-combatants without a justifiable reason,'' \nthe fatwa said.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The text was dated Sept. 27 and released in Washington by \nthe Fiqh Council of North America, an\u0014\n          11-member panel formed in 1986 under auspices of the \nIslamic Society of North America to offer legal\u0014\n          rulings for Muslims in the United States and Canada.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The ruling was requested by Army Capt. Abdul-Rashid \nMuhammad, the first Muslim chaplain in the\u0014\n          American military. Muhammad asked whether it was proper for \nthe 15,000 American Muslims in uniform to\u0014\n          participate in retaliation against those thought to have \nplanned and financed the terror attacks and to\u0014\n          eliminate their safe haven in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The fatwa made one exception to American policy, saying the \nperpetrators ``must be brought to justice in\u0014\n          an impartial court of law'' and then given appropriate \npunishment to deter future terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Nonetheless, the fatwa said U.S. Muslim soldiers can serve, \neven though in combat ``it's often difficult - if\u0014\n          not impossible - to differentiate between the real \nperpetrators who are being pursued, and the innocents\u0014\n          who have committed no crime.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          A Muslim citizen serving in the regular army ``has no \nchoice but to follow orders; otherwise his allegiance\u0014\n          and loyalty to his country could be in doubt,'' the fatwa \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The five jurists also said Muslims have a duty to speak up \nabout the faith's anti-terrorism stand.\u0014",

In this country, there are many \nanswers\u0014\n                      to that question\u0014\n\u0014\n                      BY JEFFERY L. SHELER \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Inside a storefront on West Warren Avenue, a \ngritty Dearborn, Mich., neighborhood of\u0014\n                      modest shops with hand-painted Arabic signs, a \nhandful of men respond to the\u0014\n                      high-pitched chant of the muezzin and form a \nline facing Mecca. They bow, sit, and\u0014\n                      prostrate on colorful rugs in a mostly silent \nrendition of the salat, the daily prayers\u0014\n                      Muslims have recited for nearly 1,400 years. In \na smaller room, a cluster of women\u0014\n                      with head coverings also recite the prayers in \nresponse to the voice of the imam,\u0014\n                      which they can hear from across the hall. Most \nof the worshipers are recent refugees\u0014\n                      from Iraq who want a link to the country they \nstill consider home. \"They thank God\u0014\n                      they are here\" in America, says Imam Hushan \nAl-Husainy, the mosque leader. \"But\u0014\n                      their heart is back home with their loved ones \nwho are suffering.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Meanwhile, 68 miles away, beneath a gleaming \nwhite dome and twin minarets that tower\u0014\n                      over the Ohio cornfields southwest of Toledo, \nhundreds of  families assemble  for \u0014\n                      worshipa largely upper-middle-class flock that \nrepresents some 22  nationalities, most\u0014\n                      U.S. citizens and some second- or  \nthird-generation  Americans. Few of\u0014\n                      the women wear head coverings outside of the \nprayer hall, where only a 3-foot-high\u0014\n                      partition separates men and women, side by \nside. After prayers, they all gather for a\u0014\n                      potluck. The Toledo center, says its president, \nCherrefe Kadri, represents a\u0014\n                      \"progressive and middle-of-the-road\" brand of \nIslam that, she says, is \"very much at\u0014\n                      home in Middle America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This, then, is American Islam: The modern \nIslamic Center of Greater Toledo and the\u0014\n                      traditionalist Karbala Islamic Education Center \nare but two examples of its\u0014\n                      wide-ranging diversity. And even though it is \nthe nation's fastest-growing faith, with\u0014\n                      an estimated 7 million adherents herenearly \ndouble from a decade agoIslam remains\u0014\n                      widely misunderstood in this country. The \nreligion of more than a fifth of the world's\u0014\n                      population is viewed by many Americans as \nforeign, mysterious, even threatening to\u0014\n                      the nation's \"Judeo-Christian \nheritage\"certainly no less so since the events of\u0014\n                      September 11despite the fact that it shares \ncommon roots with Christianity and\u0014\n                      Judaism and has been present in North America \nfor centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The rules. Indeed, Islam embraces the \nmonotheism of Christianity and Judaism,\u0014\n                      accepts the Hebrew Bible, and venerates Jesus \nas a prophet. It is centered on the\u0014\n                      Koranthe Islamic scriptures, which Muslims \nbelieve were revealed to the prophet\u0014\n                      Mohammedwhich commands five basic devotional \nduties, called the \"Five Pillars\": a\u0014\n                      declaration of belief that \"there is no God but \nAllah [Arabic for \"the God\"] and\u0014\n                      Mohammed is his prophet\"; prayers offered five \ntimes a day; daytime fasting during the\u0014\n                      month of Ramadan; charitable giving; and at \nleast one pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims are\u0014\n                      forbidden to consume alcohol, illicit drugs, \npork, or any meat that is not halalthe\u0014\n                      Islamic equivalent of kosher. Premarital sex \nand extramarital sex are sternly prohibited,\u0014\n                      as are most forms of unchaperoned dating. \nEmphasis on public modesty prompts\u0014\n                      many Muslims to cover themselves from the \nwrists to the ankles. Muslims also may not\u0014\n                      gamble or pay or accept interest on loans or \nsavings accounts. It is a regimen that\u0014\n                      often runs in conflict with the dominant \nculture. Most American Muslims have no\u0014\n                      choice but to break the prohibition on usury to \nbuy homes and automobiles, for\u0014\n                      example.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But if the intense scrutiny focused on world \nIslam since September 11 has revealed\u0014\n                      anything, it is that the faith is no monolith. \nWhile there is much that binds the world's\u0014\n                      1.2 billion Muslims together, there is no \nauthoritative hierarchyno pope, no central\u0014\n                      group of eldersthat speaks to them or for \nthem. And American Islam, it emerges, is its\u0014\n                      own special brand. A recent study sponsored by \nthe Council on American-Islamic\u0014\n                      Relations in cooperation with the Hartford \nInstitute for Religion Research found that\u0014\n                      American Muslims generally are more accepting \nof differences, less inclined to\u0014\n                      fundamentalism, and more at home in a secular \nsociety than most Muslims elsewhere.\u0014\n                      They are also ethnically diverse: Most are \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nor their descendants from Islamic\u0014\n                      countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. \nAbout a third are African-Americans,\u0014\n                      and a small number are whites of European \ndescent.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Connections? But while diversity may naturally \ninclude the extremes, the question\u0014\n                      on many people's minds has been what exactly \nthe relationship is between American\u0014\n                      Islam and the kind of terror and \nanti-Americanism that came so horribly into focus last\u0014\n                      month under the guise of religious zealotry. \nOne moderate American Islamic leader,\u0014\n                      Sheik Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, told a State \nDepartment forum in 1999 that 80\u0014\n                      percent of the nation's mosques are headed by \nclerics who espouse \"extremist\u0014\n                      ideology\"which Kabbani associates with \nWahhabism, an Islamic fundamentalist\u0014\n                      movement that began in Saudi Arabia in the 18th \ncentury. But Kabbani, head of the\u0014\n                      Islamic Supreme Council of America, a \nWashington, D.C.-based advocacy group,\u0014\n                      added that \"a majority of American Muslims do \nnot agree\" with the extremist ideology. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Other American Muslim leaders say Kabbani's \nestimate of Wahhabi influence in U.S.\u0014\n                      mosques is exaggerated. \"I don't know where he \ncame up with that,\" says Ingrid\u0014\n                      Mattson, a Hartford Seminary professor and vice \npresident of the Islamic Society of\u0014\n                      North America. African-Americans alone account \nfor a third of the mosques, she\u0014\n                      notes, \"and they clearly are not Wahhabis.\" The \nCAIR-Hartford study found that about\u0014\n                      20 percent of mosques say they interpret the \nKoran literally, but 7 in 10 follow a more\u0014\n                      nuanced, nonfundamentalist approach. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Scholars say the democratic structure and \nautonomy of many American mosques\u0014\n                      protect them from extremist takeovers. Modern \nIslamic centers, like the one in Toledo,\u0014\n                      are \"less likely to be dominated by a single \nteacher or viewpoint,\" says Frederick\u0014\n                      Denny, a scholar of Islam at the University of \nColorado. That describes at least 60\u0014\n                      percent of American mosques, according to the \nCAIR-Hartford study. Those that are\u0014\n                      more fundamentalist, he says, often are \nsmaller, with transient members, such as\u0014\n                      those that \"cater to foreign students who want \nsomething that feels like home.\" Even\u0014\n                      where fundamentalism exists, says Mattson, \n\"there is a huge distinction between\u0014\n                      fundamentalist ideology and support of \nterrorism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What divides American Muslims most often, says \nDenny, \"is not\u0014\n                      liberal-versus-conservative ideology but how \nbest to domesticate Islam in a Western\u0014\n                      society without doing violence to either.\" \nWhat, for example, are American Muslims to\u0014\n                      do with sharia, the Islamic legal and ethical \ncodes that tradition says should undergird\u0014\n                      Islamic society? Radical clerics say it is a \nMuslim's duty to impose sharia throughout\u0014\n                      the world, by force if necessary. But moderates \nargue that Islamic law must be\u0014\n                      internalized. \"It shouldn't be taken \nliterally,\" says Imam Farooq Aboelzahab of the\u0014\n                      Toledo mosque. \"The way sharia was applied \n1,400 years ago may not always fit. It\u0014\n                      must be applied to the place and time where you \nlive.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One indication that many Muslims are feeling \nmore at home in America is their growing\u0014\n                      involvement in the nation's public life. During \nthe past five years, Islamic leaders and\u0014\n                      groups have become increasingly outspoken on \nsocial- and foreign-policy issues.\u0014\n                      Groups like CAIR, ISNA, the American Muslim \nCouncil, and the Islamic Institute maintain\u0014\n                      a high-visibility Washington presence, working \nto rally Muslim political activism and\u0014\n                      acting as media watchdogs. While American \nIslamic groups were virtually unanimous\u0014\n                      in condemning the terrorist attacks on New York \nand Washington, they remain\u0014\n                      vociferous critics of U.S. policy in the Middle \nEast.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Stronger rhetoric, of course, has its price in \nthis country. In late September, a\u0014\n                      prominent imam at a Cleveland mosque nearly \nlost his job over anti-Jewish remarks he\u0014\n                      had made in a speech 10 years ago. The board at \nthe Islamic Center of Cleveland\u0014\n                      voted to keep Fawaz Damra after he apologized \nfor the remarks, which appeared on a\u0014\n                      tape that surfaced recently, but local Jewish \nleaders are still upset.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Incendiary rhetoric. Meanwhile, a leading \nMuslim teacher in Northern California has\u0014\n                      apologized for his own rhetorical excesses. \nHamza Yusuf, who was invited to the\u0014\n                      White House to pray with President Bush after \nthe attacks, later came under criticism\u0014\n                      for saying in a speech two days before the \nattacks that the United States \"stands\u0014\n                      condemned\" and faced \"a terrible fate\" because \nof rampant immorality and injustice in\u0014\n                      its treatment of minorities. While their causes \nmay be just, says Yusuf, \"the rhetoric of\u0014\n                      some Muslim leaders has been too incendiaryI \nmyself have been guilty of it.\"\u0014\n                      September 11, he says, \"was a wake-up call to \nme. I don't want to contribute to the\u0014\n                      hate in any shape or form.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A decade ago, Sulayman Nyang, professor of \nAfrican studies at Howard University in\u0014\n                      Washington, D.C., warned in a speech that Islam \nwill be accepted in America only\u0014\n                      when Muslims fully take their place alongside \nother citizens, participating in the nation's\u0014\n                      civic life, and when what the Islamic faith can \noffer Western culture is recognized\u0014\n                      widely as something of value. Neither, he says, \nwill be easy to accomplish. But in\u0014\n                      times like these, such hard work is more \nimportant than ever. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      With Michael Betzold in Dearborn, Mich.\u0014",

New York's is not unlike the original - in Hiroshima. \nDone that, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can reach the World Trade Center's secure \"Red Zone\" a variety of \nways. We took the subway and emerged into a crowd shuffling and \nsubdued - as the city seems understandably to be these days. Osama \nand his kamikaze killers nailed much of New York's natural brash as \nwell, at least for a while.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe area is a massive crime scene, a war zone.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice monitor the fences and plastic-ribboned barricades. Guardsmen \nman key access points - waving through rubble-filled trucks and \nclosed cars with VITs (Very Important Tourists) such as Jacques \nChirac, Oprah, Larry King, Lance Armstrong, Muhammad Ali, pols, and \nsequin-hatted potentates.\u0014\n\u0014\nA blonde in fatigues with a sergeant's voice and a large set of pecs \ninsists loudly that venturesome peons (UTs - Unescorted or \nUnconnected or Unimportant Tourists) will risk her wrath if they \ndon't get down off the sawhorses and stop craning for a better look.\u0014\n\u0014\nAS IT IS you can see very little, and then only from a few key spots. \nPolicemen wearily, blasely, recommend the best place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe corner of Liberty and Broadway offers a view of a \nstill-smoldering void edged by blackened facades and girder shards. \nSome buildings, undergoing cleaning and repair, stand sheathed in \norangey shrouds. Where the WTC's 100-story south tower stood the eye \nfinds only baby-blue sky\u0014\nwith an an airliner eerily gliding across on its final approach. And \nthe mind replays that compelling footage . . . .\u0014\n\u0014\nBody-to-body on the sidewalk, no one says anything - each lost in his \nown reflections about the atrocity's extent and degree, the \ndevastation's scale and scope. It is too much for the mind to grasp.\u0014\n\u0014\nNew street signs declare this the \"Canyon of Heroes.\" Peddlers stand \nsilent holding their belly boxes of stolen and counterfeit watches. \nOn its circuit of grief, the crowd shoves and pushes past hotdog \ncarts and kiosks selling ILNY posters of the WTC in its glory and a \nbig red heart scorched at the corner. Street preachers dispense \nBibles and Gospel tracts, and ramble on about sin and redemption and \napocalypse.\u0014\n\u0014\nTestimonials and Hiroshima-like mini-shrines to lost beloveds bedeck \nthis lampost or that fence - and over there the fire station. At \nnearby Trinity Church, with its headstones hauntingly darkened not by \nwar but by three centuries of New York grime, the curious and the \nprayerful weep.\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE SCENE recalls Hiroshima, yes - and the hallowed ground at \nGettysburg and Cold Harbor, the Hanoi Hilton and the Nazi \ncrematoriums, Verdun and the Normandy Beaches. Sites of man's highs \nand lows, his heroism and the horror he can do.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the dominant sense, gazing at the Ground Zero void - at the two \nmassive symbols of economic liberty, and the political liberty that \nis its necessary complement, now in smithereens - is of anguish mixed \nwith new determination. Pehaps that is the confused sense in the \nminds of this horde of Americans, vastly diverse New Yorkers, \ntourists important and un-.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we fill the void?

When I looked around, \nothers\u0014\n                         seemed as calm as my mother.

He was trying \nto please\u0014\n                         my mother. A scientist by profession, his \nworld was one\u0014\n                         of physics and logic. While my mother \nendeavored to\u0014\n                         bring me to God, my father taught me about \nthe solar\u0014\n                         system and Newtons laws of motion. His \ndiscomfort at\u0014\n                         being in a house of worship was palpable. \nAfter only a\u0014\n                         few minutes, he headed for the car.

I \ngave up my\u0014\n                         little secret with sincere sadness, as I \nhated the thought\u0014\n                         of hurting his feelings.

Once I began to study art \nhistory, I\u0014\n                         quickly realized that having a grasp of \nreligion in its\u0014\n                         historical context was essential to \nappreciating sublime\u0014\n                         works of art. I read books on different \nfaiths, learned\u0014\n                         about the separation of the Eastern Orthodox \nChurch\u0014\n                         and Roman Catholicism, and even studied the\u0014\n                         Reformation and Counter-Reformation, which \ndeepened\u0014\n                         my understanding of the Lutheran Church.\u0014\n                                 On my travels now, I duck into every \nholy space I\u0014\n                         come across. I delight in the quiet beauty \nof candlelit\u0014\n                         Catholic cathedrals and in the cool stones \nof Mayan\u0014\n                         temples. I appreciate the power yielded by \nfaith. I just\u0014\n                         dont feel it myself.\u0014\n                                 My secularism doesnt exclude me \nfrom the sadness\u0014\n                         and mourning that all Americans have \nexperienced since\u0014\n                         September 11.

    "title": "MATTHEW'S ACCOUNT OF JESUS' BIRTH",
    "words": "The Advent season gospel reading tells the Matthean account of Jesus' \nconception and birth. Matthew's birth narrative is far less popular \nto read at Christmastime than Luke's literary masterpiece. Luke's \ntext focuses on Mary, the obedient virgin, who willingly submits to \nGod's plans and never questions all that is required of her. \u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew's description of Jesus' conception and birth focuses instead \non Joseph. In many ways, Matthew's version is the more expected \ninterpretation, for it is concerned with technicalities and issues of \nprecise legality. It is Joseph's name and reputation that are on the \nline here, and it is only through Joseph's active obedience to the \ndivine messages he receives that both his reputation and that of the \nbaby Jesus are preserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew's text, we know nothing about Mary, except for the \nsuspicious fact that while she and Joseph were betrothed, she became \npregnant. Out-of-wedlock pregnancies were a far more serious issue \nthan in today's permissive culture, and the formal nature of Joseph \nand Mary's betrothal raised the event of this untimely pregnancy to a \nnew degree of seriousness. \u0014\n\u0014\nA betrothal, while less than a full marriage, was certainly more than \nany modern notion of an \"engagement.\" Betrothal was a definitive \nlegal state, contracts had been signed, dowries exchanged, binding \nagreements set in place. While a legal marriage did not exist until \nthe husband had taken his wife into his home and consummated their \nunion, a betrothed couple was, nevertheless, a legal entity and \nalready bound by the strict Hebraic codes of conduct. Just as a woman \nwhose betrothed husband died was considered a widow, a betrothed \nwoman who had sexual relations with another man was considered to be \nan adulteress. When Mary was found to be pregnant, she faced the full \nmeasure of the adultery laws found in Deuteronomy 22:23-24. \u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew's text stresses that Joseph was \"a righteous man\" (1:19) - a \nmoral state that both forced his hand and yet allowed him to act with \nmercy. As one who was \"righteous,\" Joseph's obedience to the law \ninsisted that he have nothing more to do with Mary. Under the law, \nshe was an adulteress and must be sent away - their marriage could \nnot occur. But Joseph could choose one of two ways to disintegrate \ntheir betrothal contract. He could bring public charges of adultery \nagainst Mary and let the law take its full course. Or Joseph could \nsimply take two witnesses with him as he formally confronted Mary \nwith charges of adultery. In the presence of just those two \nwitnesses, Joseph could divorce his betrothed.\u0014\nBut even as Joseph considers this more compassionate, face-saving way \nout of this awkward situation, he receives a direct message from a \ndivine messenger about what he should do and why. This is the first \nof three divinely inspired dreams Joseph will have. According to \nMatthew's gospel, it is this dream that tells Joseph to take a quite \ndifferent course of action than the one he had been considering. The \nangel tells Joseph to go ahead with the marriage because the adultery \naccusation is not true. Mary should not be made subject to the law \nbecause her pregnancy came about through the activity of the Holy \nSpirit - the child she bears was conceived through divine activity, \nnot human disobedience.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angelic messenger's formal address to Joseph emphasizes the \nimportant reason for Joseph to marry Mary legally and thus claim her \nchild as his own. The angel refers to Joseph here as a \"son of David\" \n- just as the genealogy Matthew constructed in 1:1-17 had so \ncarefully proven. In order for the several Old Testament messianic \nbirth prophecies to be fulfilled, the Messiah must be born of the \nline of David. According to Matthew, Joseph must become Jesus' legal \nfather in order for him to be able to lay claim to a Davidic heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatthew's text so focuses on Joseph and his role that it is wholly \nunclear what Mary actually knew about her unexpected condition or \nabout the identity of the child she was carrying. In verse 21, the \nangelic messenger gives to Joseph the name for the child and reveals \nthe role the child will play in Israel's history. The child is to be \ncalled Jesus, the Greek rendering of Joshua, from the two Hebrew \nwords \"Yahweh\" and \"save,\" because he will indeed \"save his people \nfrom their sins.\" It is Joseph who is given explicit foreknowledge \nthat the child Mary bears is none other than the Messiah, the one who \nwill bring about the reality of God's saving forgiveness for all \nIsrael.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angelic message stops, and the words of the gospel narrator begin \nagain in verse 22. Matthew reaches back into Hebrew Scripture to \nfurther verify the miraculous events that are unfolding. Isaiah 7:14 \nis the basis of Matthew's text here, although he substitutes \"they \nshall name\" for the Septuagint's \"you shall name.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is also a variance between the Greek in the Septuagint and the \noriginal Hebrew of Isaiah's text that lends strength to Matthew's use \nof this Scripture text for the cause of Mary and her yet unborn son. \nThe Hebrew term 'almah is used in Isaiah 7:14, and is usually \nrendered as \"the young woman.\" The Septuagint, however, chose to use \nthe term parthenos, that is \"virgin,\" to describe the woman in \nIsaiah's text. Matthew himself then cites the text as \"the virgin \nshall conceive,\" further emphasizing Mary's innocence and thus the \ndivine parentage and heritage that Jesus enjoys.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is some argument that the Septuagint's choice of the term \nparthenos was based on the desire to depict Israel's role as the \nvirgin awaiting God's activity. It is the virgin Israel, in this \nrendition, not any particular individual, that will give birth to the \nMessiah in the redemptive future. Yet Matthew's use of this text and \nhis emphasis on Mary's innocence seem to define Mary as the \nrepresentative of the virgin Israel. It is the Holy Spirit's activity \nthrough Mary that results in the conception of the messianic child.\u0014\nJoseph's obedience to the angelic messenger's command is complete. \nWithout hesitation, he takes Mary for his wife. As further evidence \nof his righteousness, he refrains from having sexual relations with \nher. She remains the embodiment of the virgin Israel. Matthew's text \ndoes not necessarily offer evidence one way or another here about the \nCatholic doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity. The gospel writer is \nfocused on the unique situation that surrounded Jesus' conception and \nbirth - a situation that enabled him to claim both the earthly \ngenealogy of his human father Joseph, and the divine heritage of his \nheavenly Father through the workings of the Holy Spirit.\u0014",

    "words": "Tragic Story \nof French Revolution's Famous Victim\u0014\n \u0014\n                     Reviewer: Charles Reilly  from Garden Grove, \nCalifornia  \u0014\n                     Lady Antonia Fraser's newest biography is a \nfamiliar story but she fortunately brings many\u0014\n                     new facts and forgotten figures to light. By \nincluding \"The Journey\" in her title, Lady\u0014\n                     Fraser's main purpose is to convince the reader \nthat Marie Antoinette did\u0014\n                     indeed transform herself from the frivolous and \ndisinterested Queen she was purported to\u0014\n                     be. This the author accomplishes brilliantly and \nwith the historical facts needed to back\u0014\n                     herself up. \u0014\n                     \u0014\n                     Within the first few pages, Lady Fraser \nthoroughly trounces that famous and oft-repeated\u0014\n                     statement attributed to the Queen (\"Let them eat \ncake!\")as nothing more than a vicious slur\u0014\n                     while acknowledging it as the first of many to \ndo permanent damage to her image and                                \ncharacter.  Lady Fraser is able to separate rumors from facts and \ndoes so through her \u0014\n                     inexhaustible research and innumerable sources. \nThe\u0014\n                     long and painful incarceration of the Royal \nFamily is quite detailed here and sheds new light\u0014\n                     on not only the ill-treatment of the Queen, but \nparticularly of her son (who died miserably\u0014\n                     and isolated in captivity). \u0014\n                     \u0014\n                     This is undoubtedly a sad story but one not \nunique for the victims of the French Revolution:\u0014\n                     a revolution that ended up devouring itself and \nits leaders in the immolation of the Terror.\u0014\n                     Lady Fraser certainly makes the case that, like \nmost of the victims of this volatile period,\u0014\n                     Marie Antoinette was sentenced to death by a \npre-arranged \"kangaroo court\" and was in\u0014\n                     essence \"murdered\" not for what she had done, \nbut for who she had been.\u0014\n                     \u0014\n                      A rather sly reference in the epilogue notes \nthat her chief harasser on the Revolutionary\u0014\n                     Committee, Jaques Hebert, ended up in the same \ngraveyard as the former Queen within a \u0014\n                     few short months: a deserving  victim of the \nchaos and terror that he himself instigated.\u0014\n                     All in all, Lady Antonia Fraser has written an \noutstanding\u0014\n                     biography that compares well with her previous \nwork and, in some instances, surpasses it.\u0014\n                     Thanks to this book, readers and historians \nalike will be able to obtain a far truer and\u0014\n                     balanced picture of a much-maligned historical \nfigure.

    "words": "The time was the early 1860s. The Civil War was raging. The nation was\u0014\ndivided, and many wondered if the United States of America could\u0014\nsurvive. In the midst of these tragic circumstances, J.R. Graves wrote\u0014\na series of articles. He did not address the war, the issue of slavery\u0014\nor the state of the nation. His topic: the beard!\u0014\n\u0014\nI am indebted to Mark Scott for this material. Mark has a\u0014\nstrong interest in Baptist history and became enamored with studying\u0014\nthe period of the Civil War, especially as it relates to Tennessee.\u0014\nWithout a doubt, J.R. Graves, considered the father of the Landmark\u0014\nMovement, was a strong leader in Tennessee in those days. His \ninfluence\u0014\nstill is felt in many areas. However, in my judgment, Graves missed \none\u0014\nof the greatest opportunities of his life. He allowed himself to be\u0014\nsidetracked on a trivial issue when his readers needed a prophetic \nword\u0014\nfrom the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his dissertation on Graves, Dr. Harold Smith writes of Graves'\u0014\nconclusions about the beard:  \"One of man's physical endowments was\u0014\nthe beard, and Graves maintained that shaving was contrary to God's\u0014\nlaws. The God who placed the beard upon man's lips, jaws, and face did\u0014\nnot intend for it to be shorn any more than the eyebrows or the hair\u0014\non man's head. Shaving originated in Canaan as an act of idolatrous\u0014\nworship, whereas the Jews were bearded by God's command.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Beyond breaking God's laws, shaving is detrimental to man's\u0014\nwell-being. Removing the beard injures the organs that are covered\u0014\nand the entire  constitution as well. The mustache is important for\u0014\npreserving the teeth of the upper jaw and for preventing weak eyes\u0014\nand premature loss of eyesight. Optic nerves extend into the upper\u0014\nlip, and constant shaving causes poor vision. Graves observed that\u0014\nJ.M. Pendleton, a man of the time, was wearing glasses, he said that\u0014\nthe glasses are 'the penalty that all shavers are compelled to pay\u0014\nfor the repeated violation of Nature's fixed law.' He went on to claim\u0014\nshaving also caused colds, hoarseness and baldness. He judged that\u0014\ndeaths by consumption could be reduced by one half if men stopped\u0014\nshaving.\"\u0014",

Noticing a man who eyed the \nblonde, I\u0014\n                         thought of an esoteric poem written by a \nPashtun woman\u0014\n                         full of sighs of lust, love, pain and \ndeprivation:\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Tomorrow my hungry lovers\u0014\n                                 Will be satisfied\u0014\n                                 As they watch me\u0014\n                                 Crossing the village\u0014\n                                 Unveiled\u0014\n                                 With my hair left to the wind.\u0014\n                                \u0014\n                                And I thought about why men fear \nwomen. A woman\u0014\n                         becomes like a thing kept in the \nrefrigerator to be taken\u0014\n                         out when her husband craves something sweet. \nBut even\u0014\n                         stored away, she makes him anxious. What if \nmy\u0014\n                         neighbor craves something sweet as well? \nWhy, he\u0014\n                         wonders, is he the lord of all he surveys, \nyet weakened\u0014\n                         by this woman he needs only a few minutes a \nday? How\u0014\n                         he wishes she would disappear from the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 I think of those American women who \nwould marry\u0014\n                         the likes of the Taliban, and defend them, \nand I wonder\u0014\n                         what personal problems they have. Do they \nwant to\u0014\n                         change the world to change themselves? How\u0014\n                         disappointed they must be in their husbands, \nand their\u0014\n                         lives. And I think about the Arab women I \nhave seen\u0014\n                         demonstrating in favor of Osama bin Laden \nand carrying\u0014\n                         his portrait.

    "words": "Mrs. Kennedy : The Missing History of the Kennedy Years\u0014\nA book review\u0014\n\u0014\nAsserting that Jacqueline Kennedy's role in shaping her husband's \npresidency has been\u0014\nunder-examined, Leaming (Katharine Hepburn) offers a corrective in \nthis intimate look at a very\u0014\nprivate woman. Initially inclined to keep herself as much in the \nbackground as possible, says\u0014\nLeaming, Jacqueline Kennedy became an increasingly visible and vocal \nfirst lady as she realized\u0014\nhow effective she could be as an image maker. It's in this capacity \nthat Leaming convincingly\u0014\ndepicts her as being instrumental in shaping the course of her \nhusband's administration: charming,\u0014\nintuitive and socially savvy, she was clearly adept at recognizing \nprecisely how to win over any given\u0014\nindividual or audience, and to convince them to see her husband in a \nfavorable light. While many\u0014\nworld leaders, for example, were initially inclined to view John F. \nKennedy as a playboy and an\u0014\nintellectual lightweight, Jackie skillfully massaged their \nperceptions until they began to take him\u0014\nmore seriously and consequently to be much more responsive to his \nforeign policy agenda. But even\u0014\nas she worked hard on his behalf, Jack continually betrayed her with \nhis legendary infidelities; the\u0014\nimpact of this on Jackie's psyche is also a major theme here. Indeed, \nthis is as much a\u0014\npsychological biography as a political one, and Leaming explores \nJackie's complex and often painful\u0014\ninner life with subtlety and compassion. Unabashedly sympathetic \ntoward her protagonist, Leaming\u0014\nprovides a fascinating glimpse into the psychodynamics of one of the \n20th century's most famous\u0014\nmarriages, and her assertion that Jackie Kennedy deserves more credit \nthan she's typically gotten\u0014\nfor her husband's successes is persuasive.\u0014",

    "words": "Meanwhile, at the Vatican\u0014\n                      The Pope breaks his virtual silence. But will \nhe act?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Rome&ndash;Cardinal Daro Castrilln Hoyos of \nColombia was not pleased with the\u0014\n                      Vatican press corps. The stern, white-haired \nprelate had just read aloud the pope's\u0014\n                      annual pre-Easter letter, which referred \nobliquely to a widening scandal that had cast\u0014\n                      \"a dark shadow of suspicion\" over the \npriesthood. But when he opened the floor to\u0014\n                      questions at the Vatican news conference last \nweek, reporters had but one line of\u0014\n                      inquiry: What concrete action was the Vatican \ntaking in the growing sex-abuse crisis\u0014\n                      in the American church?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The cardinal listened silently, his lips in a \ntight smile. Then, ignoring the individual\u0014\n                      queries, he read a sharply worded statement \nreminding the reporters of the\u0014\n                      Vatican's policies and  the pope's \npronouncements over the years designed to\u0014\n                      condemn and root out clergy sex abuse of \nchildren. \"The church has never neglected\u0014\n                      the problem of sexual abuse, especially not \nthose against minors,\"\u0014\n                      Castrilln Hoyos declared.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For some, these were signs that the Vatican is, \nindeed, confronting the widening\u0014\n                      crisis. But for others, it was yet another \nindication that the Vatican still has not taken\u0014\n                      the matter seriously enough, considers it \nlargely an American problem, and would\u0014\n                      prefer to do as little as possible about it. \n\"The Vatican still has a false idea that silence\u0014\n                      is dignified,\" observed one American priest in \nRome. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Beyond America. Yet while the problem may once \nhave been viewed by some as an\u0014\n                      American affliction, there's little doubt now \nthat it has become international. In Canada,\u0014\n                      the church now faces thousands of \nsex-abuse-related lawsuits stemming from years\u0014\n                      of government-funded, Catholic- and \nAnglican-run residential schools that could cost\u0014\n                      several billion Canadian dollars to settle. In \nMexico, nine men went public in 1997 with\u0014\n                      accusations that a prominent priest had \nsexually abused them when they were boys.\u0014\n                      In that case, the Vatican last year halted an \nofficial investigation into the charges\u0014\n                      against the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, head \nof the Legion of Christ order, without\u0014\n                      explanation. The powerful priest had insisted \nthat the men had conspired to defame\u0014\n                      him.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Europe, nearly 30 French priests have been \nconvicted of youth sexual abuse in the\u0014\n                      past decade. In Ireland, the church agreed last \nmonth to contribute $110 million to a\u0014\n                      settlement of about $400 million for people \nabused as children enrolled in church-run,\u0014\n                      state-funded schools from the 1940s to the \n1970s. The roughly 3,000 victims\u0014\n                      accepting the package would have to agree to \ntake no more legal action. And in the\u0014\n                      pope's own homeland, Juliusz Paetz, the \narchbishop of Poznan, Poland, stands\u0014\n                      accused of sexually abusing seminarians and \npriests in his archdiocese. Meanwhile,\u0014\n                      in Africa, an international campaign to end \nviolence against women called on the\u0014\n                      Vatican last year to address widespread abuse \nof nuns by priests. The Call to\u0014\n                      Accountability Campaign cited reports from 23 \ncountries.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In his statement last week, Castrilln Hoyos \ncited a \"climate of pansexualism and\u0014\n                      sexual libertinism\" pervasive in the world \nthat, he said, has contributed to \"some\"\u0014\n                      priests' having \"committed the extremely grave \ncrime of sexual abuse.\" Yet the laws\u0014\n                      of the church, he said, are \"serious and \nstrict\" and were conceived \"within the\u0014\n                      apostolic tradition of handling internal \nmatters internally.\" He pointed to new rules\u0014\n                      introduced last year whereby the Vatican's \npowerful Congregation for the Doctrine of\u0014\n                      the Faith now oversees all youth-sex-abuse \ninvestigations. That new policy, which\u0014\n                      was quietly disseminated among bishops last \nspring but revealed publicly only in\u0014\n                      January, requires bishops to inform Rome and \nlaunch a local investigation at the first\u0014\n                      hint of such allegations involving a priest. \nBut to protect the rights of the accused and\u0014\n                      the identities of victims, the rules provide \nfor a secret ecclesiastical tribunal in Rome to\u0014\n                      handle these cases. Critics have charged that \nthis is just another attempt to keep\u0014\n                      potential scandals under wraps. They note that \nAmerican bishops asked the Vatican\u0014\n                      several years ago for greater authority to \nremove priests who refuse to step aside,\u0014\n                      without having to go through the church's \ncumbersome canonical court system. So\u0014\n                      far, they have not received an answer. -Eleni \nE. Dimmler and Jeffery L.

    "words": "Miserable End \u0014\n\u0014\nResearchers Diagnose Herod the \u0014\nGreat With Chronic Kidney Disease\u0014\nBy Amanda Onion\u0014\n\u0014\nJan. 25, 2002  He was a ruthless man who died a miserable death. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 2,000 years after Herod the Great succumbed at age 69, \ndoctors have now settled on exactly what killed the king of ancient \nJudea: chronic kidney disease complicated by a very uncomfortable \ncase of maggot-infested gangrene of the genitals. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe clues to Herod's diagnosis were listed in ancient history books \nand, according to Jan Hirschmann, the lead diagnosing doctor in the \ncase, included \"intense itching, painful intestinal problems, \nbreathlessness, convulsions in every limb and gangrene of the \ngenitals.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nRare Affliction \u0014\n\u0014\nHirschmann, who is a physician at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sounds \nHealth Care System in Washington state, said chronic kidney disease \ncould explain nearly all of Herod's symptoms. However, he said the \nking's case of gangrene (now a rare condition known as Fournier's \ngangrene) could not be explained by kidney disease and was \"unusual.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHirschmann suspects one of three conditions likely introduced \nFournier's gangrene to the leader's \"privy parts.\" An infection in \nHerod's abdomen could have spread to his groin and rectal areas \n(Herod is said to have complained of abdominal pain). \u0014\n\u0014\nHe may have sexually contracted gonorrhea, which could have led to an \ninfection of the urethra  the tube connecting the bladder to the \noutside world. This infection could have cause urine to leak inside \nthe king's body, spreading bacteria. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, since reports indicate the king \"had a terrible desire to \nscratch himself,\" this scratching could have introduced gangrene \ndirectly into the area. \u0014\n\u0014\nRecords also indicate the swelling at the leader's groin was further \nwracked by an infestation of worms. Hirschmann says what may have \nlooked like \"worms\" could have actually been shredded pieces of skin, \nalthough, he says there is a possibility they were real. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There could have been maggots feeding on the tissue,\" said Philip \nMackowiak, chief of the Medical Care Clinical Center at the Veterans \nAffairs Maryland Healthcare System, who oversees an annual conference \nat the center to diagnose historical figures. \"It's tough to know how \nlong he was suffering but it was probably months, possibly a couple \nyears.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nParanoid Tyrant \u0014\n\u0014\nSome might say Herod, who died in 4 B.C. deserved an unpleasant end. \u0014\nFlavius Josephus, a Jewish historian who wrote about the infamous \nking roughly 100 years after his death, described the leader as a \nproductive, successful builder in his youth who became increasingly \nparanoid and ruthless during the final decade of his 36-year reign. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The main problem was he married too often and each wife produced \nprinces who schemed to be No. 1,\" said Paul Maier, a professor of \nancient history at Western Michigan University who published a book \nabout Josephus' writings. \"It turned Herod into a tyrant and the \nhouse of Herod into a can of worms.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHerod the Great eventually killed three of the sons from his 10 \nwives. When the brother of his favorite wife, Mariamme, roused his \nsuspicions, he invited the high priest to a swimming party and, \nduring a rough game of polo, had his men drown the brother. \u0014\n\u0014\nNext, Herod ordered the killing of Mariamme's grandfather and \nfinally, suspecting Mariamme had betrayed him, he killed his most \nbeloved wife. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe leader is probably most notorious for the \"Massacre of the \nInnocents,\" as described in the gospel of Matthew. When, upon hearing \nthat a new king of Jews had been born in Judaea, Herod ordered the \nkilling of all male infants of Bethlehem aged 2 years or younger. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he realized his own death was imminent, Herod directed his \nsister to assemble the leading men of distinction from all parts of \nthe nation into a large arena and ordered they be killed as soon as \nhe died. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This was to discourage any celebrations at his death,\" explained \nMaier. \"At the time he was a walking encyclopedia of disease.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHot Oil Therapy \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an effort to fend off his afflictions, Herod the Great summoned \nthe nation's best physicians to his side. The medical team decided to \nplace the king in a tub of hot oil, which, needless to say, didn't \nhelp and even temporarily blinded him. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"At that time they believed that health and disease all depended on \nthe interaction of the four vital humors  blood, black bile, yellow \nbile and phlegm,\" said Mackowiak. \"So presumably they thought the oil \nbath might help cure this imbalance of his vital humors.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nA couple thousand years later, contemporary doctors were discussing \nwhat might have been proper treatments for the king, including kidney \ndialysis and surgical removal of his gangrene, at a special clinical \npathologic conference today at the University of Maryland School of \nMedicine. Each year Mackowiak selects a new historical figure to \ndiscuss possible diagnosis and treatment. Last year's subject was the \nRoman Emperor Claudius. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think the exercise teaches doctors to be humble,\" said Mackowiak. \n\"We can see how every generation of medical scientists are absolutely \nconvinced they have found the answers. But it's apparent that this is \na field that requires constant learning.\" \u0002\u0014",

    "words": "In Act 5 scene 5 of Shakespeare's Macbeth, the character Macbeth has \nheard that the queen is dead and he knows his own death is imminent. \nAt this timehe delivers his famous soliloquy:\u0014\n\u0014\nTomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow\u0014\ncreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\u0014\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\u0014\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\u0014\nThe way to dusty death. Out, Out, brief candle\u0014\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\u0014\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\u0014\nand then is heard no more. It is a tale\u0014\nTold by an idiot. Full of sound and fury\u0014\nSignifying nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs Macbeth right? Is life nothing but a shadow having no substance, \nno meaning? Writers and philosophers since recorded time have tried \nto answer the question. I don't think any of them have been \nsuccessful in answering the question to everyone's satisfaction. Some \none once said that \"Trying tospeak about the ultimate reality is like \nsending a kiss through a messenger.\" I understand their point: \nSomething of its truth is lost in the translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the meaning of life? A philosophical question to be sure but \nthis is not only the philosopher's question. It is a genuinely human \nquestion and therefore a question that we all ask. It might be a \nquestion that is asked in despair or hope, out of cynicism, or out of \nsincere curiosity and a deep desire to have goals and guidance in \nlife. However we raise the question about the meaning of life, it is \nour most basic and fundamental question.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so it comes as no surprise that Jesus deals with this question \nand answers it. Surprisingly, the answer is not given in the context \nof an argument with the Jewish leaders or in a discussion with his \ndisciples, and it is not given in the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus \ndeals with so many fundamental issues. It is telling that Jesus deals \nwith the meaning of life in the context of prayer.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the context of what has been called, by many scholars, Jesus' High\u0014\nPriestly Prayer. [Pause] The Disciples are in the upper room, now. \nThey have just finished the Passover meal and Jesus is thinking about \nhis crucifixion which will occur within the next 24 hours. He knows \nhe is about to leave his disciples alone in the world and he goes \nbefore God as a priest would, to intercede for them, to pray for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nListen again to his prayer. I am lifting out a few key verses: \"While \nI was with them, I protected them and kept them safe, but I will \nremain in the world no longerHoly Father, protect them by the power \nof your namethe name you gave meso that they may be one as we are \none. Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your son may \nglorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he \nmight give eternal lifeand this is eternal life: that they may know \nyou, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\" It is \nin this third verse that Jesus delivers the meaning of eternal life \nand in essence the meaning of life itself. He says, \"Now this is \neternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and\u0014\nJesus Christ, whom you have sent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn essence, Jesus says, \"the meaning of life is this: that you have a\u0014\nrelationship with God, and me his Son, Jesus Christ.\" And that's the \nlong and short of it! But, Jesus himself, understood just how \ndifficult it was going to be not only for his disciples but for all \nof us to come to this very simple realization in life and so he prays \nfor two key things. In order that we might understand the meaning of \nlife1. He Prays for Our Protection from the World.\u0014\n2. He Prays That We Might Know God.\u0014",

But postmodernism has \nrejected not only God\u0014\n                      and reason but also the very idea of \nuniversally valid truth. It teaches\u0014\n                      that individuals are locked in the limited \nperspective of their own race,\u0014\n                      sex, or ethnic group; claims to moral truth are \nviewed as oppressive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Postmodernism has thus radically altered the \nway many in this\u0014\n                      generation think about life's most basic \nsuppositions. And as\u0014\n                      postmoderns begin filling our pews, it becomes \nincreasingly hard for\u0014\n                      those who think in traditional terms to \ncommunicate the biblical view\u0014\n                      of life, or even to present the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When we speak of truthmeaning binding \nabsolutesour\u0014\n                      postmodern neighbors hear just one more opinion \namong many. The\u0014\n                      biblical story, which we present as divine \nrevelation, is seen merely\u0014\n                      as one of many, equally valid cultural \nnarratives.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This makes moral propositions increasingly \nproblematic to\u0014\n                      postmodern listeners. For instance, how can we \nargue for the\u0014\n                      \"common good\" when postmodernists don't believe \nin a common\u0014\n                      good, seeking instead, as philosopher John Gray \nput it, merely \"to\u0014\n                      reconcile conflicting goods\"?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We lack even a common language for moral \ndiscourse. When we use\u0014\n                      the term liberty, for example, we mean the \nclassic definition,\u0014\n                      famously articulated by Benjamin Franklin: the \nright to do what is\u0014\n                      right. Our Founders tied freedomthe highest \npolitical goalto moral\u0014\n                      truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But postmodernism unties the knot; today, when \nnewcomers to our\u0014\n                      pews hear the word liberty, they think the \ndefinition is \"the\u0014\n                      unrestricted right to do what one pleases.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It's a \"right\" codified by the infamous \n\"mystery clause\" in the\u0014\n                      Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood \nv. Casey (1992): \"At\u0014\n                      the heart of liberty is the right to define \none's own concept of\u0014\n                      existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of \nthe mystery of human\u0014\n                      life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This 180-degree turnabout stands government's \nrole on its head, as\u0014\n                      Professor Russell Hittinger has written. In the \nmodern era,\u0014\n                      government's role was to enforce commonly held \nmoral beliefs, rooted\u0014\n                      in Scripture. But today, as decreed in cases \nlike Roe v. Wade and\u0014\n                      Romer v.

One pastor\u0014\n                      told me that 10 years ago he could discuss \nmoral truth with\u0014\n                      unbelievers, while \"today I connect only on \ngrounds of pain and\u0014\n                      compassion.\" But connecting only at the level \nof feelings is a weak\u0014\n                      reed for evangelism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Someone might \"feel\" right about \nChristianityuntil those feelings\u0014\n                      change. And even a person who is drawn to \nChrist existentially has\u0014\n                      no context in which to understand those beliefs \nor the church's moral\u0014\n                      teachings. Significantly, a recent Barna poll \nrevealed that the most\u0014\n                      common basis for moral decision-making among \nChristians is \"doing\u0014\n                      whatever feels right\" in a given situation. \nThis is why, sadly,\u0014\n                      Christians and non-Christians divorce at the \nsame rate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Postmodernism must be confronted, not \naccommodated. We must\u0014\n                      challenge its false presuppositions, lovingly \nexplaining that there is\u0014\n                      truth and that it is knowable.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In order to reach today's culture, seminarians, \npastors, and laity, not\u0014\n                      unlike foreign missionaries, must learn to \ntranslate for today's\u0014\n                      postmoderns. For example, if we say, \"The truth \nshall make you\u0014\n                      free,\" it means one thing to ustruth, that is \nChrist, makes us free\u0014\n                      from sin and death.

    "title": "MOTHER'S DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY GO TOGETHER",
    "words": "Christian History Corner: Mom, We Salute You\u0014\nMother's Day and Memorial Day were meant to go together.\u0014\nBy Elesha Coffman | posted 05/10/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a resolution passed May 8, 1914, the U.S. Congress established the \nsecond Sunday in May as Mother's Day. Congress specified that on that \nday American flags should be flown outside homes and government \nbuildings \"as a public expression of our love and reverence for the \nmothers of our country.\" But what does patriotism have to do with \nMother's Day?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe founder of Mother's Day, Anna Jarvis, saw the connection. Born in \nGrafton, West Virginia, in 1864, she witnessed the aftermath of the \nCivil War. Her mother, Anna Maria Reeves Jarvis, had spent the war \norganizing women to nurse wounded soldiers from North and South and \ngenerally attempting to hold her border state community together. \nAfter the war, Anna Maria started \"Mothers' Friendship Days\" to \nreconcile families divided by the conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout her life, Anna Maria modeled ideal Victorian motherhood. \nShe gave up her dreams of college to tend to an older husband and \nfour children. She bore the loss of seven other children with grace. \nShe taught Sunday school in the local Methodist church for 20 years \nand stayed active in benevolent work.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnna Maria's death in 1905 devastated her daughter. Two years later, \nAnna got the idea to found a holiday to remember her mother and all \nmothers, whom she felt could never be thanked enough. It was also \nAnna's idea to place Mother's Day near Memorial Day (which had been \nproclaimed in 1868) in recognition of women's contributions in \nwartime: sending sons and husbands to fight, tending the wounded, \nmaintaining households alone, and encouraging peace and \nreconciliation. Memorial Day honored the sacrifices of men; Mother's \nDay would honor the sacrifices of women.\u0014\n\u0014\nMother's Day was first celebrated in 1908 in Grafton and \nPhiladelphia, where Anna lived as an adult. The Methodist church in \nGrafton is sometimes called \"the Mother's Day church\" in recognition \nof its place in history. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson \nrecognized the holiday in 1914, perhaps not coincidentally as America \nbegan to be drawn into another war.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, though, Mother's Day has little if anything to do with the \nideals of Victorian womanhood or with patriotism. We can thank, or \nblame, women's rights activists for the first shift and florists for \nthe second.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough Anna Jarvis envisioned Mother's Day as a quiet observance \ncentered on church and the home, advocates for causes such as world \npeace and female suffrage immediately seized the day for their own \nideas. Julia Ward Howe, who grew firmly anti-war after penning \"The \nBattle Hymn of the Republic,\" encouraged women to rise up on Mother's \nDay, defy their belligerent husbands, and declare, \"We will not have \ngreat questions decided by irrelevant agencies,We women of one \ncountry will be too tender of those of another country to allow our \nsons to be trained to injure theirs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOther causes followed. In 1968, Coretta Scott King led a Mother's Day \nmarch to raise awareness of women and children living in poverty. In \nthe 1970s, the National Organization for Women held Mother's Day \nrallies in support of the Equal Rights Amendment. The pro-gun-control \nMillion Mom March took place on Mother's Day in 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, florists hold primary responsibility for making Mother's Day \nwhat it is today. Anna Jarvis originally encouraged people to wear \nand give white carnations on her mother's holiday, because that was \nAnna Maria's favorite flower. This custom had the unintended \nconsequence of causing a run on white carnations, so florists instead \nencouraged grateful children to buy all sorts of readily available \nblooms.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe marketing effort quickly grew out of hand. Anna Jarvis advised \npeople to rebel, to wear buttons instead of flowers and to refrain \nfrom giving Mother's Day gifts at all. \"I wanted it to be a day of \nsentiment,\" she said, \"not profit.\" Obviously, no one listened. As \nearly as the 1920s, Mother's Day was one of America's biggest \ncommercial holidays, and it remains near the top for flowers \npurchased, cards sent, and phone calls made. Sue Ellen Thompson's \nbook Holiday Symbols (Omnigraphics, 2nd ed. 2000) classifies the \nobservance as \"promotional\" rather than \"religious\" or even, like \nMemorial Day, \"national or patriotic.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDepending on the family, any of these categories could apply. Whether \nmotherhood is better celebrated with flags, rallies, or bouquets (or, \nfor my mother, with Cubs tickets) is a separate question.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014",

Last \nyear's installment alone\u0014\n                            sold 3 million, and for the first time \nsince 1994, the author of the\u0014\n                            best-selling novel in the U.S. wasn't \nnamed Grisham. And yet it's\u0014\n                            hard to imagine a less likely fiction \nimpresario than LaHaye, a retired\u0014\n                            Evangelical pastor who turned 76 in \nApril. He didn't seriously\u0014\n                            contemplate writing a novel until his \n60sand then found he wasn't\u0014\n                            good at it (he hands over his notes for \neach book to Jenkins, 52, also\u0014\n                            a born-again Christian, who has written \nmore than 80 novels).\u0014\n                            Instead, LaHaye has spent most of his \nlife spreading his view of\u0014\n                            Christ and fighting for conservative \nprinciples, often through\u0014\n                            nonfiction. Very oftenLaHaye has had 51 \nnonfiction books\u0014\n                            published, an eclectic mix of theology \n(for example, the forthcoming\u0014\n                            Merciful God of Prophecy), self-help (I \nLove You, but Why Are We So\u0014\n                            Different?, 1991) and psychology \n(Spirit-Controlled Temperament,\u0014\n                            1966). \u0014\n\u0014\n                            Why are so many people turning to someone \nlike LaHayea guy\u0014\n                            more interested in reality than \nfictionfor novels? Because in this\u0014\n                            volatile moment, many people are starting \nto read the Left Behind\u0014\n                            books not as novels but as tomorrow's \nnewspapers. LaHaye\u0014\n                            believes that the Scriptures lay out a \nprecise timetable for the end of\u0014\n                            the world, and the \u0014\n\u0014\n                            Left Behind books let us in on the \nchronology. A man of few\u0014\n                            doubts, LaHaye offers answers to one of \nthe biggest\u0014\n                            questions ever posed: When will it end? \nWell, you will know\u0014\n                            the end has begun when the true believers \nin Christ vanish\u0014\n                            from the earth \"in the twinkling of an \neye\" (I Corinthians 15:\u0014\n                            52), leaving their Levi's in a rumple. \nThe rest of us are \"left\u0014\n                            behind\"and that's just where the series \nstarts. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                            36% of those polled who support Israel \nsay they do so\u0014\n                            because they believe in Biblical \nprophecies that Jews\u0014\n                            must control Israel before Christ will \ncome again\u0014\n                                                                 \nTIME/CNN Poll\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Although the books did well before Sept. \n11, sales soared in the\u0014\n                            confusing period that followed, and it's \nfair to speculate that last\u0014\n                            year's installment, Desecration: \nAntichrist Takes the Throne, would\u0014\n                            not have outsold John Grisham's Skipping \nChristmas to become the\u0014\n                            biggest novel of 2001 if the planes had \nnot crashed. Near the end of\u0014\n                            the first volume, Left Behind: A Novel of \nthe Earth's Last Days (1995),\u0014\n                            Jenkins writes of one of the heroes, \"He \nwanted to believe\u0014\n                            something that tied everything together \nand made it make sense.\"\u0014\n                            Exactly so. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            And just what ties it all together? \u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye and Jenkins would say it's the \nBible. As Evangelicals, they\u0014\n                            take every word literally, even those \nmystical-sounding parts of the\u0014\n                            Book of Revelation that seem to defy \ninterpretation. LaHaye has\u0014\n                            devoted much of his careerand 13 of his \nnonfiction worksto\u0014\n                            puzzling out what the Bible's prophecies \nmean. He has explained it\u0014\n                            all in dense tomes for fellow theologians \nas well as in the\u0014\n                            accessible 140-page Charting the End \nTimes: A Visual Guide to\u0014\n                            Understanding Bible Prophecy (written \nwith Thomas Ice, 2001). \"The\u0014\n                            future is settled, and not open to \nchange,\" LaHaye says. There is\u0014\n                            comfort in that message. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            A patient, detail-oriented man, LaHaye \ncan transform complex\u0014\n                            biblical passages into a map showing what \nhe believes to be the\u0014\n                            very battle plans for the last world war, \nbeginning with the massing of\u0014\n                            the Antichrist's armies in northern \nIsrael and ending with Christ's\u0014\n                            ascent on the Mount of Olives near \nJerusalem. Jenkins skillfully\u0014\n                            filters the outlines that LaHaye provides \nthrough the adventures of\u0014\n                            heroes Rayford Steele, a pilot, and \nCameron (\"Buck\") Williams, who\u0014\n                            starts out Left Behind as a 30-year-old \nvirgin and senior writer for\u0014\n                            Time's fictional competitor Global \nWeekly.

(Yes, \nBuck finds a girl amid the\u0014\n                            chaos, and like many of the series' \nfemale characters, she is\u0014\n                            constantly in need of rescuing.)\u0014\n                            Another writer might be overwhelmed by \nthe grand scale of things,\u0014\n                            but Jenkins, an easygoing golf nut who \nlives in Colorado Springs,\u0014\n                            Colo., doesn't let it bother him. He \ndoesn't slow the liquid-like pace\u0014\n                            of the novels even when his characters \nutter sentences such as\u0014\n                            \"[H]e cannot be expected to handle the \nduties of both the U.N. and\u0014\n                            Botswana during this strategic moment in \nBotswana history, right,\u0014\n                            Steve?\" Huh? No matter. Soon enough, the \nstory returns to the\u0014\n                            explosions and earthquakes preceding \nArmageddon. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            The Bible's prediction of violence during \nthis period gives the Left\u0014\n                            Behind books their gore. The nuclear \nfrights of, say, Tom Clancy's\u0014\n                            The Sum of All Fears wouldn't fill a \nchapter in the Left Behind series.\u0014\n                            (Large chunks of several U.S. cities have \nbeen bombed to\u0014\n                            smithereens by page 110 of Book 3.) \nHarvey Cox, a professor of\u0014\n                            divinity at Harvard, says part of the \nappeal of Left Behind lies in the\u0014\n                            \"lip-licking anticipation of all the \nblood.\" But many nonbelievers come\u0014\n                            to Christ in the course of the books, and \nthis holy \"soul harvest\"\u0014\n                            lends the series a buoyant optimism that \nmany critics have ignored. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye's fascination with End Times began \nwith his own optimism\u0014\n                            in the face of tragedy. At 9, he lost his \ngregarious father Frank to a\u0014\n                            heart attack. \"I had a lovable family \nlife, and it was gone,\" he says in\u0014\n                            a voice that sounds more like Nashville, \nTenn., than his native\u0014\n                            Detroit. \"I thought the world had come to \nan end. But the minister\u0014\n                            said, 'This is not the last we will see \nof Frank LaHaye.' Suddenly in\u0014\n                            my heart a great hope was born: I will \nsee him again. I feel that\u0014\n                            today; I feel it like it happened \nyesterday.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                            These words have a slightly rehearsed \nqualityas a pastor and\u0014\n                            book-tour veteran, LaHaye has had to tell \nthe same stories many,\u0014\n                            many times. But he tells them with \nsincerity. LaHaye doesn't have\u0014\n                            the stage presence required of a great \npreacher, but he knows how\u0014\n                            to show his heart one-on-one. Left \nBehind, which is published by the\u0014\n                            Christian press Tyndale House, has \nbrought LaHaye and Jenkins\u0014\n                            something like $50 million apiece, and \nLaHaye recently signed a\u0014\n                            separate $42 million deal with Bantam \nDell for a new series about\u0014\n                            an evangelical Indiana Jones. LaHaye \nneglected to tell Jenkins\u0014\n                            about the new deal in advance, leading \nsome in the publishing\u0014\n                            business to call him greedy. (As with \nLeft Behind, a working novelist\u0014\n                            will hammer LaHaye's thoughts into prose, \nthough the new\u0014\n                            compatriot, Davis Bunn, won't take as big \na cut50%as Jenkins\u0014\n                            did.) But LaHaye doesn't seem like a man \nmotivated by money.\u0014\n                            Aside from driving a white Cadillac SUV \nthe size of a tank, he and his\u0014\n                            wife of 55 years, Beverly, don't live \nlavishly. Their condo in Rancho\u0014\n                            Mirage, Calif., is at one of the less \nimpressive country clubs, and\u0014\n                            LaHaye recently gave a seminar in \nWichita, Kans., in a\u0014\n                            \nsports-coat/paisley-tie/blue-leather-loafer combo that looked as if it\u0014\n                            could not have been purchased after 1985. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            17% of Americans believe the end of the \nworld will\u0014\n                            happen in their lifetime \u0014\n                                                                 \nTIME/CNN Poll\u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye wasn't above urging the crowd in \nWichita to preorder the\u0014\n                            new Left Behind book on the Internet \n\"'cause I'm not sure you'll get it\u0014\n                            if you don't.\" But he doesn't beg like a \ncheap televangelist. Nor does\u0014\n                            he bluster like Jerry Falwell or Jesse \nJackson. If he's having an\u0014\n                            argumentsomething that happens a lot \nwhen you fight for a single\u0014\n                            political and religious viewpoint all \nyour lifeLaHaye doesn't get\u0014\n                            louder; he gets softer. He leans back and \ntakes a full minute to\u0014\n                            consider your point. And in the end he is \nalways interested in what\u0014\n                            for him is the only real question on the \ntable: Do you have a personal\u0014\n                            relationship with Christ? Would you like \nto? Within a few hours after\u0014\n                            we met for the first time, LaHaye gave me \nadvice about my career,\u0014\n                            my love life and my salvationand yet his \nquestions didn't feel\u0014\n                            intrusive. He's that genuine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye learned how to talk to people as a \npastor. In his first two\u0014\n                            decades after graduating from Bob Jones \nUniversity in 1950, he\u0014\n                            ministered in Minneapolis, Minn., and \nthen San Diego. In 1974 he\u0014\n                            founded an Evangelical church in El \nCajon, Calif., that today claims\u0014\n                            3,500 worshippers each Sunday. As a \npastor in turbulent California\u0014\n                            during the '60s, LaHaye saw all manner of \ngood people get into\u0014\n                            trouble with drugs and sex and sin. He \nfelt that fragile humans\u0014\n                            needed to be filled with the protective \nHoly Spirit early, and his\u0014\n                            churches quickly led to schools (his \nChristian Unified Schools of\u0014\n                            San Diego now sprawls across three \ncampuses) and to a college\u0014\n                            called Christian Heritage. \"You have to \ntrain up a child in the way he\u0014\n                            should go, according to Proverbs,\" LaHaye \nsays. \"All of us are\u0014\n                            vulnerable to leadershipand those who \ndeny biblical absolutes\u0014\n                            are leading many of us away.\" LaHaye sees \npeople as remarkably\u0014\n                            malleable creatures. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            Shaping adult minds required a more \nentrepreneurial approach, and\u0014\n                            LaHaye began writing self-help books. \nEventually he hit every\u0014\n                            conceivable publishing fad: sex advice \n(including 1976's The Act of\u0014\n                            Marriage, a blockbuster that declared \n\"the husband's use of clitoral\u0014\n                            manipulation\" to be godly); How to Win \nover Depression (1974);\u0014\n                            Anger Is a Choice (1982); Why You Act the \nWay You Do (1984).\u0014\n                            The early '80s were a good time for \nLaHaye. His large ministry and\u0014\n                            publishing presence gave him influence on \nthe ascendant religious\u0014\n                            right. He served on the first board of \nthe Moral Majority, and in 1984\u0014\n                            he started his own Washington group, the \nAmerican Coalition for\u0014\n                            Traditional Values (ACTV, pronounced \n\"active\"). His wife had\u0014\n                            incorporated yet another group, Concerned \nWomen for America, in\u0014\n                            1979, and today it claims 500,000 \nmembers, about the same\u0014\n                            number reported by the National \nOrganization for Women. In 1987,\u0014\n                            shortly after LaHaye became a co-chairman \nof Republican Jack\u0014\n                            Kemp's short-lived presidential campaign, \na Baltimore Sun reporter\u0014\n                            examined one of LaHaye's theological \nbooks, 1974's Revelation:\u0014\n                            Illustrated and Made Plain. The reporter \ndiscovered that LaHaye had\u0014\n                            called Catholicism a \"false religion\" and \nsaid Rome \"too often gives\u0014\n                            man a false security that keeps him from \nseeking salvation.\" The\u0014\n                            Sun reprinted the comments on a Friday; \nCatholics and reporters\u0014\n                            cried foul, and LaHaye resigned from the \ncampaign the following\u0014\n                            Monday. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye has never backed away from the \ncomments; in fact, they are\u0014\n                            reprinted in an updated, 1999 version of \nRevelation. Many argue with\u0014\n                            LaHaye's conception of God and heaven, \nbut it is his views about\u0014\n                            this world that set him apart. He \nbelieves, for instance, that witchcraft\u0014\n                            is real, citing a coven of witches \n\"outside Milwaukee\" that sends its\u0014\n                            members to churches and confuses the \npastors with spells.\u0014\n                            Similarly, he has written about a \"secret \norder\" called the Illuminati\u0014\n                            that has carried out a \"conspiracy on the \nchurch, our government,\u0014\n                            media, and the public schools\" for more \nthan 300 years. His book\u0014\n                            Mind Siege: The Battle for Truth in the \nNew Millennium (2000),\u0014\n                            co-written with David Noebel, says TV \npromotes incest and wife\u0014\n                            swapping as part of secularists' plans \nfor \"world domination.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                            On another subjectgays and \nlesbiansLaHaye's views are not\u0014\n                            just eccentric but downright odious. In \nhis 1978 book The Unhappy\u0014\n                            Gayswhich even today LaHaye calls \"a \nmodel of compassion\"he\u0014\n                            wrote that homosexuality is \"vile\" and \nthat gays share 16 pernicious\u0014\n                            traits, which include \"incredible \npromiscuity,\" \"deceit,\" \"selfishness,\"\u0014\n                            \"vulnerability to sadism-masochism\" and \n\"poor health and an early\u0014\n                            death.\" He wondered who was more \"cruel \nand inhuman\"those\u0014\n                            who accept gays even though they are so \nunhappy or \"those who\u0014\n                            practiced Old Testament capital \npunishment\" on gays. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            What's strange about these passages is \nthat they seem at odds with\u0014\n                            LaHaye's own warm temperament. Even his \nco-author, Jenkins,\u0014\n                            doesn't share LaHaye's more \nconspiracy-minded views about the\u0014\n                            Illuminati or his prejudices against \ngays. LaHaye has promoted an\u0014\n                            instructional videotape that says the \nHarry Potter books are helping\u0014\n                            \"disciple children into the darkest \naspects of black magic.\" But\u0014\n                            Jenkins says Potter is fine for anyone \nwho understands the\u0014\n                            difference between fantasy and reality. \nStill, he says of his partner,\u0014\n                            \"He knows how to get attention. That's \none of his gifts.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                            LaHaye got the idea for a fictional \nseries about the End Times some\u0014\n                            15 years ago, at a time when he felt he \nwasn't reaching enough\u0014\n                            nonbelievers. Perhaps that's why the Left \nBehind books for the most\u0014\n                            part avoid overtly conservative political \nstatements. There is little\u0014\n                            mention of homosexuality, and even as the \nAntichrist raises taxes,\u0014\n                            he orders pipelines installed to drain \nAlaskan oil (President Bush,\u0014\n                            take note). There is also a yuppie \naspirational quality to the books,\u0014\n                            which are full of pretty people with cell \nphones and seats in first\u0014\n                            class. In other words, Left Behind serves \nthose readers who are just\u0014\n                            as worried about being left behind in \nthis life as in the next. For the\u0014\n                            present, however, LaHaye is looking \nforward to finishing the Left\u0014\n                            Behind projectthere will be two more \nbooks as well as a prequel.\u0014\n                            He's eager to start his new series, which \nwill combine archaeology,\u0014\n                            prophecy and, of course, explosions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            \"I have a gift for explaining complex \nsubjects to common people,\"\u0014\n                            says LaHaye. And in these uncommon times, \nit's a gift that is\u0014\n                            increasingly well received. \u0014\n\u0014\n                            With reporting by Andrea Sachs/Colorado \nSprings\u0014",

    "title": "MY WORST YEAR IN MINISTRY",
    "words": "My Worst Year in Ministry\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone will have a \"worst year.\" Here are six strategies one pastor \nfound he needed.\u0014\nby Frank Payne\u0014\n\u0014\nI could not believe the letter I was reading. My long-time friend, \none of our elders, had resigned and written a scathing critique of my \ntheology and sermons. Just last June we had gone fishing together in \nIdaho. Now he was informing me that he had officially contacted the \nbishop, seeking my removal.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"How could he do this to me?\" I muttered, trying to decide if I felt \nmore despair or anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust the week before, I had learned that my next door neighbor was \nsuing me and the church. He was naming me a defendant in the case \nover an incident that had occurred in the driveway shared by his \nhouse and our parsonage. Our son had accidentally hit the neighbor's \ncar as the two of them were backing out together. The neighbor had \nfor years complained about the on-street parking problems and noise \nwhenever we hosted gatherings in our home. This was his perfect \nopportunity to exact revenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suit named both me and the church since the parsonage driveway \nwas church property. He claimed the accident had resulted in neck \ninjuries forcing him to miss work. He had hired a downtown law firm \nthat specialized in personal injury suits. The amount they were \nasking for in damages was twice the church's annual budget.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't just the neighbor who was now experiencing headaches. The \nmigraines I'd struggled with in college returned just after the first \ncourt appearance.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, one Sunday evening, after a particularly encouraging morning \nservice, I received a phone call from my younger brother Philip on \nthe West Coast. With a quiet voice he told me the heartbreaking news \nthat he'd been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nI felt myself sinking under a weight of anxiety and discouragement I \nsimply could not bear. The thought of getting up and preaching next \nSunday seemed impossible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"O Lord, how am I going to continue?\" I prayed. \"Every day the \npressure gets worse, not better. And it's been this way for weeks, \nnot just days. Help me, Lord; please help me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI didn't realize it then, but I was just beginning the worst year of \nmy life in ministry. As my brother's health worsened, the alienated \nelder became more and more vocal, and the lawsuit threatened to swamp \nboth me and the church, the words of the apostle Paul became my own \nspiritual autobiography, \"We were under great pressure, far beyond \nour ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, in \nour hearts we felt the sentence of death\" (2 Cor. 1:8-9).\u0014\n\u0014\nLying awake at night asking God what I had done to deserve all this, \nI remembered Warren Wiersbe once commenting that when we go through \nperiods of prolonged and intense suffering, \"God has His eye on the \nclock and His hand is on the thermostat.\" He promised listeners God \nwill not allow our trouble to go one minute beyond the length of His \nchoosing or permit the intense heat of affliction to go up one degree \nabove what He has declared.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven that assurance provided little relief as painful days turned \ninto painful weeks and then increasingly painful months. I wavered \nbetween doubting my calling and questioning my ability to stay at the \nchurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the midst of turmoil I began to discover ways of coping that \nprovided genuine relief and comfort.\u0014\n\u0014\nNone by themselves proved a cure-all, but together they provided hope \nthat someday I would again see the goodness of the Lord in the land \nof the living.\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking back at my dark year of the soul, I now see God provided \nseveral important strategies for persevering when it appeared the \ntrouble would never end.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaintain normal priorities\u0014\nOne of the first temptations I faced was to turn all available energy \nand time to dealing with the immediate crises.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tyranny of the urgent dominated nearly every aspect of life. When \nI first received notice of the lawsuit, I spent the better part of \nthe next two weeks calling personal injury lawyers, scanning the \nInternet for relevant statutes, or simply sitting for hours alone in \nmy office brooding over the situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result I rarely ate dinner with my family, and on one occasion \nfailed to return a single phone call for an entire week. I made the \nmistake common to those who find themselves under prolonged attack: \nneglecting our normal ministry duties and disciplines. It's hard to \nkeep your regular times of study, conduct normal rounds of \nvisitation, and even take time for daily devotions.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLike the human body, which shuts down one organ at a time to preserve \nthe more vital ones, I was letting one important responsibility slide \nafter anotherall in order to hang on for dear life.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, I had a trusted friend who insisted on keeping our \nweekly appointment to pray together. On one of these occasions, he \nsaid, \"I know things are difficult for you right now. Let me urge you \nto keep your focus on doing the things a good pastor does.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Give your time to teaching the Bible and showing love to your \ncongregation. Regardless of what else is happening in your life, this \nwill pay rich rewards when the present troubles are over.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took a few weeks for this advice to sink in, but it did when I \nnoticed the distractions were hurting me in vital areas. For example, \nas I put less time in sermon prep, I became more tentative in the \npulpit. Soon I found myself dreading Sunday morning because I knew in \nmy heart I wasn't prepared. I returned to my study regimen regardless \nof the crises.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaintaining a normal schedule during a time of intense adversity \nproduces an unexpected byproductit helps you feel normal! It \nprovides a source of emotional stability and helps keep you from \nobsessing on the larger problems. By visiting our shut-ins and \nwatching their eyes light up, I could temporarily experience more \npositive emotions. Focusing on someone else's needs allowed me to \nforget my ownat least for an afternoon.\u0014\n\u0014\nChallenge the siege\u0014\nA biblical metaphor helped define my situationI was under siege. In \nancient times it was common for armies to surround and lay siege to a \ncity for months or even years. The point of the prolonged assault was \nto wear down the opponent to the point of surrender.\u0014\n\u0014\nI considered all the problems encircling methe rage of the elder, \nthe lawsuit with the neighbor, and my brother's lingering fight with \ncancerand wondered how long I could hold out before my energy and \nhope were gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years I had maintained a routine of prayer and fasting that \nincluded missing two meals every Wednesday. I had seen numerous \nanswers to prayer as a result of this practice. But when I applied it \nto the current dilemma, no immediate answers came. What was wrong?\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the fasting and prayer, the angry board member turned up his \ncampaign to discredit me before the local district. The judge refused \nto dismiss the lawsuit and set a date to impanel a jury. My brother \nhad to quit his job because the chemotherapy treatments were leaving \nhim too weak. On top of all this, my second son, normally the most \nspiritually enthusiastic of our kids, simply announced one day he was \nno longer interested in going to church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was left? As I was struggling in prayer one day, the Holy Spirit \nseemed to impress on me, \"You are under siege. Your normal times of \nprayer and fasting were adequate for your previous battles, but they \nare not enough to deal with this current enemy. You need to increase \nyour times of prayer and fasting and ask God to lift this siege \nagainst your life, family, and church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI recalled the New Testament account where the disciples were unable \nto drive out a particular demon. This led to a heated argument among \nthem, interrupted only by Jesus' sudden arrival on the scene. He \nrebuked the demon and the suffering person was set free. Later the \ndisciples asked him privately, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" So He \nsaid to them, \"This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and \nfasting\" (Mark 9:28-29, NKJV).\u0014\n\u0014\nI began to commit longer periods of time to prayer and fasting. \nInstead of just two meals, I would fast for an entire day, sometimes \ntwo days a week. During these fasts, the weight seemed to lift \ntemporarily.\u0014\n\u0014\nI began to prepare myself for critical meetings and watershed events \nby first engaging in a prolonged period of prayer and fasting. On \nmore than one occasion, meetings that should have been unpleasant and \ndivisive turned into calm, productive discussions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the resolve to maintain this practice didn't come easy. Sitting \nat the table sipping fruit juice while the family devoured a fresh \npizza or a hot pork roast were awful, believe me! Yet the benefits of \nintensified prayer and fasting continued to pay off.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother change was in my own demeanor during difficult meetings or \nconversations. As a result of the prayer and fasting, I was able to \nrespond to adversaries with genuine love and patience.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile reading the biography of Hudson Taylor, I was struck by his \nstatement: \"You have no idea what it is like to wake up and be \ndespised by everyone you meet that day  I asked Christ to give me \nlove in my heart for each person I would meet, and he did. If \nlearning this lesson was the only reason I came to this land, it was \nworth the trip.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile my immediate circumstances did not change, my response to them \ndefinitely did. Prayer and fasting helped to break the siege.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpen up selectively\u0014\nDuring this ordeal it seemed only natural to turn for support and \nadvice to the one closest to memy wife, Debbie. Yet as the weeks \nturned to months, I watched my dear wife begin to buckle under the \nstrain. I realized I was placing more of a burden on her than she \ncould bear.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne night she woke up gasping for air.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What's wrong, dear?\" I asked, my own heart racing.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm having trouble breathing,\" she whispered. \"I might be having a \nheart attack.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI called her physician's office. The answering service took the call, \nand soon her doctor was on the line. After several hours in the \nemergency room, he determined she was suffering from what once was \ntermed \"soldier's heart\" or pain in the chest wall. Though not \nlife-threatening, its primary cause is traumatic stress.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a wake-up callI simply could not continue to download my \nemotional pain onto Debbie.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I sought out another pastor who had professional training in \ncounseling. I also reached out to friends in ministry outside my \ndenomination who were willing to listen with greater objectivity.\u0014\n\u0014\nOddly enough, my greatest moments of encouragement came not from \nother ministry professionals but from unplanned encounters with \ncaring laypeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne Sunday evening after a concert, a distinguished-looking woman, \nperhaps 70 years old, walked up, extended both hands, and said, \n\"Pastor, come with me. There are three of us at the front of the \nchurch who would like to pray for you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI had never seen her before. But she literally led me by the hand \nover to her group. As the sanctuary gradually emptied, they explained \nthat they had been invited by mutual friends to attend the concert. \nThey also explained they had been in a prayer group for several years \nand someone had shared with them the difficulties I was experiencing \nat the moment. The light and love in their eyes was life-giving.\u0014\n\u0014\nI sensed that God had sent these women. I briefly described some of \nmy burden. They laid hands on me and prayed. Nearly an hour later I \nfelt as if several tons had been lifted off my shoulders.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Where have you been?\" my wife asked when I got home.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I think God sent us three angels this evening,\" I said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I worked to stay emotionally connected to Debbie, I no longer \nrequired her to serve as my counselor, and her health and spirit \nimproved.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharacter not reputation\u0014\nPerhaps the worst moments of my worst year were when I learned that \nnasty stories about me were circulating in the community.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Did you know his denomination is asking him to take a leave of \nabsence from the ministry for two years?\" one story speculated. \"Did \nyou hear he steals his sermons from others?\" was another. Hardly a \nweek passed without someone informing me of a new tale they'd heard.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring this time a cousin sent me a plaque. It simply read: \n\"Reputation is who people think you are. Character is who you \nactually are. Take care of your character and your reputation will \ntake care of itself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe plaque led me to search the Scriptures for others who had known \nthe injustice of personal attacks. Moses was charged with a spiritual \npower grab by the sons of Korah. Nehemiah was accused of planning an \ninsurrection by Sanballat and Tobiah. Jesus was labeled a cohort of \nthe prince of demons by the Pharisees.\u0014\n\u0014\nI knew I was far from perfect, and my faults had broken through on \nmore than one occasion, but I also knew I had not earned the \nmalicious rumors swirling about the community.\u0014\n\u0014\nA man in our church pointed me to the example of Jesus: \"When they \nhurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, \nhe made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges \njustly\" (1 Peter 2:23).\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that point on, I made a commitment to avoid mudslinging with the \ncritics or hunting down the source of every rumor. I chose instead to \nrest in the assurance that one day the truth would become evident to \nall, if not in this lifetime, then in the next.\u0014\n\u0014\nGo against your flow\u0014\nOne particularly dark and lonely day, I decided to skip a meeting \nwith the bishop. I anticipated yet another session of answering the \nsame old charges from the angry elder.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It doesn't matter if I'm there or not,\" I told myself. Sensing what \nseemed like strength in this newfound rebellious attitude, I called \nfor a tee time at the golf course, and scheduled it precisely for \nwhen the meeting was to start.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was polishing my nine-iron when a friend from church called and \ninnocently asked, \"Can I pick you up this afternoon for the meeting \nwith Bishop Swenson?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm not going,\" I replied.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Why? What's come up? Are you feeling sick?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, I am sicksick and tired of meetings where I become the target \nfor people's potshots. I'm going golfing instead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a long pause on the line. \"Pastor, I love you, and I'm \ngoing to ask you to trust me. I wouldn't ask you to do anything that \nI believe would hurt you. I'm going to pick you up and take you to \nthe meeting. I'll personally stop the meeting if it gets mean. But \nyour presence is vital to restoring the confidence of the \ndenomination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe argued for nearly twenty minutes. Reluctantly I agreed to trust my \nfriend's judgment. Much to my surprise, the meeting turned out to be \naffirming and productive. Afterward I put my arm around his shoulders \nand said, \"Thanks. You were right. I did need to be here.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom that experience I gained greater resolve not to take \"the \ncounsel of my fears\" (as one famous military general put it). If my \nemotions said to stay inside and withdraw from people, I would \ndeliberately take our family out to eat. If I felt anxious about \nmaking a difficult phone call, I would intentionally make it the \nfirst order of business in the morning. If I would spot a contentious \nperson in the lobby after church, I would walk over and offer my hand.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD \nis kept safe\" (Prov. 29:25).\u0014\n\u0014\nTake thoughts captive\u0014\nThen in the midst of all this, my brother died of cancer. Phil was \njust a year younger than me, and the two of us had grown up almost \nlike twins. At times my grief over his loss threatened to overwhelm \nme.\u0014\n\u0014\nI kept a picture on my desk of our last Christmas together. Tears \nwould often come suddenly and without warning.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour weeks after my brother's death, my attorney called to urge me \nand the church to settle the lawsuit out of court for a large sum of \nmoney. It was the lawyer's opinion we would likely lose the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor weeks I had wondered if life could get any worse. The words of \nElijah, who collapsed from discouragement in the desert, were mine: \n\"He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might \ndie. 'I have had enough, Lord' he said. 'Take my life'\" (1 Kings \n19:4).\u0014\n\u0014\nMy migraines flared up again, making me sick to my stomach. \"Yes, I \nknow how you feel, Elijah,\" I mumbled while shaving that morning. \n\"Believe me, I know how you feel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen would God bring relief? One afternoon a concerned fellow pastor \ncalled to check on me. As I shared my weariness and exhaustion, he \nreplied that God had moved him to stay up all night to pray for me. \nThen he quoted a Scripture verse he believed he was to give me: \"'No \nweapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every \ntongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the \nLord, and this is their vindication from me,' declares the Lord\" (Is. \n54:17). The verse promised something I had all but given up \non\"'vindication from me,' declares the Lord.\" Perhaps God had not \nabandoned me completely.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen during one of my morning devotional times, I read: \"For though \nwe live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The \nweapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the \ncontrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish \narguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the \nknowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it \nobedient to Christ\" (2 Cor. 10:3-5).\u0014\n\u0014\nI realized that if I was going to survive, indeed if my marriage, \nfamily, and church were going to survive, I would need to begin \ntaking my thoughts captive and making them obedient to Christ. I \nsimply couldn't let my mind wander down an undisciplined path to \nworry and despair any longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne by one, day after day, God began to help me confront my darkest \nbrooding and fear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What if the former deacon is successful in getting me fired?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNo weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every \ntongue that accuses you.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What if we lose the court case?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in \nthe land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart \nand wait for the Lord (Psalm 27:13-14).\u0014\n\u0014\nMy deliberate efforts to capture racing thoughts began to bring light \nand hope back to my spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet as Phil's birthday came and went, I found myself staring once \nagain at the picture of my brother's smiling face.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pain, the unfairness, and the combined cruelty of his premature \ndeath suddenly threatened to lead me down a path of new despair. Even \nthe assurance of life after death seemed to unravel at that moment.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Lord,\" I prayed at my desk, \"where is my brother today? What's \nhappened to him?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral minutes later I opened my eyes and noticed an unopened letter \nin my stack of correspondence. The name on the return address was a \nformer Sunday school teacher who had taught Phil and me years ago in \nCalifornia. Tearing it open, I scanned down the lines.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last paragraph captured my heart, \"Christians in East Asia, where \nI once served as a missionary, do not refer to death as death, but \nrather as a 'change of address.' Take heart, my friend, your dear \nbrother has simply changed addresses.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the bottom was embossed: \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is \na new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\" (2 Cor. 5:17).\u0014\n\u0014\nI cried harder than I had cried for weeks, but it was a cleansing \ngrief. God had once again taken captive my thoughts and turned them \nover to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnd of the year\u0014\nEventually the worst year of my ministry came to an end. Not all at \nonce, but slowly. The troubling elder was transferred by his employer \nto another state, and with his departure the prime mover behind the \nturmoil at church was gone.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe title company involved in the purchase of the parsonage produced \na survey of the property that showed my neighbor's garage was \nactually encroaching on our property. The opposing attorney quickly \nsuggested a settlement to avoid a counter suit. An agreement was \nreached that paid for medical costs, the price of attorney's fees, \nand damage done to his client's car, but no more.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout the intense triangular pressures, the migraine headaches \nsubsided and eventually disappeared altogether. I am a different \nperson and pastor at the end of this ordeal, and most of the changes \nare for the better.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the grief of losing my brother remains fresh, it has also made \nme more tender and sympathetic to those who've lost close relatives. \nI have a new appreciation for the practicality and timeliness of the \nBible, especially where Paul describes his own ordeal: \"We were under \ngreat pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we \ndespaired even of life. Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of \ndeath\" (2 Cor. 1:8-9).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time I could go on and read the remainder of the passage and \nclaim it as my own story, \"But this happened that we might not rely \non ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFrank Payne is a pseudonym for a pastor who remains in the church \ndescribed. I didn't realize it then, but this was the beginning of \nthe worst year of my life.\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Leadership Journal.\u0014",

A cunning \ntrickster had stained and filed her skull and the ape's jaw to make \nthem appear ancient, then planted them in a shallow pit where \nlaborers were doing road work. The workmen took their find to a local \namateur paleontologist, Charles Dawson, who showed them to Arthur \nSmith Woodward, the foremost paleontologist at London's British \nMuseum. He confirmed the bones' prehistoric provenance and the new \ncreature's key position in the evolutionary tree: The big-brained \nhominid bridged the evolutionary gap between ape and man, all but \nproving Darwin's theory of common descent. The \"missing link\" had \nbeen found. And it was British.\u0014\n\u0014\nDubbed\"Dawson's Dawn Man,\"Eoanthropus dawsoni didn't have a lot of \ncompetition at the time.

Without better evidence, \nPiltdown fit some people's preconceptions of man's \nevolutionspecifically, that our big brains, and thus, intelligence, \ndeveloped before other aspects of modern man. Even so, some \nscientists of that era argued that certain characteristics of the \nbones, like the absence of the critical joints that connect a cranium \nwith a jaw, proved they were never really joined as one. The critics \nwere generally ignored.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the puzzle of Piltdown grew with the discovery of other hominid \nfossils. The finding of tiny-brained Australopithecus in Tanzania in \n1924, for example, made Dawn Man's large brain case increasingly \ninexplicable. Stacks of articles and essayssome say 500 or morewere \ndevoted to the maddening topic. One professor who swallowed the \nPiltdown scam said the contradictions merely proved that \"there were \nat least two very distinct and independent species of primitive man.\" \nPiltdown was slowly cast off as a freakish anomaly until 1949, when \nchemical tests found that the skull and jaw were younger than many \nbelieved. Radiocarbon dating in the 1950s confirmed the true age of \nthe bones and that they came from two different periods. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhodunit? Theories abound as to why someone would engineer the hoax. \nRevenge? Prestige? Just because? And whowas it Dawson, the wannabe \nexpert, or perhaps Smith Woodward, the fame-hungry scientist? Many \nthink the perp was fingered in the 1970s, when a steamer trunk in the \nBritish Museum's attic was found to contain a cache of Piltdownesque \nfragmentsfossilized teeth abraded and stained like the sham bones. \nThe name on the trunk: Martin A. C. Hinton, a curator at the museum \nat the time of the Piltdown discovery. Some say he had a penchant for \nelaborate practical jokes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe four-decade hoax still stands as the longest-running \npaleoanthropological sham. So why did so many scientists take the \nbait? \"Many were just too trusting and gullible,\" says Chris \nStringer, head of human origins at the paleontology department at \nLondon's Natural History Museum. Rosenberg uses the Piltdown hoax in \nclass to illustrate the importance of context: Scientists can develop \ntheories based only on how much is known at that time. But don't \ndiscount nationalism and ethnocentricity. Western scientists back \nthen wanted to believe the first humans were Europeans, she says.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr maybe everyone's just a sucker when it comes to his own origins. \nJapanese scientists put their faith in self-taught archaeologist \nShinichi Fujimura, who for 20 years was reverently called \"God's \nHand\" for his otherworldly ability to find ancient relics that placed \nthe earliest known humans in Japan. His findings through the 1980s \nand 1990s challenged established theories about man's origins, but a \ncombination of the country's native cordiality and Fujimura's \nunblemished repu-tation kept critics at bay.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is, until November 2000, when a newspaper printed pictures of \nhim planting items in prehistoric layers of earth. Some were actually \nancient; others were just stones scratched to look old. At a news \nconference following his exposure, a shaken Fujimura said he was \ntempted by the Devil. But the gullible scientists can blame only \nthemselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis entire issues was devoted to hoaxes.\u0014",

Where chess employs 16 pieces of \nsix types on a board of 64 squares, Timur's game used 28 pieces of 11 \ndifferent types on a board of 112 squares. His domination and \nexpansion of the chessboard paralleled his success on the \nbattlefield, where he showed opposing armies no mercy and extended \nhis domain.\u0014\n\u0014\nA leg injury earned Timur the nickname Timur-I-Leng (Persian for \"the \niron limper\"), which became Anglicized as Tamerlane, but the \nresulting limp belied his military prowess. Through surprise, \ntactical feints, and the effective use of cavalry (like Genghis Khan \nbefore him), Tamerlane enjoyed 35 years of virtually uninterrupted \nconquest. Although his empire eventually stretched from Syria to \nTibet, his objective was not to capture territory but treasure, and \nafter looting one city, he would wait a few years and return to loot \nit again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people who stood in his way frequently were slaughtered en masse. \nAfter capturing Delhi in India, for example, Tamerlane killed all the \ndefenders and piled their skulls--some 80,000 in all--into a pyramid \nas a warning to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, until eclipsed by 20th century practitioners of genocide like \nAdolf Hitler, Tamerlane was the archetype of despotism in Western \nminds.

While there, using toilet paper to write on, he \ncomposed a letter that became a classic of American political \nliterature--his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nKing was in Birmingham to organize a boycott of stores that posted \nsigns reading \"WHITES ONLY.\" He petitioned the city for a permit to \nprotest the discriminatory policy, but Birmingham officials \nrepeatedly denied his applications.

King, who \nhad studied Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience and Mahatma \nGandhi's writings on the same theme, began by distinguishing just \nlaws from unjust.

    "title": "MEANING-FULL TRANSLATIONS",
    "words": "Meaning-full Translations\u0014\nThe world's most influential Bible translator, Eugene Nida, is weary \nof 'word worship.'\u0014\nInterview by David Neff | posted 09/16/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nEugene A. Nida is not a household name, but the 84-year-old resident \nof Belgium has influenced the Bibles read by most Christians around \nthe world. The \"premier linguist and translation consultant,\" as the \nEvangelical Dictionary of World Missions styles him, writes mostly \nabout technical topics: descriptive linguistics, cross-cultural \ncommunications, translation theory, and semantics. However, the \ntranslations he helped shape in over 200 languages make it easier for \nmany millions of lay Christians and nonbelievers to grasp the meaning \nof the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe taught at the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL), the \neducational alter ego of Wycliffe Bible Translators, and eventually \nbecame executive secretary for translations at the American Bible \nSociety.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe coined the term dynamic equivalence translation to describe a \n\"meaning-based\" approach to translationone that looks for functional \nequivalence rather than formal resemblance in translation. The \nAmerican Bible Society's 1976 Good News Bible and its 1995 \nContemporary English Version show his influence, as do other \nprominent translations, such as the New Living Translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nCT editor David Neff talked with Nida when the outspoken linguist \nvisited the United States earlier this year.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do you consider your most important contribution to Bible \ntranslation?\u0014\n\u0014\nTo help people be willing to say what the text meansnot what the \nwords are, but what the text means.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Hallowed be thy name in the Lord's Prayer. I have not \nmet one English-speaking person who can tell me what that means. I've \nmet some theologians who say that this is a passive imperative (which \nwe don't have in the English language), but it seems to me a tragedy \nfor us to use expressions that most people don't understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did you develop your ideas about Bible translation 50 years ago?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was at the University of California, Los Angeles, our \nprofessors would never let us translate literally. They said, \"We \nwant to know the meaning. We don't want to know just the words.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI found that a number of the Greek classics had been translated very \nmeaningfully, much better than the Bible had been translated. I \nthought it a tragedy to have the Scriptures in a form that most \npeople misinterpret. Why should the Bible be so much more poorly \ntranslated than secular texts?\u0014\n\u0014\nI studied linguistics, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, and I decided that \nwe've got to approach the Scripture as though it is the message and \ntry to give its meaning, not just to repeat the words.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs this difficult in practice?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we bring together a group of folks who want to be translators, \nit takes a month to get them willing to make sense intellectually. It \ntakes another two weeks to make them willing to do it emotionally. \nThey can accept it intellectually but not emotionally because they've \ngrown up worshiping words more than worshiping God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can't have conferences for new translators in less than six weeks \nbecause of this psychological hurdle. Otherwise, within a year's time \nthey will be producing literal translations because it's so much \neasier to do it word-for-word.\u0014\n\u0014\nBible translators often think they must aim at almost exact verbal \ncorrespondence to the original in order to make sense. Many of them \ninsist there must be consistency of words. But consistency in \nprincipal words is misleading because words have a variety of \nmeanings depending on context. So a translator can be consistently \nwrong as well as consistently right.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis \"word worship\" helps people to have confidence, but they don't \nunderstand the text. And as long as they worship words, instead of \nworshiping God as revealed in Jesus Christ, they feel safe.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow have your ideas on translation changed over the years?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was working on my doctorate I studied linguistics, \ncommunications, and lexicography, and at the same time I took courses \nin anthropology, because words only have meanings in terms of the \nculture of which they are a part.\u0014\n\u0014\nLanguage is a part of culture. Therefore, we have to understand the \ncultures of the New Testament period if we're going to understand \nwhat the writers were trying to say.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome metaphors seem to be culturally bound to their original context. \nOthers travel well to other cultures. Consider the shepherd metaphor, \nwhich has links to the Davidic kingship and to Jesus. How important \nis it to maintain consistency in shepherd references?\u0014\n\u0014\nLook out, because in most of Africa, sheep are regarded as very bad \nanimals! Goats are greatly appreciated. If a woman were exchanged for \na number of goats, she would have prestige. If she were exchanged for \na number of sheep, she could never live it down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe translator, of course, cannot change all the sheep into goats and \nthe goats into sheep. But you've got to have footnotes to explain the \ncultural difference. Otherwise, you're going to give an entirely \nwrong impression.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnimals have a different metaphorical potential in various languages. \nOne fellow was anxious to change all the sheep to pigs because in his \npart of New Guinea, pigs were the important animals. (I have actually \nseen women in New Guinea nursing piglets.) I said, Wait a minute, \nbecause for the Old Testament, pigs were not kosher. So you've got to \nhave a footnote explaining the cultural differences. These people are \nsmart enough to recognize the difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou respect the intelligence of the reader even in nonliterate \nsocieties.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey're not stupid. Most primitive people know different cultures do \nthings in different ways from the way they do it. They are much more \nadaptable than the translators. They don't worship their own \nparticular culture as much as the missionaries worship their own \nEnglish interpretation of Greek and Hebrew culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the smartest committee I ever worked with were five Bushmen \nin the Kalahari Desert. Linguistically, they have a highly \ncomplicated language with tonal differences. And culturally they were \nextremely sophisticated. Never met with five better men in my life \nthan in the Kalahari Desert.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have an interesting way of testing translations. We always get \nsomebody who's a very good readera local person, never a \nmissionaryto read the translation to a group of people. We watch \ntheir eyes and especially around the mouth. If the people begin to \nopen their mouths, you know they're understanding. If they sit there \nwith the mouth closed, you know they don't understand.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat units of written texts carry the most meaning?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe phrase. In all communication, the context (not the individual \nwords) has to be focused on. In semiotics and information theory, it \nis the context that has the most possibilities for indicating the \nmeaning of the core element. So we try to have people understand that \nthey've got to build context into expressions in order for key words \nto make sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you sometimes add context?\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course. You may have a word like logos, which has over 70 \nmeanings. How do you know what meaning out of 70? It's by the \ncontext. Therefore you've got to build meaning into your translation \nof the word logos by indicating a meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you react to complaints about the way gender has been handled \nin meaning-based translations?\u0014\n\u0014\nFace the fact that ancient Israel was a male-dominated culture. You \nhad to have ten men to form a synagogue. Sixty women couldn't be a \nsynagogue without ten men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many instances, though, it is good to talk about people and leave \nit ambiguous. There is nothing sacred about specifying always men, \nmen, men.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the limits in our translating gender references for the \nmodern American church? Should we say brothers and sisters everywhere \nPaul writes adelphoi?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe're stuck with English, and we have to make a decision if we're \ngoing to be inclusive. It seems to me that the words in those \ncontexts are referring to people in general. It's not referring just \nto men, although we have to admit that in many instances they were \nmen who were involved in the discussions. But the implications of \nsuch passages are for people in general.\u0014\n\u0014\nTranslators who have been influenced by your work tend to shy away \nfrom using the Jews, particularly in the Passion narratives. They \nsubstitute Jewish leaders and other phrases. Is that legitimate?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem Jesus had was not with the Jews in generalthe problem \nwas in the Jewish leadership. I think that's perfectly legitimate \nbecause in the Gospels, when it says the Jews, it is not talking \nabout Jews in general. It is usually talking about the Pharisees, but \nin some instances the Sadducees.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome American translations have suppressed biblical poetry, even in \nthe Psalms. How should poetry and other rhetorical elements be \nhandled?\u0014\n\u0014\nI was very surprised that in the Living Bible there were a number of \npassages that were really quite lyrical, but it was all printed as \nprose because the translator felt that most Americans didn't believe \nanything that was in poetic lines. He was probably right, because \nmost people don't believe that poetry really has any particular truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nBible translators are not producing poetry in the traditional \nEuropean sense. Western poetic style can work for some of the Psalms, \nthough not for all of the Psalms. But if somebody has the skill, the \ncreativity, and the ability to render the Psalms poetically, they \nshould be encouraged.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe had a Zulu poet who came to us and said, the Psalms are real nice, \nbut they're not written right. Zulu poetry has a very complicated \n12-syllable line structure. It's a chant structure. He reorganized \nthe material, and now it's meaningful for Zulus. And it has the flow \nof what the Psalms would have had, because they were normally chanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne critic recently complained about meaning-based translation, \nsaying that it required the translator to do exegesis first.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrankly, we like to have exegesis first and last. If the translator \ndoesn't know what he's talking about, why should he be translating?\u0014\n\u0014\nHow familiar with biblical languages should preachers be?\u0014\n\u0014\nThey should be familiar with the Bible, not necessarily with biblical \nlanguages.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was in Japan trying to push a translation committee there to speed \nup their work. I took one of the important passages of the New \nTestament\"The righteousness of God is revealed from faith to \nfaith\"and I tried to explain all the problems involved in that very \nsuccinct statement. When I got through, they said, \"If we made the \nBible that clear, what would the preachers have to do?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI said, \"They could preach.\" Preaching is not exegeting the Greek or \nHebrew text. Preaching is applying that message to life. The New \nTestament is a terribly practical book, and it has a lot of lessons \nfor everyday living.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe translators want to give them a basis for exegeting it right. We \nalways have footnotes because in some passages we don't know what was \nreally meant. There may be two or even three interpretations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case of \"The righteousness of God is revealed from faith to \nfaith,\" is this God's own personal righteousness? Or is it the way in \nwhich God makes us righteous through our faith in Jesus Christ? These \nare very important differences, and they ought to be footnoted, \nideally in the order in which the truth was recognized by the major \npart of Christendom.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould I look for a different kind of translation to read aloud in \nchurch from one that I might study at my desk?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are three kinds of translations: first, a liturgical \ntranslation; second, a common-language translation that almost \neverybody can read and understand; third, translations for particular \nconstituencieschildren, for example. All major languages need these \nthree types of translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you're going to have the Scriptures presented orally from the \npulpit, you're not going to have a lot of footnotes. Hopefully your \npreacher will take time to explain some of the problems. But a Bible \nfor public reading should not only be accurate in meaning but should \nhave a good flow of language so that you don't have a lot of \nunnecessary breaks in the line.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat would you tell young people who think that Bible translation \nmight be their calling?\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, SIL [www.sil.org] has a good program, but young people really \nought to get a good foundation in Greek and Hebrew and in cultural \nanthropology. Then they can pick up what is related to translation. \nMore of the problems involve cultural anthropology than they do \nproblems of theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are the biggest challenges that the whole field of Bible \ntranslation faces? Is it just the sheer number of languages?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think it would be a string of Mongolian languages that goes all the \nway from Mongolia to Turkey. A number of these languages have nothing \nof the Scriptures. The cultures are mostly Muslim.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would be very important also in some of the more well-known Muslim \nareas to produce translations that are more relevant and on a better \nlevel of Arabic. So many of the translations reflect a very \ntraditional form of the language.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the impact of multiple translations?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt makes people begin to think. As long as all people had the King \nJames Version, they didn't think. It's terribly important to have \ndifferent translations to get a good argument started.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I was a small boy, my most important theological learning was \nthe result of a preacher who used the 13th chapter of Revelation to \nprove that Mussolini was the Antichrist. One week later, another man \nused the same passage to prove that Mussolini wasn't the Antichrist. \nSo I asked my father, What's wrong?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, Son, it's much more important to know how to doubt than it \nis how to believe.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn awful lot of Christians don't think. Preachers just want them to \nsay Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\nHas the plethora of translations saturated the market for Bibles? \nWhat further is needed?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is really needed is for people to take the message seriously and \nshare it with other people, focused primarily on what this message \nhas meant to me. So many Christians love to argue about the Bible \nrather than take it seriously as a message that is important for \ntheir own lives. In many of the churches in Africa, Asia, and \nelsewhere, people take the Bible's message far more seriously than \nthey do here in America, where the Bible is so ordinary.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today.\u0014",

Never mind that\u0014\n                                    he spoke the phrase completely \nout of context.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Todd Starnes, of Baptist Press, \nlifted the quote out of its\u0014\n                                    context and wrote an article that \nwas misleading to Southern\u0014\n                                    Baptists.

They fall for the \nlies told about moderates and\u0014\n                                    conservatives. They claim that \nmoderate and conservative\u0014\n                                    Southern Baptists do not believe \nthe Bible because they say it\u0014\n                                    is just a book. Never mind they \nblatantly took the phrase out of\u0014\n                                    its context.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Within seconds after he spoke, \nfundamentalists jumped on\u0014\n                                    Anthony Sizemore like ducks on \nJune bugs. They seized the\u0014\n                                    moment to multiply lies upon lies \nabout what he believed.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Taken in context, Sizemore's \nharmless statement was\u0014\n                                    meaningful. His argument was that \nthe Bible is not synonymous\u0014\n                                    with Deity and does not belong on \nthe level of the Trinity. The\u0014\n                                    Baptist Faith & Message of 2000 \nelevated the Bible to Deity\u0014\n                                    status by saying that the Bible \nis the very Revelation of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    In reality, the new statement of \nfaith elevated the Bible\u0014\n                                    to a status above Jesus Christ. \nHowever, Jesus alone is the\u0014\n                                    true Revelation of God. (John 1:1)\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Sizemore was attempting to point \nout to the fundamentalists\u0014\n                                    that the \"Bible is just a book,\" \nin the sense that it is the \"written\u0014\n                                    revelation of God.\" Nothing more, \nnothing less. Yet, taken out\u0014\n                                    of context, the fundamentalists \nbelieved that Sizemore's\u0014\n                                    comment meant the Bible is a book \nof no more importance than\u0014\n                                    Gone With the Wind. Now, a short \nyear later, the president\u0014\n                                    of the SBC sallies forth with \ngenuine statements of\u0014\n                                    heresy and nobody raises an \naudible gasp. Merritt's\u0014\n                                    heresy has no defense. Merritt's \nstatements, whether in or out\u0014\n                                    of context, are heresy. Hear \nthree statements from the\u0014\n                                    president's mouth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         1. \"You see, it is the word \nof God that saves \u0014\n                                             sinners and turns them \ninto saints...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         2. \"It is the word of God \nthat takes a sinner and\u0014\n                                             turns him into a saint!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                         3. \"Because this book ALONE \nis the word of\u0014\n                                             God!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    One might argue that we have \ntaken these three comments out\u0014\n                                    of context. However, taken either \nin and out of context, Merritt\u0014\n                                    was talking about the Bible. It \ndoes not take a rocket scientist\u0014\n                                    or an intelligent theologian to \nsee that his statements are\u0014\n                                    heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Nowhere in the Bible is there a \nclaim that the book itself has\u0014\n                                    salvific qualities. Nowhere in \nthe Bible does it claim to be,\u0014\n                                    \"ALONE,\" the word of God. Nowhere \nin the Bible are there\u0014\n                                    claims that a book died on the \ncross for the sins of people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    As Sizemore stated, the Bible is \nindeed just a book. It is a\u0014\n                                    divinely inspired book and is the \nrecord of the revelation of\u0014\n                                    God. It is the record of the \nrevelation of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n                                    Therefore, it contains the divine \nqualities only so far as it tells\u0014\n                                    us who Jesus was and what He came \nto accomplish for sinful\u0014\n                                    people. The Bible cannot save a \nsingle soul.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    Both in context and out of \ncontext, that's precisely what James\u0014\n                                    Merritt said in his sermon. So, \non one June day in 2000, a\u0014\n                                    single statement was taken out of \ncontext and fundamentalists\u0014\n                                    with audible gasps cried heresy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                    On another June day, just one \nyear later, the president of the\u0014\n                                    SBC complete with a Ph.D. in \ntheology, issues no less than\u0014\n                                    three statements of heresy and \nthere are no audible gasps to\u0014\n                                    be heard.

There was \nlittle doubt that one could sail around the world--as long as there \nwas no uninterrupted land barrier that stretched from the top of the \nworld to the bottom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe voyages of Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and others in \nthe late 1400s and early 1500s proved that there was, in fact, quite \na considerable land mass to the west, and that it was not the Far \nEast but a New World altogether. The question, then, was whether \nthere was a passage around or through the land, and if there was such \na passage, how far was it from there to the East Indies?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Portuguese explorer Magellan answered that question, with his \ndiscovery of the passage at the tip of South America between the \nAtlantic and Pacific oceans that now bears his name--the Strait of \nMagellan. \u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, Magellan himself did not live to complete the voyage. Had he \nbeen able to sail on to the west, through the islands of Indonesia, \nacross the Indian Ocean, around the tip of Africa, and back to Spain, \nhe would have completed the first circumnavigation of the world in \none voyage. He has always received credit for doing so because some \nof the sailors in his fleet did manage to return, thus completing the \nmammoth undertaking Magellan had organized and commanded. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, on April 27th, 1521, the great navigator himself was killed \non a beach in the Philippines, at the end of a lopsided battle with \nthe forces of the chieftain of the Mactan island. Chief Lapulapu \nhimself delivered the final blow, and has been celebrated ever since \nas the first Filipino to defeat a European would-be conqueror.

I mean whichever text of the Old Testament or \nthe New Testament or whichever translation you actually study.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is important because there are those who say that the Bible \nloses its authority and becomes relatively useless unless it is \nverbally inspired, inerrant, and infallible, truth without any \nmixture of error. That is strong language, stronger than the language \nof the Baptist Faith and Message adopted by the Southern Baptist \nConvention in 1925 and again in 1963.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously such language cannot be applied to The Living Bible, for \nthe translator tells us that he has produced a paraphrase rather than \nan exact translation. Neither is the popular Good News for Modern Man \nan exact translation, for it, too, is partially paraphrase. Scholars \nhave also argued about specific portions of the translation in the \nKing James Version, the Revised Standard Version, and the New English \nVersion. Not one of these is precisely accurate without any mixture \nof error .\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps you use the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. Do you use the \nHebrew text without the vowels or do you use the much later eighth \ncentury AD Massoretic vowel pointed text, or do you prefer the \nSeptuagint?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the New Testament, do you prefer the Westcott and Hort Greek \ntext, the Nestle's Greek text, or the United Bible Societies' text? \nDo you prefer any of the footnotes to the main text?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scholars have had a hand in establishing each of these original \nlanguages texts of the Old and New Testament, not to mention the\u0014\ntranslations. I have great confidence in scholars, but I do not think \nthey are infallible.\u0014\n\u0014\nAny talk about the inerrant, infallible, verbally inspired Scripture, \ntruth without any mixture of error, must take account of the problems \nof textual differences and translation. Some who use this language do \nso apparently intending to deceive by not making it clear that they \nare really talking about the original copy or original autograph of \neach book of the Bible and not a Bible available today.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a thousand years no one has seen any original autograph of each \nbook of the Bible. The earliest copies of the New Testament available \nto us are in the library of the Vatican or the British Museum and \nwere made about AD 400.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are not exactly alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is why I am concerned about the emphasis on something not now \navailable to us. Surely the original autograph is not the only Bible \nwe can trust.\u0014\n\n                                                                                                                                                                             \u0014\nI am not talking about a Bible which used to exist. I am talking \nabout the Bibles on your and my bookshelf - Hebrew, Greek, German, \nFrench, Latin, Engl ish, Russian -each one has truth without any \nmixture of error for its matter. It is the authoritative revelation \nof God; it is the rule of faith and practice; it is the source of my \nknowledge of salvation; it has introduced me to the God and Father of \nour Lord, Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am aware of the mistakes the copyists made in ancient manuscripts. \nI am aware of scholarly limitations and prejudices and the \ntheological blindness of some translators. Yet, my Bible is true. I \nam going to live by it; I am going to die believing it and trusting \nthe Savior I have found through it; I am going to live eternally with \nthe God who inspired it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, I am going to study it with the help of all the \ntheological scholars the world can produce. I will be grateful to \nthose scholars who help me while ignoring those who do not.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf God had thought I needed an inerrant, infallible, verbally \ninspired copy of the Bible, he would have preserved the original text \non a golden tablet.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod has not left me without anything necessary for my salvation. We \nmay use all of the strong language we want about the original \nautographs of the Bible, but my faith can survive with the Holy \nScripture available to me today. The differences in the ancient texts \nare not all that great. Please do not put any barriers against the \nfaith of simple Christians who assume that the Holy Spirit can guide \nthem into the truth with any copy of the Bible that happens to be \nhandy. Let those among us who are helped thereby discuss the \ninfallibility of the original autographs, but let scholars keep \nworking to produce better copies of the Bible in English for some of \nus to use in our daily living.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter all, even an original autograph would require the \ninterpretation of.the Holy Spirit to make it come alive as God's Word \nin my life. Indeed, the Holy Spirit is the agent of the infallible, \nredeeming truth, which permeates my thought, mind, and hard heart. \nThank you, God, for my Bible and for the Holy Spirit who makes it the \nliving Word within me.\u0014\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n                                                             WHY I \nWROTE \"MY BIBLE IS TRUE\"\u0014\n\n                                                                                 \nDuke McColl\u0014\n\u0014\nThe \"My Bible is True\" column (see page 6) was written in 1975 both \nto answer the new SBC \"Fundamentalists\" and to illustrate how I \nthought they could be beaten. To win the majority of Southern \nBaptists, I thought the only useful answer was to say, \"I believe the \nBible more than our critics.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe goal was to do that truthfully and without abandoning scholarly \ntools and study metrology. Further, there are studies which indicate \nthat 65% of our population can not handle abstract ideas. This is not \nmeant as a criticism or \"put down.\" It is a description like saying \n\"many people have brown eyes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, any scholarly discussion of the inspiration of Holy \nScripture almost immediately becomes abstract. That means you are \nmaking no sense to 65% of the people if that analysis of our \npopulation is accurate. So I tried to simplify my position accurately \nin terms that the 65% could accept.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy friend and opponent W .A. Criswell knew that the \"inerrant Bible\" \nwas a false issue and tried to say so, according to reports of a \nspeech he made in Birmingham, Ala. He believed that the ending of \nMark's gospel is a late addition that should be dropped. I have \nargued with him that as allergic as I am to snake handling, I accept \nall of Mark 16 as the record given us by the Holy Spirit working \nthrough holy men.\u0014\n\u0014\nW.O. Carver was right. THE BIBLE is bigger than \"my Bible\" The Holy \nSpirit is still seeking to guide us into the truth where all that God \nwants to reveal to us takes over our minds and hearts and habits.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus could say, \"They have said to you of old, but I say to you...\" \nRecently some Baptists have made their version of Holy Scripture more \nauthoritative than our individual relations with Jesus. I acknowledge \nthat the \"priesthood of believers\" will permit diversity among \nChristians, but diversity in creation makes me think that God may \nlike diversity, or just permit it if you prefer. I see Christian (and \nBaptist) unity in our relations to Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. \n(john 17:22-23)\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian unity is not in a creed or confession of faith written by \nwell intentioned smart men. The Roman Catholic Church, led by an \n\"infallible\" Pope, has not produced unity or agreement through \ncreeds. It has demonstrated the path human nature will take when \ngodly men try to improve on God's plan for His people. Long ago I \nobserved that it took 1 ,875 years for the Catholic Church to develop \nan \"infallible Pope.\" On the same path Baptists will not take so long.\u0014",

According to the ABC report, the real reason \nfor the war was that the administration \"wanted to make a statement.\" \nAnd why Iraq? \"Officials acknowledge that Saddam had all the \nrequirements to make him, from their standpoint, the perfect target.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA British newspaper, The Independent, reports that \"intelligence \nagencies on both sides of the Atlantic were furious that briefings \nthey gave political leaders were distorted in the rush to war.\" One \n\"high-level source\" told the paper that \"they ignored intelligence \nassessments which said Iraq was not a threat.\"\u0014\nSure enough, we have yet to find any weapons of mass destruction. \nIt's hard to believe that we won't eventually find some poison gas or \ncrude biological weapons. But those aren't true W.M.D.'s, the sort of \nweapons that can make a small, poor country a threat to the greatest \npower the world has ever known. Remember that President Bush made his \ncase for war by warning of a \"mushroom cloud.\" Clearly, Iraq didn't \nhave anything like that  and Mr. Bush must have known that it didn't.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it matter that we were misled into war? Some people say that it \ndoesn't: we won, and the Iraqi people have been freed. But we ought \nto ask some hard questions  not just about Iraq, but about \nourselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, why is our compassion so selective? In 2001 the World Health \nOrganization  the same organization we now count on to protect us \nfrom SARS  called for a program to fight infectious diseases in poor \ncountries, arguing that it would save the lives of millions of people \nevery year. The U.S. share of the expenses would have been about $10 \nbillion per year  a small fraction of what we will spend on war and \noccupation. Yet the Bush administration contemptuously dismissed the \nproposal.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr consider one of America's first major postwar acts of diplomacy: \nblocking a plan to send U.N. peacekeepers to Ivory Coast (a former \nFrench colony) to enforce a truce in a vicious civil war. The U.S. \ncomplains that it will cost too much. And that must be true  we \nwouldn't let innocent people die just to spite the French, would we?\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it seems that our deep concern for the Iraqi people doesn't extend \nto suffering people elsewhere. I guess it's just a matter of \nemphasis. A cynic might point out, however, that saving lives \npeacefully doesn't offer any occasion to stage a victory parade.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, aren't the leaders of a democratic nation supposed to tell \ntheir citizens the truth?\u0014\nOne wonders whether most of the public will ever learn that the \noriginal case for war has turned out to be false. In fact, my guess \nis that most Americans believe that we have found W.M.D.'s. Each \npotential find gets blaring coverage on TV; how many people catch the \nlater announcement  if it is ever announced  that it was a false \nalarm? It's a pattern of misinformation that recapitulates the way \nthe war was sold in the first place. Each administration charge \nagainst Iraq received prominent coverage; the subsequent debunking \ndid not. \u0014\n\u0014\nDid the news media feel that it was unpatriotic to question the \nadministration's credibility? Some strange things certainly happened. \nFor example, in September Mr. Bush cited an International Atomic \nEnergy Agency report that he said showed that Saddam was only months \nfrom having nuclear weapons. \"I don't know what more evidence we \nneed,\" he said. In fact, the report said no such thing  and for a \nfew hours the lead story on MSNBC's Web site bore the headline \"White \nHouse: Bush Misstated Report on Iraq.\" Then the story vanished  not \njust from the top of the page, but from the site. \u0014\nThanks to this pattern of loud assertions and muted or suppressed \nretractions, the American public probably believes that we went to \nwar to avert an immediate threat  just as it believes that Saddam \nhad something to do with Sept. 11. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow it's true that the war removed an evil tyrant. But a democracy's \ndecisions, right or wrong, are supposed to take place with the \ninformed consent of its citizens. That didn't happen this time. And \nwe are a democracy  aren't we? \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company\u0014",

    "title": "MUTATING VIRUS: HATRED OF JEWS",
    "words": "May 17, 2003  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMutating Virus: Hatred of Jews\u0014\nBy EDWARD ROTHSTEIN\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a conference on anti-Semitism at the Center for Jewish History \nearlier this week one panelist told a classic Jewish joke:\u0014\n \u0014\nAfter a Jewish man is rejected for a job as a radio announcer, the \nstory goes, an acquaintance asks him why he was passed over. \n\"Simple,\" the man replies with an agonized stutter, \n\"Anti-S-S-S-S-Semitism.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat joke, of course, mocks the very idea of anti-Semitism, just as \nit mocks excessive Jewish sensitivity toward its slights. But the \njoke is also a declaration of assimilationist confidence. There are \nbigger problems than one's identity, and there are plentiful \nopportunities despite it. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet far from mocking the idea of anti-Semitism, the conference, \norganized by Leon Wieseltier and Martin Peretz of the New Republic \nand Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, found the old virus \nfreshly seeping through Western culture, taking new pathways, seeking \nnew hosts and posing new threats. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe four-day conference, which was sponsored by the YIVO Institute \nfor Jewish Research, included an impressive international roster of \nhistorians and social scientists, scholars of anti-Semitism, \njournalists and leaders of Jewish organizations. The theme of \nresurgent anti-Semitism also inspired another conference this week, \nin Paris, organized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Unesco. And \nlast month a one-day symposium on the same subject was held at the \nAnne Frank House in Amsterdam. This confluence of rising concerns is \nalso evident in such recent histories as \"The Anti-Semitic Moment: A \nTour of France in 1898\" by Pierre Birnbaum (Hill & Wang) and in the \nforthcoming \"The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We \nMust Do About It\" (Jossey-Bass) by Phyllis Chesler. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe anxieties are not groundless. In France during the last two \nyears, hundreds of anti-Semitic incidents have included synagogue \nburnings and physical assaults. At the YIVO conference, the Polish \nwriter Konstanty Gebert, who wears a skullcap, said he had just \nendured more insults during a few months in Paris than he had during \nyears of living in Poland. The historian Simon Schama told of his \nfamily's graves being desecrated along with hundreds of others in a \nJewish cemetery in England two weeks ago. The most egregious examples \nstill come from the Arab world, where Der Strmer-style cartoons are \ncommonplace and the medieval blood libel flourishes. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the incidents in Western Europe can be traced to young men in \ngrowing Muslim communities who have made targets of Jews. But these \nattacks and the responses to them have influenced the broader \nevolution of anti-Semitism. For some time the French government, at \nleast, resisted treating them as anti-Semitic acts. In some cases \nthey have also been justified or explained as reactions against Ariel \nSharon's policies in Israel or President Bush's war on terror. Since \nsuch condemnations are also made on the European left, a sympathy \ndeveloped. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis helped aggravate a form of intellectual anti-Semitism associated \nwith harsh criticism of Israel. Of course, criticism of Israel need \nnot be anti-Semitic, and accusations of anti-Semitism become devalued \nwhen they are used to describe all criticisms of Israel. But \ncriticism is anti-Semitic when it demonizes Zionism, equates it with \nNazism or justifies organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah that have \npledged themselves to the destruction of Israel. And the Nazi analogy \nis so avidly applied to Israel that it seems to offer a form of \nrelief and absolution to the accuser while condemning the state to \nthe lowest rung of hell. Soon enough, the indictment expands to \nencompass other Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this transformation of anti-Semitism old myths and notions of the \npariah people often reappear in new guises. Thus the idea that Jews \ndevour the blood of Gentiles for ritual purposes was reincarnated in \na political cartoon in The Independent of London this January, which \nspurred a protest from the Israeli government. It showed a Goya-esque \nethnic monstrosity of an Ariel Sharon, gobbling the head of a \nPalestinian child as Israeli helicopters dropped bombs in the \nbackground. \"What's wrong?\" Sharon growls. \"You never seen a \npolitician kissing babies before?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut why have newer forms of intellectual anti-Semitism become so \nfamiliar in Europe? Why have they thrived even when traditional \nanti-Semitism is forthrightly condemned? \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the YIVO conference, Mark Lilla, who teaches European intellectual \nhistory at the University of Chicago, argued that in the past \noutbursts of anti-Semitism had often been associated with political \ncrises: with the conflict between church and state in the Middle \nAges, with the Enlightenment in the 18th century, with the rise of \ntotalitarianism in the 20th. Now, he continued, another \ntransformation is taking place. Throughout Europe a rebellion is \nunder way against the very idea of the nation-state and its \nsovereignty. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn European consciousness the nation-state is associated with the \nevil forces of nationalism, xenophobia and fascism. After the Second \nWorld War, Mr. Lilla argued, Europe was able to avoid thinking about \nsovereignty altogether; the United States and NATO picked up the \nburden. As a consequence, Mr. Lilla said, the \"idea of Europe\" has \nreceived an \"uncritical embrace,\" while nongovernmental organizations \nare regularly appealed to as political ideals. In the midst of this, \nIsrael is an anomaly, a nation-state of recent vintage, insisting on \nits status, strength and sovereignty, violating the spoken pieties of \ncontemporary international life. This may be one reason that at the \nUnited Nations Israel has been treated as a pariah, unable even to \nserve on the Human Rights Commission (whose chair is Libya) or \nsubject to resolutions that affirm the legitimacy of armed struggle \nagainst it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Lilla is extending recent arguments made by Robert Kagan about \nthe differences between America and Europe. Indeed, both \nanti-Americanism and anti-Zionism oppose modern nation-states that \ninsist on older ideas of power. Even when Europe addresses issues of \nsovereignty  in affirmations of inviolable borders or in arguments \nfor a Palestinian state  they are rarely examined seriously, Mr. \nLilla said: \"Even sympathy for Palestinians has an oddly apolitical \nquality in Europe.\" Proposed solutions are little more sophisticated \nthan imagining, as Mr. Lilla put it, \"Hans Blix zipping around \nPalestine in his little truck.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut this is not just a matter of political ideology. Alain \nFinkielkraut, the French intellectual, suggested that in the wake of \nthe Second World War Europe was haunted by a \"never again\": \"Never \nagain, power politics. Never again, nationalism. Never again, \nAuschwitz.\" While America could forthrightly celebrate itself, for \nEurope remembrance opened \"an abyss.\" So Europe imagined a new world, \n\"a world so humane, so unprejudiced, so open-minded\" that the very \nidea of an enemy is not taken seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, in the midst of this idealistic dream, the Jews intrude. \nOnly this time they \"are not accused of clinging stubbornly to their \nJewishness but of betraying it.\" Israel's nationalism, its military \nand its particularism offend Europe's left-wing universalism and \nanti-globalization sympathies and recall the catastrophic past. Any \nwhiff of right-wing anti-Semitism is still treated as inexcusable. \nBut these new condemnations are considered virtuous, even though, Mr. \nFinkielkraut speculates, they invoke the oldest traditions of \nanti-Semitism: \"Seeing the Jews as a people so intoxicated with its \nown chosenness that it refuses the idea of universal humanity.\" In \nthat refusal the Jew, in this caricature, really is the archetypal \nracist, the enemy  the Nazi. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile once the Jew was attacked for an association with modernity and \ninternationalism, now the Jew is attacked for a dissent from \npost-modernity and internationalism. Paradoxically, these attacks \noverlap the more traditional anti-Semitism of Islamic radicals and \nPalestinian nationalists who distrust liberal modernity, chanting \n\"Death to the Jews\" and spinning out their own imaginings of Nazism. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut despite all this, there are also signs of positive change in the \nwake of recent events. It was only during the last year, under \nAmerican pressure for reform, that the concrete characteristics of \nPalestinian governance were examined more seriously. And last month \nYigal Carmon, whose Middle East Media Research Institute has \nregularly been translating material from the Arab world related to \nconflicts with the United States and Israel, argued that there were \nnow significant \"harbingers of change in the anti-Semitic discourse \nin the Arab world\" (www.memri.org), with increasing dissent from \nexpressions of extreme anti-Semitism.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeday, perhaps, the old Jewish joke about the stuttering \nbroadcaster might even take on a different form, signaling that \nanti-Semitism has again become eligible for jest.\u0014",

    "words": "More Americans in Poverty in 2002, Census Study Says\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LYNETTE CLEMETSON\u0014\n\u0014\n       ASHINGTON, Sept. 26, 2003  The number of Americans living in \npoverty increased by 1.7 million last year, and the median household \nincome declined by 1.1 percent, the Census Bureau reported today. The \nworsening economic conditions fell heaviest on Midwesterners and \nnonwhites. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was the second straight year of adverse changes in both poverty \nand income, the first two-year downturn since the early 1990's.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe data, results of the Census Bureau's annual Current Population \nSurvey, the official barometer for measuring income and poverty \nrates, showed that lingering negative effects of the recent recession \ncut across a broad swath of the population.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe official poverty rate rose to 12.1 percent in 2002 from 11.7 \npercent the year before, bringing to total number of people living \nbelow the poverty line to 34.6 million. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe median household earned income fell $500 over the same period to \n$42,400. Per capita income declined by 1.8 in 2002 to $22,794, the \nfirst decline since 1991. \u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel H. Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau's Housing and \nHousehold Economic Statistics Division, said the findings were \nconsistent with the bureau's expectations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you look at the historical timeline trend, there is a lag with \npoverty rates,\" Mr. Weinberg said. \"Low points in poverty and income \nseem to come the year after a recession ends.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe most recent recession lasted from March 2001 through November \n2001, though job losses have continued at high rates this year. \u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about the census data, Scott McClellan, the White House \nspokesman, said, \"The actions that we've taken to boost the economy \nand to create jobs are essential to turn this around.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt his daily press briefing, Mr. McClellan, rather than focusing on \nthe census data, pointed instead to newly released figures from the \nCommerce Department that showed a larger-than-expected rise in the \ngross domestic product.\u0014\n\u0014\nA 3.3 percent increase in G.D.P. in the second quarter of this year, \nMr. McClellan suggested, indicates that the economy is moving in a \npositive direction. \u0014\n\u0014\nGross domestic product is considered a leading economic indicator, \nwhile poverty is seen as a lagging indicator.\u0014\n\u0014\nWithin hours of the morning release of the data, Democrats seized on \nthe figures to criticize Bush administration policies in a flurry of \nfaxed press releases, e-mailed statements and news conferences. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is sad news that the Bush administration is trying to sweep \nunder the rug,\" said Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a \nDemocratic presidential candidate.\u0014\n\"I'd like to hear President Bush explain to all the single mothers \nwith kids living in poverty how his tax breaks for the rich are \nhelping them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGen. Wesley K. Clark, the newest Democratic candidate, said of Mr. \nBush, \"With a record like this he shouldn't be running for president, \nhe should be running for the hills.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn general, poverty rates over the last two years have not been as \nsevere as in the aftermath of past recessions, a point several \nconservative analysts pointed out.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"As recessions go this is extremely good news,\" said Robert E. \nRector, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. \"This \nshows that this has been a shallow recession that has been mild in \nits impact, and it also shows the positive impact of welfare reform \nwhich has kept more women in the work force.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Midwest was the only area of the country to have a significant \nincrease in poverty rates, rising to 10.3 percent from 9.4 percent a \nyear earlier. Real median income declined 2 percent in the region, \nwith drops in important battleground states in next year's \npresidential election, including Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and\u0014\nOhio.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong racial groups African-Americans suffered the worst increases in \npoverty, after several years of economic progress in the 1990's. The \npoverty rate among blacks rose to 24.1 percent from 22.7 percent a \nyear earlier. Median income for blacks fell 3 percent. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther racial and ethnic groups also saw significant decreases in \nmedian income, which declined 4.5 percent for Asians, Native \nHawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 2.9 percent for Hispanics, a \ngroup that Mr. Bush has been courting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd though rates of poverty did not change significantly from 2001 \nfor those under age 18 and over age 65, staying afloat was harder \nlast year for people aged 18 to 64, the bulk of the work force. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe poverty threshold for a family of four is $18,392. For \nindividuals the amount is $9,183. The percentage of people in severe \npoverty, those with incomes below half of the poverty threshold, \nincreased to 14.1 million from 13.4 million. \u0014\n\u0014\nLiberal economists took the position that any increase in poverty was \ntoo high, given the relative prosperity of the country. Many also \ncriticized policy shifts, which they said reduced the social safety \nnet for the poor, like reductions in child care assistance and \nreduced unemployment insurance benefits.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We would all expect poverty go up some in an economic downturn,\" \nsaid Robert Greenstein, executive director for the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. \"But misplaced \npriorities by Congress and the president are making the increase in \npoverty larger than it needs to be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs controversial as the data was the timing of its release. Typically \nthe results of the annual survey have been released on a Tuesday in \nlate September at the National Press Club in downtown Washington. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis year the bureau scheduled the release for a Friday, the first \ntime it has done so, and moved the news conference from the centrally \nlocated press club to the bureau's suburban headquarters in Suitland, \nMd. The switch prompted some advocates and lawmakers to speculate \nthat the government agency had been pressured by the administration \nto move the date and place so that that the results, which most \npeople expected to be worse than they were last year, would generate \nless attention in the weekend news cycle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effect of the move meant that the figures on poverty and income \nwere released on the same day as the data on G.D.P., data that many \neconomists expected to be more positive.\u0014\n\u0014\nCensus officials maintained that the delayed release had to do with \nnothing more than a work backlog.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We were running into technical problems getting it all done; we were \nrunning behind,\" Mr. Weinberg said. \"So we decided, hey, how about \nsome more time.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                            Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company \n|\u0014",

Rumor ran rampant: \nA wild-eyed foreign anarchist with an unpronounceable name had killed \nthe\u0014\n                     Commander-in-Chief. Eric Rauchway's brilliant \nMurdering McKinley re-creates Leon Czolgosz's hastily conducted trial \nand then\u0014\n                     traverses America as Dr. Vernon Briggs, a Boston \nalienist, sets out to discover why Czolgosz rose up to kill his \nPresident. While\u0014\n                     uncovering the answer that eluded Briggs and \nsetting the historical record straight about Czolgosz, Rauchway also \nprovides the finest\u0014\n                     portrait yet of Theodore Roosevelt at the moment \nof his sudden ascension to the White House.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     For Czolgosz was neither a foreigner nor much of \nan anarchist. Born in Detroit, he was an American-made assassin of \nsuch inchoate\u0014\n                     political beliefs that Emma Goldman dismissed \nhim as a police informant. Indeed, Brigg's search for answers---in \nthe records of the\u0014\n                     Auburn New York State penitentiary where \nCzolgosz was electrocuted, in Cleveland where Leon's remaining family \nlived---only\u0014\n                     increased the mystery. Roosevelt, however, cared \nmost for the meanings he could fix to this \"crime against free \ngovernment all over the\u0014\n                     world.\" For Roosevelt was every inch the \ncalculating politician, his supposed boyish impulsiveness more feint \nthan fact. At one moment\u0014\n                     encouraging the belief that Czolgosz's was a \npolitical crime, at the next that it was a deranged one, Roosevelt \nused the specter of\u0014\n                     McKinley's death to usher in Progressive Era \nAmerica.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     So why did Czolgosz do it? Only Rauchway's \ncareful sifting of long-ignored evidence provides an answer: \nheart-broken, recently\u0014\n                     radicalized, and thinking he had only months to \nlive, Leon decided to take the most powerful man in America with hi\u0014",

And he shows how these \nsquads were\u0014\n                     utilized as the Nazis made two separate plans \nfor dealing with the civilian populations they wanted to destroy. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     The first plan, initiated in July 1941, \ncondemned the Jews of eastern Europe to slaughter by the \nEinsatzgruppen, who went on to execute\u0014\n                     1.5 million men, women and children between 1941 \nand 1943 by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar--massive \ncrimes that have\u0014\n                     been underestimated or overlooked by Holocaust \nhistorians. Rhodes documents the organizing and carrying out of this \nprogram and\u0014\n                     introduces the professional men--economists, \narchitects, lawyers--who were the programs commanders and officers, \nas well as the\u0014\n                     \"ordinary men\" who did most of the actual \nkilling.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The second plan, initiated in December 1941, was \ndirected at the Jews of western Europe. By then, Rhodes shows, the \nface-to-face\u0014\n                     killing of hundreds of thousands had so \nbrutalized the SS that even Himmler was shocked into ordering the \ndevelopment of a less\u0014\n                     \"personal\" means of murder--the notorious gas \nchambers and crematoria of the Holocausts second wave. Rhodes shows, \nfurther, that\u0014\n                     Hitler and Himmler intended the Jews to be only \ntheir first victims; their plan was to open up Russia to German \ncolonization by destroying\u0014\n                     more than 30 million Slavs and members of other \nethnic groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Drawing on Nuremberg Tribunal documents largely \nignored until now, and on newly available material from eyewitnesses \nand survivors,\u0014\n                     Richard Rhodes has given us a book that is \nessential reading on the Holocaust and World War II.\u0014",

We're still hoping \nwe'll open a sleepy eye and think, 'What a horrible dream.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But we won't, will we, Father? What we saw was not a dream. Planes \ndid gouge towers. Flames did consume our fortress. People did perish. \nIt was no dream; and, dear Father, we are sad.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a ballet dancer who will no longer dance and a doctor who \nwill no longer heal. A church has lost its priest, a classroom is \nminus a teacher. Cora ran a food pantry. Paige was a counselor; and \nDana, dearest Father, Dana was only 3 years old. (Who held her in \nthose final moments?)\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are sad, Father. For as the innocent are buried; our innocence is \nburied, as well. We thought we were safe. Perhaps we should have \nknown better,but we didn't.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So we come to You. We don't ask You for help; we beg You for it. We \ndon't request it; we implore it. We know what You can do. We've read \nthe accounts. We've pondered the stories; and now we plead, 'Do it \nagain, Lord. Do it again.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Remember Joseph? You rescued him from the pit. You can do the same \nfor us. Do it again, Lord. Remember the Hebrews in Egypt? You \nprotected their children from the angel of death. We have children, \ntoo, Lord. Do it again.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And Sarah? Remember her prayers? You heard them. Joshua? Remember \nhis fears? You inspired him. The women at the tomb? You resurrected \ntheir hope. The doubts of Thomas? You took them away. Do it again, \nLord. Do it again.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You changed Daniel from a captive into a king's counselor. You took \nPeter the fisherman and made him Peter an apostle. Because of you, \nDavid went from leading sheep to leading armies. Do it again, Lord, \nfor we need counselors today, Lord. We need apostles. We need \nleaders. Do it again, dear Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Most of all, do again what you did at Calvary. What we saw here on \nthat Tuesday, You saw there on that Friday. Innocence slaughtered. \nGoodness murdered. Mothers weeping. Evil dancing. Just as the ash \nfell on our children, the darkness fell on your Son. Just as our \ntowers were shattered, the very Tower of Eternity was pierced. By \ndusk, heaven's sweetest song was silent, buried behind a rock.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But You did not waver, O Lord. You did not waver. After three days \nin a dark hole, You rolled the rock and rumbled the earth and turned \nthe darkest Friday into the brightest Sunday. Do it again, Lord. \nGrant us a September Easter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We thank You, dear Father, for these hours of unity. Disaster has \ndone what discussion could not. Doctrinal fences have fallen. \nRepublicans are standing with Democrats. Skin colors have been \ncovered by the ash of burning buildings. We thank You for these hours \nof unity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We thank You for these hours of prayer. The enemy sought to bring us \nto our knees and succeeded. He had no idea, however, that we would \nkneel before You;and he has no idea what You can do.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let Your mercy be upon our president, vice president, and their \nfamilies. Grant to those who lead us wisdom beyond their years and \nexperience. Have mercy upon the souls who have departed and the \nwounded who remain. Give us grace that we might forgive and faith \nthat we might believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"And look kindly upon your church. For 2,000 years You've used it to \nheal a hurting world. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Through Christ, Amen.\"\u0014",

Two were hijacked jets. The third was a .40-caliber \npistol on a dark corner of Brooklyn, with just 18 minutes remaining \nin that day. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo be the last man killed on Sept. 11 is to be hopelessly anonymous, \nquietly mourned by a few while, year after year, the rest of the city \nlooks toward Lower Manhattan. No one reads his name into a microphone \nat a ceremony. No memorial marks the sidewalk where he fell with a \nbullet in his lung. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe case of the \\last man killed that day remains unsolved. Had he \nbeen shot a day before, the police might have arrested someone, but \nthe sad truth is that the police response to the 911 call at 11:42 \nthat night was diminished by the need for officers at key city sites \nand at the place fast becoming known as ground zero. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe wasn't afforded the initial experts in processing the homicide \nscene, said Detective Michael Prate, on whose desk the cold-case \nfile rests. It was old school. If it wasn't 9/11, you would have had \neight or nine detectives out here canvassing the scene. That night, \nyou might have had two or three. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis name was Henryk Siwiak. He was an immigrant, and in the middle of \na city staggering with loss on that night, he was looking forward to \nstarting something new. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Siwiak, 46, had been living in New York about 11 months since \nmoving here from Poland to find work and send money home to his wife \nof 20 years, Ewa, and their two children, Gabriela, 18, and Adam, 11. \nHis job in Poland as a railroad man had dried up, and now he was \nliving near his sister, Lucyna Siwiak, in the Rockaways. On Sept. 11, \nhe had found a job, mopping floors overnight in a Pathmark \nsupermarket on Albany Avenue in Brooklyn. He was to start that night. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe put on his favorite outfit, a choice that would be scrutinized by \ndetectives later: camouflage pants and a matching coat that he had \nbought from the Salvation Army, and black boots. He carried sneakers \nand another pair of pants in a backpack. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had asked the landlady at his house on Beach 91st Street how to \nget to the store, and they found Albany Avenue on a subway map. Take \nthe A train to Utica, she told him, not realizing that she was \nsending him to 1 Albany Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and not 1525 \nAlbany Avenue, where the store was, more than three miles away in \nFarragut. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe walked up the steps of the subway station sometime after 11 p.m. \nCamouflage or no, he stood out right away. I passed the white guy on \nFulton Street, a witness told detectives later. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe reached the wrong stretch of Albany and turned right, the wrong \nway. The block, at the top of the avenue, was dangerous, Detective \nPrate said, and that night would not have been any different. I \ndon't know if the World Trade Center falling down really affects the \ndrug trade on Albany Avenue, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nNeighbors heard shots. A blood trail showed that Mr. Siwiak, wounded, \ncrossed Decatur Street and went up a stoop to ring a doorbell for \nhelp. \u0014\n\u0014\nI heard the bell ringing, a woman in the building told detectives \nlater, but I wasn't answering it after I heard those shots. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Siwiak went back down the steps and fell on his face and died.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see: Word/My Documents/Mourned Only Quietly By a Few\u0014",

    "title": "MAJESTIC HE WAS--RACING'S GOLDEN BOY",
    "words": "Majestic Prince was based in California and was creating quite a \nbuzz. The Prince, as he became known, was racing's golden boy. As a \nphysical specimen, the red chestnut son of Raise a Native was as \nclose to perfection as any horse in memory. At the 1967 Keeneland \nJuly yearling sale, he sold for a then-world-record $250,000. \nPurchased by Frank McMahon from the Spendthrift Farm consignment, \nMajestic Prince was turned over to former riding legend Johnny \nLongden to train. With the controversial Bill Hartack aboard, The \nPrince would capture his first six starts, all in California, \nincluding runaway scores in the Los Feliz, San Vicente, and San \nJacinto Stakes. He then romped by eight lengths in the Santa Anita \nDerby, but still was dismissed by the experts back East, who felt he \nhad beaten nothing and had run his 1 1/8-miles in the Santa Anita \nDerby in a slow 1:49 1/5. But what they didn't notice was the \nridiculous ease with which he won and the long, graceful strides that \nseemed to propel him off the ground. He was a thing of beauty, \nwhether in action or not.  \u0014\n---\u0014\nThere was another horse who still had something to prove to the \nEastern press corp, and that was Majestic Prince, the Hollywood \ngolden boy who had beaten up on inferior competition in slow times. \nLongden decided to prep The Prince in the seven-furlong Stepping \nStone Purse at Churchill Downs the Saturday before the Derby, where \nhe would get a good test from the speedy Fast Hilarious.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Majestic Prince did was demolish Fast Hilarious by six lengths in \n1:21 3/5, just a fifth off the track record. California's pretty boy \nwas for real.\u0014\n----\u0014\nRacing fans, like those today, wondered if any horse would ever sweep \nthe Triple Crown following the failures of Carry Back ('61), Northern \nDancer ('64), Kauai King ('66), and Forward Pass (who was awarded the \n'68 Derby after the Butazolidin positive and subsequent \ndisqualification of Dancer's Image).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut The Prince was different. This was to be a horse for the ages. \nLongden, however, felt the colt wasn't 100% and was beginning to feel \nthe effects of the rigors of the Triple Crown. Shortly after the \nPreakness, he shocked everyone by announcing that Majestic Prince \nmight not run in the Belmont. The news filled the entire back page of \nthe New York tabloids. McMahon backed his trainer, but the pressure \nto run became too intense and several days before the race he \nannounced The Prince would run, especially after a Sports Illustrated \narticle suggested he was ducking Arts and Letters. Longden was \nincensed that McMahon had overruled him and the two could be heard in \na shouting match at the barn. But the universal thinking was, no \nDerby and Preakness winner skips the Belmont unless he has a serious \ninjury. That's like making it to gates of the pantheon and deciding \nyou've gone far enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nA record Belmont Stakes crowd of 66,115 turned out to see if this \ntime history would be made. But the Belmont turned out to be an oddly \nrun race. The early pace was so slow the late-running Dike went for \nthe lead going into the clubhouse turn, much to the shock of the \ncrowd. Baeza and Arts and Letters were right on his heels, but \nHartack elected to keep Majestic Prince three to four lengths back \nthrough an agonizingly slow three-quarters in 1:16 1/5. When Baeza \ngunned Arts and Letters to the front nearing the final turn, the race \nwas all but over. The colt drew off to win by 5 1/2 lengths, closing \nhis final quarter in :24 2/5, with Majestic Prince finishing second, \nnever to race again. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe had a check ligament going into the Belmont that was just not \nright, Longden said years later. It wasn't real bad, but the horse \nwasn't 100%. I was looking forward to racing him as a 4-year-old and \nI thought it was tough asking him to go a mile and a half when he was \nnot 100%.\u0014\n\u0014\nMajestic Prince, after spending the rest of the year at Longden's \nranch in Arcadia, was retired to stud the following winter as a \nresult of the check ligament. After siring numerous top-class stakes \nwinners, including Belmont Stakes winner Coastal and grade I winners \nMajestic Light, Sensitive Prince, and Eternal Prince, he died of a \nheart attack at Spendthrift Farm in 1981at the young age of 15. In \n1988, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. The vision of him, with \nhis Adonis-like frame, glistening red chestnut coat, and bounding \nstride will never be forgotten. One of the great racing photos ever \ntaken appeared in Sports Illustrated following the Santa Anita Derby. \nIt was a close-up head-on shot of Majestic Prince crossing the finish \nline, with the late afternoon sun illuminating his mane and chin \nwhiskers into a fiery glow. That is the everlasting image of Majestic \nPrince.\u0014\n\u0014\n. Steve Haskins, The Blood Horse  9/20/11\u0014",

    "words": "August 16, 2011\u0014\n\u0014\nMore Unwed Parents Live Together, Report Finds\u0014\n\u0014\nBy SABRINA TAVERNISE\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON  The number of Americans who have children and live \ntogether without marrying has increased twelvefold since 1970, \naccording to a report released Tuesday. The report states that \nchildren now are more likely to have unmarried parents than divorced \nones. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report was published by the National Marriage Project, an \ninitiative at the University of Virginia, and the Institute for \nAmerican Values, two partisan groups that advocate for strengthening \nthe institution of marriage. The report argues that the rise of \ncohabitation is a growing risk for children, and that their lives are \nless stable in such families. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report cites data from the Census Bureau as well as the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, and includes work from 18 \nresearchers who study family issues. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the National Survey of Family Growth, part of the \nCenters for Disease Control, 42 percent of children have lived with \ncohabiting parents by age 12, far more than the 24 percent whose \nparents have divorced. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe numbers also suggest a correlation with class. Americans with \nonly a high school diploma are far more likely to cohabit than are \ncollege graduates, according to the report. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres a two-family model emerging in American life, said W. \nBradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project and an \nassociate professor of sociology at the University of Virginia. The \neducated and affluent enjoy relatively strong, stable families. \nEveryone else is more likely to be consigned to unstable, unworkable \nones. \u0014\n\u0014\nCohabiting parents, Mr. Wilcox said, are more than twice as likely to \nbreak up as parents who are married. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe increase in unmarried couples cohabitating and having children \nswept poor communities beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Wilcox said, \nciting data from the National Survey of Family Growth, and now has \nmoved into working class and lower-middle-class families. \u0014\n\u0014\nOut-of-wedlock births among white women with a high school diploma \nrose more than sixfold in recent decades, the report said, jumping to \n34 percent in the late 2000s, from 5 percent in 1982. In contrast, \nthe rate for white college graduates stayed flat at about 2 percent. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile births to white women in cohabiting relationships rose by about \ntwo-thirds from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, the proportion \njumped by about half for black women and nearly doubled for Hispanic \nwomen, though that increase was affected by a large influx of \nimmigrants, said Sheela Kennedy, a research associate at the \nMinnesota Population Center, which conducts demographic studies and \nwhose work was cited in the new report. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres growing evidence that families that would be unstable anyway \nare just skipping marriage, Ms. Kennedy said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report cited studies in the Journal of Marriage and Family , and \nin Sociology of Education, asserting that children in cohabiting \nfamilies tend to perform worse in school and be less psychologically \nhealthy than those whose parents are married. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt also cited a 2010 report on child abuse by the federal Department \nof Health and Human Services that found that children living with two \nmarried biological parents had the lowest rates of harm  6.8 per \n1,000 children  while children living with one parent who had an \nunmarried partner in the house had the highest incidence, at 57.2 per \n1,000 children.\u0014",

    "title": "MINISTRY SEEKS TO MAKE MARRIAGES DIVORCE PROOF",
    "words": "Bob Allen, Associated Baptist Press\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBETHESDA, Md. (ABP) -- America's divorce rate is the highest in the \nworld, double that of Canada and triple either England or France, but \nmost divorces don't need to happen, marriage specialists Mike and \nHarriet McManus insist. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarried since 1965, the McManuses are co-founders of \\Marriage \nSavers, a ministry to help churches and communities make marriages \nthat are divorce proof.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcManus, a syndicated newspaper columnist who was Time Magazine's \nyoungest correspondent in 1963, was out of a job in their 10th year \nof marriage and could find only temporary work in Washington, D.C. \nThey lived in Connecticut, so he became a long-distance commuter, \ngetting on a train at 2 a.m. on Monday, working all week and coming \nhome for dinner at 11 p.m. Friday.\u0014\n\u0014\nA friend told him about \\Marriage Encounter, a religious-based \nweekend program designed to help couples improve their marriage. \nMcManus protested he already had a good marriage, but his friend said \nthe experience would make it better.\u0014\nAfter some hesitation, the McManuses went to a retreat where four \ncouples talked about intimate details of struggles within their own \nmarriage. After each talk, the couples were told to write a love \nletter to their spouse to be exchanged and discussed in private. In \nresponse to one question about what the spouse could not or did not \nshare, McManus was shocked to learn his wife felt bruised and \ndeserted by his work in Washington and thought that he loved his job \nmore than her.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a turning point for the couple. They began a marriage ministry \nin their home church, \\Fourth Presbyterian Church of Bethesda, Md., \nin 1992. They pioneered the training of couples with healthy \nmarriages to mentor younger couples.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1986, McManus gave a speech to local pastors in Modesto, Calif., \nin which he suggested how the city could cut its divorce rate in \nhalf. Modesto became the first of more than 200 cities across the \nUnited States to adopt a Community Marriage Policy, an agreement \nacross denominational lines to make marriage such a priority in their \nchurches that divorce rates would fall.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage Savers claims divorce rates in those cities have fallen by \nan average of 17.5 percent and cohabitation by a third.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ministry also establishes Marriage Savers Congregations, in which \nmentor couples are trained to help other couples prepare for lifelong \nmarriages, strengthen existing ones and restore troubled marriages. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe strategy can virtually eliminate divorces in the local \ncongregation, the McManuses claim.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe McManuses conduct marriage enrichment weekends at local churches. \nThey also train back from the brink couples who once considered \ndivorce to create a Restoration Marriage Ministry where they help \nother couples in crisis restore their relationship.\u0014\nThere has been one divorce for every two marriages since the 1970s, \nand McManus said churches are part of the problem. About 80 percent \nof marriages are performed by clergy, but divorce rates in the church \nare just as high as the rest of society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Community Marriage Policy seeks to crack down on quickie \nmarriages, requiring any couple getting married to experience a \nrigorous four months of preparation that includes taking a premarital \ninventory of strengths and areas where they need to grow. Answers are \nsent to the mentor couple, which meets with the prospective newlyweds \nto discuss relationship issues and teach skills of communication and \nresolving conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the McManuses' church, 20 percent of couples decided during the \nrigorous process not to marry. Of the 230 who did marry, there were \n16 divorces in 18 years, a 93 percent success rate that Marriage \nSavers touts as virtual marriage insurance.\u0014\n\u0014\nGetting clergy to buy in community-wide prevents couples turned away \nby one minister from shopping around until they find a church that \nwill perform their wedding.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcManus, a conservative columnist who has written Ethics & Religion \nsince 1981, recently went after no-fault divorce laws that swept \nthe nation starting with the 1970s. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore no-fault divorce, a married person had to prove grounds for a \ndivorce, such as adultery or physical abuse. If both partners wanted \nto get out of the marriage, they usually succeeded by claiming \nirreconcilable differences.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder no-fault divorce, however, a single spouse unilaterally can \nterminate a marriage entered mutually by both partners, even though \ndivorce is opposed by the other spouse in four out of five marriages. \nMcManus said other state laws also discourage marriage and encourage \ncohabitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2005, McManus sparked controversy when USA Today identified him as \none of three newspaper columnists to receive funds from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services for work in support of \nPresident George W. Bush's effort to promote marriage.\u0014\nThe newspaper said Marriage Savers received $49,000 from a group that \nreceived HHS money to promote marriage to unwed couples who are \nhaving children, while McManus boosted the Bush marriage initiative \nin several columns.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcManus insisted receiving the money did not influence the opinions \nwritten in his columns. He later apologized, saying in retrospect he \nrecognized there was a conflict of interest and he should have \ndisclosed that his nonprofit ministry had received a consulting fee \nfrom the administration.\u0014",

    "words": "Jerzy Bielecki Dies at 90; Fell in Love in a Nazi Camp\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DENNIS HEVESI  New York Times 10/23/11\u0014\n\u0014\nJerzy Bielecki was 19 years old, Roman Catholic and suspected of \nbeing a member of the Polish resistance when he was arrested by the \nNazis in June 1940 and transported to Auschwitz, where the number 243 \nwas tattooed on his arm. \u0014\n\u0014\nNearly three years later, Cyla Cybulska, her parents, her two \nbrothers and her younger sister were crammed into a train with \nthousands of other Polish Jews and shipped to Auschwitz. Only Cyla  \nNo. 29558  would survive. Because of Mr. Bielecki. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheirs was a tale of love and courage that would continue to resonate \ndespite the nearly 40 years during which they were separated, both \nbelieving the other had died. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor his daring rescue of that one Jewish woman, Mr. Bielecki was \nrecognized in 1985 as one of the so-called righteous gentiles by Yad \nVashem, Israels center for Holocaust research and education. He died \nThursday at 90 in Nowy Targ, Poland, said Stanlee Stahl, executive \nvice president of the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, which \nassists non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bielecki  known as Jurek  was in forced labor in a grain \nwarehouse at the concentration camp when several young women were \nherded through the door in the fall of 1943. It seemed to me that \none of them, a pretty dark-haired one, winked at me, he told The \nAssociated Press last year. It was Cyla, who had just been assigned \nto repair grain sacks. \u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next eight months, although able to exchange only a few \nfurtive words each day, they fell in love. Mr. Bielecki began \nplanning their escape. Aided by a fellow inmate working in a uniform \nwarehouse, he began piecing together an SS guards uniform. He \nobtained a stolen pass and a forged document authorizing the \npurported guard to take a prisoner to work at a nearby farm. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 21, 1944, Mr. Bielecki led Ms. Cybulska out of her barrack \nand onto a long path leading to a side gate where a sleepy guard \nsaid, Ja  yes  and let them pass. Hiding in the fields during the \nday, they walked for 10 nights until they reached the home of one of \nMr. Bieleckis relatives. Though much in love, Mr. Bielecki decided \nthat he had to join the Polish underground. He found a hiding place \nfor Ms. Cybulska with a Polish family. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey would not see each other again for 39 years. Through a variety \nof misunderstandings each thought the other died, Ms. Stahl said. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Cybulska would immigrate to the United States, marry another \nHolocaust survivor, David Zacharowicz, and eventually open a jewelry \nbusiness in Brooklyn. In Poland, Mr. Bielecki started a family of his \nown and worked as the director of a school for car mechanics. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was pure chance that in 1983 they would find each other again. By \nthen, David Zacharowicz had died. Cyla was at home talking to the \nPolish woman who cleaned for her, telling how this man had saved her \nand that she had been told he had died, Ms. Stahl said. The \ncleaning lady said: I dont think hes dead. I saw a man telling the \nstory on Polish television. Hes alive.  \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Zacharowicz tracked down Mr. Bieleckis phone number in Nowy Targ \none morning in May 1983 and several weeks later flew to Krakow to \nmeet him. When she stepped off the plane, he handed her 39 red roses, \none for each of the years they had not seen each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe and Cyla saw each other about another 15 times, Mr. Stahl said. \nThey were good friends for life. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Bielecki was born in Slaboszow, Poland, on March 28, 1921. Ms. \nStahl said she did not have information about his survivors. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last year, Mr. Bielecki \nsaid he was very much in love with Cyla, adding: Sometimes I cried \nafter the war, that she was not with me. Fate decided for us, but I \nwould do the same again. \u0014\n\u0014\nCyla and David Zacharowicz had one child, Fay Roseman of Coral \nSprings, Fla. My mother died in 2005. I have two children, Ms. \nRoseman said Friday. Without him, there wouldnt be this family.\u0014",

    "title": "MARY, THE MOTHER OF JESUS",
    "words": "MARY THE MOTHER OF JESUS.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo woman in all history has been so highly  honored as the Mother of \nJesus, nor has any one been so misunderstood. The Roman Catholics  \n(the masses, at any rate) have practically worshiped her, and often \nMary stands in the place of Christ with those~who pray to her and ask \nher intercession. As a reaction against this almost  idolatrous \nattitude towards Mary and the paintings and statues of her, most \nProtestants neglect her entirely. In my book, The Mother of Jesus:  \nHer Problems and Her Glory, the effort is made  to do justice to her \nand to try to understand her attitude toward the great part that she \nhad to\u0014\nplay in the coming of the Messiah. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuke gives us the annunciation by the angel Gabriel and  how she gave \nherself to the will of God (Lk. 1:26-38). The supernatural aspect of \nthe Virgin Birth of Jesus is told by Luke, the Greek physician, from \nMary's standpoint and by Matthew from Joseph's point of view (Mat. \n1:16, 18-25).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary sought sympathy with Elizabeth and found  it, and gave \nexpression to her own ecstasy in the wonderful Magnificat (Lk. \n1:39-56). The conduct of Joseph was noble and Mary went with Joseph \nto Bethlehem after their marriage because of the decree of Augustus \nin the first of the fourteen-year cycles of the census now known from \nthe papyri to have lasted several centuries (Lk. 2:1-7).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary was probably of the family of David as well as Joseph. Mary met \nwith dignity the emergencies and the honor that came from the \nshepherds (Lk. 2:8-20), Simeon and Anna at the presentation in the \ntemple (Lk. 2: 22-38), the visit of the Magi on the return to\u0014\nBethlehem (Mat. 2:1-12), the flight to Egypt to  escape. the anger of \nHerod (Mat. 2:13-18), the return to Nazareth and the long years of \nwaiting (Mat. 2:19-23; Lk. 2:39-40). The Boy Jesus astonished Mary in \nspite of all the messages of  the angels and her own long broodings \n(Lk. 2:19, 33, 48-50).

She is thus \na new character in Luke's narrative and is  not the woman that was a \nsinner in Lk. 7:36-50.  It is a gratuitous insult to Mary Magdalene \nto  make such an identification. The very name  Magdalene has come to \nmean a sinful woman  who has repented of her life. Surely Mary \nMagdalene had trouble enough without this slander.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then some would even identify both with Mary of Bethany, a still \nfurther wrong to the two Marys. It is as one of the group of women \nwho helped support the work of Christ and the Apostles that she \nappears in Lk. 8:1-3. Mary Magdalene is prominent at the time of the \ndeath of Jesus. She was with the Mother of Jesus and the women who \nwere standing beside the Cross  (John 19:25). She, with the other \nMary,  watched the tomb on the Sabbath day (Mat. 27: 61), and late on \nthe Sabbath visited it (Mat. 28:1), and after sunset went and bought \nspices (Mk. 16:1), and early Sunday morning came and saw the empty \ntomb and ran and told Peter her fears of a grave robbery (John \n20:1-2). \u0014\n\u0014\nShe came back to the tomb after Peter and John had left, and was the \nfirst who saw the Risen Christ, whom at first she did not recognize \ntill He spoke her name (John 20:11-18).

    "words": "October 31, 1816 \u0014\nMoffat Sailed to Heroic Endeavors in Africa\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Moffat sailed for South Africa on this day, October 31, 1816. \nMission leaders saw him off reluctantly, believing he was unqualified \nfor the task. Little did they know their man.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in Scotland in 1795, Moffat hated school as a child. His one \ntextbook was the Shorter Catechism. The schoolmaster saw he did not \nlike to study and coaxed him on with a rod. Unhappy with that state \nof affairs, Moffat ran away to sea. He found the sailor's life even \nharder than the scholar's. He was barely a teenager when he gladly \nfound himself on shore again. Apprenticed to a gardener for low pay \nand hard work, he saw that without an education his life was going to \nbe very tough.\u0014\n\u0014\nA desire to study possessed him. He gained every skill he could, \narranging his work so that he could attend school at night to learn \nLatin and geometry. He picked up blacksmithing and learned to play \nthe violin. A new employer encouraged him to improve himself even \nmore.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Moffat was twenty when he discovered what it is to have \nChrist's love in oneself. He shared his faith with all who crossed \nhis path but was shocked to discover that most people did not care to \nhear. A desire stirred in him to do some great work for the Lord. He \napplied at a mission agency but was turned down. Yet he persisted and \nwas finally sent to Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere he learned the value of patience. The Africans believed Moffat \nmust be an outcast to leave his own people and live among them. They \nheld him in contempt. But he would not give up. Despite thievery and \nthreats; despite long years without results, he kept at it, trusting \nthat God would keep his promises and produce a harvest of souls. The \nbreakthrough came when African leaders accompanied Moffat to the \ncoast. Seeing the respect with which he was greeted, they realized he \nwas no outcast. They saw the luxuries of civilization. \"Why have you \nleft all of this for us?\" they asked. Moffat explained the love of \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the days before modern linguistic tools, Moffat proved what a \nwilling mind under Christ can accomplish. He learned a difficult \nlanguage and translated the Bible into it. The boy who despised \neducation became a man who educated thousands. Because of his \nperseverance, hundreds of Africans submitted their lives to the \nChrist he honored.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote: FRS---this is not the whole story of Robert Moffatt.

    "words": "MARY THE MOTHER OF JESUS.\u0014\n\u0014\n No woman in all history has been so highly\u0014\nhonored as the Mother of Jesus, nor has any one\u0014\nbeen so misunderstood. The Roman Catholics\u0014\n(the masses, at any rate) have practically wor-\u0014\nshiped her, and often Mary stands in the place\u0014\nof Christ with those~who pray to her and ask her\u0014\nintercession. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a reaction against this almost\u0014\nidolatrous attitude towards Mary and the paint-\u0014\nings and statues of her, most Protestants neglect\u0014\nher entirely. In my book, The Mother of Jesus:\u0014\nHer Problems and Her Glory, the effort is made\u0014\nto do justice to her and to try to understand her\u0014\nattitude toward the great part that she had to\u0014\nplay in the coming of the Messiah. Luke gives\u0014\nus the annunciation by the angel Gabriel and\u0014\nhow she gave herself to the will of God (Lk.\u0014\n1:26-38). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe supernatural aspect of the Virgin\u0014\nBirth of Jesus is told by Luke, the Greek physi-\u0014\ncian, from Marys standpoint and by Matthew\u0014\nfrom Josephs point of view (Mat. 1:16, 18-25).\u0014\nMary sought sympathy with Elizabeth and found\u0014\nit, and gave expression to her own ecstasy in the\u0014\nwonderful Magnificat (Lk. 1:39-56). The con-\u0014\nduct of Joseph was noble and Mary went with\u0014\nJoseph to Bethlehem after their marriage be-\u0014\ncause of the decree of Augustus in the first of\u0014\nthe fourteen-year cycles of the census now known\u0014\nfrom the papyri to hav~ lasted several centuries\u0014\n(Lk. 2:1-7). \u0014\n\u0014\nMary was probably of the family\u0014\nof David as well as Joseph. Mary met with\u0014\ndignity the emergencies and the honor that came\u0014\nfrom the shepherds (Lk. 2:8-20), Simeon and\u0014\nAnna at the presentation in the temple (Lk. 2:\u0014\n22-38), the visit of the Magi on the return to\u0014\nBethlehem (Mat. 2:1-12), the flight to Egypt to\u0014\nescape. the anger of Herod (Mat. 2:13-18), the\u0014\nreturn to Nazareth and the long years of wait-\u0014\ning (Mat. 2:19-23; Lk. 2:39-40). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Boy Jesus astonished Mary in spite of all the messages of\u0014\nthe angels and her own long broodings (Lk. 2:19,\u0014\n33, 48-50). But Mary took pride in the power\u0014\nof God in her wondrous Son (John 2:1-12). The\u0014\nday came when Mary felt that Jesus was over-\u0014\nstrained and she wanted to take Him home for\u0014\na rest. Jesus went on His way to the Cross and\u0014\nMary could only watch Him and follow Him till\u0014\nshe stood by the Cross with a sword through her\u0014\nheart, as Simeon had said would be the case.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jesus spoke tenderly to His mother as He\u0014\ndied and commended her to the care of the Be-\u0014\nloved Disciple who took her from the Cross to his\u0014\nhome. But Mary had the vindication in the\u0014\nResurrection of Jesus, and she met in the upper\u0014\nroom with the disciples when they waited for the\u0014\ncoming of the Ho~y Spirit. No woman ever had\u0014\nsuch high and holy secrets in her heart and life.\u0014\nShe bore herself in a worthy way as the chief\u0014\nmother of the human race.\u0014\n\u0014\nA.T. ROBERTSON\u0014",

    "words": "December 20, 1899 \u0014\nEvangelist Martyn Lloyd-Jones\u0014\n\u0014\nCardiff is a seaport and the capital of Wales--a city graced with \nmany historic buildings and overlooked by a castle on a hill. A town \nof fewer than 2,000 people in 1801, its population multiplied into \nthe hundreds of thousands in the 19th century. Martyn Lloyd-Jones \ncontributed to that population boom when he was born in Cardiff on \nthis day, December 20, 1899.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn's childhood had at least one highlight: In January, 1910, his \nhome caught on fire while he and his brothers were sleeping. All of \nthem could easily have lost their lives. The family did lose almost \neverything they owned and their shaky finances never recovered. As a \nresult, Martyn set out with real determination to succeed.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe entered a London medical school, completing all his exams at such \na young age that he had to wait for his degree until his age caught \nup with his education. He became the chief clinical assistant of a \nleading physician, Sir Thomas Horder. Horder described Martyn as \"the \nmost acute thinker that I ever knew.\" Martyn faced the prospect of a \nbrilliant and financially rewarding career. But something happened to \nchange that.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn had joined a Calvinist Methodist church when he was \nfifteen-years-old. Around 1924, he began to seriously consider his \nspiritual condition. \"For many years I thought I was a Christian when \nin fact I was not. It was only later that I came to see that I had \nnever been a Christian and became one.\" Reading the Bible for himself \nand pondering its meaning, he eventually realized that \"What I needed \nwas preaching that would convict me of sin and ... bring me to \nrepentance and tell me something about regeneration. But I never \nheard that. The preaching we had was always based on the assumption \nthat we were all Christians...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMartyn asked Christ to become master of his life. As soon as he had \nmade that decision, he was overwhelmed with a longing to return to \nWales to share his new-found faith with the folks back home.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe took a small church in Aberavon, Wales. Local doctors snubbed him, \nthinking he was going to poach on their patients. But Martyn wanted \ninstead to win souls. He preached clear, analytical messages. Working \nmen and women came to know Christ. Notorious alcoholics converted to \nChrist. Other churches invited him to speak.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few years after Martyn came to Aberavon, a local doctor asked for \nhelp with a difficult medical case. Martyn diagnosed the problem at \nonce and proved completely right. After that, demands for his medical \nassistance increased to the point that they almost threatened his \npastoral work.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis name became increasingly well-known. G. Campbell Morgan, another \npastor with a powerful ministry, invited him to come to Westminster \nChapel. Martyn accepted the Westminster invitation in 1938. \nPublication of his powerful sermons made him internationally famous. \nHe died in 1981.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Cardiff.\" Britannica. 1967.\u0014\n\"Cardiff, Wales Area -- December 1999.\" \nhttp://www.electricrainbow.com/welshpages/\u0014\nCatherwood, Sir Fred. \"Dr. D.

    "title": "MURDER 0F ABOLITIONIST ELIJAH P. LOVEJOY",
    "words": "November 7, 1837 \u0014\nMurder of Abolitionist Elijah P. Lovejoy\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Elijah Lovejoy was born in Maine on November 9, 1802, none of \nhis family could have imagined the violent death he met almost \nexactly 35 years later. Elijah was murdered on this day, November 7, \n1837 and buried two days later, on what would have been his 35th \nbirthday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trouble was, he had become a clergyman and moved west to St. \nLouis in 1828. For the next six years he was editor of a Whig \nnewspaper, and then founded the St. Louis Observer, which became an \ninfluential Presbyterian voice. But when Elijah's articles denounced \nslavery, the anger of the townspeople forced him to flee across the \nMississippi River, and to settle at Alton, Illinois. There he \nestablished the Alton Observer and continued advocating gradual \nemancipation and the abolition of slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwice crowds came and destroyed his printing presses. When a \ncommittee pressured Elijah to leave town, he replied, \"You may hang \nme...you may burn me at the stake, tar and feather me, or throw me \ninto the Mississippi, but you cannot disgrace me. I and I alone can \ndisgrace myself; and the deepest of all disgrace would be, at a time \nlike this to deny my Master by forsaking his cause.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 3 a.m. Tuesday morning, November 7, 1837 the steamboat Missouri \nFulton unloaded a new press for Elijah. Winthrop Gilman, his \nsupporter, allowed him to place it inside his warehouse--a brave \nmove, since it was full of costly merchandise that could be destroyed \nif violence errupted.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving safely landed the press, Elijah and his friends thought that \nthe threat of violence was past. Elijah comforted his pregnant wife \nwith this assurance. He and others prayed. But talk in town was \nrough. Fearing violence, Elijah and Gilman moved their families. \nGilman organized a small band of men to defend the warehouse and \nasked the mayor for help.\u0014\n\u0014\nA drunken, pro-slavery mob formed. They ordered Gilman to give up the \npress or watch his warehouse burn. Gilman said he would defend the \npress with his life. Elijah agreed. The violence started with \nstone-throwing and soon escalated into shots. From inside the \nwarehouse one of the defenders shot a young carpenter who had boasted \nhe would \"get\" the abolitionists. The young man died thirty minutes \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\nShouting, \"Burn them out,\" the mob tried to set fire to the roof of \nthe building. Their first attempt failed. At their second attempt, \nElijah stepped out to drive away the man with the torch. Immediately \nhe was hit by five shots--two apparently from doctors hidden behind a \nwoodpile--and died almost at once. With the building on fire and \ntheir leader dead, most of the defenders fled. The mob fired at them, \nbut they escaped. One wounded man was saved with a tourniquet. The \nmob smashed the press. One of the doctors danced a jig as Elijah \nLovejoy's body was carried home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe murder was a big mistake by the pro-slavery mob. John Quincy \nAdams wrote that Elijah's death was like an earthquake shock that \nwould be felt not only across America, but in the most distant \nregions of the earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe murder swayed northern sentiment in favor of abolition. Senator \nHenry Wilson of Massachusetts declared that the murder of Elijah \nLovejoy made it clear that the bitter pro-slavery forces would stop \nat nothing, and that the slavery question would be much more than \njust a bloodless clash of ideas. This grim prophecy was fulfilled \ntwenty-five years later with the outbreak of the American Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nSimon, Paul.

    "words": "January 8, 1956 \u0014\nMissionaries Died in Ecuador Jungle\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe five men on \"Palm Beach,\" a strip of sand on the Curaray River, \nEcuador, knew that there was danger. But they took the risk for a \nchance to make friendly contact with the Huaorani (Auca) Indians. \nMissionaries Ed McCulley, Nate Saint, Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, and \nRoger Youderian, had landed on the makeshift airstrip in their \n\"modern missionary mule\" (a Piper Cruiser).\u0014\n\u0014\nBack at Shell Mera,on this day January 8, 1956, Marj Saint waited for \nword. The short wave radio crackled. Marj listened as her husband, \nNate, told her that \"a commission of ten\" was on its way from \nTerminal City. \"Looks like they'll be here for the early afternoon \nservice. Pray for us. This is the day! We'll contact you next at \nfour-thirty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nExcitement was intense. Months of efforts were about to bear fruit! \nThe \"commission\" was a group of Huaorani men. Terminal City was the \ncode name the missionaries had given to a Huaorani village they had \nspotted from the air. If Nate spoke in code words, it was because he \ndid not want Ecuadorians with guns pre-empting the mission's friendly \novertures to the natives. The Huaorani were sturdy forest dwellers \nwho had fiercely resisted all efforts to subdue them, killing many \npeople who ventured into their territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nNate had first spotted one of their villages from the air on \nSeptember 19, 1955. On October 1st, missionaries developed a plan for \nmaking contact, when bad weather kept Johnny Keenan from flying Ed \nback to his home station at Arunjo. Ed, Nate and others gathered at \nShell Mera and talked into the wee hours of the morning, huddled over \nmaps. How could they demonstrate that they came in peace and not in \nhostility?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat they decided to do was fly over the villages and lower gifts to \nthe people. Using a public address system, they repeated friendly \nphrases that Jim had collected from an Huaorani woman on a nearby \nhacienda. \"Biti miti punimupa: I like you; I want to be your friend.\" \nSoon large numbers of Aucas were converging for the gift drops. \nFinally the day came when the villagers tied a gift to the line in \nreturn--a feathered headdress.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext, a landing spot had to be found. They chose a playa(sand bar) on \nthe Curaray River. Nate ran simulated landings, touching his wheels \nto the sand to test its firmness. It seemed okay. Finally on January \n3rd, Nate and Ed landed. The sand proved softer than hoped, but by \nletting air out of the tires, a safe landing and takeoff was \npossible. Nate ferried the other men and supplies to the camp. They \nerected a prefab tree house and shouted friendly words into the bush. \nFour days later a Huaorani man and two women appeared. Now, on \nJanuary 8th, 1956, several Auca were headed to \"Palm Beach.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFour thirty rolled around, time for the planned radio contact. \nEagerly Marj switched on her radio back at base. Nothing! Had the men \nbeen invited to the Huaorani houses? She waited. There was no sound. \nThe minutes passed, and lengthened into hours. Silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohnny Keenan flew over Palm Beach on Monday morning. He reported to \nMarj that he had spotted Nate's plane, stripped of its fabric. On \nWednesday he saw the first of the bodies from the air. Then another. \nSoon it was evident all five men were dead. A ground force moved in \nto bury the men. Ed's body had washed away.\u0014\n\u0014\nA shipwrecked sailor recalled Jim Elliot's words: \"When it comes time \nto die, make sure that all you have to do is die.\" The five men on \nthe beach had been ready to die and their deaths were not in vain. \nThrough the efforts of the widows, the Huaorani discovered Christian \nforgiveness. The day came when they explained that they had killed \nthe five out of fear, thinking they were cannibals. The same Huaorani \nwho killed the men became believers in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nEllliot, Elisabeth. Through Gates of Splendor.

    "title": "MALE DOMINANCE REFLECTS CULTURE, NOT BIBLE",
    "words": "Male Dominance Reflects \nCulture, Not Biblical Mandate \u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge\u0014\nJanuary 10, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nLifeWay Christian Resources of the Southern Baptist Convention has \npublished a two-volume Bible commentary (for the \\Old and New \nTestaments) that's marketed to women. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat comes as no surprise, nor is it surprising that the volumes \nwould be co-edited by Rhonda Kelley, wife of New Orleans Baptist \nTheological Seminary president Chuck Kelley, and Dorothy Patterson, \nwhose husband, Paige, is president of Southwestern Baptist \nTheological Seminary.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it's no surprise that the commentary is designed to promote a \n\"complementarian\" view of the genders, a view that really \nconservative interpreters call \"biblical womanhood.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least the volumes are named \"Women's Evangelical Commentary\" on \nthe Old and New Testaments, lest they be confused with more \nfeminist-oriented commentaries that target women.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's unfortunate that the word \"evangelical\" has become a virtual \nsynonym for \"fundamentalist,\" but its inclusion (along with its \npublisher) lets the reader know up front which tack the commentary \ntakes. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe basic argument of \"complementarianism\" is that God created men \nand women with equal worth, but assigned them different roles in \nwhich the man is to lead and the woman is to submit, both at home and \nin church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is portrayed as the biblical view of womanhood, as opposed to \nmore liberated views of equality between genders that are common to \nWestern culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's the main problem with the \"complementarian\" view: biblical \nstories reflect the prevailing culture of their own time, a highly \nmale-dominant culture in which exceptional women could occasionally \nshine but were always clearly subservient to men.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven women typically held up as heroes (like Ruth and Esther) \nachieved their fame by playing along with cultural expectations, \ndolling themselves up and fawning over the men they hoped to impress.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that biblical inerrantists, who assume that the Bible \nway is the only way, assume that male dominance is inherently a \ndivinely intended biblical value rather than a reflection of the \nancient cultures in which the biblical stories took place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose cultures also called for regular doses of blood-vengeance, a \nwholesale acceptance of slavery, and capital punishment for minor \noffenses.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould we argue that those practices establish biblical standards \nrather than recognizing them as cultural influences reflected in the \nbiblical world? Of course not.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeither should we assume that God created women to be subservient to \nmen just because that's the way it was in the cultures in which the \nBible was written and therefore in the minds of some biblical writers \n all or most of whom were men.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world in which we now live continues to reflect a variety of \ncultures. Western societies acknowledge greater equality for women, \nat least in theory, though men continue to dominate the economic and \npolitical systems, and women's wages for the same work still falls \nbehind those of men. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther cultures are unapologetically male-dominant. In Saudi Arabia, \nfor example, women are expected to remain at home most of the time. \nThey are not allowed to drive, and only recently were women given \npermission to work in sales; then only for the sale of women's \nlingerie.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Muslim countries dominated by religious fundamentalists, women \nmust cover themselves from head to toe when outside the home, as if \nthey are not truly humans with faces.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some African cultures, female circumcision and other practices are \ndesigned to disempower women and keep them under men's thumbs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe awareness of competing cultural expectations in our own time \nshould help us to understand that the Bible's reflection of its \nnarrow cultural world does not necessarily imply a biblical \nendorsement or establishment of male dominance.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod, whose own \"personhood\" is beyond gender, created both men and \nwomen in God's image, according to Genesis 1:27. That's the ideal; \nanything less is a cultural corruption, even if it is reflected in \nthe world of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nComplementarianism is no compliment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge is associate professor of Old Testament at Campbell \nUniversity Divinity School\u0014",

The day came when they explained that they had killed \nthe five out of fear, thinking they were cannibals.

    "words": "The monophysites were an early, post-Nicea heretical group which \nargued that Jesus had a single, divine nature and denied the more \northodox view that Jesus had a dual nature, fully human and fully \ndivine. The earliest instances of monophysitism were not condemned \nand were, in fact, advocated by a number of prominent Church leaders, \nlike Cyril.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe monophysite view that Jesus had a single nature was eventually \ncondemned at the Council of Chalcedon (451) which asserted that Jesus \nhad both a Divine and a Human nature combined in a single person. \nSome tried to avoid being condemned as heretics by asserting that \nJesus may have had two natures technically, the Human nature was so \nsubsumed by the Divine nature that the practical effect was a single \nnature. \u0014\n\u0014\nA genuine schismatic movement of Monophysites did not appear until \nafter the Second Council of Constantinople (553) which required \nacceptance of the formulation decided upon at Chalcedon and some \nsimply refused. They were the precursors of the present-day Syrian \nand Armenian Orthodox churches. In 1984, the patriarch of the Syrian \nOrthodox church (Mar Ignatius Zakka II) met with Pope John Paul II \nand together they signed a new declaration which stated the \ndifference in their dogmas were more apparent than real and \nultimately based upon cultural and linguistic \"inadequacies.\"\u0014",

    "words": "September 10, 1752 \u0014\nMoravians Settled North Carolina\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nToday it takes only a few hours to drive across North Carolina from \neast to west. In the 1750s, the same route was a gruelling trek. On \nthis day, September 10, 1752 (new calendar),* an expedition of \nMoravian men under the leadership of August Gottlieb Spangenberg set \noff from Edenton, North Carolina. They headed west at the invitation \nof John Carteret, the Earl of Granville, proprietor to much of the \ncolony.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpangenberg was a good choice as leader. Born in Prussia, he came \nunder the influence of Count von Zinzendorf, the dedicated leader of \nthe Moravians. (Moravians were exiled Protestants from what is now \nCzechoslovakia.) Spangenberg did not join the Moravians at once, but \nwhen he was dismissed from the theological faculty at the University \nof Halle because of his religious views, he united with the small \nevangelical group. Zinzendorf sent him to America where he negotiated \nland in Georgia for Moravians who expected to be expelled from \nGermany. Spangenberg founded several other Moravian settlements and \neventually became the American bishop for his sect.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Moravian reputation for sober hard work was well-known to \nCarteret. He felt that if he could point to a flourishing community \nof these godly folk on his land, he could attract more settlers. \nAlthough the first English settlement in the New World had been at \nRoanoke, North Carolina, the state lagged behind others in \ndevelopment owing to mismanagement, high taxes and the economic \nrivalry of neighboring Virginia. John Carteret's offer to the \nMoravians aimed to improve matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut December saw the Moravians lost in the mountains. Eventually, \nthey recovered their bearings and selected the best land they could \nfind. They bought 99,000 acres in what is now Forsyth County. \nSpangenberg named the area Wachau after a valley in Austria.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving staked out their land, the Moravians settled it the next year, \nsending a team of fifteen unmarried men to the region. Among these \nmen were represented all of the essential professions and skills of \nthe day: minister, surgeon, shoemaker, cooper (barrel maker), \nseive-maker, business manager, carpenter and so forth. One secret of \nMoravian success was their practicality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little band created their first settlement at a place they named \nBethabara. They cut two and a half miles of road, cleared land, \nplanted crops, made furniture, imported livestock, constructed an \noven for baking, built homes, and even opened a mill. Within six \nyears, there were seventy Moravians living at Bethabara.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little town's palisade served as a fort during the French and \nIndian War. After the war ended in 1760, the Moravians planted the \ncities of Bethania and Salem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica's Moravians under Spangenberg were deeply concerned with \nmission work among the Native Americans. In fact, Spangenberg even \nwrote a lengthy pamphlet on missions. His philosophy of missions \ncould be summed up in a few excerpts from that pamphlet. \"In our \nlabour among the heathen, we will particularly endeavor, that they \nbecome converted to Christ Jesus with all their heart.\" And, \"To \ncomprise the whole briefly together, the labors of the brethren among \nthe heathen aim at this, that they might be enabled to say of a \ntruth: 'Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, \nwe die unto the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the \nLord's.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n*Note: Under American reckoning, the date would still have been \nAugust 30. On September 2, 1752, Britain adopted the Gregorian \ncalendar and September 14 followed September 2 in North Carolina. \nHowever, Protestant Germans had adopted the Gregorian calendar 52 \nyears earlier.

    "words": "September 6, 1620 \u0014\nMayflower Sailed, Taking Pilgrims to New England\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most significant chapters in American history opened on \nthis day, September 6, 1620. After failed attempts to sail from \nEngland, leaving behind her sister shipSpeedwell, the Mayflower \nsailed from Plymouth for the New World. Aboard were 101 passengers. \nBy today's standards the ship was little bigger than a yacht. Ninety \nfeet long and twenty-six feet wide, it hardly seemed the vessel to \nalter world history.\u0014\n\u0014\nCramped in so small a space and subject to rough weather, the \npassengers suffered a good deal. The sailors cursed the pious \nPilgrims, whom they detested. Food consisted of dried fish, cheese \nand beer. The only sanitary accommodation was a slop bucket. There \nwas nowhere to bathe. Seasickness was rampant during storms. With \nlittle air below decks, the conditions were nauseating at the best. \nDespite this, only one passenger died at sea. However bad matters \nwere aboard ship, they would prove far worse in the \"hideous and \ndesolate wilderness\" which soon confronted them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months and five days after sailing, the ship landed at Cape Cod. \nBefore going ashore the Pilgrims signed the famous Mayflower Compact. \nThis not only made them a completely religious entity but broke \npolitical ground, too, in that it placed them under their own \ngovernance while still paying formal respect to the king of England. \nThe compact was essentially a church covenant, signed by most of the \nadult men who were aboard. It probably staved off a mutiny, for \ntensions were running high.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their destination, the Pilgrims were a long while making up their \nminds where to settle. The sailors grumbled and wanted to force them \noff ship before all the provisions were consumed. Fortunately, some \nof the men who first went ashore found berries and corn which could \nsupplement their rations. The ship remained over winter. Inadequately \nprepared, the Pilgrims died by the dozens. Less than half survived \nthe first winter. Shelter was lacking. The houses they built were of \nwattle and clay. But enough settlers survived to establish a \ncommunity and to open an incomparable chapter in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a social contract as embodied in the Mayflower Compact \nwould become important in the theories of John Locke, Rousseau and \nothers. Christian forms had a good deal of influence in shaping the \ncharacter of early American governments which were largely the \ncreation of Christian exiles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford, William.

    "words": "Market Researcher Explains the Lure of Peer Pressure \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Lindstrom, a former market research expert and author of \nBrandwashed, argues that advertisers know something that human beings \nhave in common with birds and termites. Without even thinking about \nit, we're often controlled by peer pressure. For instance, Lindstrom \nnotes how many bird species \"rise from a field in complete synchrony, \nas though doing a choreographed dance.\" Scientists will say that the \nbirds are \"acting as if they shared one collective brain.\" Termites \nalso act like one enormous termite brain. \"In other words,\" Lindstrom \nwrites, \"only by observing and mimicking the behavior of its \nneighbors can a termite figure out what it should be doing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLindstrom observes that as consumers human beings act in much the \nsame way. He writes:\u0014\n\u0014\nJust like those birds and termites, we, too, are wired with a \ncollective consciousness in that we size up what those around us are \ndoing and modify our actions and behaviors accordingly. In a 2008 \nexperiment conducted by researchers at Leeds University, groups of \npeople were instructed to walk aimlessly around a large hall, without \nconversing with one another. But first the researchers gave just a \nfew of the people detailed instructions on where, precisely, they \nshould walk. When [the researchers] observed the resulting behavior, \nthey found that no matter how large or small the group, everyone in \nit blindly followed that handful of people who appeared to have some \nidea where they were going.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs [one of the researchers] put it, \"The research suggests that \nhumans flock like sheep and birds, subconsciously following a \nminority of individuals,\" and that it takes a mere 5 percent of \n\"informed individuals\" to influence the direction of a crowd of up to \ntwo hundred people. The other 95 percent trail along without even \nbeing aware of it .\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is ample research to show that we instinctively look to the \nbehaviors of others to inform the decisions we makeeverything from \nwhich way we should walk, to what music we should listen to, to which \nkind of car we should drive. It seems, in short, that we \ninstinctively believe that others know more about what we want than \nwe ourselves do.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsychologists have a name for this phenomenon. It's called peer \npressure . [And] this implicit peer pressure is a far more insidious \nkind, and companies and marketers are taking advantage of its \npersuasive powers in ways you couldn't even imagine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMatt Woodley, managing editor, PreachingToday.com; source: Martin \nLindstrom, Brandwashed (Crown Business, 2011), p. 104-108\u0014",

    "words": "The Nobel Prize winning psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman \nrecounts the story behind a famous experiment conducted at New York \nUniversity:\u0014\n\u0014\nParticipants in that experiment were led to individual booths and \ninvited to speak over the intercom about their personal lives and \nproblems. They were to talk in turn for about two minutes. Only one \nmicrophone was active at any one time. There were six participants in \neach group, one of whom was a stooge. The stooge spoke first, \nfollowing a script prepared by the experimenters. He described his \nproblems adjusting to New York and admitted with obvious \nembarrassment that he was prone to seizures, especially when \nstressed. All the participants had a turn.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the microphone was again turned over to the stooge, he became \nagitated and incoherent, said he felt a seizure coming on, and asked \nfor someone to help him. The last words heard were, \"C-could \nsomebody-er-er-help-er-uh-uh-uh [choking sounds]. I  I'm gonna \ndie-er-er-er-er  I'm gonna die-er-er-I seizure I-er [chokes, then \nquiet].\" At this point the microphone of the next participant \nautomatically became active, and nothing more was heard from the \npossibly dying individual.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you think the participants responded to the person they \nthought was having a seizure? Kahneman reports that only four of the \nfifteen participants responded immediately to the appeal for help; \nsix stayed in the booth; five came out only after the \"seizure \nvictim\" had nearly choked to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nKahneman concludes:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe experiment shows that individuals feel relieved of responsibility \nwhen they know that others have heard the same request for help. Did \nthe results surprise you? Very probably. Most of us think of \nourselves as decent people who would rush to help in such a \nsituation, and we expect other decent people to do the same. The \npoint of the experiment, of course, was to show that this expectation \nis wrong. Even normal, decent people do not rush to help when they \nexpect others to take on the unpleasantness of dealing with a \nseizure. And that means you, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel Kahnehan, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, \n2011), pp. 170-171\u0014",

Perelman; Citigroup founder \nSandy Weill and wife Joan; hedge-funders Julian Robertson Jr. and Jim \nSimons; and private-equity honcho David Rubenstein.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe technology sector also is well represented, by venture capitalist \nJohn Doerr and wife Anne; Pierre Omidyar and wife Pam; and Jeff Skoll.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe list includes a few old-money (or at least older-money) names: \nBarron Hilton and David Rockefeller. Still, almost all are self-made \nbillionaires or near-billionaires.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe turnout is impressive, especially since the \nGates-Buffett-sponsored pledge was just announced a month and a half \nago.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince some of the names already planned to give away half their \nfortune, the hard part will be persuading additional signers in the \nmonths to come. The Gates Foundation plans to hold small dinners in \ncoming months in which signers will try to persuade potential givers \nto give their John Hancocks.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people may write off the pledge as a gimmick aimed at simply \nimproving the PR of the super-rich, which could certainly use some \nimproving. But the list could become a strong financial force for \nphilanthropy, if for no other reason than peer pressure, publicity \nand the inspiring example of others.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmericas rich have been searching for new status symbols in the wake \nof the Great Recession. Yachts, private jets, seaside mansions are so \n2007. But being wealthy enough and generous enough to get on the \nGiving Pledge list may quickly become the ultimate badge of \nstatusboth in the U.S. and abroad.\u0014",

    "words": "April 12, 2012 , New York Times\u0014\nMore Evidence Against the Death Penalty\u0014\n\u0014\nConnecticut is poised to become the 17th state without the death \npenalty and the fifth in five years to abolish it. Gov. Dannel Malloy \nis expected to sign the repeal bill approved by the Legislature in \nrecent days. \u0014\n\u0014\nConnecticut is part of a growing movement against capital punishment, \nwith repeal measures now \\proposed in California, Florida, Georgia, \nKansas, Kentucky and Washington. Other states like Ohio, Oregon and \nPennsylvania are reviewing their death penalty laws. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis shift comes at a time when new analyses of capital punishment \nshow gross injustice in its application and enormous costs in \ncontinuing to impose it. In Connecticut, a powerful, comprehensive \nstudy provided evidence that state death sentences are haphazardly \nmeted out, with virtually no connection to the heinousness of the \ncrime. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn California, two former death penalty proponents  a prosecutor who \ndrafted the 1978 ballot initiative that expanded the states death \npenalty and a leading supporter of the 1978 law  are now championing \na new ballot measure to repeal the penalty. They point to a study \nshowing that, since 1978, California has spent roughly $4 billion on \nthe death penalty to carry out 13 executions. The cost of our system \nof capital punishment is so enormous that any benefit that could be \nobtained from it  and I now think theres very little or zero \nbenefit  is so dollar-wasteful that it serves no effective purpose, \nDonald Heller, the drafter of the 1978 measure, said recently. \u0014\n\u0014\nDecades of research show that racial bias pervades death penalty \ncases. Minority defendants with white victims are much more likely to \nbe sentenced to death than others; 35 percent of those executed \nnationally since 1976 were black, though blacks currently make up \n12.6 percent of the population. The problem of inadequate counsel \npermeates the system, with many indigent defendants sentenced to \ndeath after major blunders by court-assigned lawyers. And a horrific \nnumber of innocent people have ended up on death row: 17 convicts \nwith death sentences have been exonerated with DNA evidence since \n1993, 123 with other evidence since 1973. \u0014\n\u0014\nAny careful evaluation leads to what the American Law Institute \nconcluded after a review of decades of executions: the system cannot \nbe fixed. It is practically impossible to rid the legal process of \nbiases driven by race, class and politics. The growing number of \nstates reconsidering this barbaric system is a welcome sign. Capital \npunishment, by overwhelming evidence, should be abolished throughout \nthe United States.\u0014",

    "words": "May 30, 2012 New York Times\u0014\nMarkets and Morals\u0014\nBy NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it bother you that an online casino paid a Utah woman, Kari \nSmith, who needed money for her sons education, $10,000 to tattoo \nits Web site on her forehead? \u0014\n\u0014\nOr that Project Prevention, a charity, pays women with drug or \nalcohol addictions $300 cash to get sterilized or undertake long-term \ncontraception? Some 4,100 women have accepted this offer. \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Sandel, the Harvard political theorist, cites those examples \nin What Money Cant Buy, his important and thoughtful new book. He \nargues that in recent years we have been slipping without much \nreflection into relying upon markets in ways that undermine the \nfairness of our society. \u0014\n\u0014\nThats one of the underlying battles this campaign year. Many \nRepublicans, Mitt Romney included, have a deep faith in the ability \nof laissez-faire markets to create optimal solutions. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheres something to that faith because markets, indeed, tend to be \nefficient. Pollution taxes are widely accepted as often preferable \nthan rigid regulations on pollutants. It may also make sense to sell \nadvertising on the sides of public buses, perhaps even to sell naming \nrights to subway stations. \u0014\n\u0014\nStill, how far do we want to go down this path? \u0014\n\u0014\n Is it right that prisoners in Santa Ana, Calif., can pay $90 per \nnight for an upgrade to a cleaner, nicer jail cell? \u0014\n\u0014\n Should the United States really sell immigration visas? A $500,000 \ninvestment will buy foreigners the right to immigrate. \u0014\n\u0014\n Should Massachusetts have gone ahead with a proposal to sell naming \nrights to its state parks? The Boston Globe wondered in 2003 whether \nWalden Pond might become Wal-Mart Pond. \u0014\n\u0014\n Should strapped towns accept virtually free police cars that come \nladen with advertising on the sides? Such a deal was negotiated and \nthen ultimately collapsed, but at least one town does sell \nadvertising on its police cars. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe marketization of everything means that people of affluence and \npeople of modest means lead increasingly separate lives, Sandel \nwrites. We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our \nchildren go to different schools. You might call it the \nskyboxification of American life. Its not good for democracy, nor is \nit a satisfying way to live. \u0014\n\u0014\nDo we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there \ncertain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money \ncannot buy? \u0014\n\u0014\nThis issue goes to the heart of fairness in our country. There has \nbeen much discussion recently about economic inequality, but almost \nno conversation about the way the spread of markets nurtures a \nbroader, systemic inequality. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe do, of course, place some boundaries on markets. I cant buy the \nright to cut off your leg for my amusement. Americans can sell blood, \nbut (perhaps mistakenly) we dont allow markets for kidneys and other \norgans, even though that would probably save lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nWealthy people can, in effect, buy access to the president at a \n$40,000-a-plate dinner, but they cant purchase a Medal of Freedom. A \nmajor political donor can sometimes buy an ambassadorship, but not to \nan important country. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere to draw the lines limiting the role of markets isnt clear to \nme, but Im pretty sure that weve already gone too far. Im offended \nwhen governments auction naming rights to public property or sell \nspecial access, even if only to fast lanes on a highway or better \ncells in a jail. It is one thing for Delta Air Lines to have first \nclass and coach. It is quite another for government to offer first \nclass and coach in the essential services that government provides. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhere would this stop? Do we let people pay to get premium police and \nfire protection? Do we pursue an idea raised by Judge Richard Posner \nto auction off the right to adopt children? \u0014\n\u0014\nWe already have tremendous inequality in our country: The richest 1 \npercent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, \naccording to the Economic Policy Institute. But we do still have a \nmeasure of equality before the law  equality in our basic dignity  \nand that should be priceless. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarket fundamentalism, to use the term popularized by George Soros, \nis gaining ground. Its related to the glorification of wealth over \nthe last couple of decades, to the celebration of opulence, and to \nthe emergence of a new aristocracy. Market fundamentalists assume a \nmeasure of social Darwinism and accept that laissez-faire is always \noptimal.\u0014",

She couldn't tell us her name,\" \nCaryville Police Chief Johnny Jones told msnbc.com on Wednesday. She \nwas physically healthy and showed no signs of abuse, but Jones said \nLynn was nervous and \"scared to be thrown out at the bar.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People at the bar said it looked like the door opened and somebody \npushed her in,\" Jones said.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice plastered Lynn's photo everywhere, hoping someone would be \nable to identify her. She wasn't a known face in Caryville, a town \nwith a population of about 2,300 people about an hour outside of \nKnoxville.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the meantime, not knowing Lynn's age -- investigators estimated \nshe was between 15 and 20 -- the state's department of child services \ntook custody of her.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 200 tips were called into Caryville's five-officer police \ndepartment. On Monday, an Illinois bus driver who used to shuttle \nkids to a school for children with developmental disabilities \ncontacted officials to say she recognized Lynn.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice then contacted Eva Cameron, who returned to Caryville on \nTuesday to acknowledge abandoning her daughter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The mother comes here yesterday and says, 'I don't want her. Do what \nyou want to with her,'\" Jones said. \"She told my assistant that if \nthe state of Tennessee doesn't want her, she'll be Kentucky's \nproblem.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA hearing held on Tuesday in Campbell County determined no criminal \ncharges were applicable in the case due to the fact that Lynn, \ndespite having a much younger mental capacity, is an adult at 19, and \ntherefore her mother no longer technically has legal guardianship \nover her. Lynn was handed over to the state of Tennessee; Eva drove \nback home to Illinois, where she has other children.\u0014\n\u0014\nJones said the prosecutor's decision came as a shock.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We had all planned on charging the mother. Then I checked with the \ndistrict attorney, and she said she didn't violate any Tennessee \nlaws,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nLynn is now with adult protective services.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not clear why Eva chose to drop her daughter off in Caryville. \nShe initially told police she stopped at the bar to let Lynn use the \nbathroom, but security footage from a nearby Waffle House earlier in \nthe evening shows Lynn entering the Waffle House's restroom. \u0014\n\u0014\nEva, who couldn't be reached by msnbc.com, told Illinois' Northwest \nHerald on Tuesday that her church had directed her to Caryville \nbecause it had a large concentration of Baptists. She also said \nTennessee \"has the No.1 health care system in the United States of \nAmerica,\" and she wanted Lynn to have the best care.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe added that she thought all the attention was \"just a big hoopla \nout of nothing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJones disagrees, and said he's trying to get Tennessee laws changed \nso nothing like this can ever happen again.\u0014",

    "words": "Marriage for the 99%: Seeing Family as a Social Justice Issue\u0014\nHow research demonstrates that marital status can predict a person's \nsocioeconomic status. \u0014\nGlenn T. Stanton   7/13/2012 Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals appear increasingly interested in promoting social \njustice for the downtrodden and the poor. Caring for the least of \nthese has been a central part of Christian history, since Acts 6 and \nthe church's first seven deacons. Christians started the first \nhospitals, soup kitchens, substance-abuse centers, and orphanages, \nand urged the abolition of slavery. The Salvation Army, Youth with a \nMission, Mercy Ships, Compassion International, World Vision, and \npregnancy centers have strong, noble histories from 20th century \nevangelicalism. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut an important new angle on social justice is emerging in academic \ncircles that every concerned Christian should understand and \nacknowledge, a central factor in determining whether one lives in \npoverty or not. Just 60 years ago, those who had stable employment \nwere seldom poor. Forty years ago, education became the gulf which \nseparated the haves from the have-nots. For the past 20 years or \nmore, though, the unexpected factor in whether our neighbors and \ntheir children rise from poverty is marital status. Isabel Sawhill, \nco-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings \nInstitute, explains: \"The proliferation of single-parent households \naccounts for virtually all of the increase in child poverty since the \nearly 1970s.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Christian's attention to the well-being of marriage among the \nvarious strata of society is about far more than mere traditionalism \nor empty moralism. Marriage is unarguably a central love of neighbor \nissue.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Galston, a senior fellow at Brookings who served as President \nClinton's domestic policy advisor, has explained that an American \ntoday must only do three things to avoid living in poverty: graduate \nfrom high school, marry before having a child, and have children \nafter age 20. Only 8 percent of people who do these three things are \npoor, while a stunning 79 percent who fail to meet these expectations \nlive in poverty. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute makes important \nobservations of how marital status is related to poverty in his \nimportant new book, Coming Apart: The State of White America, \n19602010. In 1960, the poorly and moderately educated were only 10 \npercent less likely to be married than the 94 percent of \ncollege-educated Americans who were married. The comparison between \nthe two groups largely held until 1978. Today, these two groups are \nseparated by a 35 percent margin. According to a recent report from \nthe Brookings Institute, the strong rate of marriage among the \nhighly-educated, top-earning Americans has largely held constant and \neven seems to be increasing. But the bad news is that marriage is \nsinking dramatically among low and middle-class Americans, down from \n84 percent to a minority of 48 percent todaya dramatic decline over \nthe last 40 years, and no indicators hint at a slowing pace. The \nstark trend line leads Murray to lament, \"Marriage has become the \nfault line dividing America's classes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some ways, the concern about marriage and class mobility is not \nnew at all. In 1965, a young Daniel Patrick Moynihan passionately \nwarned his boss, President Lyndon Johnson, and our nation that the \nnew landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act was not likely to be fully \nsuccessful because the African American family was dangerously \nfragile and continuing to weaken. On the first page of his infamous \nreportwhich was one of the first shots fired in the modern culture \nwar over the familyMoynihan warned of the consequences stemming from \nthe persistent \"crumbling\" of the African American family: \"So long \nas this situation persists, the cycle of poverty and disadvantage \nwill continue to repeat itself\" among African Americans.\u0014",

As \nhe waited, a woman, hauling behind her a large cart of flowers, \nhappened to pass by. The sweet smell of the flowers perfumed the air. \nJimmy instantly lost the weariness in his body and his spirits were \nlifted. Never before had he experienced anything like this, \nespecially from flowers, and he had many of them at his home. \"How \nmuch are you asking for your flowers?\" Jimmy asked the lady. \"You may \ntake as many as you wish,\" she replied. \"There is no charge. Your \ngratitude and the proper use of the flowers is sufficient payment for \nme.\" Jimmy hurriedly gathered as many flowers as he could in his arms \nand, now renewed in body and spirit, continued his journey home.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he arrived home and entered the front door, the sweet aroma of \nthe flowers almost instantly permeated the house. Jimmy's wife and \nchildren came to the front room, sensing that something special was \nhappening. They too had their weariness removed and their spirits \nlifted. The flowers were performing some magic; in a very real way \nthese flowers were feeding the Harper family. \u0014\n\u0014\nJimmy was concerned that the magic of the flowers be maintained. When \nthe blossoms began to wither and die, he gathered them together and \nplanted them in a small plot of land behind the house. With sunlight \nand water the flowers again bloomed and continued their magic. Never \nbefore had the Harper family received such solace from weariness, \ncomfort from sorrow, and spiritual nourishment as these special \nflowers brought.\u0014\n\u0014\nJimmy was quite cautious about the flowers; he did not want anything \nto happen to them. At first his caution was manifest only in a \nwarning to his children, lest their energy in play result in \ntrampling the flowers. Later, when the Harper children were more \nmature and guests were a regular occurrence at the house, Jimmy built \na wall around the flowers to protect them. This caused much \nconsternation in the family as now special permission was required \nand access was restricted to the flowers and to their special power. \nLater Jimmy found it necessary to hire a guard to safeguard the \nflowers and lawyers and judges to adjudicate cases for access. In the \nprocess the family lost the special magic that the flowers had \nbrought; they were no longer fed. In the end members of the Harper \nfamily, frustrated that the flowers were denied them, decided to seek \nthe flower lady themselves. They searched the highways and byways; \nfinally they found her. She was still giving away her flowers, free \nof charge, to any who would be grateful and would use them properly\u0014",

    "words": "Missionary's Efforts Bear Fruit 150 \nYears Later\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American missionary Adoniram Judson arrived in Burma, or Myanmar, \nin 1812, and died there thirty-eight years later in 1850. During that \ntime, he suffered much for the cause of the gospel. He was \nimprisoned, tortured, and kept in shackles. After the death of his \nfirst wife, Ann, to whom he was devoted, for several months he was so \ndepressed that he sat daily beside her tomb. Three years later, he \nwrote: God is to me the Great Unknown. I believe in him, but I cannot \nfind him.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Adoniram's faith sustained him, and he threw himself into the \ntasks to which he believed God had called him. He worked feverishly \non his translation of the Bible. The New Testament had now been \nprinted, and he finished the Old Testament in early 1834.\u0014\n\u0014\nStatistics are unclear, but there were only somewhere between twelve \nand twenty-five professing Christians in the country when he died, \nand there were no churches to speak of.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the 150th anniversary of the translation of the Bible into the \nBurmese language, Paul Borthwick was addressing a group that was \ncelebrating Judson's work. Just before he got up to speak, he noticed \nin small print on the first page the words: \"Translated by Rev. A. \nJudson.\" So Borthwick turned to his interpreter, a Burmese man named \nMatthew Hia Win, and asked him, \"Matthew, what do you know of this \nman?\" Matthew began to weep as he said,\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We know himwe know how he loved the Burmese people, how he suffered \nfor the gospel because of us, out of love for us. He died a pauper, \nbut left the Bible for us. When he died, there were few believers, \nbut today there are over 600,000 of us, and every single one of us \ntraces our spiritual heritage to one man: the Rev. Adoniram Judson.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Adoniram Judson never saw it!\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that will be the case for some of us. We may be called to invest \nour lives in ministries for which we do not see much immediate fruit, \ntrusting that the God of all grace who oversees our work will ensure \nthat our labor is not in vain.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Julia Cameron, editor, Christ Our Reconciler \n(InterVarsity Press, 2012), pp. 200-201\u0014",

    "title": "MAKING LANGUAGE EQUAL FOR BOTH GENDERS",
    "words": "Making Language Equal for Both Genders\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Naomi Walker\u0014\nOctober 4, 2012   Ethics Daily \u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican schools have long taught the English grammar rule that \nallows the words \"man\" and \"he\" to refer to both males and females. \nThis practice has evolved along a convoluted path. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Carolyn Jacobson in the English department at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, \"man\" was once a truly generic word \nreferring to all humans. One document even refers to a \nseventh-century princess as \"a wonderful man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the meaning of the word \"man\" has gradually narrowed to refer \nonly to males.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, upper class boys needed help \npreparing for their Latin studies, so English grammar rules were \ncreated. As a result, \"he\" officially came to mean \"male\" only, not \n\"male and female.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThen a problem arose with using \"they\" as a singular, rather than \nplural, pronoun. Eventually, grammarians drafted legislation that \nincluded establishing \"he\" as a generic pronoun.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn 1850 Act of Parliament officially stated that \"words importing the \nmasculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe new law sanctioned \"he\" as a generic pronoun, but application of \nthat law was quickly ignored.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1879, for instance, female physicians seeking admission to the \nall-male Massachusetts Medical Society were denied acceptance because \nwording in the society's bylaws referred to members only as \"he.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEnglish, like other languages, is still evolving. In the 21st \ncentury, words like \"man,\" \"men,\" \"he,\" \"him\" and \"his\" are \nofficially generic, but in practice they are usually male-specific.\u0014\n\u0014\nStudies show that, despite knowing traditional grammar rules, both \nadults and children tend to think of male, not female persons, when \nhearing or reading masculine pronouns.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor Carol Becker (\"Leading Women\") observes that our grammar rules \npromote a double standard that allows both men and women to hear male \nlanguage as neutral and female language as gender-biased.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe notes: \"Our habit of using masculine pronouns reminds us \nconstantly that men are active in human history. Using 'he' to talk \nabout humanity works in favor of men and contributes to the \ninvisibility of women.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn \"O Come, Let Us Bow Down and Worship,\" author Deborah Moore Clark \nadds that we must choose our words carefully because \"language often \nwarps and filters meaning and understanding. Words, like mirrors, \nreflect our attitudes  bear witness to our beliefs  influence our \nbehavior and the behavior of others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat is why gender-inclusive language is foundational to the issue of \n\"women's place\" in church and society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe way we speak shapes the way we think and act. Women will never \nachieve full equality and opportunity as long as female gender is \nabsorbed into male terminology and imagery.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not a matter of being politically correct; it's a matter of \nputting our theology into practice. The gospel message of inclusion \ncannot be delivered adequately in the vehicle of gender-exclusive \nlanguage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news is that we can begin changing the status quo, one \nindividual at a time, by adjusting the way we speak and write. It \nwill take sustained effort, akin to becoming fluent in a second \nlanguage, but it can be done.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere to begin? People often stumble over feminine imagery for God (a \ntheological issue for some, which I will address in an upcoming \narticle).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it seems easier to start with using gender-inclusive terms (rather \nthan male-oriented terms like \"man\" and \"he\") when speaking of males \nand females as a combined group.\u0014\n\u0014\nA short list of terms that excludes females: he, males, lords, guys, \nhim, man/men, brotherhood, gentlemen, his, boys, mankind, fellow man, \nsons, lads, fathers, brothers, fellows and kings.\u0014\n\u0014\nA short list of terms that excludes males: she, woman/women, gals, \nlasses, her, females, girls, ladies, daughters, sisterhood, mothers \nand sisters.\u0014\n\u0014\nA short list of terms that includes both females and males: person, \nparent, people, internationals, sibling, nations/nationals, \nmultitudes, people of God, child/children, everyone/everybody, \none/one's, humans, child(ren) of God, anyone/anybody, community, \nmortals, human race, souls, they/their, all creation, \nfamily/familial, humankind/humanity, human beings, saint, \nall/some/many/most, coworker, lovers, laborers, sage, neighbor, \ngroup/people group, friend, loved ones, world/worldwide, folk, all \nraces, kin/kindred, all generations, team, flock/sheep, tribe, heir, \nall ages and all lands.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea is to select inclusive terminology from the last list (and \navoid the first list) when speaking of women and men together.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember: There will always be naysayers who dig up awkward grammar \nproblems (most of which can be worked around) created by substituting \ngender-inclusive language.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut with practice, everyday usage will become second nature for those \nwho are intentional about including women linguistically.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs author Brian Wren (\"What Language Shall I Borrow?\") notes: \n\"Language, like tobacco, is habit forming. Some patterns of writing \nand speaking are addictive and may damage both the user and others \nwho breathe the same linguistic atmosphere. If we  decide to kick \nthe habit, we may get withdrawal symptoms and hostility or derision \nfrom other smokers. But in the end, we shall enjoy breathing fresh \nair.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNaomi K.

Otte, who officials say suffered epileptic \nseizures, has been hospitalized since Thursday.\u0014\n \u0014\nHer baby, Joseph Lewis Martinez, was found dead in the microwave at \n649 W. Riverside Drive in Lanexa early Thursday by an aunt, Alina \nMartinez. She had been called to the residence by Joseph Anthony \nMartinez, the baby's father, when he couldn't find his son. The \nmicrowave oven was not on when she made the discovery.\u0014\n \u0014\nA small funeral for Joseph was held Saturday.\u0014\n \u0014\nHis father, Joe Martinez, said yesterday, \"One day I had everything; \nthe next day I had \u0014\nnothing. I lost my whole little family. No words can explain it.\" New \nKent Commonwealth's Attorney C. Linwood Gregory said the preliminary \nautopsy report indicates Joseph died as result of being placed in the \nmicrowave and it being turned on. The final autopsy report has not \nbeen issued, pending the completion of toxicology reports, Gregory \nsaid. The state's chief medical examiner has said the baby suffered \nburns consistent with those caused by a microwave.\u0014\n \u0014\nAccording to family friends such as Steve Walker, Otte told family \nmembers she suffered a seizure that morning, became confused and \nthought she was placing the baby's milk bottles in the microwave for \nheating.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe investigation began shortly after Joe Martinez, a handyman and \nplumber's apprentice and a sport fisherman, awoke Thursday morning to \ngo to work.\u0014\n \u0014\nJoey, as he called his son, slept in a crib next to his bed. Martinez \nsaid he had been tired from a string of 60-hour work weeks' and went \nto bed Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. He said he expected to awake to Joey's \ncries about 2 a.m., the infant's usual feed- \u0014\ningtime. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe cries didn't come. Joe Martinez awoke later for work, looked in \nhis son's crib and found it empty. He awoke Otte, who told him she \ndidn't know the whereabouts of the baby, said Alina Martinez. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoe Martinez called his grandmother's home nearby, and family members \nrushed over to help him search the home from end to end. A 911 call \nwas placed about 5:30 a.m.\u0014\n \u0014\nShortly before deputies' arrived, Alina Martinez looked at the \ncountertop microwave. \"I just walked over, and he was in \u0014\nthere, already dead,\" she said during an interview Friday. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe discovery deeply disturbed all those involved.\u0014",

    "words": "October 19, 2012, New York Times \u0014\n\u0014\nMalala Moment May Have Passed in Pakistan, as Rage Over a Shooting \nEbbs\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DECLAN WALSH\u0014\n\u0014\nRAWALPINDI, Pakistan  The smartly dressed Internet entrepreneur \nbasked in the sun outside a McDonalds, down the road from Pakistans \nmilitary headquarters, considering the furor over Malala Yousafzai, \nthe schoolgirl who had taken on the Taliban only to be shot in the \nhead. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe have mixed feelings about Malala, said the man, Raja Imran, 30, \nhis eyes shaded by sunglasses, fiddling with a pack of Marlboros. \nWas it the Americans who shot her or was it Al Qaeda? We dont know. \nSome people think this is all an American publicity stunt to make \ntheir point against the Taliban. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd what did he himself think? Mr. Imran shrugged. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral young customers at the restaurant were similarly ambivalent. \nOthers asked: What about the other two girls wounded in the shooting? \nAnd what about Aafia Siddiqui? asked one young woman, referring to \nthe Pakistani woman convicted on charges of trying to kill American \nsoldiers and F.B.I. agents by a New York court in 2010 and sentenced \nto 86 years in prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nNobody mentions her, said the woman, who gave her name as Maria, \nwith a pointed glance before darting away. \u0014\n\u0014\nSuch conspiracy-laden skepticism about Ms. Yousafzai, who was shot by \na Taliban gunman inside her school bus, is only one strand of public \nopinion here; others have expressed unqualified anger at the attack. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut it does suggest something dispiriting: that Pakistans Malala \nmoment, and the possibilities it briefly excited, has passed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 9 assault, some Pakistanis \nhoped it could set off a sea change in their society. For years, the \ncountrys ability to resist Taliban militancy has been hamstrung by a \nbroad ambiguity that undermined a national consensus against Islamist \nviolence. \u0014\n\u0014\nReligious groups hesitated to challenge the Taliban for religious \nreasons. Politicians feared speaking out on safety grounds. And the \nmilitary, which has a history of nurturing Islamists to fight its \nproxy wars in India or Afghanistan, equivocated by tacitly supporting \nselected militant outfits, known among militancy experts as the good \nTaliban. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut after Ms. Yousafzai was shot, heart-rending images of the wounded \nchild bounced against coldblooded Taliban statements that the \nmilitants would shoot her again, if they had a chance. The country \nsuddenly spoke with a unified, furious voice.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoliticians and religious leaders condemned the Taliban with unusual \npassion. The army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, visited Ms. \nYousafzais bedside and released a rare public statement that the \nmilitary would refuse to bow before terror.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriters compared the teenage blogger to Anne Frank. Conservative \npoliticians came under harsh scrutiny.\u0014",

    "title": "MORE THAN CONQUERORS - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "William Hendrickson has done a great job in this book in presenting \nthe \"historic amillennial\" view of interpreting the book of \nRevelation. He does a good job showing how Revelation is written in \nsigns and symbols (as Rev. 1:1 in the Greek clearly says) rather than \nbeing written as a literal account. Through consistently using the \nBible to interpret the Bible (not simply prooftexting), Hendrickson \nshows that Revelation is not a book which appeals to our desire for \nthe sensational. Dispensationalists would do well to seriously read \nthis second best book I've ever read on Revelation. \u0014\n\u0014\nHendrickson is not perfect though. He occasionally breaks out of his, \nand the Bible's, consistent method of interpretation in this book and \nuses some \"literal\" interpreting (such as that concerning the black \nplague). Overall, I recommend this book at an excellent starting \npoint, but not as an ending point. There is a book which takes the \ntechnique of using the Bible to interpret the Bible to a much higher \nlevel (The Days of Vengeance by Chilton), but whereas Chilton's book \nis over 700 pages, Hendrickson's book is about a fourth the size. One \nwould do well to begin at the shorter, simpler exegesis of \nHendrickson before moving on to something so completely comprehensive \nas Chilton's book. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than Conquerors is a presentation of historic amillennialism and \nthere are other forms of amillennialism to consider as well (futurist \nand post-millennial for instance). But the main issue is the \nrefreshing approach Hendrickson restores to interpreting the Bible; \nthat is, he uses the Bible, not the newspaper, to determine the \nmeaning of the prophecies. For this one reason, I believe this book \nshould be on people's reading list. And dispensensationalists would \ndo well to put down the newspaper and turn off the evening news \n(which are never good commentaries on the Bible) and pick up \nHendrickson's book. \u0014\n\u0014\nI personally do not ultimately agree with Hendrickson's specific \ninterpretation in every area, but I agree with his method of using \nthe Bible to interpret the Bible. Therefore, it's a good text book on \nBible interpretation in process, even though one may not ultimately \nagree with the book's final conclusions.\u0014",

    "title": "MY 4 CLEARER VIEWS OF GOD",
    "words": "My 4 Clearer Views of God \u0014\nMarshall Shelley \u0014\n\u0014\nWithin a three-month period, Marshall and Susan Shelley saw two of \ntheir children die. In November 1991, son Toby succumbed to birth \ndefects after two minutes of life. Then in February 1992, daughter \nMandy, almost 2, died of complications from microcephaly. Now after \ntwenty years, Marshall, LEADERSHIP JOURNAL's editor, reflects on how \nthese losses have affected his relationship with God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter losing two children, and after years of reflection, I see some \naspects of God's character in much sharper focus than before, while \nothers are still behind a glass dimly.\u0014\n\u0014\nServing God demands more\u0014\n\u0014\nI hadn't realized the cost of discipleship. God assigns some people \nincredibly tough situations. Mandy's life was marked by severe and \nprofound retardation and frequent seizures. Toby's Trisomy 13, the \ndoctors said, was \"a condition incompatible with life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSince our two children died, I can't help but pause, and wince, each \ntime I read the Bible and see afresh the ordeals children faced, \noften at the hand of God. Sometimes his ways are severe.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Genesis, at God's direction, Ishmael and his mother are evicted \nfrom their home into the desert. Young Isaac is bound as a human \nsacrifice (though soon released). In Exodus, all firstborn sons of \nthe Egyptians are slain by the death angel. Job's children (though \nprobably grown children) are killed in Satan's test, sanctioned by \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd this doesn't include the children killed in God's broader \njudgments, such as the flood of Noah's day, the destruction of Sodom, \nor the conquest of Canaan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the story of David and Bathsheba, the adultery and the murder of \nUriah no longer hold much interest for me--simply more evidence of \nhuman sinfulness. Now I fixate on God's treatment of the two sons \nproduced by David and Bathsheba's union--one, a nameless son, died as \nGod's judgment on David's sin; the second, Jedidiah (meaning \"loved \nby God\"), became Solomon and enjoyed God's most lavish blessing. I \nponder that first son's destiny--dying as punishment for David's sin \n(even though David apparently didn't grieve the death).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Matthew, all boys in Bethlehem under age 2 are murdered, in \nfulfillment of an Old Testament prophecy.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn John 9, in front of a man blind since birth, Jesus is asked if \nthis suffering is due to his own sins or to those of his parents. \nJesus explains it is neither but rather \"that the work of God might \nbe displayed in his life.\" A childhood of blindness for God's greater \nglory? That answer--especially from Jesus, known for his love of \nchildren--causes me to tremble.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, of course, God's own Son is sent to die upon a cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nLiving for God's glory is not for sissies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only way I can gaze upon such severe treatment of children, \nwithout becoming catatonic, is trusting that God's purposes require a \nstiff price. Redemption must be ever so much costlier than I imagine. \nEarth's contamination by sin must be so severe that equally strong \nmedicine is required.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd even trusting God's purpose, I still occasionally flinch.\u0014\n\u0014\nEternity is nearer\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore my children died, I considered the doctrines of resurrection \nand heaven pleasant but remote, a bit quaint. Now, they are central \nand strategic.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I held both Toby and Mandy within seconds of death, I was \noverwhelmed by a sense of how close every one of us is to eternity. I \nwas cheek to cheek with a child now entering everlasting life. That \nsense, though sometimes overshadowed by the busyness of life, is \nnever far away.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany times now, heaven seems so much more substantial than earth. My \nwife, Susan, sometimes says, \"I have one foot in heaven and one foot \non earth.\" We've already sent part of ourselves on ahead--and we \nunderstand better what Jesus meant when he said, \"Where your treasure \nis, there will your hearts be also.\" Our hearts are continually drawn \nheavenward.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I still dread the process of dying, the fact that my children \nhave preceded me gives me greater resolve. If my child can go through \ndeath's door, certainly I can.\u0014\n\u0014\nA friend put the issue clearly: \"To enter eternity, you must (1) be \nborn, and (2) die. That's the process for every one of us, including \nMandy and Toby.\" After your child enters eternity, it seems amazingly \nclose.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer is less specific, more intense\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter desperate pleas for our children's healing, for the ability to \nswallow, for lungs to breathe, for an end to seizures--and then to \nsee Toby and Mandy's days on earth end--my prayer life has changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's harder to confidently make specific requests. It's now clear \nthat God's redemptive agenda may, or may not, include granting my \ncurrent passionate desire--even a passionate desire for my son or \ndaughter to breathe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe day after Toby's birth/death, one of the labor-and-delivery \nnurses handed us a recording by Wayne Watson; the title song, \"Home \nFree,\" described us with uncanny accuracy.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Out in the corridors we pray for life, a mother for her baby, a \nhusband for his wife. Sometimes the good die young, it's sad but \ntrue. While we pray for one more heartbeat, the real comfort is in \nYou....\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Pain has little mercy, suffering's no respecter of age, of race, or \nposition. I know every prayer gets answered, but the hardest one to \npray is slow to come: O Lord, not mine but your will be done.\" \n(copyright 1990 Material Music and Word Music)\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's clear answer to our prayers was not to provide additional \nheartbeats. It was \"Toby and Mandy will live--but with resurrected \nbodies in heaven with me.\" If his answer was so much deeper than what \nwe requested, then it's hard not to imagine him also reconfiguring \nour more mundane requests about jobs, relationships, schedules, and \nsurgeries.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I'm not sure I even want him to grant my daily wish list. What I \nreally want is to see God's eternal work and to be a part of it. \nPrayer is now an intense desire to know God, to understand his ways, \nand to see good come out of pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nFaith is more intentional\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you remember the classical distinction between virtue and \ninnocence? Virtue, unlike innocence, has successfully passed a point \nof temptation.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps a similar distinction can be found in faith--innocent faith \ncan trust God because it hasn't seen the abyss; virtuous faith has \nknown the terror and chooses to trust God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Abraham Heschel observed, \"Job's faith was unshakable because it \nwas the result of being shaken.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEven as a child, I loved to read, and I quickly learned that I would \nmost likely be confused during the opening chapters of a novel. New \ncharacters were introduced. Disparate, seemingly random events took \nplace. Subplots were complicated and didn't seem to make any sense in \nrelation to the main plot.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I learned to keep reading. Why?

    "words": "Man says prayer group leader told him to kill wife\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Bill Draper, MSN \u0014\n\u0014\nA preliminary hearing is set Wednesday in Kansas City, Mo., for Micah \nMoore in the death of Bethany Deaton.\u0014\n\u0014\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.  Less than three months after he stood as a \ngroomsman in the wedding of two friends he had known since college in \nTexas, Micah Moore walked into a suburban Kansas City police \ndepartment and unloaded a dark secret: He had taken the woman's life \nat the request of her new husband, a charismatic prayer group leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice said Bethany Deaton's death initially appeared to be a \nsuicide. Officers found a note and empty bottle of over-the-counter \npain medication along with her body in a minivan parked by a lake on \nOct. 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wasn't until Moore confessed nearly two weeks later that police \nannounced she had been killed. He is scheduled for a preliminary \nhearing on a first-degree murder charge Wednesday.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the criminal complaint filed in support of the charge, police \ndetailed a stunning series of allegations that Moore made as part of \nhis confession.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore, 23, lived with Deaton and her husband, Tyler, in a communal \nhome shared by male members of their prayer group. He told police \nthat several members had sexually assaulted Bethany Deaton, and they \nwere worried she would tell someone. Moore said that's when Tyler \nDeaton ordered him to kill Bethany Deaton, according to a criminal \ncomplaint.\u0014\n\u0014\nTyler Deaton has not been charged in his wife's death. Jackson County \nprosecutor Jean Peters Baker said Deaton was under investigation but \ndeclined to elaborate. Deaton does not have a listed phone number and \ndid not respond to requests for comment The Associated Press made \nthrough Facebook and phone and email messages to his father.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore's attorney, Melanie Morgan, declined to comment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTyler and Bethany Deaton moved to Kansas City in 2009 from Texas to \nattend a six-month internship at the non-accredited International \nHouse of Prayer University. The two had met as freshmen at \nSouthwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, in 2005, and two years \nlater Tyler started a prayer group, a former longtime member of the \ngroup told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he \nwas afraid of retaliation from Tyler Deaton.\u0014\n\u0014\nTyler Deaton was listed at one point as a division coordinator for \nIHOPU's \"friendship groups,\" but the school said that was a mistake. \nIt issued a statement distancing itself from Tyler Deaton after \nMoore, a student at IHOPU, was arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Since Bethany's death it has come to light that over five years ago, \nboth she and Mr. Moore joined an independent, close-knit, religious \ngroup in Georgetown, Texas,\" the school said in a statement. \"This \nreligious group of fewer than 20 people was led by Tyler Deaton. They \nrelocated to Kansas City over the last few years and operated under a \nveil of secrecy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIHOPU is the educational arm of International House of Prayer of \nKansas City, an evangelical Christian group focused on missions and \npreparation for the end of time.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Deatons' prayer group had at least two houses, with women living \nin one and men in another. Bethany Deaton, 27, moved into the men's \nhouse with Tyler Deaton after they married in August.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Moore told police that men in \nthe house began drugging Bethany Deaton and sexually assaulting her \nsoon after she moved in. He said she was seeing a therapist and group \nmembers became concerned she would tell the therapist about the \nassaults.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore and other men who lived in the house told police that several \ngroup members also were having sexual relations with Tyler Deaton, \nunbeknownst to his wife. One man, whose name was blacked out of the \ncriminal complaint, told police that Tyler Deaton said after Bethany \nDeaton died that he had had a dream he killed his wife by suffocating \nher.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoore told detectives Tyler Deaton instructed him to kill Bethany \nDeaton because he knew Moore had it in him to do it, and that Moore \nreported back to Tyler Deaton after she was dead. Moore told police \nthat he had placed a bag over Bethany Deaton's head and held it there \nuntil her body shook.\u0014",

    "words": "LIKE a crisis, a good scapegoat is a terrible thing to waste. Just \u0014\nnow Mitt Romney is proving a fine one for Republicans, as \u0014\nthey chew over defeat and their movement's future. Never loved \u0014\nby the rank-and-file, Mr Romney finds himself portrayed as a \u0014\ngaffe-prone plutocrat who left little mark on the party. Sitting in \u0014\nenforced retirement, harassed by photographers when he ven- \u0014\ntures out (snatched images include the former-future-president \u0014\nfilling up his car and visiting Disneyland), Mr Romney could be \u0014\nforgiven for feeling a bit aggrieved. Many attacks on him are exag- \u0014\ngerated or tinged with humbug. Besides, in large part Mr Romney \u0014\nwas the (willing) victim of a primary system that prodded candi- \u0014\ndates to take ferocious positions that were catnip to partisans, but \u0014\npoison to the general electorate. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet fair or unfair, the trashing of Mr Romney should be wel- \u0014\ncomed, because it shows signs of reflection among those now vy- \u0014\ning to lead the party. Mr Romney faces two main charges. First, he \u0014\nallowed the Republicans to be seen as a party of the rich. Second, \u0014\nhe seemed to scorn social mobility. Exhibit A for both charges is \u0014\nthe moment when Mr Romney was secretly filmed at a dinner \u0014\nwith donors asserting that 47 of Americans are Democratic vot- \u0014\ners \"no matter what\" because they are dependent on govern- \u0014\nment largesse, pay no federal income tax and are thus deaf to ar- \u0014\nguments about low taxes or personal responsibility. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent days, a string of grandees have singled out those \u0014\ncomments for attack. Mitch Daniels, the outgoing governor of In- \u0014\ndiana, calls the 47 incident a \"self-inflicted fatal blow\", com- \u0014\npounded shortly after the election when Mr Romney blamed de- \u0014\nfeat on voters greedy for government \"gifts\". Ted Cruz, a \u0014\nsenator-elect from Texas, claims (rather implausibly) that the 47 \u0014\ncomments-rather than Republican hostility to immigration-ex- \u0014\nplain Mr Romney's dire showing among Latinos. Mr Romney's \u0014\nrunning-mate, Paul Ryan, has let it be known that he \"seethed\" \u0014\nabout his boss's blunder. \u0014\n\u0014\nA defense of Mr Romney would call all this outrage overdone. \u0014\nStressing the interests of business and of wealth-creators is not \u0014\nusually a crime among conservatives. His comments were crass \u0014\nand unfair to millions of hard-working or retired Americans who \u0014\nreceive government support, but he is hardly the first Republican \u0014\nto divide America into taxpaying \"makers\" and welfare-claiming\u0014\ntakers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Economist Magazine, 12/8/12\u0014\n\u0014\nVery few Republican leaders are saying, \"We messed up. Our platform \nwas totally disavowed by the public.\" No, Mitt Romney is to blame. He \ncost us the election\u0014",

ACKERMAN\u0014\n\u0014\nRoslyn Heights, N.Y. \u0014\n\u0014\nITS my last full day as a member of the Congress, and I have it all \nunder control  I think. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm fulfilled and grateful to have been able to pay back a small \nportion for the good things that happened to me in life. To retire \nafter 35 years in elected office, with no formulated plan as yet but \ngoofing off with my grandchildren, seems right for the moment. Im \nhappy to play the rest of life by ear. \u0014\n\u0014\nI had hoped to keep my emotions in check, to put off the question of \nwho I am. Did I become the job? Without it, who will I be? The \nquestion tomorrow will be  as Jean Valjean sings in Les Misrables \n Who am I? \u0014\n\u0014\nBut my emotions have a mind of their own. This week I cast my last \nvote  to extend certain tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and \n2003 and for other purposes  of what I estimate have been more \nthan 16,000 votes cast in my career. \u0014\n\u0014\nComing from an immigrant family of Polish Jews with peasant origins, \nsheltered by decent, safe public housing (the Kingsborough Houses in \nCrown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Pomonok Houses in Flushing, Queens), \nreceiving great medical care when I needed it thanks to a generous \nsociety (and charity hospitals such as St. Giles the Cripple and St. \nLukes), educated by wonderful public schools, with a priceless, \ncost-free degree from Queens College, I have lived my entire life \nknowing that I owed somebody something. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd I fancied myself becoming somebody, and paying it forward. I \ntaught in public schools. I helped start a business. (Yes, liberals \ncan be job creators and believe in capitalism.) As a state senator \nand then a congressman, Ive had the privilege of trying to do good \nthings for people to whom I owe so much and can never fully repay. \nIve personally demanded that tyrants let their people go. Ive tried \nto feed the hungry, clothe the poor, protect the elderly and infirm, \nand defend the needy from the aggressively greedy. Ive led a blessed \nlife. What a kick for a kid from the projects. \u0014\n\u0014\nI entered government service at a time when America was becoming more \nand more diverse. Some neighborhoods in my hometown, New York City, \nwere changing so rapidly, welcoming people with so much hope and \ntalent and pride, one just had to know that so much promise could \nonly make a great nation better. \u0014\n\u0014\nI remember from my childhood a wooden jigsaw puzzle map of what were \nthen the 48 states. The puzzle wasnt complete unless one could fit \nall the pieces together to make one country, our country. But the \nHouse of Representatives has 435 separate pieces, each piece \nrepresented by a person speaking for communities with different ideas \nand approaches. On many occasions, we made it all fit together. \nCompromise was not heresy. Your opponent was not your enemy. The \ndebate was choosing between better or worse policies, not good or \nevil ideologies. Of course, between good and bad there is a void of \ngray. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months shy of 30 years in the House, I leave a chamber in which \nwe challenge one anothers legitimacy, not one anothers ideas. When \nI arrived in Washington, in 1983, Ronald Reagan was president, the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, and the Democrats were the \nmajority in the House. Today the situation is reversed: Barack Obama \nis about to be sworn in for a second term, the Democrats control the \nSenate and the Republicans are in the majority in the House. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has changed is the disappearance of the spirit of cooperation \nand shared sacrifice that, only three decades ago, could bring \npolitical opponents together. I came at a time of great hope and \nleave at a time when finding a middle path has become a much greater \nchallenge. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy last votes capped off a chapter of a storybook life I couldnt \nhave dreamed up: the fiscal compromise approved by the House, with \nthe support of nearly all Democrats and a minority of Republicans, \nstaved off what would have been devastating tax-rate increases for \nnearly all but the wealthiest American households. The background \nmusic of Claude-Michel Schnberg sounded in my mind. \u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, there was a disappointing coda, as House leaders failed to \nbring to a vote legislation to provide emergency aid to those left \ndesperate and dispirited by Hurricane Sandy. (House Republican \nleaders are now promising a vote on that legislation on Friday, when \nthe new, 113th Congress will have been seated.) I found myself hoping \nfor one day more. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs I walked out of La Guardia Airport this morning, on my last flight \nas a congressman from Reagan National Airport, I suddenly felt lost. \nI got misty. Without a musket to raise, a barricade to storm, a flag \nto wave, the question hit me in the face like the cold air: Who am \nI? \u0014\n\u0014\nBack home on Long Island, I am slowly regrouping, stunned by my own \nquestion. But wait. Slowly, slowly, from the back of my mind ... can \nyou hear it? Its the sound of distant drums! \u0014\n\u0014\nRepresentative Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat who represents parts of \nQueens and Long Island, has served in Congress since 1983. He was \nformerly a state senator.\u0014",

Following the incident, Joe \nRickey Hundley was charged with simple assault involving 33-year-old \nJessica Bennett and her 19-month-old son Jonah. During the alleged \naltercation, Hundley (apparently intoxicated) told Bennett to \"shut \nthat nigger baby up\" after young Jonah began getting restless during \nthe plane's decent for landing. As the mother looked on in horror, \nHundley then slapped Bennett's young boy across the face when he \nwouldn't quiet down.\u0014\n\u0014\nBennett told authorities that her adopted son \"started to cry due to \nthe altitude change\" as the plane prepared for landing in Atlanta, GA \non Feb. 8. The mother and son (who were on their way to a family \nfuneral) shared a seat on the flight while Hundley occupied the seat \nnext to them. When baby Jonah wouldn't quite down, Hundley allegedly \nturned to Bennett and told her to \"shut that ni##er baby up.\" A \nreport compiled by FBI Agent Daron Cheney and reported by the Smoking \nGun states that Hundley then \"turned around and slapped\" the toddler \nin the face \"with an open hand, which caused the juvenile victim to \nscream even louder.\" Bennett claims that the violent slap \"caused a \nscratch below [the child's] right eye.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHundley, the president of an aircraft parts manufacturer based in \nIdaho, claims that he never abused the baby either racially or \nphysically, although he did ask Bennett to \"quite the child.\" The man \nwas charged with simple assault in an Atlanta federal court last week \n- if convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nBennett recently told The Smoking Gun that Hundley appeared to be \nintoxicated - he allegedly \"reeked of alcohol\" and was \"stumbling \naround wasted.\" The mother insists that he consumed several double \nvodkas during the flight. In this drunk state, Hundley also allegedly \ntold Bennett that Jonah was too big to be a \"lap baby.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut according to Hundley, he only had one alcoholic beverage while on \nthe plane. He was traveling to Atlanta to visit a hospitalized \nrelative, so his emotional state was \"distraught.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut according to several other passengers on the Delta flight, \nHundley did indeed commit the crime. Todd Wooten, who was seated 12 \nrows ahead, told authorities that he \"heard derogatory language \ncoming from the rear of the aircraft.\" When he went to see what was \ngoing on, \"he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike\" the child.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral people disagree with the \"light\" sentence, and believe that \nHundley should also be charged with a hate crime.\u0014",

    "title": "MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD'S STATEMENT ON WOMEN",
    "words": "March 14, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nMuslim Brotherhoods Statement on Women Stirs Liberals Fears\u0014\n\u0014\nBy DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MAYY EL-SHEIKH    NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\nCAIRO  During its decades as an underground Islamist movement, the \nMuslim Brotherhood has long preached that Islam required women to \nobey their husbands in all matters. \u0014\n\u0014\nA woman needs to be confined within a framework that is controlled \nby the man of the house, Osama Yehia Abu Salama, a Brotherhood \nfamily expert, said of the groups general approach, speaking in a \nrecent seminar for women training to become marriage counselors. Even \nif a wife were beaten by her husband, he advised, Show her how she \nhad a role in what happened to her. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf he is to blame, Mr. Abu Salama added, she shares 30 percent or \n40 percent of the fault. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, with a leader of the Brotherhoods political arm in Egypts \npresidential palace and its members dominating Parliament, some \ndeeply patriarchal views the organization has long taught its members \nare spilling into public view. The Brotherhoods strident statements \nare reinforcing fears among many Egyptian liberals about the \npotential consequences of the groups rise to power and creating new \nawkwardness for President Mohamed Morsi as he presents himself as a \nnew kind of moderate, Western-friendly Islamist. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a statement Wednesday on a proposed United Nations declaration to \ncondemn violence against women, the Brotherhood issued a list of \nobjections, which formally laid out its views on women for the first \ntime since it came to power. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn its statement, the Brotherhood said that wives should not have the \nright to file legal complaints against their husbands for rape, and \nhusbands should not be subject to the punishments meted out for the \nrape of a stranger. \u0014\n\u0014\nA husband must have guardianship over his wife, not an equal \npartnership with her, the group declared. Daughters should not have \nthe same inheritance rights as sons. Nor should the law cancel the \nneed for a husbands consent in matters like travel, work or use of \ncontraception  a reform in traditional Islamic family law that was \nenacted under former President Hosni Mubarak and credited to his \nwife, Suzanne. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe statement appeared in many ways to reflect the Brotherhoods \nlongstanding doctrine, still discussed in classes like Mr. Abu \nSalamas and in the groups womens forums. Feminists said its \nstatement also may reflect the views of most women in Egypts \nconservative, traditionalist culture. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an interview on Thursday, Pakinam El-Sharkawy, President Morsis \npolitical adviser and Egypts representative last week at the United \nNations commission, sought to distance the Morsi administration from \nthe Brotherhoods statement. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Brotherhood, she emphasized, does not speak for the president; he \nhas resigned from the Brotherhood but remains a member of its \npolitical party. Does any statement issued by any political party or \ngroup represent the presidency? she asked. Its not the \npresidencys institution, and its not an official entity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Egyptian government, she said, is working with all its powers \nand policies to stop all forms of violence against women. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe government objected to the United Nations declaration condemning \nviolence against women, she said, only over issues like whether to \ndescribe restrictions on abortion as an act of violence against \nwomen. That offended the cultural norms in many Arab and African \ncountries, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about the statements apparent attempt to shield marital rape \nfrom legal prosecution, Ms. Sharkawy brushed off the issue as an \nirrelevant foreign concern. \u0014\n\u0014\nMarital rape? Is this a big problem that we have? she said, \nsuggesting that it might be a Western phenomenon, while sexual \nharassment in the streets was a far greater concern in Egypt. \u0014\n\u0014\nShould we import their concerns and problems and adopt them as \nours? she asked. Were talking about things that arent widely \nagreed upon, like abortion. We cant give women the freedom to have \nabortions whenever they want. \u0014\n\u0014\nDo not pick issues not pressing in Egypt, she said, and then tell me \nthat Im in a conflict with the international community. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome Egyptian feminists, though, called the statement a vindication \nof their warnings that the Brotherhood might lead Egypt in a more \nconservative and patriarchal direction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey do not believe that when domestic violence is present, the \nwomen should resort to the justice system or the legal process, said \nGhada Shahbandar of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights. It \nshould be kept at home and under the protection of the family  that \nis their claim. And there is no such thing as marital rape because a \nhusband is entitled to have sex with his wife any time that he \nwants. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the first time we have heard it said publicly on the world \nstage, she said, but this has been in their rhetoric for ages. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his seminar for prospective Islamist marriage counselors, Mr. Abu \nSalama justified the groups approach to marriage by explaining that \nIslam also required husbands to be compassionate, just as it required \nwomen to be obedient. \u0014\n\u0014\nQuoting Muhammads injunction that a man must not fall on his wife \nlike an animal, a textbook in Mr. Abu Salamas class said Islam \ninstructed men to engage in foreplay before sex and attend to their \npartners satisfaction. As for inheritance, Islamic scholars have \nargued that a son should have a greater share, but also an obligation \nto look after the financial well-being of a sister. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Mr. Abu Salam also argued that husbands should keep their wives \nunder tight control. Its the nature of the weak to overstep the \nrequired framework if she is given the space and the freedom, like \nchildren, he said in the seminar. Most of the women nodded in \nagreement. \u0014\n\u0014\nClosing its statement on the proposed United Nations declaration, the \nBrotherhood appeared to go even further. The provisions discussed are \ndestructive tools meant to undermine the family as an important \ninstitution, the statement concluded, and would drag society back \nto pre-Islamic ignorance.\u0014",

She had a little pink bow where someday she was \ngoing to have hair and anytime anybody walked by, she greeted them \nwith, 'Dada, Dada.' Jeanette concluded, 'I think I know who is going \nto be there waiting when this plane lands, Dada.' Meanwhile the baby \nwas the magnet of everyone's attention on the plane. The mom had a \nbaby bottle filled with orange juice. It turned out to be a rough \nflight and when the baby got fussy, the mom would pacify her with the \nbottle of orange juice. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The flight became even more turbulent. Seat belts were buckled and \nflight attendants had to take their seats. Soon all the fruit juice \nthat had gone down the baby, came back up until it seemed there was \nmore up than there was in her. The rest of the passengers were not in \ngood condition, Jeanette said. As the plane was pitching back and \nforth, Jeanette kept reaching into her purse and handing tissues to \nthe mom. Finally the plane landed and instantly the baby was fine and \nagain saying, 'Dada, Dada.' Jeanette said she looked out the window \nand there he was. It had to be hima young man in white slacks, white \nshirt, carrying white flowers wrapped in green paper. Jeanette \nthought, 'This ought to be interesting.

Matthew had just accepted the \npresidency of newly formed Indiana Asbury University in Greencastle, \nIndiana (now De Pauw University).\u0014\n\u0014\nEyes sparkling with fun, Matthew replied, \"That is a difficulty which \ntime will help to cure.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was hard to believe that there was once a time when Matthew was so \nshy that he could not speak up or look a girl in the eye. It was \nobedience to Christ that changed him.\u0014\n\u0014\nRaised in frontier Ohio, he worked incredibly hard not only to help \nhis widowed mother and the uncle who raised him, but to educate \nhimself. When he went to school, he hoped to find teachers who would \ntake him by the hand and lead him to knowledge. He was disappointed. \nTeaching was just a job for most of them. However, he learned what he \ncould by snatching spare moments for study and apprenticed himself to \na physician.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough reared in a Christian home, he had never given his heart to \nChrist. When he did, it was at a camp meeting, but without the usual \nemotional experience. He began to feel an inward pressure to preach. \nGiven his shyness, that seemed impossible. He had his mother to care \nfor. However, he responded when asked to speak at religious meetings \nand gradually gained more confidence. He took his medical license.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut he had only practiced medicine eight months when he closed up \nshop. Charles Elliott, a Methodist educator, had asked him to become \na circuit rider. Matthew spoke to his mother, afraid of her reaction. \n\"My Son, I have been looking for this hour since you were born.\" She \nhad prayed daily that Matthew would become a preacher, but had said \nnothing, wanting the Spirit of God to lead him. Matthew reported to \nElliott that he was available. Elliott arranged for Matthew to ride a \nroute near home so he could still care for his mother. On this day, \nApril 5, 1834, Matthew Simpson saddled his horse and rode out on his \nfirst circuit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe shy man became a master educator, the most influential Methodist \nof the day and a powerful speaker who never used notes. Audiences \nwept, clapped and leapt to their feet during his sermons. He was \nasked to repeat favorite messages over and over again. One of them \nwas on the United States flag. Another famous sermon emphasized \nvictorious faith. He made people think as he was thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a typical message, he noted: \"If you live for fame, men may turn \nagainst you. If you live for pleasure, your ability to enjoy it may \npass away and your senses grow dim...If you live for your children, \nthey may be smitten down and leave you desolate, or, what is far \nworse, they may desert you and leave you worse than childless in a \ncold and unfeeling world.

    "words": "Mumford Musician Wary of Christian Baggage\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: John Pierce\u0014\nPosted: Friday, April 19, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nMarcus Mumford, front man for the popular musical act, Mumford and \nSons, has caused a stir among evangelical Christians. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked by Rolling Stone magazine if he considers himself to be a \nChristian, Mumford said: \"I don't really like that word. It comes \nwith so much baggage.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe added: \"So, no, I wouldn't call myself a Christian. I think the \nword just conjures up all these religious images that I don't really \nlike.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMumford went on to say that he holds very personal views about Jesus \nbut has \"separated [himself] from the culture of Christianity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not surprising that many Christians responded with all kinds of \nwords of condemnation about him denying Christ. However, Mumford said \nhe separated himself from \"the culture of Christianity,\" not from \nJesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is that evangelical culture he refers to that wants to own \ncelebrities and to define them  whereby every move the person makes \nand every word that is sung is parsed for its orthodoxy.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo thanks, said Mumford. He'd rather not carry that baggage.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile continuing to embrace the term Christian myself, I understand \nthe young musician's hesitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven without the bright spotlight, one can spend a lot of time trying \nto escape the well-earned reputation of U.S. evangelical Christians \nas narrow-minded, judgmental and cocksure about how God views \neverything from Middle East politics to science textbooks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd if Mumford thinks the title \"Christian\" brings baggage, he should \ntry being a Baptist.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of us spend half our lives explaining that we have less in \ncommon with Robert Jeffress and Bob Jones than more than half of the \nworld's population  and that our efforts to faithfully follow Jesus \nhave no connections to what they hear on Fox News and talk radio.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, a funny dynamic exists within fundamentalist \nChristianity, especially those of the Southern Baptist variety.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn one hand, they will cast aside fellow Baptists and other \nChristians over a minor difference in biblical interpretation  like \nwhether women can serve in certain leadership roles.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, on the other hand, they will jump full force at any chance to \nembrace a celebrity who gives a hint of sharing their religious \nand/or political ideologies, with no regard for the person's \nChristian doctrine or personal history.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch is the case with sports figures like Tim Tebow (although he got \nsideways with some fundamentalists in Dallas recently), actors like \nChuck Norris (who spout favored right-wing political rhetoric) and, \nof course, the funny, praying \"Duck Dynasty\" guys who have church \npeople dressing in camouflage and quacking at every opportunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is as if, for some Christians who otherwise condemn modern culture \nat every turn, there is an underlying need for their faith to be \nvalidated by the rich and famous.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut these same people will drop you like a rock star if you  like \nMarcus Mumford  draw outside their lines of acceptance.\u0014\n\u0014\nGood for Marcus  keep pursuing Jesus and giving us good music with a \nbanjo line.\u0014\n\u0014\nOther Christians may cast aside young Mr. Mumford, who was raised in \na Christian family and whose lyrics often affirm the great themes of \nChristianity, but I will wait. I will wait.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn D. Pierce is executive editor of Baptists Today.\u0014",

    "words": "Mom missing for 11 years thought the family was 'better off \nwithout me'\u0014\n                          By Lauren Ina TODAY   5/17/13\u0014\n\u0014\nOn February 8, 2002, life's problems had become too big for Brenda \nHeist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pennsylvania mother of two, who was getting a divorce and facing \nfinancial uncertainty, dropped off her children, daughter Morgan, 8 \nand son Lee, 12, at school and went to a park, where she began to \ncry. She was approached by some homeless people who asked if she was \nall right, and when they said they were leaving for Florida, she \nasked to go with them.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe disappeared for the next 11 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe left with $20 in her pocket and the clothing on her back and \nthat was it, Dr. Phil McGraw told TODAY on Friday in a network \nexclusive. She didn't have makeup, she didn't have a packed bag, a \ncredit card. She had 20 bucks and an empty purse, and off she went.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeist, who reappeared two weeks ago after being gone for more than a \ndecade, spoke to McGraw in an interview that will air on the Dr. Phil \nshow on Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I just kept saying to myself, 'They're better off without me,'\" she \ntold him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeist's family didn't know what to think, and her former husband, who \nwas initially believed to be a suspect in her disappearance, believed \nshe might have been carjacked. After she had been missing for seven \nyears, Heist was declared legally dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom a professional standpoint I'm looking for the answer to that \nquestion: Who does this?\" McGraw told TODAY. When I first sat down \nwith her, she was in complete and utter meltdown. I mean full body \ntremors, shaking, and not because of the interview but because she \nwas getting ready to have to come to grips with what she had done.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeist, now 54, assumed a new identity while living in Florida. At \ntimes she was homeless, though she also held odd jobs and had new \nrelationships. But her real identity was never far from the surface.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen did you stop crying and start living? McGraw asked Heist.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know if Ive ever stopped crying and started living, to be \nhonest with you, she replied.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeist turned herself in to police and is currently in the Santa Rosa \nCounty jail being held on outstanding warrants. McGraw took a team of \ntherapists with him to help understand why she would take such \ndrastic measures with her life, and her familys future.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat's going on here, you have to look way back in the situation, \nhe said. This is a woman that I believe has serious attachment \ndisorder. Serious issues with regard to forming the normal bonds and \nattachments that people would normally do.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow else can you leave a child, eight and 12, and never call within \n11 years? he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeist has not reunited with her family, and daughter Morgan wants \nnothing to do with her. Its not that I hate her, Morgan Heist told \nNBC affiliate WCAU. I just think she doesnt deserve to be in my \nlife at this point.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I would like their forgiveness,\" Heist tearfully told McGraw of her \nfamily, \"but I'm going to have a hard time forgiving myself for what \nI've done.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGraw said that one thing Heist admitted during their interview \nsurprised him.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe told me something very insightful I believe  very telling, he \nsaid. She is really questioning if she did the right thing by coming \nback at all. Because now she fears burdening her family, and creating \nall this angst and opening wounds with her children.\u0014",

    "title": "MILTON'S TEN POUND EPIC",
    "words": "Milton's Ten Pound Epic\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThis date is preeminent in literature for one transaction. On this \nday, April 27, 1667, Milton sold the most magnificent epic in the \nEnglish language, conveying the rights for Paradise Lost to Samuel \nSimmons.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tAlthough the author was well-known, the sale roused little notice \nand the book went for a pittance, nor was there any urgency to get it \nthrough the press. Paradise Lost was not be published until August \n20th. Despite this inauspicious start, it would become ranked by many \nnext to the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe blind poet's lofty narrative required twelve books to tell. He \ndealt with the highest dramatic events known to us: the rebellion of \nSatan and the fall of man, both of which he accepted as literal \nfacts. He shows Adam and Eve naive of evil and delighted with the \ngarden of Eden; their sin and consequent woe; and God's promise of \neventual restoration of all things through Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Milton presented his epic in blank verse, knowing that \nrhymes would make it trite and weary the ear in that vast span of \nwords. The majesty of iambic pentameter would best suit his \nconception. Theological truths which would not easily bear rhyme \nwould work well with an unobtrusive alliteration. For example, God \nsays of Adam and Eve:\u0014\n\u0014\n\". . .they themselves decreed\u0014\ntheir own revolt, not I. If I foreknew,\u0014\nForeknowledge had no influence on their fault.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n          It is remarked that Milton achieved his finest effects \ndepicting the rebel Satan. A Puritan, Milton participated in the \nrevolt against Charles I. No doubt this helped him frame the \nsentiment he ascribed to Satan: \"Better to reign in Hell than serve \nin Heav'n.\" Try as he will to pervert God's purpose, however, Satan \nis ultimately thwarted; evil is transformed by God into the means for \ngood.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who seeks to lessen thee,\u0014\nagainst his purpose serves\u0014\nTo manifest the more thy might: his evil\u0014\nThou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n         To write such lines, Milton must have meditated long on \nJoseph's words to the very brothers who had sold him into slavery: \n\"You intended it for evil, but God meant it for good, for the saving \nof many lives.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n         This work of unparalleled genius earned Milton  5 with \npromise of 5 more at publication and 5 for each reprinting. \nAccording to the agreement entered that April day the number of \ncopies to be printed with each impression was limited. \"[The] \nimpression shall be accounted to be ended when thirteen hundred books \nof the said whole copy, or manuscript imprinted shall be sold or \nretailed off to particular reading customers. . .\" Millions have sold \nsince.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBagehot, Walter. \"John Milton.\" Literary Studies.

    "title": "MAKING REPUTATION EQUAL TO CHARACTER",
    "words": "Glorifying: Making Reputation Equal to Character\u0014\nby W. Lamar Massingill\u0014\n\u0014\nWe humans are a species who believe that reputation in life is many \ntimes more important than anything else. We will go to great lengths \nin order to preserve our reputation. We do not have to look beyond \nthe famous people who have recently fallen into various scandals to \nknow that. They have confessed, held press conferences, spoken to the \npublic, made promises to do better, and invoked the Fifth Amendment \n-- all in an attempt to do one thing: preserve their reputations. We \nhave seen example after example of the lengths human beings will go \nto in order to preserve their reputations. And this is a uniquely \nhuman action. All of us do this, not just the rich and famous. No \ndoubt there have been times when we participated in attempts to \npreserve our own reputation when an individual or group has \"read\" us \nwrong. All this is to say that we value reputation. It is something \nthat matters in human experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nI would be quick to note, however, that reputation is not the same \nthing as character. They are worlds apart. More times than not, we \nknow the reputation of people without really knowing their character. \nI know you have been in conversations before when the discussion \nturned to an individual and someone mentioned that well-worn line, \n\"Well, he certainly has a reputation.\" Normally that phrase begins \nall kinds of negative talk that may or may not be true. Sometimes the \n\"reputation\" statement causes a very positive conversation about the \ngreat qualities of an individual. But in my experience, most of the \nconversations that begin with that phrase are negative.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth be told, we all have a reputation -- but reputations may or may \nnot be true. A reputation is something that appears to be true, but \ncannot really be proven. For example, I remember a Coca-Cola \ncommercial decades ago in which the famous Pittsburgh Steelers \ndefensive lineman \"Mean\" Joe Greene received a Coke from a little boy \nafter a rather difficult game. At first he did not appear grateful -- \nbut as the young boy was leaving, Mean Joe Greene says \"Hey kid!\" and \ntosses the boy his jersey as a gesture of appreciation for the \nice-cold drink he had received. That commercial certainly projected a \nreputation -- namely, that Mean Joe Greene loves kids. Then you \nwonder how he got the nickname \"mean,\" and one begins to think about \nwhether this is actually true or not. From the looks of the \ncommercial it appeared to be true, but in actuality this trait may or \nmay not be true.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm sure you, like me, have heard \"reputations\" about yourself that \nreally did not reflect the \"real you.\" When these reputations happen \nto be the worst of untruths it really hurts, because you know the \nreputation doesn't reflect your character. You desire with all your \nheart for somebody to come along and vindicate you and say to others \nthat what appears to be actually isn't. If such a person comes along \nand does this for you, then that person has \"glorified\" you. That is, \nhe has made your reputation equal to your character.\u0014\n\u0014\nW. Lamar Massingill, a former Southern Baptist pastor, is now the \nminister at Richton United Methodist Church in Richton, Mississippi.\u0014",

    "words": "Report: More seniors are living in poverty\u0014\nBy: Kathryn Smith\u0014\nMay 21, 2013 \u0014\n\u0014\nAn alternative census estimate shows that more of Americas seniors \nthan originally thought are living in poverty  and that means the \npoverty rate could spike under certain Medicare reforms, a new \nanalysis finds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe estimate, which takes into account health spending and regional \ncost of living, finds 1 in 7 seniors lives in poverty. It was \npreviously thought that just 1 in 10 did.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday breaks this \npoverty data down for seniors state by state  and notes that under \nsome proposals to reform Medicare, these poverty levels would keep \nclimbing.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the supplemental poverty measure, which deducts health \nspending from income, poverty rates could increase if beneficiaries \nwere required to pay higher cost sharing or premiums for Medicare, \nthe analysis states.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe supplemental poverty measure is the alternative estimate released \nby the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe supplemental measure differs from the bureaus official estimate \nin a number of key ways: It factors in out-of-pocket health spending, \nalong with taxes and government benefits, and looks at poverty \nstandards within the regional cost of living.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe supplemental measure suggests that a greater share of seniors \nmay already be struggling financially than is conveyed by the \nofficial measure, Kaisers analysis states.\u0014\n\u0014\nKaiser finds the supplemental measures poverty rates for those 65 \nand older are higher in every state than the rates in the official \nestimate.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in 12 states  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, \nMassachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, \nNevada, Wisconsin and Wyoming  the supplemental poverty measure for \nseniors is twice as high as the official estimate. In New Hampshire, \nthe percentage of seniors in poverty is three times as high under the \nsupplemental measure.\u0014\n\u0014\nKaisers analysis showed the supplemental measure also finds poverty \nhits seniors hardest in certain areas. In Washington, D.C., it shows \n1 in 4 seniors lives in poverty. In California, 1 in 5 lives in \npoverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Kaiser brief says its meant to provide context for the many \nspending proposals being tossed around  particularly those that \nfocus on shifting costs in Medicare and paring down Social Security \nbenefits.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also notes that adopting chained CPI, which slows the growth of \nSocial Security benefits, would most likely make for higher poverty \nrates for older seniors across both census measures.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2013 POLITICO LLC\u0014",

That is when the Franciscan \nfriar, Maximilian Kolbe, lifted up his arm to receive a lethal \ninjection of carbolic acid.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks earlier, a prisoner had escaped from Auschwitz. The camp's \nrule was that if one prisoner escaped, ten died in his place. All day \nthe weak and underfed men from the escaped prisoner's block were made \nto stand in the sun without food and water. When the man was not \nfound, a prison guard called out the names of ten men who were to die \nin his place.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sergeant Francis Gajowniczek heard his name called, he cried \nout, \"Have mercy! I have a wife and children.\" But mercy was a \ncommodity in short supply in Nazi death camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nInto the gap stepped Maximilian Kolbe. He moved forward silently. \nAsked what he wanted, he replied, \"I am a Catholic priest from \nPoland; I would like to take his place, because he has a wife and \nchildren.\" Hesitating a moment in face of this noble gesture, \nCommandant Fritsch accepted the replacement. Maximilian and nine \nothers were sent to starve to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring those two weeks, Maximilian led the victims in hymns and \nprayer. When he became too weak to speak aloud, he whispered his \nprayers. After two weeks, only four of the ten were still alive. \nMaximilian alone was completely conscious. The guards needed the \nspace for more prisoners and decided to hasten the deaths with lethal \ndoses of carbolic acid. Maximilian was last. Weak though he was, he \nraised his arm to receive the injection, triumphantly embracing \nmartyrdom. We know some of these details, because the guard who kept \nthe records was so impressed during Maximilian's two-week ordeal that \nhe logged more detail than was required.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch martyrs do not just happen by chance. Maximilian was born as \nRaymond Kolbe. Although a wild boy as a youth, he was moved by the \nprayers and pleas of his mother. One day when he was twelve, as he \nprayed before a statue of Mary he saw her in a vision; she offered \nhim two crowns: a white one for purity and red for martyrdom. Told to \nchoose between them, he asked for both. He became a Franciscan friar \nand took the name Maximilian.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis life was devoted to Mary. He founded an order which used the \nmeans of mass communication, including radio and a widely circulated \nnewspaper and magazine, to spread truth. \"No one in the world can \nchange Truth,\" he said. \"What we can do and should do is to seek \ntruth and to serve it when we have found it. The real conflict is the \ninner conflict. Beyond armies of occupation and the hecatombs of \nextermination camps, there are two irreconcilable enemies in the \ndepth of every soul: good and evil, sin and love. And what use are \nthe victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our \ninnermost personal selves?\" Indifference toward the things of God was \nthe deadliest enemy of any soul. He aimed to defeat this.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn prison, he often went without food so others might have more and \ninsisted on being the last in his unit to receive medical treatment. \nHis attitude was expressed in his words, \"For Jesus Christ I am \nprepared to suffer still more.\" Pope John Paul II canonized \nMaximilian in 1982, saying, \"He bore witness to Christ and to love.\"\u0014",

Felicity tells Fox that she is pregnant, and she pleads with \nhim to find a safer job once they escape.

Every day we eat 8,500 milligrams of saltthat's four \nwhopping teaspoons of salt. In his book Salt Sugar Fat, Michael Moss \nshows that during the past two decades some of America's largest food \nproducers carefully studied how to \"help\" us crave all this junk \nfood. For example, some of the food industries biggest \nnames--including Cambell Soup, General Foods, Kraft, PepsiCo, and \nCadbury--hired \"crave consultants\" like the scientist Dr. Howard \nMoskowitz to help them determine our \"bliss points,\" the point where \nfood compainies can \"optimize\" our cravings.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr as another example, Frito-Lay, makers of Lay's potato chips and \nthe 21 varieties of Cheetos, operated a research complex near Dallas \nthat employed nearly 500 chemists, psychologists, and technicians and \nspent up to $30 million a year to find the bliss point for their junk \nfoods. One food scientist called Cheetos \"one of the most marvelously \nconstructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.\" Cheetos \nhas what's called \"vanishing caloric density.\" In other words because \nit melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there's no calories in \nit, and you think you can just keep eating forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly, many of the former executives who Moss interviewed for \nhis book avoid the foods they tried to get us to eat. Howard \nMoskowitz doesn't drink Pepsi products because he claims \"[soda's] \nnot good for your teeth.\" A Frito-Lay executive admitted to Moss that \nhe avoids most processed foodslike Cheetos. Moss concluded, \"Like \nother former food company executives I met, [this Frito-Lay \nexecutive] overhauled his diet to avoid the very foods he once worked \nso hard to perfect.\"\u0014",

    "words": "October 1, 2013  New York Times \u0014\n\u0014\nPoll Shows Major Shift in Identity of U.S. Jews\u0014\n\u0014\nBy LAURIE GOODSTEIN\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first major survey of American Jews in more than 10 years finds a \nsignificant rise in those who are not religious, marry outside the \nfaith and are not raising their children Jewish  resulting in rapid \nassimilation that is sweeping through every branch of Judaism except \nthe Orthodox. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe intermarriage rate, a bellwether statistic, has reached a high of \n58 percent for all Jews, and 71 percent for non-Orthodox Jews  a \nhuge change from before 1970 when only 17 percent of Jews married \noutside the faith. Two-thirds of Jews do not belong to a synagogue, \none-fourth do not believe in God and one-third had a Christmas tree \nin their home last year. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts a very grim portrait of the health of the American Jewish \npopulation in terms of their Jewish identification, said Jack \nWertheimer, a professor of American Jewish history at the Jewish \nTheological Seminary, in New York. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey, by the Pew Research Centers Religion & Public Life \nProject, found that despite the declines in religious identity and \nparticipation, American Jews say they are proud to be Jewish and have \na strong sense of belonging to the Jewish people. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile 69 percent say they feel an emotional attachment to Israel, and \n40 percent believe that the land that is now Israel was given to the \nJewish people by God, only 17 percent think that the continued \nbuilding of settlements in the West Bank is helpful to Israels \nsecurity. \u0014\n\u0014\nJews make up 2.2 percent of the American population, a percentage \nthat has held steady for the past two decades. The survey estimates \nthere are 5.3 million Jewish adults as well as 1.3 million children \nbeing raised at least partly Jewish. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey uses a wide definition of who is a Jew, a much-debated \ntopic. The researchers included the 22 percent of Jews who describe \nthemselves as having no religion, but who identify as Jewish \nbecause they have a Jewish parent or were raised Jewish, and feel \nJewish by culture or ethnicity. \u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the percentage of Jews of no religion has grown with each \nsuccessive generation, peaking with the millennials (those born after \n1980), of whom 32 percent say they have no religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts very stark, Alan Cooperman, deputy director of the Pew \nreligion project, said in an interview. Older Jews are Jews by \nreligion. Younger Jews are Jews of no religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe trend toward secularism is also happening in the American \npopulation in general, with increasing proportions of each generation \nclaiming no religious affiliation. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jews without religion tend not to raise their children Jewish, so \nthis secular trend has serious consequences for what Jewish leaders \ncall Jewish continuity. Of the Jews of no religion who have \nchildren at home, two-thirds are not raising their children Jewish in \nany way. This is in contrast to the Jews with religion, of whom 93 \npercent said they are raising their children to have a Jewish \nidentity. \u0014\n\u0014\nReform Judaism remains the largest American Jewish movement, at 35 \npercent. Conservative Jews are 18 percent, Orthodox 10 percent, and \ngroups such as Reconstructionist and Jewish Renewal make up 6 percent \ncombined. Thirty percent of Jews do not identify with any \ndenomination.\u0014",

    "words": "We saw the lightning and that was the guns; and then we heard the \nthunder and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling \nand that was the blood falling; and when we came to get in the crops, \nit was dead men that we reaped. Harriet Tubman\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn five years, Jesmyn Ward lost five young men in her lifeto drugs, \naccidents, suicide, and the bad luck that can follow people who live \nin poverty, particularly black men. Dealing with these losses, one \nafter another, made Jesmyn ask the question: Why? And as she began to \nwrite about the experience of living through all the dying, she \nrealized the truthand it took her breath away. Her brother and her \nfriends all died because of who they were and where they were from, \nbecause they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle \nthat fostered drug addiction and the dissolution of family and \nrelationships. Jesmyn says the answer was so obvious she felt stupid \nfor not seeing it. But it nagged at her until she knew she had to \nwrite about her community, to write their stories and her own. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesmyn grew up in poverty in rural Mississippi. She writes powerfully \nabout the pressures this brings, on the men who can do no right and \nthe women who stand in for family in a society where the men are \noften absent. She bravely tells her story, revisiting the agonizing \nlosses of her only brother and her friends. As the sole member of her \nfamily to leave home and pursue higher education, she writes about \nthis parallel American universe with the objectivity distance \nprovides and the intimacy of utter familiarity. A brutal world \nrendered beautifully, Jesmyn Wards memoir will sit comfortably \nalongside Edwidge Danticats Brother, I'm Dying, Tobias Wolff's This \nBoys Life, and Maya Angelous I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn four years, five young men dear to Ward died of various causes, \nfrom drug overdose to accident to suicide, but the underlying cause \nof their deaths was a self-destructive spiral born of hopelessness. \nSurrounded by so much death and sorrow, Ward closely examined the \nheartbreakingly relentless deaths of her young relatives and friends \ngrowing up in the small town of DeLisle, Mississippi, with few job \nprospects and little to engage their time and talents other than \nselling and using drugs and alcohol. She herself had partially \nescaped, going on to college in Michigan and California; but the pull \nof close family ties and a deep appreciation of southern culture \nlured her back each summer. Ward, author of Salvage the Bones (2011), \nlovingly profiles each of those she lost, including a brother, a \ncousin, and close friends, and their tragic ends as she weaves her \nfamily history and details her own difficulties of breaking away from \nhome and the desperate need to do so.

FITZSIMMONS     New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than two decades after the girl who would come to be known as \nBaby Hope was found dead in a cooler along a New York highway, a law \nenforcement official said on Monday that her mother had been \nidentified. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a push by the police this summer to find new information about \nthe case, they received a tip from a woman who thought she might know \nthe sister of Baby Hope, said the official, who was familiar with the \ninvestigation. Using the information the woman provided, the police \ninterviewed several people and eventually confirmed the mothers \nidentity through scientific evidence, the official said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe police declined to release the mothers name while the case \nremains a murder investigation. No one has been charged. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls decomposing body was found in Washington Heights on the \nmorning of July 23, 1991, in a cooler in a wooded area near the \nDyckman Street exit off the Henry Hudson Parkway. The girl, estimated \nto be 3 to 5 years old, appeared to be malnourished, and tests showed \nthat she had been sexually abused. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe authorities have long wondered why her parents or relatives never \nreported that she was missing. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis summer, the police returned to the area where she was found to \nask residents for help in solving the case. They put up posters and \nhanded out fliers with police sketches of how the girl might have \nlooked at the time of her death. They offered a $12,000 reward for \nany information leading to an arrest or a conviction. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe campaign appears to have worked. The tip was received at a Crime \nStoppers phone line in July. \u0014\n\u0014\nA woman who lives in New York reported that she had spoken to a woman \nwho said she had a sister who had been killed, the law enforcement \nofficial said. The woman who provided the tip said she had seen the \nrecent news coverage about the case and suggested it was possible \nthat this woman was Baby Hopes sister. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2011, the medical examiners office obtained a complete DNA \nprofile for Baby Hope after exhuming her body from St. Raymonds \nCemetery in the Bronx, where she had been buried. But there were no \nmatches when they tested it against DNA databases of convicted felons \nor active missing person cases. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe case captured the attention of the city in the summer of 1991 \nbecause of the horrific details of the girls condition; she was \nfound doubled-over in the cooler, tied up and wrapped in a plastic \nbag.\u0014",

Her husband, 66-year-old Wayne Sperling, is in \ncustody and sat with defendants in other cases behind a glass \nbarrier. He was dressed in a yellow jail uniform.\u0014\n\u0014\nBailey and Sperling did not enter pleas. However, both have \npreviously pleaded guilty to child abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice said officers had been called in April 2012 after children \nwere seen hanging from a window at the couple's apartment building. \nOfficers reported there was food in the home and children appeared \nwell-fed. The home was \"messy and crowded,\" according to a police \nreport.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice followed up after learning Bailey and Sperling had both \npleaded guilty to one count of child abuse in 2009.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen officers interviewed Bailey last year, she told police that she \nhad lost parental rights to three of her children in 2009 but had \nbeen able to get one back.\u0014\n\u0014\nSperling was cited then with a municipal charge for allowing the \nchildren to hang out the window.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe latest charges came after an investigation that began on Sept. \n29, when Bailey took her youngest son to St. Joseph's Children's \nHospital for a cut on his forehead that she said happened after a \nfall.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn emergency room doctor informed authorities that the child was \nunwashed and smelled like cigarette smoke, prompting a welfare check \nby a Denver Human Services case worker. Bruising behind the child's \nright ear appeared consistent with pinching, the doctor said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenver police Officer N. Rocco-McKeel accompanied the case worker to \nthe apartment and reported finding five cats and feces on the floor \nthroughout the apartment and the \"strong odor of a decomposing \nanimal.\" The officer noted that flies covered every surface in one \nroom and that he couldn't determine any age or developmental \ndifferences between the three oldest children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother said she did not think the apartment was unsafe and denied \nthe boys had any developmental delays. She said she had been living \nalone in a separate unit of the building for the past two months, but \nstill saw the children every day except Saturday and Sunday, when she \nworked.\u0014\n\u0014\nSperling, meanwhile, told investigators he was unemployed and has \nbeen the boys' primary guardian. He said he intended to begin \nhome-schooling.\u0014",

We were \nfriends for ten years untiluntil we decided no longer wanted to be \njust friends. :) I strongly recommend that best friends fall in love. \nGood times will be had by all.\u0014\n\u0014\nNevertheless, falling in love with my best friend did not prevent me \nfrom having certain fears and anxieties about getting married. The \nnearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was \nfilled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right \nchoice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, one fateful night, I shared these thoughts and concerns with my \ndad.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps each of us have moments in our lives when it feels like time \nslows down or the air becomes still and everything around us seems to \ndraw in, marking that moment as one we will never forget.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy dad giving his response to my concerns was such a moment for me. \nWith a knowing smile he said, Seth, youre being totally selfish. So \nIm going to make this really simple: marriage isnt for you. You \ndont marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else \nhappy. More than that, your marriage isnt for yourself, youre \nmarrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that \nnonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you \nraise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isnt for \nyou. Its not about you. Marriage is about the person you married.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in that very moment that I knew that Kim was the right person \nto marry. I realized that I wanted to make her happy; to see her \nsmile every day, to make her laugh every day. I wanted to be a part \nof her family, and my family wanted her to be a part of ours. And \nthinking back on all the times I had seen her play with my nieces, I \nknew that she was the one with whom I wanted to build our own family.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy fathers advice was both shocking and revelatory. It went against \nthe grain of todays Walmart philosophy, which is if it doesnt \nmake you happy, you can take it back and get a new one.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. Its about \nthe person you lovetheir wants, their needs, their hopes, and their \ndreams. Selfishness demands, Whats in it for me?, while Love asks, \nWhat can I give?\u0014\n\u0014\nSome time ago, my wife showed me what it means to love selflessly. \nFor many months, my heart had been hardening with a mixture of fear \nand resentment. Then, after the pressure had built up to where \nneither of us could stand it, emotions erupted. I was callous. I was \nselfish.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut instead of matching my selfishness, Kim did something beyond \nwonderfulshe showed an outpouring of love. Laying aside all of the \npain and aguish I had caused her, she lovingly took me in her arms \nand soothed my soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage is about family.\u0014\n\u0014\nI realized that I had forgotten my dads advice. While Kims side of \nthe marriage had been to love me, my side of the marriage had become \nall about me. This awful realization brought me to tears, and I \npromised my wife that I would try to be better.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo all who are reading this articlemarried, almost married, single, \nor even the sworn bachelor or bacheloretteI want you to know that \nmarriage isnt for you. No true relationship of love is for you. Love \nis about the person you love.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd, paradoxically, the more you truly love that person, the more \nlove you receive. And not just from your significant other, but from \ntheir friends and their family and thousands of others you never \nwould have met had your love remained self-centered.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruly, love and marriage isnt for you.

December 2, \n2013, The Washington Post\u0014\n\u0014\nNov. 24, 2013, David Musselman, a bishop for The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints in Taylorsville, Utah, had makeup artist \nTara Starling transform him to appear battered and homeless.

By \nundertaking this sting operation, which, according to the report, \ninvolved the assistance of a Salt Lake City makeup artist and a wig \nthat he dramatically removed during services, Bishop Musselman here \ndemonstratedperhaps inadvertentlyexactly what religion is.

    "words": "The Two Covenants: The Transition Now the God of peace, who brought \nagain from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of \nthe everlasting covenant, even our Lord Jesus, make you perfect in \nevery good thing to do His will, working in us that which is \nwell-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ.Heb. 13:20, 21.\u0014\n\u0014\n THE transition from the Old Covenant to the New was not slow or \ngradual, but by a tremendous crisis. Nothing less than the death of \nChrist was the close of the Old. Nothing less than His resurrection \nfrom the dead, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, the \nopening of the New. The path of preparation that led up to the crisis \nwas long and slow; the rending of the veil, that symbolised the end \nof the old worship, was the work of a moment. By a death, once for \nall, Christs work, as fulfiller of law and prophets, as the end of \nthe law, was for ever finished. By a resurrection in the power of an \nendless life, the Covenant of Life was ushered in. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese events have an infinite significance, as revealing the \ncharacter of the Covenants they are related to. The death of Christ \nshows the true nature of the Old Covenant. It is elsewhere called a \nministration of death (2 Cor. 3:7). It brought forth nothing but \ndeath. It ended in death; only by death could the life that had been \nlived under it be brought to an end. The New was to be a Covenant of \nLife; it had its birth in the omnipotent resurrection power that \nbrought Christ from the dead; its one mark and blessing is, that all \nit gives comes, not only as a promise, but as an experience, in the \npower of an endless life. The Death reveals the utter inefficacy and \ninsufficiency of the Old; the Life brings nigh and imparts to us for \never all that the New has to offer. An insight into the completeness \nof the transition, as seen in Christ, prepares us for apprehending \nthe reality of the change in our life, when, like as Christ was \nraised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also walk in \nnewness of life. The complete difference between the life in the Old \nand the New is remarkably illustrated by a previous passage in the \nEpistle (Heb. 9:16).\u0014",

    "title": "MENTAL ILLNESS, THE DREADED FAMILY HEIRLOOM",
    "words": "Mental Illness, the Dreaded Family Heirloom\u0014\n\u0014\n'The Painted Table' offers a realistic picture of a familys struggle \nwith schizophrenia. \u0014\n\u0014\nReview by Amy Simpson     1/28/2014  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nFamilies affected by serious mental illness, like my own, have many \nthings in common: secrecy, confusion, alienation, exhaustion, fear, \neven terror; anger, frustration, loneliness, longing to be \"normal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSadly, one of them is a common, and erroneous, conviction that we are \nalone. Because we lack a public and productive forum for sharing our \nstories, we miss out on a sense of normalization and connection to \neach other. Our isolation reinforces the importance of silence, which \nin turn reinforces stigma, which keeps us silent.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps nowhere has that silence rung louder than in much of the \nchurch, where we have allowed fear and misinformation about mental \nillness to rule. Tragically, this community with the greatest \npotential for loving and healing such families instead often deepens \ntheir sense of alienation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThings are beginning to change, though, as people share their stories \nand come to understand just how common mental illness is. With just \nover 25 percent of American adults experiencing a diagnosable mental \ndisorder each year, mental illness may be among the most common of \nhealth problems.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, it is about equal to the total percentage of people \ndiagnosed with cancer each year, those living with heart disease, \npeople infected with HIV and AIDS, and those afflicted with \ndiabetescombined. And \"serious\" mental illnessdisorders like \nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, \nobsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and \nborderline personality disorderaffects six percent of American \nadults, almost 12 million people. Silence isn't helping anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamilies affected by mental illness need to tell their stories, not \nonly for our own sake but also for the sake of others, who will \ndiscover in our words that they are not alone. I was eager to read \nThe Painted Table, a new book by debut novelist Suzanne Field. The \nPainted Table tells a fictional story based on her own lifea story \nthat rings true for many whose families were shaped by a loved one's \nmental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nField's book honors realityno sensationalized or romanticized \npictures of mental illness here. I recognized my own family in this \nstory, sometimes in spooky parallels: the family's Scandinavian \nheritage, the slow rise of psychosis in a mother who eventually would \nbe diagnosed with schizophrenia, the family's denial and \nbewildermentthen quiet desperation. The devoted and faithful husband \nand father, in over his head. The fears of a daughter who fears the \nscripts of heritage and heredity drive her toward a destiny she is \ndesperate to escape. And above all, the redemption that only God can \nbring within scarred families and individual hearts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Painted Table references the family's hand-crafted Norwegian \ntable, lovingly made and handed down. The table travels across the \nAtlantic Ocean and four generations to make its way to Saffee, a \nyoung woman who struggled to grow up in a family increasingly defined \nby her mother's mental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the story unfolds, we learn about Saffee's mother's early life, \nher parents' newlywed days, and her own sad childhood. We also see \nher mother's illness burgeon and pass a confused heritage to her \ndaughters. The story unfolds in a series of episodes that are \ntouching, embarrassing, sad, alarming, confusing, and sometimes \nfrustrating.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Saffee comes of age, we wonder as she does, Is she destined to \nfollow her mother's path, or will she find a way to live a very \ndifferent life? When she's saddled with the unwanted Norwegian table, \ncovered in layers of paint that symbolize her mother's unstable mind, \nshe finds an opportunity to work toward redemption and healing.\u0014\n\u0014\nFields has a compelling and valuable story to tell. Unfortunately, \nshe does not always tell it in a compelling way. Because I saw myself \nin this story and believe we need such stories, I wanted to love its \ncharacters. But I couldn't get close to them. I felt like I was \nwatching events from a distance, reading a journalistic account of a \nseries of family experiences.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe episodic rhythm feels choppy. The book's sweeping coverage (more \nthan 100 years and four generations) means its descriptions of people \nand incidents are sometimes summarized rather than unfolded, told \ninstead of shown. This also makes character developmentand \nengagement even with Safeea challenge.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author uses a third-person perspective, with a variable level of \nomniscience, sometimes presenting the story through one person's \neyes, then suddenly switching to someone else's. This leaves readers \nguessing who we should relate to and what is really going on within \nthe characters. Then, as we begin to draw closer to living in the \nstory, suddenly a narrative voice comments, again from a distance, to \ninterpret characters' motivations and desires without having shown us \nthe existence of such desires in the first place.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, within the episodes she describes, Field's book realistically \ncaptures the small tragedies, hard to recognize as they unfold, that \nadd up to great sorrow. It portrays the everyday losses that \naccompany a life hampered by untreated mental illness. The confusion \nand bewilderment. The efforts to cope. The urge to escape and to \npaint over wounds that instead need healing. The need to relearn so \nmuch of what should have been learned the first time, at the knee of \na parent who didn't know what was real. To feel valuable when a \nparent lacked the capacity to impart that sense of value.\u0014\n\u0014\nI appreciate that Field has not tried to answer a lot of questions \nabout mental illness and why people suffer. She has told a story \nthat, with some flaws in execution, rings true. I hope it will help \nreaders understand their own experiences and the struggles of their \nfriends and neighbors who are thrown into crisis by mental illness. I \nhope it will point those same readers toward redemption, the kind \nthat removes all the layers of anesthetic we use to tryand failto \nnumb our pain, and replaces them with beauty that can come only \nthrough grief and surrender.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy Simpson is author of Troubled Minds: Mental Illness and the \nChurch's Mission (InterVarsity Press). She also serves as editor of \nChristianity Today's Gifted for Leadership.\u0014",

As two of his three sons \nfaced danger and death on the battlefield, Gerecke tended to the \nbattered bodies and souls of wounded and dying GIs outside London. \nBut at the close of the European theater, with Hitler defeated and \nscores of American troops returning home to resume their lives, \nGerecke received his most challenging assignment: he was sent to \nNuremberg to minister to the twenty-one imprisoned Nazi leaders \nawaiting trial for crimes against humanity.\u0014\n\u0014\nA crucial yet largely untold coda to the horrors of World War II, \nMission at Nuremberg unearths groundbreaking new research and \ncompelling firsthand accounts to take us deep inside the Nuremberg \nPalace of Justice, into the very cells of the accused and the \ncourtroom where they answered to the world for their crimes. Never \nbefore in modern history had man accomplished mass slaughter with \nsuch precision. These twenty-one Nazis had sat at the right hand of \nAdolf Hitler; Hermann Goering, Albert Speer, Wilhelm Keitel, Hans \nFrank, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner were the orchestrators, and in some \ncases the direct perpetrators, of the most methodical genocide in \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the drama leading to the court's final judgments unfolds, Tim \nTownsend brings Henry Gerecke's impossible moral quandary to life: \nHow, having risked his own life (and those of his sons) to eliminate \nthe Nazi threat, could he now win the confidence of these men? In the \nmonths after the war ended, Gerecke had visited Dachau. He had \ntouched the walls of the camp's crematorium. He had seen the \nconsequences of the choices these men had made, the orders they had \ngiven and carried out. As he worked to form compassionate \nrelationships with them, how could he preach the gospel of mercy, \nknowing full well the devastating nature of the atrocities they had \ncommitted? And as the day came nearer when he had to escort these men \nto the gallows, what comfort could he offerand what promises of \nsalvation could he maketo evil itself? \u0014\n\u0014\nDetailed, harrowing, and emotionally charged, Mission at Nuremberg is \nan incisive new history of the Nuremberg trials as well as a nuanced \nreflection on the nature of morality and sin, the price of empathy, \nand the limits of forgiveness.\u0014",

But \njust minutes after it ended, the bride and groom hurriedly scurried \npast dozens of protesters here who were chanting Bigamist! and \nShame on you!\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the wedding guests on Thursday evening glared at the \ndemonstrators, repeatedly hissing: Mazel tov. Mazel tov. Mazel tov. \nThe bride, in a lace and sequin floor-length gown, grasped the hand \nof her husband and looked at the crowd in silence.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeir Kin, the new husband, has been divorced for more than seven \nyears, under Californias civil law. But he has refused to give his \nprevious wife the document known as a get, as required by Orthodox \nJewish law to end a marriage. In the eyes of religious authorities, \nthe woman he married in 2000 is what is called an agunah  Hebrew for \nchained wife. Without the get, the woman, Lonna Kin, is forbidden \nunder Jewish law to remarry.\u0014\n\u0014\nJewish law prohibits men from taking multiple wives. But Mr. Kin, \naccording to several rabbis here, apparently relied on a legal \nloophole, which says that if a man can get the special permission of \n100 rabbis to take a second wife, he is able to do so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case has become a powerful symbol for what activists say is a \ndeepening crisis among Orthodox Jews  hundreds of women held hostage \nin a religious marriage, in some cases for years after civil cases \nhave been settled. According to the intricate religious laws \ndictating marriage and divorce, only the husband has the power to \ngrant a divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has happened here is really shameful, said Rabbi Kalman Topp, \nwho drove from Los Angeles to protest the wedding, along with other \nrabbis and congregants from Orthodox synagogues there. Not only is \nhe in clear violation of Jewish law, but he is utilizing and \ncorrupting Jewish law to commit cruel domestic abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Kin, who runs a real estate company, and \\her supporters say that \nMr. Kin, a physician assistant, is demanding $500,000 and full \ncustody of their 12-year-old son in exchange for the divorce. And \nthey cast doubt on whether he really has the support of 100 rabbis. \nReached at his Las Vegas home on Thursday, as a photographer took \npictures of him and his bride in the driveway, Mr. Kin declined to \ncomment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditionally, Jewish communities relied on the threat of ostracism \nto persuade a recalcitrant husband to give his wife a divorce, but \nmany say the threat became far less potent as these communities \nopened and spread out. In recent years, Orthodox activists with the \nOrganization for the Resolution of Agunot, which organized the \nprotest at Mr. Kins wedding, have tried to publicly shame men into \ngiving the get.\u0014",

When Jesus saw his mother and \nthe disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \n'Woman, behold, your son!' Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, \nyour mother!' And from that hour the disciple took her to his own \nhome\" (ESV).\u0014\n\u0014\nTender meditations\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries this scene of immense tenderness immediately \npreceding the death of Jesus has inspired, not only many Byzantine \nikons, works of statuary beyond count, and numerous paintings in \nevery generation, but also a wealth of hymns penned and sung by \nChristians in both East and West. The poetry and imagery of these \ndiverse hymns share the common purpose of bringing the Christian \nimagination into a vivid awareness of the pain and dereliction of \nJesus' mother standing by his cross, as he entrusts her to the care \nof \"the disciple whom he loved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has prompted Christians to think so long and lovingly on this \ntheme?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe emotional impulse to dwell on the sorrow of Jesus' mother at the \nfoot of the Cross had its root in the very love symbolized by the \nCross. Simply put, Jesus died because he loved us. And such \nsacrificial love elicited a responding love from the believing heart. \nChristian emotional response to the sufferings of Jesus, then, has \ntraditionally been deep and abiding. We sense this in the devout \ntenderness of Paul's assertion, \"I have been crucified with Christ. \nIt is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life \nI now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved \nme and gave himself for me\" (Gal. 2:20 ESV). Paul was one of the \nfirst of those Christians who, from the very beginning, have \ndemonstrated a sustained, overwhelming disposition to \"survey the \nwondrous Cross where the young Prince of Glory died.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have always known, of course, that the victory of the \nCross is inseparable from the Lord's Resurrection. They have never \nbeen in doubt that Jesus was \"raised for our justification.\" Yet, \ntheir warmest sentiments have traditionally been directed to the \nharsher fact that He \"was delivered up for our offenses\" (Romans \n4:25). From the beginning, that is to say, they were disposed to \ndwell in imagination, distress, and deep empathy on the thought of \nwhat Jesus endured on their behalf. Even his wounds were treasured, \nbecause He \"Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that \nwe, having died to sin, might live for righteousnessby whose stripes \nyou were healed\" (1 Peter 2:24).\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article see:\u0014\nChristian History Home > 2004 > Issue 83 > Mary at the Cross\u0014",

(AP) 5/28/14 A man who tossed his 2-year-old daughter \ninto a creek while she was strapped into her car seat apologized \nWednesday  but not for murdering the child. Instead, just before he \nwas sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, Arthur Morgan \nIII apologized to the child's mother for the breakdown of their \nrelationship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I want to say I'm sorry for the deterioration of what I thought was \na beautiful friendship between the two of us that blossomed into a \ndaughter,\" Morgan told Imani Benton. \"For anybody that was truly \naffected by this, I hope we can all heal from this situation, knowing \nTierra is in a better place.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the chance to explain his actions to Superior Court Judge \nAnthony Mellaci Jr., Morgan complained that the media published \nphotos that made him look inappropriately angry or happy, and said he \nwould not have worn designer clothing to court if he knew he would be \ncriticized for it. He also said his courtroom wink following his \nconviction was to reassure his sister he was not upset at the verdict.\u0014\n\u0014\nMorgan was found guilty last month of murdering Tierra Morgan-Glover \nby tossing her into a creek, strapped into a car seat and weighed \ndown by a tire jack, in November 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girl's mother, who wore a dress embroidered with Tierra's name \nand photos attached to it, said she hopes Morgan suffers in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't understand why she was taken from me,\" Benton said. \"It does \ngive me peace to know that she is in Heaven with God, and (Morgan) \nwill pay for what he did to her, to me and to everyone else. No good \nwill come to him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth the prosecutor and the judge lamented that New Jersey has \nabolished the death penalty.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You'd be candidate No. 1 for its imposition,\" Mellaci told Morgan. \n\"Your actions were horrific, unthinkable and appalling.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This child was alive when she was placed in the water in pitch \ndarkness, and had to suffer the unthinkable action of having water \nrush in and fill her lungs while strapped into that car seat,\" the \njudge said. \"This child suffered before she died.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors alleged Morgan killed the girl because he was angry that \nBenton had broken off their relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was because he wanted Imani and he couldn't have her,\" prosecutor \nMarc LeMieux said. \"So he took away the one precious thing in her \nlife.\"\u0014",

June 17, 2014\t\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the anxiety society still feels about single mothers, most \nAmerican women aged 26 to 31 who have children are not married. And \nthe number of these millennial single mothers is increasing. In fact, \nin a study just released by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, \nonly about a third of all mothers in their late twenties were married.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe less education the young women have the higher the probability \nthat they became a mom before they got married. Conversely, the \nmarried moms of that generation probably have a college degree. It \nis now unusual for non-college graduates who have children in their \nteens and 20s to have all of them within marriage, says Andrew \nCherlin, one of the authors of the study Changing Fertility Regimes \nand the Transition to Adulthood: Evidence from a Recent Cohort.\u0014\n\u0014\nSociologists such as Cherlin have been tracking the decline of \nmarriage as one of the milestones or goals of an individuals \nlifethe whole first comes love, the comes marriage, then comes the \nbaby with the baby carriage paradigm. And its clear that an \nincreasing number of young people are just not putting a ring on it. \nThe lofty place that marriage once held among the markers of \nadulthood is in serious question, says Cherlin.\u0014\n\u0014\nMotherhood is beginning to show the fissures along income and \neducation lines that have already appeared in other aspects of U.S. \nsociety, with a small cluster of wealthy well educated people at one \nend (married with kids), a large cluster of struggling people at the \nother (kids, not married) and a thinning middle. While many children \nraised by single parents are fine, the advantages of a two parent \nfamily have been quite exhaustively documented. Some of these \nadvantages can be tied to financial resources, but not all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong people with kids between the ages of 26 to 31 who didnt \ngraduate from college, 74% of the mothers and 70% of the fathers had \nat least one child outside of marriage, Cherlin found.

    "title": "MARCHING THROUGH DEATH'S DESERT",
    "words": "Its 93 degrees in Texas today. And Rev. Jeff Hood is walking 200 \nmiles across the state. What would compel somebody to do that? He \nwants to end the death penalty  and he is not alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nRev. Jeff Hood is a Southern Baptist pastor, deeply troubled by his \ndenominations stance on capital punishment. And he is troubled \nbecause he lives in the most lethal state in the U.S. Texas has had \n515 executions since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976  \nthe next state in line is Oklahoma with 111. That means Texas is \nresponsible for 37 percent of the executions in the U.S. Jeff has \nbeen a longtime organizer and board member for the Texas Coalition to \nAbolish the Death Penalty, a movement that is gaining some serious \nmomentum these days\u0014\n\u0014\nA growing number of Texans  and Americans in general  are \nquestioning the death penalty. A recent ABC poll shows we are over \nthe tipping point, with more than half of Americans being against the \ndeath penalty and in favor of life in prison, putting death penalty \nsupport at a new low. For some it is the racial bias  in Texas it is \nnot uncommon for an African American to be found guilty by an \nall-white jury. In fact, in considering future dangerousness, a \ncriteria necessary for execution in Texas, state experts have \nargued that race is a contributing factor, essentially that someone \nis more likely to be violent because they are black  prompting \narticles like the headline story in the New York Times about Duane \nBuck: Condemned to Die Because He is Black.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor others, the issue is more of an economic one: Often the decisive \nfactor on execution is not guilt or innocence but whether one is rich \nor poor  whoever doesnt have the capital gets the punishment as the \nold adage goes. And for others still, it is the Constitutional part  \nthe cruel and unusual element  as equal justice under the law should \nmean you get the same punishment for a crime done in Connecticut as \nin Texas, which is clearly not the case. More than 80 percent of \nexecutions come from 2 percent of the counties in the U.S. And more \nand more folks are feeling the cruelty of it all, wasting so much \nenergy and resources on how to kill people to show that killing is \nwrong. In fact there has not been an execution since the botched \nOklahoma execution over a month ago, which left a man writhing in \npain for 45 minutes before he died of a heart attack. Its not just \nliberals anymore, but all sorts of reasonable people (including \nconservatives and faith leaders) who are convinced that we can do \nbetter than this as a country  and we must.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Rev. Jeff Hood it is his faith that drives him. As he likes to \nsay: The death penalty makes us both killers and victims. Only love \ncan heal us. He began his journey by meeting with the men on death \nrow, for whom he is a spiritual advisor. As he left the prison he \nsaid, The wind of God is at my back and set out on the 200-mile \njourney through the desert.\u0014\n\u0014\nI got to talk with him today, and he emphasized how his faith has \nshaped his views on the death penalty. We discussed the victims of \nviolence, the heroic families like Murder Victims Families for \nReconciliation and Journey of Hope folks who are further traumatized \nby the 10 years of trials and millions of wasted dollars that go \ntoward each execution, and especially the fact that taking another \npersons life does not bring back their lost loved ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nJeff and I also talked about Jesus, the lens through which we read \nthe Bible and the world around us. He is haunted by the way \nChristianity has been misrepresented when it comes to execution.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a cross on top of the execution chamber in Huntsville, he \nsaid sadly. Its a contradiction that not enough Christians recognize \n Jesus was a victim of the death penalty, not a proponent of it. \nJeff described his hope that if more and more Christians embraced \nJesuss life and teaching we would end the death penalty in America, \nfor its strongest pillars are in the heart of the Bible belt. He is \nhopeful, and so am I.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we ended the call, he described all the gracious hospitality he \nhas received  folks bringing him gifts, water, food, and smiles. One \nof the congregations hosting him is United Methodist, whose church \npolicy prohibits the death penalty: We believe the death penalty \ndenies the power of Christ to redeem, restore, and transform all \nhuman beings. Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of his favorite stories was an encounter with one passer-by who \nstopped to talk with him, not entirely convinced of where she stood \non the issue. He explained how Jesus command to love your neighbor \nas yourself and to love your enemies makes it difficult to execute, \nand she responded: Damn, that makes a lot of sense. Indeed it does.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel is good news. The merciful will be shown mercy. March on, \nbrother Jeff. I hope with every step you take, every mile you walk, \nwe get a little closer to the abolition of the death penalty in \nTexas, in the USA, and in the world. March on, brother, march on to \nthe promised land.\u0014\n\u0014\nShane Claiborne is an author and activist, currently working on a \nbook on the death penalty.

    "title": "MASSACHUSETTS' LAW AGAINST THE QUAKERS",
    "words": "Religion was taken seriously in the seventeenth century in Europe and \nAmerica because most people still believed that their faith dealt \nwith issues of truth, not simply the opinions of men. In the colony \nof Massachusetts there were strict laws governing the religious \nbeliefs of society. If you didn't agree with those beliefs, the \ncolonial leaders thought you should go live somewhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuakers were frequently asked to leave Massachusetts. The group had \nbeen founded in the 1640s by the Englishman George Fox. After finding \nno peace for his soul in the churches of his day, Fox had begun to \ngive up all hope when he had the experience of a voice speaking to \nhim. He believed that this inner voice was the voice of God, and that \nhe could receive direct revelation through the Holy Spirit. Fox began \nspeaking of hie new, inward spiritual faith, and the Society of \nFriends--known as Quakers--followed his teachings. They emphasized \nthe direct revelation of Christ to the individual's soul and \nminimized an ordained ministry and the traditional forms of worship \nin the church. Many Christians objected to the Quakers' belief in an \ninner revelation separate from the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 1656, the ship Swallow anchored in Boston harbor with two \nQuaker women from Barbados on board. The two women, Mary Fisher and \nAnn Austin, had come to Boston to share their Quaker faith. When they \nlanded, however, they were kept on board the ship while their \nbelongings were searched and over 100 books were confiscated. They \nwere then hurried off to jail where they were stripped of their \nclothing and inspected for signs of witchcraft. Five weeks later, the \ncaptain of the Swallow was placed under 100 bond to take the women \nback to Barbados. But two days later, another ship with eight more \nQuakers came to dock! These Quakers were imprisoned for eleven weeks \nbefore they were shipped back to England. They were able to convert \none man to their Quaker faith, Nicholas Upsall, but he fled to Rhode \nIsland to avoid punishment\u0014\n.\u0014\nBecause of the influx of Quakers, on this day October 14, 1656, \nMassachusetts enacted a law against the \"cursed sect of heretics \nlately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers...\" \nIt declared that any shipmaster bringing a Quaker into the colony \nwould be fined 100. Any colonist possessing a Quaker book would be \nfined 5. Any Quaker coming within the jurisdiction of the colony \nwould be arrested, whipped, and transported out of the colony without \nconversing with anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, some Quakers felt they simply had to share their beliefs in \nMassachusetts. Robert Fowler built a small craft, the Woodhouse, and \nloaded it with Quakers bound for New England. They landed in Rhode \nIsland, and some entered Massachusetts to spread their views. Quaker \nMary Clark went to Boston to test the law, and she soon had twenty \nstripes of a 3-corded whip \"laid on with fury\" and then spent twelve \nweeks in prison. Even so, the Quakers continued to arrive. So, in \nOctober, 1658, stronger laws were passed. Between 1659 and 1661, four \nQuakers were sent to the gallows.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen King Charles II heard of that, he said all Quakers were to be \nsent to England for trial. There were no more Quaker hangings in \nMassachusetts, and no Quakers were sent to England for trial; but \npunishments and deportations from the colony continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nJones, Louis Thomas. \"The Quakers of Iowa.\" Iowa History Project. \nhttp://iagenweb.org/history/qoi/QOIPt1Chp2.htm.

    "words": "R G. LeTourneau was a man who knew how to clear obstacles. When he \nmet his wife Evelyn, she was but twelve, he was in his twenties. \nAlmost at once she fell in love and began to pray, \"Oh God, please \nhave him wait for me.\" Bob did wait for her. When she turned \nseventeen he asked for her hand. His father, Oscar Peterson, forbade \nmarriage until Evelyn was twenty-one. So R. G. eloped with her to \nTijuana. \u0014\n\u0014\nLife was tough for the young couple. Often they did without \nnecessities. For years they did not even have running water. The \ndeath of their first child forced them to realize they had neglected \nGod in their marriage. They committed themselves fully to the Lord \nand began to tithe. By 1920 R. G. opened his first garage. The year \nof the stock market crash he formed his Peoria earth-moving business. \nDespite the times, LeTourneau succeeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nR. G. became the greatest obstacle-mover in history, building huge \nearth-moving machines. During World War II he produced 70% of all the \narmy's earth-moving machinery. He spoke of God as the Chairman of his \nBoard. A lay pastor in the Christian and Missionary Alliance, R. G. \nshared his faith with millions during his life. Additionally he \nstarted two agricultural missions in Liberia and established the \nLeTourneau foundation to channel 90% of his personal salary to \nChristian endeavors, especially the training of Christian workers in \npractical skills (such as house-building) which are needed on mission \nfields. He also gave of his time to Christian business associations \nand Christian colleges.\u0014\n\u0014\nR. G. maintained a close partnership with Evelyn. She could move \nobstacles, too. Once, at Bob's request, she baked his favorite hot \nTamale pie--for eight thousand people! As active as he was in \nspiritual affairs, she was more so. She mothered the young men who \nworked for LeTourneau, even going so far as to rent a house that many \ncould live in so they would not become prey to the vices of Chicago. \nMany became Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 30, 1937 the Evelyn and R.G. LeTourneau were in a serious car \naccident. R. G. was on crutches when their twentieth wedding \nanniversary rolled around. Despite that, Evelyn coaxed him into the \ncar on this day, August 27, 1937. She had something she wanted him to \nlook at it with her. That day they drove to Winona Lake, Indiana, and \nshe bought Camp Bethel. Using help from students of Wheaton College, \nshe turned the camp into an evangelistic and recreational center. \nNumbers of people became Christians in its \"Victory Circle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLeTourneau's life is testimony to the big things God can do through \nmen with big ideas.

    "title": "MORAVIANS SETTLE NORTH CAROLINA",
    "words": "Today it takes only a few hours to drive across North Carolina from \neast to west. In the 1750s, the same route was a gruelling trek. On \nthis day, September 10, 1752 (new calendar),* an expedition of \nMoravian men under the leadership of August Gottlieb Spangenberg set \noff from Edenton, North Carolina. They headed west at the invitation \nof John Carteret, the Earl of Granville, proprietor to much of the \ncolony.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpangenberg was a good choice as leader. Born in Prussia, he came \nunder the influence of Count von Zinzendorf, the dedicated leader of \nthe Moravians. (Moravians were exiled Protestants from what is now \nCzechoslovakia.) Spangenberg did not join the Moravians at once, but \nwhen he was dismissed from the theological faculty at the University \nof Halle because of his religious views, he united with the small \nevangelical group. Zinzendorf sent him to America where he negotiated \nland in Georgia for Moravians who expected to be expelled from \nGermany. Spangenberg founded several other Moravian settlements and \neventually became the American bishop for his sect.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Moravian reputation for sober hard work was well-known to \nCarteret. He felt that if he could point to a flourishing community \nof these godly folk on his land, he could attract more settlers. \nAlthough the first English settlement in the New World had been at \nRoanoke, North Carolina, the state lagged behind others in \ndevelopment owing to mismanagement, high taxes and the economic \nrivalry of neighboring Virginia. John Carteret's offer to the \nMoravians aimed to improve matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut December saw the Moravians lost in the mountains. Eventually, \nthey recovered their bearings and selected the best land they could \nfind. They bought 99,000 acres in what is now Forsyth County. \nSpangenberg named the area Wachau after a valley in Austria.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving staked out their land, the Moravians settled it the next year, \nsending a team of fifteen unmarried men to the region. Among these \nmen were represented all of the essential professions and skills of \nthe day: minister, surgeon, shoemaker, cooper (barrel maker), \nseive-maker, business manager, carpenter and so forth. One secret of \nMoravian success was their practicality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little band created their first settlement at a place they named \nBethabara. They cut two and a half miles of road, cleared land, \nplanted crops, made furniture, imported livestock, constructed an \noven for baking, built homes, and even opened a mill. Within six \nyears, there were seventy Moravians living at Bethabara.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little town's palisade served as a fort during the French and \nIndian War. After the war ended in 1760, the Moravians planted the \ncities of Bethania and Salem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica's Moravians under Spangenberg were deeply concerned with \nmission work among the Native Americans. In fact, Spangenberg even \nwrote a lengthy pamphlet on missions. His philosophy of missions \ncould be summed up in a few excerpts from that pamphlet. \"In our \nlabour among the heathen, we will particularly endeavor, that they \nbecome converted to Christ Jesus with all their heart.\" And, \"To \ncomprise the whole briefly together, the labors of the brethren among \nthe heathen aim at this, that they might be enabled to say of a \ntruth: 'Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, \nwe die unto the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the \nLord's.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n*Note: Under American reckoning, the date would still have been \nAugust 30. On September 2, 1752, Britain adopted the Gregorian \ncalendar and September 14 followed September 2 in North Carolina. \nHowever, Protestant Germans had adopted the Gregorian calendar 52 \nyears earlier. This story uses their reckoning.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nOld Salem. (www.oldsalem.org/about/carolina.htm)\u0014\nReichel, Levin Theodore. The Moravians in North Carolina.

    "words": "Mexicos Deadly Narco-Politics \u0014\nBy IOAN GRILLOOCT. 9, 2014    NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIGUALA, Mexico  STUDENT protesters in rural Mexico have long dealt \nwith heavy-handed police officers. But on the black night of Sept. \n26, students who attended a rural teachers college realized they \nwere facing a far worse menace in this southern city. Not only were \npolice officers shooting haphazardly at them, killing three students \nand several passers-by; shady gunmen were also firing from the \nsidelines.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning, the corpse of a student was dumped on a major \nstreet. Hed had his skin peeled off and his eyes gouged out. It was \nthe mark of drug cartel assassins.\u0014\n\u0014\nSoldiers and federal detectives detained two alleged cartel hit men, \nwho confessed they had conspired with the police to murder students. \nThey led troops to pits on the outskirts of Iguala containing 28 \ncharred corpses. Forensic teams are working to identify the bodies. A \ntotal of 43 students went missing that night, many last seen being \nbundled into police cars.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I went to the grave site on an eerie hill, it still stank of \ndecaying human flesh. I had just been interviewing some of the \nstudents classmates at their university, mostly teenage sons of poor \nfarmers, who are idealistic, committed and frightened. I have covered \ncartel violence in Mexico for over a decade. But as I inhaled the \nstench of death on that hill, and saw photos of the mutilated student \non the road, I felt as never before that I was covering an act of \npure unadulterated evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy drug cartels want to slaughter students may at first seem \ninexplicable. But it is a symptom of a systematic process that has \nbeen taking place in Mexico for years. Drug cartels are taking over \nchunks of government apparatus, from local police forces to city and \nstate governments. Sometimes, they control the officials; other \ntimes, cartel members themselves are the officials. I call it state \ncapture. A student I talked to had a more visceral term for it: \nnarco-politica, or narco-politics.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts a terrifying concept. Being ruled by corrupt and self-interested \npoliticians can be bad. But imagine being ruled by sociopathic \ngangsters.\u0014",

    "title": "MALALA SHARES NOBEL PEACE  PRIZE",
    "words": "Pakistani youth activist Malala Yousafzai was awarded the 2014 Nobel \nPeace Prize on Friday, an honor she shares with Kailash Satyarthi, \nwho has long been campaigning against child exploitation in \nneighboring India. But until about two years ago, Malala was just a \n15-year old blogger on a school bus with her friends. It was Oct. 9, \n2012, when armed Taliban men boarded Malala's bus and shot her in the \nhead, transforming her from a minor Internet celebrity to an \ninternational symbol.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's hard to believe that she's accomplished so much  including \nrecovery from her injuries  in only two years, but Malala's story \nactually started long before the assassination attempt that launched \nher to worldwide fame. She was born in the Swat valley in Pakistan, \nin 1997, to parents who encouraged her love for education from a \nyoung age. Her father, Ziauddin, opened a private school for boys and \ngirls, partly to fight against gender discrimination in Pakistan. My \nfather educated my brother and me, but he didn't send my sisters to \nschool, he told \\The Guardian. I thought it was an injustice. When \nMalala was born, he named her after a Pashtun heroine and never \ncurbed her ambition.Don't ask me what I did, ask me what I did not \ndo, Ziauddin said in a viral \\TEDtalk about his daughter, I did not \nclip her wings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a toddler, Malala would sit in classrooms in her father's school \nand follow lessons for 10-year olds. Aryn Baker wrote in her \\2012 \nprofile of Malala for TIME:\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time she was 2, she was sitting in class with 10-year-olds, \naccording to a close family friend and teacher at the school founded \nby Malala's father. The little girl with the huge hazel eyes didn't \nsay much, but she could follow, and she never got bored, says the \nteacher, who asked to remain anonymous for fear that she too might \nbecome a Taliban target. Malala loved the school, a rundown \nconcrete-block building with a large rooftop terrace open to views of \nthe snowcapped mountains that surround the Swat Valley. As she grew \nolder, she was always first in her class. She was an ordinary girl \nwith extraordinary abilities, says the teacher, but she never had a \nfeeling of being special.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2008, everything changed. The Taliban gained control of the Swat \nregion, banning DVDs, dancing, and beauty parlors. By the end of the \nyear, over 400 schools were \\closed. Ziauddin took Malala to \nPeshawar, where she made a famous speech in front of national press \ntitled How Dare the Taliban Take Away My Basic Right to Education? \nShe was only 11.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn early 2009, Malala started blogging anonymously for the \\BBC about \nwhat it was like to live under the Taliban. Just a few days after she \nstarted, all girls schools were closed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn retrospect, some parts of Malala's blog seem like ominous \nforeshadowing: On my way from school to home I heard a man saying 'I \nwill kill you', she wrote on Jan. 3, 2009. I hastened my pace and \nafter a while I looked back if the man was still coming behind me. \nBut to my utter relief he was talking on his mobile and must have \nbeen threatening someone else over the phone. But there are also \nhumorous parts that remind us that, at the time, she was only 11: My \nmother liked my pen name 'Gul Makai' and said to my father 'why not \nchange her name to Gul Makai?' I also like the name because my real \nname means 'grief stricken'.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn December 2009, Ziauddin publicly identified his daughter, even \nthough her real name has been widely suspected for months.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat proved to be a dangerous move. We did not want to kill her, as \nwe knew it would cause us a bad name in the media, Sirajuddin Ahmad, \na senior commander and spokesman for the Swat Taliban, told TIME for \nthe 2012 magazine profile. But there was no other option.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2012, armed men boarded the converted truck that Malala and her \nclassmates used as a makeshift school bus. Which one is Malala? one \nof them asked. I think we must have looked at her, Malala's \nclassmate Shazia Ramzan told TIME's Aryn Baker. We didn't say \nanything, but we must have looked, because then he shot her. Malala \ntook a bullet to the head.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe endured a traumatic operation in Pakistan that left her with a \n(temporary) metal plate in her skull while they stored a piece of her \nskull in her abdomen, to reattach when she's healed enough. She was \nthen airlifted to a hospital in Birmingham, England, where she had \nmore medical treatment and extensive rehabilitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rest of her story has played out in the public eye. Nine months \nafter she was shot, Malala gave a now-famous speech at the UN. They \nthought that the bullets would silence us. But they failed, she \nsaid. And then, out of that silence came thousands of voices.  \nWeakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was \nborn.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow relocated to England, Malala goes to Edgbaston School for Girls. \nShe's continued her high-profile campaign for girls' education with \nThe Malala Fund, which raises money to promote girls' education. \nShe's used the fund as a platform to confront Barack Obama about \ndrone strikes, help Syrian refugee children and demand the return of \nthe Nigerian girls kidnapped by Boko Haram. And this September, she \nannounced a $3 million multi-year commitment to partner with Echidna \nGiving to support girls education in developing countries.\u0014\n\u0014\nMalala won Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize in 2011, before she \nwas shot, but the prize been since renamed in her honor; it's now the \nNational Malala Peace Prize. She was shortlisted for TIME's Person of \nthe Year in 2012, and was one of the TIME 100 in 2013. She won a \nMother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice in 2012 and the 2013 \nSimone de Beauvoir Prize for international human rights work on \nbehalf of women's equality.\u0014\n\u0014\nTIME magazine  (10/10/14)\u0014",

    "words": "Michelangelo Unveiled Unfinished Chapel Ceiling\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of Rome waited in expectation. For months, Michelangelo \nBuonarroti had worked in secret. Curiosity was aflame. What had he \naccomplished? Had he succeeded in transferring his skill as a \nsculptor to work with fresco (paint in plaster)? \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Julius II, as impatient as ever, demanded that Michelangelo \nunveil the ceiling of the Sistine chapel although it was far from \ndone. High on the scaffolding, his face just inches from the ceiling, \npaint dripping into his eyes, Michelangelo had completed only the \ncentral vault.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulius prevailed. Down came the scaffold, erected with such labor. On \nthis day, November 1, 1509, the public surged into the chapel to see \nwhat Michelangelo had wrought.\u0014\n\u0014\nPainters could only gape in astonishment. Michelangelo, who had \nearlier revolutionized sculpture, now did the same with painting. His \nnine groups of stories from Genesis stole the breath of \ncontemporaries. He made his figures seem to be in perspective and \ndistributed them across the vault with an astonishing inner rhythm to \ntell the stories of creation, the fall of man, and sacred history. \n(Years later, he added the Last Judgment to the wall behind the \naltar.) His rivals immediately began to ape his techniques.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichelangelo infused much of his art with Christian feeling. An \nadmirer of the reformer Savonarola, his sonnets show that he \ngenuinely desired to know God and considered himself unworthy of him:\u0014\n\u0014\nO my dear God, matched with the much I owe\u0014\nAll that I am were no real recompense:\u0014\nPaying a debt is not munificence. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he had flaws of temper, Michelangelo's art and life reveal \nan individual concerned for God's glory. A contemporary wrote, \n\"Buonarroti, having lived for ninety years, there was never found \nthrough all that time anyone who could with right and justice impute \nto him a stain or any ugliness of manners.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he found dealing with Pope Julius a strain. Once when \nMichelangelo threatened to leave Rome, Julius, in a fury, said he \nwould have him flung from the scaffold. Michelangelo immediately took \nit down and refused to add the gold leaf and touch-ups that Julius \nwanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCross, F.

    "title": "MORAL MAN AND IMMORAL SOCIETY",
    "words": "Monday, December 8, 2014 David Gushee on Faith, Politics & Culture \u0014\n\u0014\nReinhold Niebuhr, Eric Garner and white privilege\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Reinhold Niebuhrs stark realism teaches us about our current \nracial crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy David Gushee\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most bracing books I read for doctoral work was Reinhold \nNiebuhrs 1932 classic, Moral Man and Immoral Society. I pulled it \noff the shelf this week while thinking about Trayvon Martin, \nFerguson, Michael Brown, Staten Island, Eric Garner, the Cleveland \npolice and so on, and so on.\u0014\n\u0014\nWritten to pierce any surviving liberal optimism as the Roaring 20s \ngave way to the disastrous 30s, Niebuhrs primary thesis concerns \nthe effects of sin on human society and, in particular, on human \ncollectivities or groups. Niebuhr says that all human life is marked \nby sin, especially in the forms of ignorance and selfishness, but at \nleast the individual sometimes demonstrates the potential to rise \nabove ignorance and selfishness to reach rational analysis and \nunselfish concern for others. Human groups, on the other hand, are \nboth more stupid and more selfish than individuals. They seem \nespecially impervious either to rational or moral appeal, easily \nprone to self-deception and demagoguery, and apparently needful of \nthe imposition of a power greater than their own power if they are to \naccede to any changes that cut against their own self-interest.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Moral Man and Immoral Society, Niebuhr primarily analyzes economic \nproblems and the great clash between privileged and proletarian \nclasses. Moral appeals to the holders of great economic power and \nprivilege are almost always fruitless, Niebuhr says. Their tremendous \npower must be countered by the effectively organized collective power \nof the workers, either in the form of revolution (which has its own \ndangers) or through political processes that gradually win gains for \nthe proletariat through collective bargaining and government \nregulation to mitigate inequalities and ensure a measure of worker \nrights and economic security. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlready in 1932 Niebuhr recognized that racial injustice in America \ncould be subjected to the same kind of analysis that he offers of the \neconomic problem. Scattered throughout his book he offers some \ninsightful, though not always satisfactory, commentary on the plight \nof black Americans (which he called Negroes, in the vernacular of his \ntime) in a land of white privilege. Some of this commentary resonates \ndeeply today.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, Niebuhr notes that it has always been the habit of \nprivileged groups to deny the oppressed classes every opportunity for \nthe cultivation of innate capacities and then to accuse them of \nlacking what they have been denied the right to acquire. He then \napplies this insight to white attitudes toward black Americans, at \nthe time the issue being white opposition to full voting rights for \nblacks based on the claim that they were incompetent to exercise said \nfranchise. But Niebuhrs insight here has a broader reach with deep \napplicability to the attitudes of many white Americans today.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater Niebuhr writes: It is hopeless for the Negro to expect \ncomplete emancipation from the menial social and economic position \ninto which the white man has forced him, merely be trusting in the \nmoral sense of the white race. Thats because, as Niebuhr writes \nthroughout, groups which benefit from the existing structure of \nsociety have no particular interest in seeing that structure changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, privileged groups have an extraordinary ability to \nidentif[y] [their] interests with the peace and order of society. \nSelf-deception reigns among the privileged because, among other \nreasons, to see reality more truly would place an unbearable moral \npressure on such groups to resign privilege in favor of greater \njustice. Instead, privileged groups call in the forces of state power \nin the purported interests of the peace and order of society as a \nwhole, but in fact to suppress movements of the oppressed for social \nchange and greater justice. \u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing that only forceful resistance to white privilege has any hope \nof changing the existing structures of power, Niebuhr ponders whether \nthat pressure will be more effective if it is violent or if it is \nnonviolent. Niebuhr refuses to draw an absolute distinction between \nthese forms of pressure. He does conclude that non-violence is a \nparticularly strategic instrument for an oppressed group which is \nhopelessly in the minority and has no possibility of developing \nsufficient power to set against its oppressors. The emancipation of \nthe Negro race in America probably waits upon the adequate \ndevelopment of this kind of social and political strategy. \u0014\n\u0014\nWith these words Niebuhr anticipated the nonviolent civil \ndisobedience strategy that came to full flower in the civil rights \nmovement and remain favored among Christian activists. But events in \nthe last weeks and months here in the U.S. remind us that the same \nrace-based injustices, and the same available repertory of strategies \nfor confronting injustice, remain with us  with violence the \nresponse of those who become unconvinced that nonviolence is \neffective. \u0014\n\u0014\nNiebuhr is often described as a cynic, or at least as a pessimist. \nLines like this one help cement that reputation: However large the \nnumber of individual white men who do and who will identify \nthemselves completely with the Negro cause, the white race in America \nwill not admit the Negro to equal rights if it is not forced to do \nso. \u0014\n\u0014\nFriends, Niebuhr wrote those words 82 years ago. As recent events \nagain tragically demonstrate, he was right. The power of white \nprivilege, often incarnated in unjustified and unpunished state \nbrutality against black people, then followed by white resentment \nthat anyone could have a problem with the way things are, remains a \nreality. Its power must be broken, once and for all.\u0014",

    "words": "Martyrdom of Anabaptist Evangelist Hubmaier\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nEurope's Hapsburg rulers were convinced that the Anabaptist sect was \ndangerous to the peace of the Empire. And with good reason: a peasant \nrevolt, led by extreme Anabaptists, destroyed the peace of central \nEurope. The Hapsburgs determined to eradicate the Anabaptists from \ntheir kingdom. They drew no distinction between peaceable Anabaptists \nand radicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 1527, King Ferdinand's men arrested an Anabaptist leader who \nwas halfway between the peaceable and radical factions. This was \nBalthasar Hubmaier. The authorities extradited him to Vienna where he \nwas burned at the stake on this day, March 10, 1528. Three days later \nthey tied a stone around his wife's neck and threw her into the \nDanube river to drown.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut although he was dead, Balthasar's influence continued through the \nwritings he left behind. He had been educated in the University of \nFreiburg, where he showed brilliance and received his doctorate the \nsame year as Martin Luther. In 1520 he went to Waldshut where he \nbegan reading the writings of Paul, Erasmus, and Luther. He said that \n\"Christ was starting to sprout in me,\" and by 1522, he became a \nProtestant. At Waldshut, Balthasar, supported by the town council, \nbegan to change the order of worship. When Archduke Ferdinand (who \nwas a Catholic) threatened to send troops to bring Waldshut into \nline, Balthasar left so that the town would not be invaded. \u0014\n\u0014\nBalthasar wrote an argument for toleration which became the first \nwork on religious liberty to spring from the Reformation. In it he \nsaid, \"It is well and good that the secular authority puts to death \nthe criminals who do physical harm to the defenseless (Romans 13). \nBut no one may injure the atheist who wishes nothing for himself \nother than to forsake the gospel.\" While Archduke Ferdinand was \ndistracted by war, the Anabaptist leader returned to Waldshut to \nimplement further reforms. On Easter Sunday, 1525, he and sixty \nothers were rebaptized; three hundred soon followed their example. \n(They considered that baptism as babies was meaningless.) Balthasar \nwrote a work on believer's baptism which was the most exhaustive \ntreatment of the subject in the sixteenth century.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the Hapsburg troops defeated the peasants, they moved on to \nWaldshut, and the townsfolk converted back to Catholicism rather than \nface reprisals. Balthasar fled in the night to Zurich. There \nZwingli's torturers made him recant some of his Anabaptist views. But \nBalthasar's thinking had not really changed. Once released from their \nclutches, he settled in Nikolsburg, where he again defended \nAnabaptist beliefs and baptized about six thousand people. He \ncontinued to publish works on Christian life and church discipline \nuntil his arrest a year later.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Council of Trent met in 1645 and condemned the works of the \nReformers, Balthasar Hubmaier was grouped with Martin Luther, Ulrich \nZwingli, and John Calvin as a heretic to the Church of Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\n\"Balthasar Hubmaier.\" http://www.hccentral.com/gkeys/hbmier.html\u0014\n\"Balthasar Hubmaier.\" http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/hubmaier.htm\u0014\n\"Hubmaier, Balthasar.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, \nedited by F.

    "title": "MARTIN LUTHER'S MOST NOBLE WORDS",
    "words": "Since your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will \nanswer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am convicted by \nscripture and plain reason--I do not accept the authority of popes \nand councils for they have contradicted each other--my conscience is \ncaptive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, \nfor to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, \nI cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most notable words spoken in the Reformation, this \naccording to early printed reports, was Luther's reply at Worms when \nurged to recant. He uttered the memorable lines in German on this \nday, April 18, 1521, and then, upon request, repeated their gist in \nLatin for those who did not understand his native tongue. He was \nsweating, said witnesses. With a victory gesture he slipped out of \nthe room.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick the Wise, Luther's supporter was uneasy. Did the scriptures \ncondemn Luther or not? \"He is too daring for me,\" the elector \nadmitted. Nonetheless, on the next day, when asked to stand against \nLuther with the emperor, he did not sign the condemnation although \nthe other four electors did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the Emperor, he reasoned that a single friar who went contrary \nto the whole church could not possibly be right. Descended from a \nlong line of Christian emperors, he felt that to accept Luther's view \nwas to betray the faith of his fathers. He would take prompt action \nagainst Luther, he vowed. But since Luther had been given safe \nconduct to Worms, he allowed him to depart in safety. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuther did not leave Worms at once. For several days a committee \nreasoned with him, begging him not to rend the church in two. They \npointed out that war would surely come to Germany. Melanchthon, his \nbeloved associate, might be killed. Luther could not help but be \nmoved, but his determination held. God's word must be followed \nwhatever the cost. To this confrontation his stand against \nindulgences had finally brought him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are grounds to doubt that Luther said \"Here I stand. I cannot \ndo otherwise.\" Although the earliest printed versions contain these \nlines, the official transcripts do not. Whether spoken or not, the \nwords convey the brave monk's attitude. When Luther left Worms, the \nReformation was irrevocable.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was at his noblest at Worms. His bold words have \nstirred men's imagination through subsequent centuries, for they have \nthe same ring to them as Peter's famous defiance of the Sanhedrin. \n\"Judge for yourselves whether we ought to obey God or men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "Editor, Times-Dispatch:  4/15/15\u0014\n\u0014\nH.V. Traywick Jr. is right that secession was the immediate cause of \nthe Civil War. Professor Ed Ayers is also right that the war was \noriginally about slavery but differently about slavery at its end. \nSecession and Lincoln's response to it were the cause of the war, but \nthe fear of losing the right to own human beings was the cause of \nsecession, as Traywick acknowledges.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln responded to secession in the only way he could considering \nhis oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Other \npresidents who were faced with the threat of secession also \nthreatened to respond forcefully. The most notable is probably Andrew \nJackson, a Tennessee Democrat, who promised to hang John C. Calhoun \nif South Carolina tried to secede. In that instance, it was about the \ntariff. In the 1860s, it was not.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraywick argues that Lincoln fought the war to retain the numerous \nassets in the South, including access to New Orleans and the \nMississippi River. Of course he did. He had just been elected \npresident of the United States, an election in which the South \nparticipated, and this represented a serious threat to the security \nand interests of the nation. That doesn't change the fact that the \nissue that ignited this conflict, in which so much was at stake, was \nthe right to own slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation made it clear that this was \nnot just a war to preserve the Union but one to end the inhuman \ninstitution that triggered the crisis in the first place. The war and \nthe 13th Amendment that followed it finally settled an issue that had \nplagued a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are \ncreated equal since its inception. Unfortunately, it would be another \n100 years before the descendants of the former slaves were truly \nallowed to be free.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert S. Alley Jr.\u0014\nRichmond.\u0014",

Superior Court judge to nine years in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetty T. Threatt, 27, who was convicted in March of aggravated \nassault against a minor and first-degree child cruelty after \nadmitting in court that she bound her son with duct tape and refused \nto feed him, spoke softly in a brief statement to the judge.\u0014\n\u0014\nI want to say I apologize to the family for putting them through \nheartache and pain and stress, said Threatt, referring to the family \nof the boys father, who was not present in court. Threatt, wearing a \nblue jumpsuit, added in a barely audible voice, I love my family and \nchildren very much.\u0014\n\u0014\nJudge Rhonda Reid Winston accepted the recommended nine-year sentence \nnegotiated in Threatts plea deal, explaining that nothing she read \nin a pre-sentencing report, detailing Threatts childhood and her \nmental illness, could excuse the mothers actions.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe behavior in the case is almost unheard of, Reid Winston told \nThreatt, who stood at the defense table with her hands clasped in \nfront of her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge told Threatt, I see defendants come into court every day \nwho have undergone many horrible things, but it is in my view just \nunheard of to engage in this kind of conduct with respect to ones \nown child.\u0014\n\u0014\nThreatts attorney, Brandi Harden, requested that, after sentencing, \nThreatt be placed in a facility where she could receive mental health \ntreatment. According to social services documents, when Threatt was 9 \nyears old, she was sent to an inpatient psychiatric facility after \nputting the family cat in a microwave and turning it on.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Threatt is going to be released from prison at some point; it is \nobviously in the communitys best interest to have these issues \naddressed head-on while she is incarcerated, Harden said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe judge also sentenced Threatt to three years of supervised release \nafter she gets out of prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nThreatt must complete parenting and anger-management classes as well \nas counseling for past trauma. Threatt was ordered not to have any \ncontact with her son or any of her four other children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Threatts arrest, three of her children  ages 1, 4 and 7  \nwere placed in foster care. The boy, who was diagnosed with cerebral \npalsy when he was 5, is the second-oldest of Threatts five children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThreatt told detectives, according to court records, that she was \nembarrassed by the boys cerebral palsy and hated him, blaming \nthe boy for a miscarriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring a court hearing in March, a prosecutor told the judge that \nThreatt and her then-boyfriend, Lester O. Jackson, 52, had abused the \nboy in their apartment on Brandywine Street in Southeast Washington.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jason Park told the judge that Threatt poured \nscalding water on her son and locked him in a bedroom and a bathroom \nfor as many as five days at a time.\u0014\n\u0014\nJackson, 52, ordered Threatt to withhold food from the boy during the \nfour-month period from March to June 2014, Park said. The boy became \nseverely malnourished and extremely underweight.

Some say it is a comment \non our society not appreciating the things done and made by old \ntimers for newer generations. This story reminds me a little of Mema. \nShe so wanted to be remembered. She made many nice things by hand and \nher grandkids, or most of her grandkids, would take them and put them \naway or hang some in the hallways. She was very big on things that \nwere made by her family or made by hand and she so wanted them to be \npassed on and wanted by the newer generations. However, none of the \nnewer generations would fight over a single thing she had. I believe \nthat made her sad. And in some ways, she died alone, rejected by her \ndaughter and son-in-law in the last days of her life, and to some \ndegree there was a celebration of her death. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou know this story well. Osalene wanted you to not only have things \nbut she wanted you to treasure them. It was the same with Mema. And \nunfortunately, or fortunately, we got away from this I made this for \nyou and you should appreciate it. I like you feel that something \nwent wrong in this old man's life. He died alone and not only was no \none there but they turned away. So I can't help but believe that \nthis old man was a Jud of sorts. Only around to say look how proud of \nyou I am and never there to change the diapers or hug them as they \nwent off to school. And as we have discussed before, it is also true \nthat writers also write emotional things that sometimes make no sense.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'll let you know if I ever figure it out. \u0014\n\u0014\nI do know this: my old man will not die alone. He is loved and \nrespected by all of his children. He loved our mother and he loves \nhis children and their children and has supported and encouraged all \nof us throughout life. We may not want all of the things he has but \nwe will always hold on to his gifts of self-respect, morals, meaning \nin life and the knowing that we were loved by our father and our \nmother, during the good times and the bad. We will not turn away and \nwe will cry when he leaves us. We will cry a lot. He may be \nphysically alone the day he leaves us to go home but he will never be \nalone. He is with us and we with him and it must make him shed tears \nof happiness when he knows how much he is loved. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy Morningside was always brighter because of you, Dad.

    "words": "Maximilian Kolbe Gave His Life for another Man\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most heroic acts of the twentieth century reached its \nconclusion on this day, August 14, 1941. That is when the Franciscan \nfriar, Maximilian Kolbe, lifted up his arm to receive a lethal \ninjection of carbolic acid.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo weeks earlier, a prisoner had escaped from Auschwitz. The camp's \nrule was that if one prisoner escaped, ten died in his place. All day \nthe weak and underfed men from the escaped prisoner's block were made \nto stand in the sun without food and water. When the man was not \nfound, a prison guard called out the names of ten men who were to die \nin his place.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sergeant Francis Gajowniczek heard his name called, he cried \nout, \"Have mercy! I have a wife and children.\" But mercy was a \ncommodity in short supply in Nazi death camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nInto the gap stepped Maximilian Kolbe. He moved forward silently. \nAsked what he wanted, he replied, \"I am a Catholic priest from \nPoland; I would like to take his place, because he has a wife and \nchildren.\" Hesitating a moment in face of this noble gesture, \nCommandant Fritsch accepted the replacement. Maximilian and nine \nothers were sent to starve to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring those two weeks, Maximilian led the victims in hymns and \nprayer. When he became too weak to speak aloud, he whispered his \nprayers. After two weeks, only four of the ten were still alive. \nMaximilian alone was completely conscious. The guards needed the \nspace for more prisoners and decided to hasten the deaths with lethal \ndoses of carbolic acid. Maximilian was last. Weak though he was, he \nraised his arm to receive the injection, triumphantly embracing \nmartyrdom. We know some of these details, because the guard who kept \nthe records was so impressed during Maximilian's two-week ordeal that \nhe logged more detail than was required.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch martyrs do not just happen by chance. Maximilian was born as \nRaymond Kolbe. Although a wild boy as a youth, he was moved by the \nprayers and pleas of his mother. One day when he was twelve, as he \nprayed before a statue of Mary he saw her in a vision; she offered \nhim two crowns: a white one for purity and red for martyrdom. Told to \nchoose between them, he asked for both. He became a Franciscan friar \nand took the name Maximilian.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis life was devoted to Mary. He founded an order which used the \nmeans of mass communication, including radio and a widely circulated \nnewspaper and magazine, to spread truth. \"No one in the world can \nchange Truth,\" he said. \"What we can do and should do is to seek \ntruth and to serve it when we have found it. The real conflict is the \ninner conflict. Beyond armies of occupation and the hecatombs of \nextermination camps, there are two irreconcilable enemies in the \ndepth of every soul: good and evil, sin and love. And what use are \nthe victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our \ninnermost personal selves?\" Indifference toward the things of God was \nthe deadliest enemy of any soul. He aimed to defeat this.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn prison, he often went without food so others might have more and \ninsisted on being the last in his unit to receive medical treatment. \nHis attitude was expressed in his words, \"For Jesus Christ I am \nprepared to suffer still more.\" Pope John Paul II canonized \nMaximilian in 1982, saying, \"He bore witness to Christ and to love.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Mayflower Sailed, Taking Pilgrims to New England\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most significant chapters in American history opened on \nthis day, September 6, 1620. After failed attempts to sail from \nEngland, leaving behind her sister ship Speedwell, the Mayflower \nsailed from Plymouth for the New World. Aboard were 101 passengers. \nBy today's standards the ship was little bigger than a yacht. Ninety \nfeet long and twenty-six feet wide, it hardly seemed the vessel to \nalter world history.\u0014\n\u0014\nCramped in so small a space and subject to rough weather, the \npassengers suffered a good deal. The sailors cursed the pious \nPilgrims, whom they detested. Food consisted of dried fish, cheese \nand beer. The only sanitary accommodation was a slop bucket. There \nwas nowhere to bathe. Seasickness was rampant during storms. With \nlittle air below decks, the conditions were nauseating at the best. \nDespite this, only one passenger died at sea. However bad matters \nwere aboard ship, they would prove far worse in the \"hideous and \ndesolate wilderness\" which soon confronted them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months and five days after sailing, the ship landed at Cape Cod. \nBefore going ashore the Pilgrims signed the famous Mayflower Compact. \nThis not only made them a completely religious entity but broke \npolitical ground, too, in that it placed them under their own \ngovernance while still paying formal respect to the king of England. \nThe compact was essentially a church covenant, signed by most of the \nadult men who were aboard. It probably staved off a mutiny, for \ntensions were running high.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their destination, the Pilgrims were a long while making up their \nminds where to settle. The sailors grumbled and wanted to force them \noff ship before all the provisions were consumed. Fortunately, some \nof the men who first went ashore found berries and corn which could \nsupplement their rations. The ship remained over winter. Inadequately \nprepared, the Pilgrims died by the dozens. Less than half survived \nthe first winter. Shelter was lacking. The houses they built were of \nwattle and clay. But enough settlers survived to establish a \ncommunity and to open an incomparable chapter in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a social contract as embodied in the Mayflower Compact \nwould become important in the theories of John Locke, Rousseau and \nothers. Christian forms had a good deal of influence in shaping the \ncharacter of early American governments which were largely the \ncreation of Christian exiles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford, William.

    "title": "MICHAEL SERVETUS BURNED FOR HERESY",
    "words": "The two men were the most exact opposites in spirit, doctrine, and \naim. One was a reformer, a champion of orthodoxy, and one who sought \nto build up the church of Christ. The other was considered by \nCatholic and Protestant alike an archheretic who sought to destroy \nkey doctrines on which the church took its stand. At twenty-seven the \nfirst had written one of the most influential systems of theology the \nChristian faith had ever seen. When he was barely twenty the other \nwrote a work to denounce a fundamental doctrine of Christianity. Both \nwere brilliant and leaned men born in 1509. One was burned at the \nstake for heresy in the town where the other was pastor. The two men? \nJohn Calvin and Michael Servetus.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Servetus was born in Spain in 1509. He had a brilliant mind, \nwas trained by the Dominicans, and went to the University of \nSaragossa. There he began studying the Bible, whose authority he \naccepted; but his interpretations brought him into conflict with the \northodox church. In 1531 Servetus published a work called the Errors \nof the Trinity, in which he said those who believed in the Trinity \nwere really Tritheists (believers in three gods) or atheists. He said \nthe gods of the Trinitarians were a 3-headed monster and a deception \nof the devil. Both Protestants and Catholics found the work \nblasphemous, and the emperor banned it.\u0014\n\u0014\nServetus proceded to France where he took the name Michel de \nVilleneuve. He studied mathematics, geography, astrology, and \nmedicine. Gaining fame as a physician, he came close to discovering \nthe pulmonary circulation of the blood, and published a frequently \nstudied book on the use of syrups in medicine. In spite of his \nsuccess, Michael made enemies through his insolent and contentious \ntone. He who denied the prophecies of the Old Testament made \nprophecies based on astrology.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1540 Michael opened a correspondence with John Calvin of Geneva, \nasking the reformer what it meant for Jesus to be the Son of God and \nhow a man was to be born again. He criticized Calvin's replies and \nstated that those who believed in the Trinity believed in the spirit \nof the dragon, the priests and the false prophets who make war on the \nlamb. He implied that he was the Michael, referred to in Revelation \n12:7 and Daniel 12:1, the one who was to fight the antichrist. Both \nJohn Calvin and the Pope were antichrists in Servetus' eyes. Calvin \nwrote to a friend that if Servetus ever fell into his hands, he would \nnot allow him to get away alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1553 Michael anonymously published The Restitution of Christianity \nwhich he saw as an attempt to restore Christianity to its primitive \npurity. In that work he boldly--or rashly--continued to deny the \nTrinity despite the danger it brought him. Denying the Trinity and \nthe incarnation of Christ were still capital offenses as they had \nbeen throughout the middle ages. Michael said Jesus was the Son of \nthe eternal God but not the eternal Son of God. Contrary to the \nreformers, he also taught that both faith and works were necessary \nfor salvation. He sent Calvin a portion of the work.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoman Catholic authorities in Vienne discovered the name of the \nRestitution's author because Calvin collaborated in denouncing him to \nthe Inquisition, and they arrested Michael for heresy. He escaped, \nhowever, and fled toward Naples by way of Calvin's Geneva. Vienne's \nauthorities burned him in effigy. He entered a church where Calvin \nwas preaching, was recognized, and arrested on charges of blasphemy \nand heresy, although he was not a citizen and was just passing \nthrough town. Was it legal for them to arrest him?\u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless, Michael was tried for heresy, this time by a Protestant \ncity council. He continued in an attitude of superior knowledge and \ncalled John Calvin \"Simon Magus\" an \"impostor,\" and more. Servetus \nshocked the Genevans with his pantheistic or gnostic claim that \neverything emanated from God, even the devil. Like the Anabaptists, \nhe declared infant baptism a great error. Geneva unfairly refused him \nlegal council although he was a stranger to its law system, saying he \ncould lie well enough without a lawyer to assist him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Geneva Council voted to condemn Servetus for heresy and called \nfor his execution. The Swiss churches of Berne, Zurich, Basle, and \nSchaffhausen encouraged this move. Although Calvin insisted with the \nrest that Servetus must die, he urged that in mercy Servetus be \nexecuted by the sword, not by burning, but the Council rejected the \nsuggestion. It was quarreling with Calvin at that time over the city \ngovernment. Calvin and reformer William Farel spent hours with \nServetus trying to turn him back from his lapses from commonly \naccepted Christian doctrine, but Servetus stood fast to his \nprinciples.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, October 27, 1553, Geneva burned Michael Servetus at the \nstake for blasphemy and heresy. In the flames, Michael called \nrepeatedly on Jesus, the Son of God for mercy. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeneva's action led to an immediate controversy among reformers \nwhether it is right for a reformation church to execute heretics. \nMost said it was not. Calvin took a lot of heat for his role in the \ndenunciation, trial and execution of Servetus and was not always \nhonest in his account of what had happened.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nBainton, Roland.

    "title": "MOTHER THERESA, SAINT OF DARKNESS",
    "words": "Like so many others around the world, I was overjoyed to hear of the \nrecent decision of the Vatican to canonize Mother Teresa, a woman \ngenerally recognized, during her lifetime, to be a \"living saint.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMother Teresa first came to my attention through Malcolm Muggeridge's \nfilm and attendant book Something Beautiful for God. Of course \nMuggeridge showed Mother's work with the dying and the poorest of the \npoor on the streets of Kolkata, but what moved me the most were the \nimages of the saint's smile amidst so much squalor and suffering. She \nwas a very bright light shining in exceptionally thick darkness.\u0014\n\u0014\nMother's life reveals so many aspects and profiles of holiness, but I \nwould like to focus on three of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, she shows something remarkable about love, which is not a \nsentiment but rather willing the good of the other. It is fair to say \nthat Mother Teresa went to extremes in demonstrating love in this \nproper sense. She renounced practically everything that, in the \nopinion of the world, makes life pleasant -- wealth, material goods, \npower, comforts, luxuries -- in order to be of service to those in \nneed. Further, for decades, she personally reached out to the most \nvulnerable in one of the worst slums in the world and sent her \nsisters to some of the most disagreeable places on the planet. Most \nof us, I imagine, manage to love to a degree, but few ever express \nthis theological virtue more dramatically and radically than she did. \nThis is not simply admirable, it constitutes a crucial witness to the \nnature of love. Unlike the other virtues, both natural and \ntheological, love has no limit. Justice, limitlessly expressed, \nexcludes all mercy; too much temperance becomes a fussy puritanism; \nexaggerated courage is rashness; unlimited faith is credulity; \ninfinite hope devolves into presumption. But there can never be too \nmuch love; there is never a time when love is inappropriate, for love \nis what God is, and love constitutes the very life of heaven. Mind \nyou, in heaven there is no need for faith and hope fades away. But in \nthat supremely holy place, love remains in all of its infinite \nintensity and radicality. Mother Teresa's way of life, accordingly, \nis an icon of the love that will obtain in heaven, when we are drawn \nutterly into the very life of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nA second feature of Mother's holiness is her dedication to prayer. \nWhen I visited the Mother House of the Missionaries of Charity in \nKolkata some years ago, what impressed me most was a life-size statue \nof Mother Teresa in the very back of the chapel, in the attitude she \ncustomarily assumed when she prayed: legs folded under her, palms \nfacing upward, head bowed. From the very beginning of her community, \nMother insisted that her sisters should engage in substantial amounts \nof prayer every day; and in time, she established a branch of her \norder dedicated exclusively to contemplative prayer. She understood \nsomething that is essential to the Christian spiritual life, namely, \nthat the kind of love she and her sisters endeavored to practice \ncould come only through the grace of God, only as a sheer gift. To \nget that gift, it was necessary to ask, to ask again, to beg one's \nwhole life long. Without this explicit connection to God and his \npurposes, their work, she knew, would turn into mere do-goodism, and \nthe egos of her sisters would inevitably assert themselves. Saints, \nthose who embody the love that God is, are necessarily beggars.\u0014\n\u0014\nI remarked above that Mother Teresa struck me as a light in the \nshadows. How mysterious, therefore, that she herself once said, \"If I \never become a saint, I will surely be a saint of darkness.\" She was \nreferring to something that only a handful of people knew in her \nlifetime, that for upwards of fifty years, Mother Teresa experienced \nthe pain of the absence of God. The living saint often felt abandoned \nby God or even that God does not exist. Once a visiting bishop was \nkneeling in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament with Mother and her \nnuns. A note was passed to him from the saintly foundress, which \nread, to his infinite surprise, \"Where is Jesus?\" That she lived \nthrough this crucible for decades, even as people routinely saw her \nas the very paragon of holiness, shows forth a third dimension of her \nsaintliness. To be a saint is to allow Christ to live his life in \nyou. Indeed, St. Paul said, \"It is no longer I who live, but Christ \nwho lives in me;\" and this means the whole Christ. Jesus was a person \nof service to the poor and needy, and Mother certainly embodied this \naspect of his life; Jesus was a person who prayed intently and for \nlong periods of time, and Mother participated in this dimension of \nhis existence. But Jesus was also the crucified Lord, who said, at \nthe limit of his suffering, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken \nme?\" To allow Christ to live his life in you is, therefore, \nnecessarily to experience, to one degree or another, the absence of \nGod, to undergo the agony of the crucifixion in all of its \ndimensions. St. John of the Cross, the greatest mystical theologian \nin the Church's history said, quite simply, that there is no path to \nholiness that does not lead through the cross. Though it is a high \nparadox, the fifty-year darkness that Mother endured is, therefore, \none of the surest indicators of her saintliness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaints exist for the Church, for in them we see the very raison \nd'etre of the Church, and this is why canonizations are always joyful \naffairs. So let us rejoice in this new saint whose love, prayer, and \nvery darkness, are light for us.\u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Robert Barron is an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los \nAngeles and the founder of Word on Fire.\u0014",

    "words": "You might as well know the end of the story now. Cannibals o\u0014\nGoaribari Island in the South Seas ate James Chalmers on April 8 o\u0014\n1901. But his death matched his life--both were invested in passion\u0014\nately inviting benighted souls to come freely to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Chalmers heard God's call to missionary service as a teen. His Sco\u0014\ntish pastor read a letter one Sunday from the Fiji Islands, telling \nof th\u0014\ngospel's power to transform cannibals, followed by an appeal for mor\u0014\nworkers. James resolved then and there to go.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Never doubting his earlier call to missions. In 1866, he sailed \nfor the South Pa-\u0014\ncific as a Presbyterian missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\n    Chalmers had a way with people. \"It was in his presence, his car-\u0014\nriage, his eye, his voice,\" a friend wrote. \"There was something \nalmost\u0014\nhypnotic about him. His perfect composure, his judgment and tact and\u0014\nfearlessness brought him through a hundred difficulties.\" Robert Louis\u0014\nStevenson, who didn't like missionaries until he met Chalmers, said,\u0014\n\"He is a rowdy, but he is a hero. You can't weary me of that fellow. \nHe\u0014\ntook me fairly by storm.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n    In 1877, Chalmers sailed on to New Guinea. His ministry was suc-\u0014\ncessful there. Packed churches replaced feasts of human flesh. But as\u0014\nthe years passed, he grew lonely. He was delighted when young Oliver\u0014\nTomkins came to join him in 1901. The two men decided to explore a\u0014\nnew part of the islands, and on Easter Sunday they sailed alongside a\u0014\nnew village. The next morning, Chalmers and Tomkins went ashore.\u0014\nThey were never seen again. A rescue party soon learned that the men\u0014\nhad been clubbed to death, chopped to pieces, cooked, and eaten.\u0014\n\u0014\n    In all, James Chalmers established 130 mission stations throughout\u0014\nNew Guinea, and thousands came to Christ, including 64 men who be-\u0014\ncame pastors, preachers, and missionaries.\u0014",

    "title": "MORMONS AND CHRISITIANS: SO CLOSE YET SO FAR AWAY",
    "words": "A book review of The Mormon Jesus: A Biography by John G. Turner\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat should we make of claims that the two faiths are on a path to \nreconciling? \u0014\n\u0014\nGerald McDermott/ September 7, 2016  Reviewer\u0014\n\u0014\nFor nearly 200 years, Mormons have both enraged and intrigued \nevangelicals. The rage has come from Mormon claims that the Book of \nMormon contains new revelation superseding and correcting the Bible, \nand that Christians are apostates from the apostolic church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe intrigue has come from the fact that Latter-day Saints (LDS) are \nso similar and yet so different. The Book of Mormon is remarkably \nChrist-focused, and presents a godhead resembling the Trinity. Yet \nlater teachings by Joseph Smith deny the Trinity and claim that God \nthe Father has both a physical body and his own father. Evangelicals \nhave always been fascinated by Mormon beliefs that the Garden of Eden \nwas in Missouri, that the New Jerusalem will be located nearby, and \nthat American Indians are descended from the ancient Israelites.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow the Internet buzzes with new debate over (president emeritus of \nFuller Seminary) Richard Mouws pronouncement at First Things that \nMormons are moving closer to historic Christian orthodoxy. LDS \nleaders, he proposes, are downplaying the Mormon teaching that God \nwas once a man. A participant in Mormon-evangelical dialogue \nresponded that, on the contrary, this teaching remains on the LDS \nChurch website and LDS leaders are still teaching that God and humans \nare of the same species. Then a professor at Brigham Young University \nproclaimed that the LDS has no intention of revising its doctrine of \nGod and humans sharing the same species, or of moving toward \northodoxy. A leading LDS intellectual added that Joseph Smiths \nrevelation of God once being a man was one of the great corrections \nthat Christian orthodoxy would do well to adopt. Southern Baptist \nRichard Land interpreted this to mean that the Mormon Jesus is not \nour Jesus because the former is not eternal. Land promptly got his \nhand slapped by Mormon religion scholar Jana Riess for getting his \nfacts wrong: The Mormon Jesus, she chided, is indeed eternal.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeeling Back the History\u0014\n\u0014\nInto this swirling controversy a bombshell has dropped that will send \nevangelicals and Mormons alike scurrying for biblical cover: John G. \nTurners The Mormon Jesus: A Biography. Turner, professor of \nreligious studies at George Mason University and the author of \naward-winning books on Bill Bright and Brigham Young, peels back the \nhistory of Mormon beliefs about Jesus. What he finds will shock \nevangelicals and might embarrass Mormons.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost shocking is Turners discovery that many, perhaps most, \n19th-century Mormon leaders taught that while on earth, Jesus had \nmarried, and had taken more than one woman as his wife. Their \nreasoning went like this: If Joseph Smith had taught that Jesus did \neverything necessary for exaltation to godhood, and that plural \nmarriage was required for the highest level of exaltation, then \nJesus must have married several women and sired children by them. For \nexample, near the turn of the 20th century Joseph F. Smith (who would \nlater become a president of the church) preached a sermon on the \nwedding at Cana, declaring that Jesus was the Bridegroom and Mary \nand Martha the brides.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe LDS church officially renounced polygamy in 1890 in church \npresident Wilford Woodruffs Manifesto. Turner gives evidence that \nsome leaders continued entering plural marriages nevertheless, and \nthat Woodruff did not reject polygamy as a principle, but made it \nclear to American politicians that he intended to do what was \nrequired to avoid the churchs dissolution. Yet polygamy has been \ncondemned by LDS authorities ever since, and the polygamous Jesus \ndisappeared from LDS discourse in the 20th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurner suggests, however, that a married Jesus is a logical \nconsequence of LDS teaching that Jesus is a member of our species who \nbecame a god by achieving the highest level of exaltation. When three \nMormon scholars debunked The Da Vinci Code in 2007, they conceded \nthat a married Jesus is impossible to assert without clear scriptural \nevidence. But they added that it would not bother modern disciples \nwho are firmly rooted in the doctrines and ordinances of the kingdom \nto find out one day that Jesus was married while on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nA Goldmine of Fascinating Nuggets\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Mormon Jesus contains other startling revelations. One is the \ninspiration that Smith derived from Freemasonry. He founded a \nMasonic lodge in Nauvoo, Illinois (where the early Mormon community \nfled to escape conflict with the Missouri government), and was \nhimself raised to the rank of Master Mason two years before his \ndeath. Smith taught his associates that Mormon priesthood represented \nthe true recovery of ancient Christian principles imperfectly \npreserved in Masonic rites. Turner points out that Mormon temple \ngarments continue to display the Masonic symbols of a square and a \ncompass.\u0014\n\u0014\nReaders might be surprised to learn of the Mormon Jesus role in \nconflicts between Joseph and Emma Smith, his first wife. According to \nTurner, the Smiths clashed repeatedly over Josephs additional \nmarriages, usually entered into without her knowledge or consent. \nEmma appears to have gotten revenge by starting a relationship with \nSmiths confidante William Clayton. Joseph then told Emma he had \nreceived a revelation from Jesus instructing her to cleave unto my \nservant Joseph, to no one else. Otherwise, Jesus threatened, she \nshall be destroyed. Turner notes that after Smiths murder in 1844, \nEmma denied that Joseph had ever practiced polygamy, a testimony to \nthe depth of her opposition.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurners depiction of LDS views on Jesus atonement is not \nparticularly new, but most Christians will be startled to learn that \nby the 1980s, the Mormon consensus was that the principal scene of \nChrists suffering and atonement was at Gethsemane rather than on the \ncross. According to Mormon theologian Bruce McConkie, Jesus had \nalready atoned for human sin before he died on the cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book is a gold mine of fascinating historical nuggets. Here are \na few: Early Mormons used bread and wine at Communion (now they use \nbread and water), Joseph Smith did not look at the golden plates but \nused them for inspiration during most of his translation of the \nBook of Mormon, he taught that God created worlds without number, \nand Brigham Young was convinced for most of his life that Adam is \nhumanitys God and divine Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nUtterly Christian?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Turner has a thesis, it is that todays Mormonism is thoroughly \nChristian. As he puts it, LDS teaching falls within most common and \ncommonsense definitions of Christianity. Mormonism, on this \nunderstanding, is not just a new religious tradition or new world \nreligion, as some scholars have called it. Rather, it is firmly \nanchored to the Christian savior. The Mormon Jesus is both \ndistinctively Mormon and utterly Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nReally?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is telling that in an endnote Turner includes the Jehovahs \nWitnesses in his commonsense definition of Christian. Yet \nJehovahs Witnesses insist that Jesus is not fully God, not equal to \nthe Father. Like Mormons, they reject the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, Mormons say that Jesus is fully God and equal to \nthe Father. But they also say that God the Father and Jesus are two \ndifferent beings, two different gods, each with flesh and bones. The \nsame, they teach, is true of the Holy Ghost (Mormons use the King \nJames phrasing).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut for Joseph Smith, Jesus was not always God. The Mormon founder \nsaid it was revealed to him that Jesus grew into being God. This is \nnothing new to Mormons or students of Mormonism. But it is crucial to \nany question about whether the Mormon Jesusor Mormonism generallyis \nChristian.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor most Christians in the last 2,000 years, Jesus identity was \ndefined by the New Testament. A Jesus who did not conform to the \nJesus of the New Testament was by definition not the Christian Jesus. \nOne of the early church heresies was adoptionism, which held that \nJesus was originally a mere man but later adopted by God at his \nbaptism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAgainst adoptionists the church fathers pointed to New Testament \ntestimony that Jesus was always God: In the beginning was the Word, \nand the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1). Luke \ntells us that as a boy Jesus grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52), but the \nchurch has taught that this means his human nature was instructed by \nhis own divinity (Jerome), or that while remaining divine he made \nhis own the progress of humans in wisdom and grace (John of \nDamascus). As Athanasius argued in his battles with the Arians, there \nnever was a time when God the Son was not God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat about the Mormon teaching that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost \nare three distinct gods? The Bible teaches, on the contrary, that \nthere is only one God. It calls both the Father and the Son God, \nbut never refers to them as two gods. It says God is the Savior of \nall men (1 Tim. 4:10), and teaches that the Son saves by the power of \nthe Spirit, but the three are never called three saviors. Scripture \nnever refers to the Creator or Redeemer in the plural, although it \ndoes use the plural for men, women, angels, devils, demons, and \nprincipalities and powers. This is true in both Testaments: God asks, \nIs there any God besides me? (Isa. 44:8), and declares, I am God, \nand there is no other (Isa. 45:22). The psalmist cries, You alone \nare God (86:10). Jesus himself quotes the Old Testament, The Lord \nour God, the Lord is one (Mark 12:29), thus affirming its insistence \non monotheism.\u0014\n\u0014\nTherefore, there is no way we can say that Jesus was not always God \nor that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three different gods \nunless we read the New Testament through the lens of later Mormon \nrevelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo is the Mormon Jesus utterly Christian, as Turner puts it? Not if \nChristian is defined by a plain-sense reading of the New Testament \nand the historic teaching of orthodox Christian churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nGerald McDermott is Anglican Chair of Divinity at Beeson Divinity \nSchool, and co-author of Evangelicals and Mormons: Exploring the \nBoundaries (Regent College Publishing).\u0014",

    "title": "MOTHER THERESA SOMETIMES DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GOD",
    "words": "Mother Teresa sometimes didn't believe in God. That makes her an \nexample of faith.\u0014\nPascal-Emmanuel Gobry   The Week  Sept. 7, 2016\u0014\n\u0014\nMother Teresa might be the most famous, and most widely admired, \nCatholic personality of the 20th century. And on Sunday, she was \ncanonized by Pope Francis.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Catholic Church makes saints to hold up as examples to the \nfaithful. Every Christian is supposed to imitate Jesus in their own \nlife, but what does it mean to do so as, say, a soldier, a doctor, a \nrich man, a poor man, a woman, a husband, a wife, a son? The saints \nof the Catholic Church provide countless examples, an infinite and \nendlessly fractal portrait of what it means to live a life dedicated \nto what is true, good, and beautiful  something that should interest \nall of us.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, what kind of example does Mother Teresa set? One of dedication of \none's entire life to what Jesus called \"the least of these\"  not \njust the poor in the financial sense, but all those marginalized, in \nevery sense of the term. Controversy about her work with the poor is \na bunch of political nonsense, as any cool-headed analysis of the \nfacts shows.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there's another aspect of Mother Teresa's life that is slowly \ncoming into focus: her struggles with faith. She spent a long period \nof her life  decades, in fact  struggling with faith, losing the \npresence of God, and even believing that she didn't believe in God, \nas she wrote in many pained, distressed, poignant letters that were \nonly released after her death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's easy to conclude that this makes her a hypocrite, and indeed \nTeresa reports sometimes feeling like one. But according to Catholic \nspirituality, this is all normal  indeed, to be expected. And it's a \nstore of wisdom, for those with eyes to see.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Mother Teresa's experience was unusual in terms of its \nlength, it was not at all unusual for the great saints in terms of \nits existence, or its depth. According to classical Catholic \nspirituality, the road to spiritual enlightenment includes what the \ngreat spiritual master Saint John of the Cross famously called \"the \ndark night of the soul.\" Yes, faith and the spiritual life can be \nexhilarating. Prayer can give us great experiences. But what are you \nafter? Are you after God, or are you after how awesome it feels to be \nafter God? The only way to answer that question is for God to strip \nus of the experience of his presence, of the feel-goody aspects of \nthe spiritual life. Indeed, all of the great spiritual traditions  \nnot just Catholic, not just Christian, not just Western  say \nenlightenment must be preceded by a process of purification, of \nstripping away of the unnecessary, and this process can be very \npainful.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's another aspect of the Catholic worldview  which has helped \nme personally so much over the years  that is worth considering when \nthinking about Mother Teresa's faith struggles: a focus on objective \nreality as opposed to subjective feelings. The history of Catholic \nmysticism is full of incredible stories of visions and other strange \nmystical experiences. While the tradition allows that these can \nhappen, all of the spiritual masters teach us to disregard them. The \nonly criterion for whether your prayer life is successful, writes the \ncontemporary spiritual master Sister Ruth Burrows, OCD, is whether it \nmakes you a more charitable and loving person, not whether it feels \ngood or bad. Someone whose prayer life feels empty and grinding, as \nit does for so many of us, but who is a loving person, has a better \nprayer life than someone who has lovely spiritual experiences but is \na shrew. Mother Teresa showed us that in spades.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians talk a lot about \"faith.\" At points of her life, Mother \nTeresa did not believe that she believed in God. Does that mean she \ndidn't have faith? Well, she was an ordained sister in the Catholic \nChurch, and she devoted her life to following the teachings of Jesus. \nObjectively, she was a Christian, no matter what she subjectively \nbelieved. She practiced what a friend of mine once called \"the faith \nof the body\" as opposed to the \"faith of the mind,\" a concept \ncaptured by the proverb \"Act as though ye had faith, and faith shall \nbe given to you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf people ever stop trying to match what they subjectively believe \nwith what they objectively do, yes, they become hypocrites. But until \nthen,they are exercising what Aristotle called the virtues: the idea \nthat our moral and psychological faculties are muscles, and that you \nneed to practice them. What makes you a kind person isn't how kind \nyou feel, it's the kind acts you do. And doing kind things for those \naround you, even when you don't feel like it, even though it's work, \nmakes you a more meritorious person than someone for whom it comes \neasily.\u0014",

    "title": "MICHAEL, THE ARCHANGEL",
    "words": "Many Americans are caught up in a craze to know more about angels. \nBooks galore are available on the subject. Popular shows, such as the \nmany episodes of Touched by an Angel, or the Christmas movie A Season \nfor Miracles have introduced angels into their plots.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel craze is not all bad. No doubt we should learn something \nabout these majestic and powerful beings, for, as God's messengers, \nangels played important roles in both the Old and New Testaments. \nSeveral kinds are mentioned in the Bible, including cherubim and \nseraphim. However, because they are created beings, they are never to \nbe worshipped--and God's good angels will never accept such worship, \nalthough fallen angels will.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Middle Ages, Christians also were interested in angels. In \nfact, they set apart this day, September 29, as the feast day of \nMichael the archangel, a day the English call Michaelmas. Later, \nGabriel, the angel who announced the birth of Jesus to Mary, was \nadded to the feast, as was Raphael, an angel mentioned in the \napocryphal book of Tobit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is only one archangel mentioned in the commonly accepted books \nof the Bible and that is Michael. He is the powerful being who led \nGod's armies to throw Satan out of heaven. Whereas Satan (Lucifer) \ntried to seize God's place, Michael's name reflects his humility, for \nit means \"Who is like God?\" The term archangel implies that Michael \nis an angel over the other angels, just as an archbishop is a bishop \nover other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Daniel, Michael is also the special protector of the \nJews. He will stand up in their behalf in the last days.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little book of Jude also tells us that Michael once had to \ndispute with Satan for Moses' body. Those who mock Satan should be \nwary, for we are warned that even Michael did not dare to do so, but \ninstead called upon the Lord to rebuke the fiend.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Paul we learn that the archangel will give the shout when Christ \nreturns at his second coming. At this shout the dead will rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Angel\" and \"Michael.\" Pictorial Bible Dictionary. Edited by Merrill \nC. Tenney.

Christ warned that no man knows that day and \nhour. This has not stopped rash theologians from announcing dates. \nAll have subsequently been disappointed by events. One of the most \nprominent prediction makers was Baptist preacher William Miller.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiller gained a large following, predicting that Christ would return \non this day, October 22, 1844. His theories were not far-fetched if \none accepted interpretations in vogue through much of church history. \nThe argument goes something like this: The prophet Daniel's eighth \nchapter speaks of 2,300 days. Many of the greatest scholars of the \nchurch (Augustine and Bede for example) took these days to stand for \nyears. 490 years (the seventy \"weeks\" mentioned in Daniel 9:24) were \n\"cut off\" from the 2,300 years, leaving 1810 years. It was assumed \nthat Christ died early in 31 ad. with 3-1/2 years of Daniel's 70th \nweek still to run. Adding those 3-1/2 years to 31 ad. brings us to \nlate 34 ad, at which time the 1810 remaining years supposedly began. \n1810 + 34 brings us to 1844. Technical considerations placed the date \nin October 1844.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder this interpretation, it seemed possible to match actual \nhistorical events with the sequence of events in Daniel chapter \neleven. Byzantium, the pope, Egypt, Turkey, France and other \ncountries, supposedly fulfilled various predictions derived from the \nBible. The whole argument was developed at length and convinced vast \nnumbers of people.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs many as 100,000 followers gathered at the predicted time in \nmakeshift temples and on hillsides to \"meet the bridegroom.\" Maxwell \nPierson Gaddis attended one of these rallies and reported the result. \nWhen midnight came and Christ had not returned, people grew restless. \nSome walked out. One person said allowance must be made for \ndifferences of latitude and longitude between Palestine and the US. \nAt about one o'clock one of the leaders rose and said \"I never did \nfix upon the precise time myself, and I always told my brethren they \nwould get into trouble if they did; but they would not listen to me, \nbut followed other leaders...I believe the most important thing after \nall is, to be ready...\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHumiliated by what has been called \"The Great Disappointment,\" some \nMillerites shucked their faith completely. Led by Miller, others \nformed the Adventists. The majority returned to more traditional \nchurches. \u0014\n\u0014\n>Resources\u0014\n\u0014\nGaddis, Maxwell Pierson. Foot-Prints of an Itinerant.

    "title": "MAGI, WISEMEN OR KINGS? IT'S COMPLICATED",
    "words": "Magi, Wise Men, or Kings? It's Complicated. \u0014\nChristian tradition finds meaning in each of these mysterious \nmonikers.\u0014\nChad Ashby\u0014\n\u0014\nThey're the three men in glittering velvet robes and fake beards in \nthe living nativity at church. Sometimes they tow a live camel. \nBearing gifts, they traversed afar, following yonder star through the \nback of the sanctuary in the grand crescendo of our beloved annual \nChristmas pageant. I'm speaking, of course, of the Magi. Or is it \nwise men? Wait, kings?\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps if Luke the historian had written about them in his Christmas \naccount, we might have had precise details. But Matthew's account is \nvague, shrouded in mystery: Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of \nJudea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east \ncame to Jerusalem (Matt. 2:1).\u0014\n\u0014\nIntrigue swirls around these festooned foreigners. Where did they \ncome from? With a wink Matthew writes, the East. Indeed, his \ndescription is so utterly specific that church traditions in dozens \nof countries claim to be their country of origin. And who were they? \nTechnically speaking, Matthew calls them magibut what are magi? Are \nthey kings? Wise men? Sorcerers? Astrologers?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have been trying to nail down their identity for \nmillennia. As early as A.D. 200, Tertullian was laying out arguments \nthat the Magi, while astrologers by trade, were considered kings. To \nthe contrary, John Calvin felt strongly about anyone who would label \nthem three kings: Beyond all doubt, they have been stupefied by a \nrighteous judgment of God, that all might laugh at [their] gross \nignorance. Adding a further wrinkle, first-century naturalist Pliny \nthe Elder wrote several chapters about the Magi wherein they sound \nmore like something from a Harry Potter novel. He details their skill \nin magic artsincluding pouring boiled earthworms in the ear to cure \na toothache!\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the disagreement, here are a few facts. The word magus is of \nPersian origin; however, Basil indicated that they were not confined \nto a specific empire but scattered all over the country. \nFirst-century Jewish historian Philo referred to Balaam from Numbers \n2224 as a magus. This anachronism indicates that by the first \ncentury A.D. it may have been adopted for more general use. \nHerodotus's accounts of magi in his Histories (440 B.C.) portrays \nthem as conniving political figures vying for royal power. Various \nkings in the ancient world frequently consulted these men because of \ntheir skill in interpreting omens, signs, and the stars.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese external witnesses corroborate the picture of magi we see in \nthe Old Testament. The Persians and their magi crop up in the \nbiblical timeline in the days of Daniel and Esther. One particular \nstatement concerning King Xerxes's magi might raise an eyebrow: Then \nthe king said to the wise men who knew the timesthe men next to him \nbeingthe seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, \nand sat first in the kingdom (Esther 1:1314). These seven \nmenclearly magiare also labeled wise men and princes. So, are \nthe titles interchangeable? And what do they signify?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we reconsider these familiar Christmas characters, could it be \nMatthew was being intentionally vague with his coy magi from the \nEast?\u0014\n\u0014\nCall Them Magi.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term magi is the precise Greek word used in Matthew's gospel. His \nstory demonstrates that the Magi were astrologers and interpreters of \nomensfollowing a star and dreaming dreams. When they arrived in \nJerusalem, their curt bluntness had King Herod spitting out his \nmorning coffee: Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For \nwe saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him (Matt. \n2:2).\u0014\n\u0014\nThese visitors were like a blast from the Hebrews' past. The book of \nDaniel chronicles how he and his companions spent 70 years exiled \namong magi in the East. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was in the \nhabit of gathering the best and brightest from his vanquished foes \ninto an advisory body of wise men, stargazers, and dreamers. When he \ncaptured Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, he added them to his \nmenagerie of magi, and in every matter of wisdom and understanding \nabout which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better \nthan all the magicians and enchanters (Greek magi) in his whole \nkingdom (Dan. 1:20).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one episode from the book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar had an ominous \ndream. Summoning his magi and enchanters, he demanded, If you do not \ntell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into \npieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble (2:5). When the \nmagi only succeeded in coming up with excuses, Daniel rescued them \nall with the dream and interpretation from the Lord. In awestruck \ngratitude, the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished \nmany gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of \nBabylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men (2:48).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe whole episode with Daniel and the magi should feel like biblical \ndj vu. Another famous Old Testament king had a penchant for keeping \nhis court packed with wise men, astrologers, and magicians: Pharaoh \nof Egypt. Genesis tells of a young man named Joseph who was carted \noff to exile in Egypt. One night Pharaoh awoke from a terrifying \ndream. He found that none of his magicians could provide an \ninterpretation. It was Joseph, the Hebrew exile in prison, who \nprovided Pharaoh with God's interpretation. In response, Pharaoh \nclothed Joseph like a king, and they called out before him, 'Bow the \nknee!' Thus [Pharaoh] set him over all the land of Egypt (Gen. \n41:43, ESV). Long before Daniel, Joseph knew what it was like to have \nmagi bow before him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you call Matthew's journeymen magi this Christmas, don't be \nsurprised to find them bowing before a Hebrew and heralding him as \nking. At Jesus's birth, recognize how the tables have turned. This \ntime, a star led the Magi into exile, sojourning in search of the \nscepter rising out of Israel (Num. 24:17). This time, they do not \nfind a man seated at the right hand of Pharaoh or Nebuchadnezzar, but \na child seated on his mother's lap. As they bow and worship, they \nbecome the first to recognize the end from the beginning. This child \nwould surpass both Daniel and Joseph as chief of the magi: And Jesus \ncame and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been \ngiven to me' (Matt. 28:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nCall Them Wise Men.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the word magi feels a little too foreign for you. Have no \nfear! Wise men is a perfectly acceptable translation. Cicero \ndescribes magi as being wise and learned men among the Persians. In \nfact, the Hebrew word wise men is used much more frequently in the \nOld Testament to designate this class of astrological advisors. \nGentile kings valued these men for their wisdom concerning the \naffairs of the kingdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the early church fathers saw significance in wise men \nbringing gold, frankincense, and myrrh from the East. In the \nestimation of Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian \nthese gifts were particularly Arabian in nature. Martin Luther \nagreed. He writes concerning the wise men, At first they did not \nconsider this king to be God, but in the usual manner took him \n[Jesus] for a temporal king, just as the queen of Sheba considered \nSolomon a king, coming to him with presents from her country. Luther \nread Matthew 2 and thought: Foreigners from Arabia bringing gifts and \nseeking wisdom in Jerusalem? We've heard this story before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe story echoed in the wise men of Matthew 2 comes from 1 Kings 10: \nWhen the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his \nrelationship to the Lord, she came to test Solomon with hard \nquestions. Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravanwith \ncamels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious \nstonesshe came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had \non her mind. During her visit, the depth of Solomon's wisdom took \nher breath away: In wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the \nreport I heard (1 Kings 10:7). Laying her gifts of gold, spice, and \nprecious stones before him, she blessed the Lord for making Solomon \nking.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe you prefer to call the visitors bearing treasure chests of \ngold, frankincense, and myrrh wise men this Christmas. As you do, \nfollow them in the footsteps of the queen of Sheba across the \nwilderness in search of the wisdom of God in Jerusalem. However, as \nMatthew tells it, the wisdom of God was not to be found in the king's \npalace in Jerusalem, but in the small town of Bethlehem. As you watch \nthem lay their gifts before baby Jesus, realize that something \ngreater than Solomon is here (Matt. 12:42). This little child is \nhimself the Wisdom of God. May you join the Arabian Queen in her \nprayer: Because of the Lord's eternal love for Israel, he has made \nyou king to maintain justice and righteousness (1 Kings 10:9).\u0014\n\u0014\nCall Them Kings.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what of calling them kings? After all, they always wear crowns in \nour Christmas pageants, and we all know the carol We Three Kings. \nThe medieval church heavily preferred this designationmuch to the \ndismay of many of the Reformers. But Matthew's Magi would not be the \nfirst wise men to be considered kings: Joseph and Danielboth Hebrew \nmagi of sortswere elevated to royal status. We also find magi \nreceiving royal honors elsewhere in ancient literature. In Histories, \nHerodotus chronicles a bizarre episode in the Persian Empire where \ntwo magi brothers staged a coup for royal power. After King Smerdis \ndied, one of the magi, also named Smerdiswho bore a striking \nresemblance to the late kingsat on the throne as an impersonator!\u0014\n\u0014\nAs early as the second century Tertullian considered the Magi to be \nkings. He argued their visit fulfilled Solomon's prayer in Psalm \n72May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts. But \nTertullian found Isaiah 60 to be the most compelling evidence: \nNations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your \ndawnand all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and incense and \nproclaiming the praise of the Lord. It's impossible to miss the \nclear parallels to Matthew 2.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe may never know whether the Magi were literal kings, but the idea \nof kings bringing treasure from Babylon is a compelling way to \nenvision the beginning of Matthew's gospel. In the days of Isaiah, \nKing Hezekiah received a friendly envoy of Babylonians in Jerusalem. \nIn a moment of hubris, he showed them the silver, the gold, the \nspices, the fine olive oilhis entire armory and everything found \namong his treasures (Isa. 39:2). Isaiah warned Hezekiah that these \nBabylonians had made a mental note of his storehouses: The time will \nsurely come when everything in your palace, and all that your \u0014\npredecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to \nBabylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord (Isa. 39:6). Sure \nenough, in 587 B.C. the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, did just \nthat, capturing and plundering Jerusalem. In fact, Daniel recounts a \nraucous party in the Babylonian capital where the Babylonian king \nused the golden cups from the Lord's temple to take shots (Dan. \n5:1-4).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, if you prefer to call the Magi kings this Advent season, \nrecognize how you are proclaiming the return of Jerusalem's \ntreasuries from exile. As these kings travel the road from Babylon in \nthe East to Jerusalem, they bring back the gold, frankincense, and \nmyrrh stolen so many years before from David's house. This is what \nIsaiah promised would happen. The same foreigners that looted \nJerusalem would one day, rebuild [her] walls, and their kings will \nserve [her] (Isa. 60:10). Matthew shows us that what Nehemiah and \nEzra experienced under Cyrus the Persian was a mere foretaste of the \nriches God would return to his Messiah in Jerusalem. At Christmas, \nthe kings bring the treasures back to Jerusalem. It signals the \nbeginning of the eternal restoration of David's wealth, the \nrebuilding of David's city, and the rejoicing of David's people.\u0014\n\u0014\nCall them Magi. Call them wise men. You can even call them kings if \nyou'd like! When it comes to Matthew's Christmas narrative, the more \nthe merrier. Each label shines a light on a different facet of the \nstory. Whatever you choose to call them this holiday season, these \nmen are the first in the canonical New Testament to bow and worship \nthe Lord Jesus. This Christmas we would do well to follow their \nexample.\u0014\n\u0014\nChad Ashby is a pastor at College Street Baptist Church in Newberry, \nSouth Carolina, and writes regularly at \\After+Math He is a graduate \nof Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Grove City College.\u0014",

Popular shows, such as the \nmany episodes of Touched by an Angel, or the Christmas movie A Season \nfor Miracles have introduced angels into their plots.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel craze is not all bad. No doubt we should learn something \nabout these majestic and powerful beings, for, as God's messengers, \nangels played important roles in both the Old and New Testaments. \nSeveral kinds are mentioned in the Bible, including cherubim and \nseraphim. However, because they are created beings, they are never to \nbe worshipped--and God's good angels will never accept such worship, \nalthough fallen angels will.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Middle Ages, Christians also were interested in angels. In \nfact, they set apart this day, September 29, as the feast day of \nMichael the archangel, a day the English call Michaelmas. Later, \nGabriel, the angel who announced the birth of Jesus to Mary, was \nadded to the feast, as was Raphael, an angel mentioned in the \napocryphal book of Tobit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is only one archangel mentioned in the commonly accepted books \nof the Bible and that is Michael. He is the powerful being who led \nGod's armies to throw Satan out of heaven. Whereas Satan (Lucifer) \ntried to seize God's place, Michael's name reflects his humility, for \nit means \"Who is like God?\" The term archangel implies that Michael \nis an angel over the other angels, just as an archbishop is a bishop \nover other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Daniel, Michael is also the special protector of the \nJews. He will stand up in their behalf in the last days.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little book of Jude also tells us that Michael once had to \ndispute with Satan for Moses' body. Those who mock Satan should be \nwary, for we are warned that even Michael did not dare to do so, but \ninstead called upon the Lord to rebuke the fiend.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Paul we learn that the archangel will give the shout when Christ \nreturns at his second coming.

    "title": "MASSACHUSETTS LAW AGAINST QUAKERS",
    "words": "Religion was taken seriously in the seventeenth century in Europe and \nAmerica because most people still believed that their faith dealt \nwith issues of truth, not simply the opinions of men. In the colony \nof Massachusetts there were strict laws governing the religious \nbeliefs of society. If you didn't agree with those beliefs, the \ncolonial leaders thought you should go live somewhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuakers were frequently asked to leave Massachusetts. The group had \nbeen founded in the 1640s by the Englishman George Fox. After finding \nno peace for his soul in the churches of his day, Fox had begun to \ngive up all hope when he had the experience of a voice speaking to \nhim. He believed that this inner voice was the voice of God, and that \nhe could receive direct revelation through the Holy Spirit. Fox began \nspeaking of hie new, inward spiritual faith, and the Society of \nFriends--known as Quakers--followed his teachings. They emphasized \nthe direct revelation of Christ to the individual's soul and \nminimized an ordained ministry and the traditional forms of worship \nin the church. Many Christians objected to the Quakers' belief in an \ninner revelation separate from the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 1656, the ship Swallow anchored in Boston harbor with two \nQuaker women from Barbados on board. The two women, Mary Fisher and \nAnn Austin, had come to Boston to share their Quaker faith. When they \nlanded, however, they were kept on board the ship while their \nbelongings were searched and over 100 books were confiscated. They \nwere then hurried off to jail where they were stripped of their \nclothing and inspected for signs of witchcraft. Five weeks later, the \ncaptain of the Swallow was placed under 100 bond to take the women \nback to Barbados. But two days later, another ship with eight more \nQuakers came to dock! These Quakers were imprisoned for eleven weeks \nbefore they were shipped back to England. They were able to convert \none man to their Quaker faith, Nicholas Upsall, but he fled to Rhode \nIsland to avoid punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the influx of Quakers, on this day October 14, 1656, \nMassachusetts enacted a law against the \"cursed sect of heretics \nlately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers...\" \nIt declared that any shipmaster bringing a Quaker into the colony \nwould be fined 100. Any colonist possessing a Quaker book would be \nfined 5. Any Quaker coming within the jurisdiction of the colony \nwould be arrested, whipped, and transported out of the colony without \nconversing with anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, some Quakers felt they simply had to share their beliefs in \nMassachusetts. Robert Fowler built a small craft, the Woodhouse, and \nloaded it with Quakers bound for New England. They landed in Rhode \nIsland, and some entered Massachusetts to spread their views. Quaker \nMary Clark went to Boston to test the law, and she soon had twenty \nstripes of a 3-corded whip \"laid on with fury\" and then spent twelve \nweeks in prison. Even so, the Quakers continued to arrive. So, in \nOctober, 1658, stronger laws were passed. Between 1659 and 1661, four \nQuakers were sent to the gallows.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen King Charles II heard of that, he said all Quakers were to be \nsent to England for trial. There were no more Quaker hangings in \nMassachusetts, and no Quakers were sent to England for trial; but \npunishments and deportations from the colony continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nJones, Louis Thomas. \"The Quakers of Iowa.\" Iowa History Project. \nhttp://iagenweb.org/history/qoi/QOIPt1Chp2.htm.

Christ warned that no man knows that day and \nhour. This has not stopped rash theologians from announcing dates. \nAll have subsequently been disappointed by events. One of the most \nprominent prediction makers was Baptist preacher William Miller.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiller gained a large following, predicting that Christ would return \non this day, October 22, 1844. His theories were not far-fetched if \none accepted interpretations in vogue through much of church history. \nThe argument goes something like this: The prophet Daniel's eighth \nchapter speaks of 2,300 days. Many of the greatest scholars of the \nchurch (Augustine and Bede for example) took these days to stand for \nyears. 490 years (the seventy \"weeks\" mentioned in Daniel 9:24) were \n\"cut off\" from the 2,300 years, leaving 1810 years. It was assumed \nthat Christ died early in 31 ad. with 3-1/2 years of Daniel's 70th \nweek still to run. Adding those 3-1/2 years to 31 ad. brings us to \nlate 34 ad, at which time the 1810 remaining years supposedly began. \n1810 + 34 brings us to 1844. Technical considerations placed the date \nin October 1844.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder this interpretation, it seemed possible to match actual \nhistorical events with the sequence of events in Daniel chapter \neleven. Byzantium, the pope, Egypt, Turkey, France and other \ncountries, supposedly fulfilled various predictions derived from the \nBible. The whole argument was developed at length and convinced vast \nnumbers of people.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs many as 100,000 followers gathered at the predicted time in \nmakeshift temples and on hillsides to \"meet the bridegroom.\" Maxwell \nPierson Gaddis attended one of these rallies and reported the result. \nWhen midnight came and Christ had not returned, people grew restless. \nSome walked out. One person said allowance must be made for \ndifferences of latitude and longitude between Palestine and the US. \nAt about one o'clock one of the leaders rose and said \"I never did \nfix upon the precise time myself, and I always told my brethren they \nwould get into trouble if they did; but they would not listen to me, \nbut followed other leaders...I believe the most important thing after \nall is, to be ready...\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHumiliated by what has been called \"The Great Disappointment,\" some \nMillerites shucked their faith completely. Led by Miller, others \nformed the Adventists. The majority returned to more traditional \nchurches. \u0014\n\u0014\nResources\u0014\n\u0014\nGaddis, Maxwell Pierson. Foot-Prints of an Itinerant.

    "words": "Martin Luther: Preacher of the Word\u0014\n\n                                                                                       \nJohn Bishop\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAt noon on October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to \nthe door of the Castle Church in Wittenburg. This simple act started \na movement which altered economic structures, undermined empires, and \ndrastically changed the religious life of Europe.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Luther appeared before the Diet of Worms on April 18, 1521, some \nof the foremost theologians of that time charged this simple monk, a \nminer's son, with heresy. Piled high on a table were all his \npublished works, which he was ordered to retract. Luther replied, \nUnless I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason, my conscience \nis captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, \nfor to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand. \nI cannot do otherwise. God help me. Amen. As he went outside he \nraised his arms and shouted, I've come through. And so he had, with \nthe Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nKierkegaard called him the knight of faith, and so he proved to be. \nHe was the instrument of God in recalling the Church to the deeper \nmeaning of the Gospel. He was one of those men whom God matches to \nthe hour. His beliefs were hammered out on the anvil of experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was born on November 10, 1483 at Eisleben in Saxony, to \nHans and Margaret Luther. His father sacrificed so his son could go \nin 1501 to the university at Erfurt, where, four years later, he took \nhis masters of art. As an intense seeker after God, Luther wanted a \nvital faith and longed to be at peace with God. One day as he walked \nback to Erfurt, after visiting his parents, a bolt of lightning \nflashed out of the sky and crashed to earth beside him, killing his \nfriend Alexius who walked with him. Fear paralyzed Luther and he fell \nto earth, vowing to be a monk.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn July 17, 1505, he entered the Augustinian monastery, made his \nprofession in 1506, and a year later was ordained. The following year \nhe was transferred to the university at Wittenburg as a lecturer. At \nthe age of twenty-eight he became a doctor of divinity and professor \nof biblical theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther began to preach very unwillingly and only in obedience to the \nhead of his monastery. He preached first in the dining hall of the \ncloister at Erfurt and then in the small church of the cloister at \nWittenburg. Some of his earliest sermons are scholastic compositions \nin Latin, but soon he was preaching in German as often as four times \na day on such subjects as the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis sermons were published and soon attracted attention by the \nfreshness and frankness of his speech. Their wide circulation \nextended Luther's influence beyond the borders of Germany. They moved \nhe hearts and stirred the consciences of the people. It soon became \nclear that this one man  by the converting power of his words  was \nushering in a fresh era in the history of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been nothing like it since the Day of Pentecost, says John \nDerr. On the way to Worms to meet the Diet, he could not escape from \nthe crowds. At Erfurt the church was so crowded that they feared it \nwould fall. At Zwickau, the marketplace was thronged by 2,500 eager \nlisteners and Luther had to preach from a window. He continued to \npreach to the end of his life though so broken in health that he \noften fainted from exhaustion. To the end he retained his wonderful \npower. The last time he entered the pulpit was February 14, 1546, a \nfew days before he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther's one aim was to present the Gospel by expounding the \nScriptures. On Easter 1519, he began continuous exposition of the \nGospels and Genesis. In 1520 he began in Latin, and then continued in \nGerman, a collection of sermons on the lectionary readings for the \nday. Another writer says, Doctrines drawn from the Scriptures were \ncombined in a living fruitful unit with practical application to the \nneeds of the believers and of the Church alike.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe great truths for which the Reformation stood were constantly \nproclaimed. The general appeal was to the heart and the will, rather \nthan to the intellect. Luther retained the allegorical method of \nexposition but was not bound to it. He did not try to give the sermon \nan organic unity, rather the passage was expounded verse by verse. \nHis language was simple, strong, and manly. Nature spoke rather than \nart.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was Luther who put the sermon into Protestantism, in the place \nheld by the Mass, and so made preaching the most powerful influence \nin the churches of the Reformation. He wrote once in a letter, I \nsimply taught, preached and wrote God's Word: otherwise I did \nnothing. The Word did it all.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost all Luther's sermons were expository. He liked to preach on \nentire books of the Bible; two of his favorite books were Genesis and \n1 Peter. The chief aim of his preaching was to acquaint the \ncongregation with the great truths of the Bible and especially to \nproclaim Christ as Savior. He said, We preach always Jesus Christ. \nThis may seem a limited and monotonous subject, likely to be soon \nexhausted, but we are never at the end of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of his sermons as he preached them were taken down by interested \nhearers. As a rule he did not write out his entire sermon.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther's concept of preaching may be seen in the advice he gave to \npreachers: A good preacher should have these virtues: first, to \nteach systematically; second, he should have a ready wit; third, he \nshould be eloquent; fourth, he should have a good voice; fifth, a \ngood memory; sixth, he should know when to stop preaching; seventh, \nhe should be sure of his doctrine; eighth, he should engage body and \nblood, wealth and honor in serving the Word; ninth, he should suffer \nhimself to be mocked and jeered by everyone.Plain, simple, but \nbeautiful language marked Luther's preaching. He knew how to address \nhimself to his hearers in a way that led them accept his messages. He \nbelieved that the Gospel should be prepared plainly and carefully \njust as a mother prepares the food for her baby.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther preached two or three times a week, and his last sermon was \npreached four days before he died in his sixty-second year. His \npreaching was never merely topical. He would never turn a text into a \npretext. He said, I take pains to treat a verse and stick to it, and \nso to instruct the people that they could say, 'that is what the \nsermon is about'. He would have agreed with Kierkegaard's \ndescription of the Bible as a letter from God with our address upon \nit, though he would have wanted to add that it comes to us like that \nmost forcibly when it is read to us in the living voice of the \npreacher. Every sermon for him was a struggle for souls. His hearers \nwere made to feel that the offer of the Gospel was here and now, and \nnow or never. For him to preach the Gospel was nothing less than to \nbring Christ to the people and the people to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther restored the sermon to prominence in the liturgy of the Church \nbut he also stressed the need to relate Word and Sacrament, keeping \nthem in fruitful tension. He did not regard them as opposites, for he \nsaid The Lord's Supper is commanded in Scripture and is in itself a \nproclamation of the Word.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his letters and Table Talk, Luther expressed his views on \npreaching. He regarded the sermon as the most important part of \nworship, but he insisted that it must be rooted and draw its ground \nfrom Scripture. The subject of preaching is the Glory of God in Jesus \nChrist, otherwise it is not only worthless, but harmful.He was often \nso carried away with his subject that, to himself and many of his \nhearers, his sermons seemed much shorter than they were. His delivery \nwas dynamic. He cast a spell over those who heard him. Masterful in \nhis handling of the language, Luther was fresh in expressing old \ntruths and clear in expressing new ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who heard him, though his plain speech often offended them, \ncame eagerly again and again to hear him. They sensed the deep \nconviction of his soul. Luther said, Now I and any who speak Christ's \nword may freely boast that his mouth is Christ's mouth. I am certain \nthat my word is not mine but Christ's word, therefore my mouth must \nall be His whose word it speaks. As often as the Word of God is \npreached it makes men's consciences before God happy, broad and \ncertain, because it is a word of grace and forgiveness, a good and \nbeneficial word.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis monk who retired from the world to save his soul shaped the \ncourse of events more than most of the generals and statesmen of \nhistory. How did this happen? Karl Barth said of himself that he was \nlike a man in the darkness climbing a winding staircase in the \nsteeple of an ancient cathedral. In the blackness of the place, he \nreached out to steady himself and his hand laid hold of a rope. He \nwas surprised and startled to hear the clanging of a bell.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was precisely the experience of Martin Luther. The bell he rang \nushered in the modern era. It called me and women to a vital faith. \nIt is still tolling today. It calls us to be captive to the Word. \nChristianity stands or falls by the Word. Luther said, He who does \naway with the Word and does not accept it as spoken by God does away \nwith everything.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther's creed was forged in the crucible of experience: Sola \nScriptura, Sola Gracia, Sola Fide. Only through Scripture, only from \nGod's grace, only through faith in Christ does the Christian receive \nsalvation.\u0014",

    "words": "America will Have More Elderly People Than Children \nby 2035, Census Bureau Predicts\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this week, \\NPR covered a report from the U.S. Census Bureau \nthat projects that Adults 65 and older will outnumber children for \nthe first time in U.S. history by the year 2035.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis coming shift in U.S. demographics brings with it some notable \nimplications for U.S. society. As the NPR report clarifies, this \nnumber of elderly Americans will be so high by that time that 1 in \nevery 5 Americans will be at retirement age. Additionally, the death \nrate will surpass the birth rate. Even though the U.S. population \nwill still continue to grow, the only reason for that growth will be \nimmigration. According to NPR, For the first time in U.S. history, \nimmigration, and not births, will be the main driver of the country's \npopulation growth.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom a common-sense perspective, this shift in the average American \nage is a bit of an issue. Since the number of births isn't enough to \nreplace those who die, the country will certainly be seeing a drop in \ncaretakers as the population continues to age.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, with this in the future, now is the time for Americans to decide \nhow to treat the elderly among them. If the nation continues to buy \ninto the lie that humans are only worth the value they bring to \nsociety, then the society is in danger of eliminating the ones among \nthis aging generation that need the most caremuch like it has \neliminated the unwanted unborn.\u0014",

    "words": "James Cone's \"Martin & Malcolm & America\" is a fascinating contrast \nof the lives, experiences, and thoughts of two icons. It is written \nin a style that recalls good investigative journalism as it maps out \nthe tumultuous times in which the two lived.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe philosophies of Malcolm and Martin, often portrayed as polar \nopposites in the media, are grounded in certain similarities. Both \nbased their viewpoints on their religious traditions, believed that \nGod was on the side of the poor and oppressed, and both held a \npassionate belief in the dignity of black lives. Both philosophies \nwere formed in spite of the fact that they lived in a age when the \ninstitutions that ruled America either neglected the dignity of \nblacks, or ignored civil rights issues altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lives of Malcolm and Martin were quite different, however. Martin \nwas raised in a upper middle class family in Atlanta, the descendant \nof slaves whose father and grandfather both became prominant \npreachers. He life afforded him a great education -- at Morehouse, \nCrozer Theological Seminary, and Boston University. His family was \nclose knit.\u0014\n\u0014\nMalcolm, by contrast, saw his father murdered by white supremicists \nand his mother abused by the social service agencies, which \neventually institutionalized her. Malcolm ended up in the foster care \nsystem and eventually went to prison for petty crime. There, he came \nto value the importance of education, and read voraciously. \nIntroduced by his brother to the Nation of Islam, he had a powerful \nconversion experience in prison. After his release, he became second \nin command to Elijah Mohammed, the religion's leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Martin and Malcolm spent their time working to improve the \nquality of black lives. Martin took on institutional power through \ncivil rights legislation, and Malcolm worked in the urban ghettos, \nattempting to galvanize blacks to reject Christianity and move \ntowards strengthening their lives through non-integration. Although \nMartin and Malcolm differed in their visions, they were more alike \nthan not.\u0014",

On this day we honor the memories of \u0014\nthose Americans who have laid down their lives for this nation. In \u0014\nan 1884 Memorial Day speech, Oliver Wendefl Holmes Ir., himself a \u0014\nCivil War veteran, described the day's purpose well: \"It is today \nthat \u0014\nwe are most in the presence of the dead ... It is on this day, when \u0014\nwe decorate their graves, they come back and live with us. And for \u0014\nan hour or two at regimental dinners held in their memories, the \u0014\nghosts sitting at the tables are more numerous than the living.\" \u0014\nOriginally called Decoration Day, Memorial Day began follow- \u0014\ning the Civil War. That conflict claimed more American lives than \u0014\nany other war in u.s. history. In 1868, John A. Logan, a retired \u0014\nUnion general, called for a nationwide day of remembrance to be \u0014\nheld on May 30 for the purpose of decorating the graves of com- \u0014\nrades who died in defense of their country. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe day of observance rapidly grew in popularity throughout \u0014\nthe Northern states. By 1890, it was recognized as a holiday in every \u0014\nstate that fought for the Union. Southern states initially refused to \u0014\nhonor their dead on the same day. Sadly, it took another bloody \u0014\nconflict, WWI, to mend that rift. The shared tragedy oflosing hus- \u0014\nbands, fathers, and sons on foreign battlefields thousands of miles \u0014\naway brought Americans on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line \u0014\nback together. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom battlefields to harbors, from country lanes to city streets, \u0014\nfrom the Revolution through the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, more \u0014\nthan 54,600 Virginians have laid down their lives in freedom's \u0014\nname. Most Virginians are well aware of the painful cost of war. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany Americans will end this three-day weekend enjoying fam- \u0014\nily, fun, and cookouts. That is well and good. But remember this: \u0014\nDespite the ills and issues that seem to be tearing Americans apart, \u0014\nit remains true that far more people from far more places across \u0014\nthe globe still aspire to come to the United States than any other \u0014\nnation that has ever existed. The freedoms we enjoy are the envy \u0014\nof billions. And it is those very freedoms that were paid for with \nthe \u0014\nultimate sacrifice by the men and women we honor this Memorial \u0014\nDay. Enjoy the rest of this holiday weekend and all the weekends \u0014\nto come. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were purchased at a very dear cost.\u0014\n\u0014\nEditorial, Richmond Times Dispatch 5/29/8\u0014",

Its purpose, of course, was to honor the \nfallen of the Civil War.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack then the holiday was called Decoration Day, but it was observed \npretty much the way we do today: with flags at half-staff, parades, \nand placing flowers on graves.

In the Union \nArmy, between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers were converted; among \nConfederate forces, approximately 150,000 troops converted to Christ. \nPerhaps 10 percent of all Civil War soldiers experienced conversions \nduring the conflict. \u0014\n2.\tAbraham Lincoln, though he knew the Bible thoroughly and spoke \noften of an Almighty God, was never baptized and was the only United \nStates president never to join a church. \u0014\n3.\tBefore the Civil War, it was rare to find chaplains in American \narmies. During the war, they earned a lasting place. \u0014\n4.\tThe Constitution of the Confederate States of America specifically \ninvoked \"Almighty God\"unlike the U.S. Constitution. Further, the \nConfederate Constitution prohibited the foreign slave trade. \u0014\n5.\tMillions of tracts were distributed to soldiers during the war. \n(Average price: 1,500 for $1.) The U.S. Christian Commission alone \ndistributed 30 million tracts, including many through a young agent \nnamed Dwight L. Moody. \u0014\n6.\tChristians who opposed the war on religious grounds were often \npersecuted. The Brethren eventually were allowed to be exempted from \nmilitary service if they paid $500, but most suffered for their \nstance. for example, John Kline, moderator of the Brethren Annual \nMeeting, became distrusted because he provided medical aid to \nsoldiers from both armies. Once he was jailed for two weeks, without \ncause, and in June 1864 he was ambushed and murdered. \u0014\n7.\tBlacks were not allowed to serve as chaplains (or soldiers) until \n1863. 14 black chaplains served U.S. regiments . One of the best \nknown was H. M. Turner, whose preaching had drawn Congressmen to hear \nhim; he was known as \"the Negro Spurgeon.\" \u0014\n8.\tAbraham Lincoln was the first President to use the phrase,\"This \nnation under God.\" It inspired President Eisenhower, in 1954, to add \nthe words \"one nation under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. \u0014\n9.\tMany Civil War generals stood so committed to observing the \nSabbath that it influenced their military operations. Stonewall \nJackson would fight only \"more ordinary battles\" on Sunday, and \nWilliam Rosecrans refused to pursue a fleeing enemy force on a \nSabbath day. Other generals attributed defeats to the fact they had \nviolated the Sabbath by fighting on that day. \u0014\n10.\tMany preachers, especially in the North, felt that through the \nwar the final glorious reign of God would begin. Both sides thought \nthe war would be over in three months. Instead, it lasted four years, \nuntil 364,511 Union and approximately 260,000 Confederate soldiers \nlay dead from bullets and disease. More Americans died in the Civil \nWar than died in all other American wars combined.\u0014",

    "words": "B. H. Carroll was a big man with a flowing white beard that made him \nlook even bigger. He was pastor of a small church in Waco, Texas for \n28 years, during which time 2,325 people made professions of faith. \nHe was a powerful, popular speaker and community leader who worked \nhard to build a strong educational program in his church and in the \ncommunity. He was a major leader in Baptist life in Texas. His \nefforts led other instiitutions to seek his teaching and \norganizational skills, Baylor University among them. He was \nrecognized for his colossal intelligence. He began to feel the need \nfor seminary training for young, aspiring ministers. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne day in 1907, while riding on a train in the panhandle of west \nTexas, he felt the urging of God to start a seminary and started \nworking on that. By 1910, the school that became known as \nSouthwestern Baptist Theological Seminary was a reality. It \neventually came to be the largest seminary in the world. He gave up \nhis church and served as president of the Seminary for most of the \nrest of his life. His achievements were monumental; nobody doubts \nthat. But theres one more thing I need to tell you.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis home was across the street from the seminary. On one particular \nday, Carroll was seen walking in front of his home, back and forth, \nback and forth, back and forth, wringing his hands, obviously very \ntroubled. A friend, walking over to him trying to see how he could \nhelp, heard Carroll saying over and over, They made me keeper of the \nvineyard, but my own vineyard have I not kept. He had a son upstairs \nin his home dying of a gunshot wound received in a drunken brawl. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe admitted he had time for a church. He time for a seminary. He had \ntime to be a recognized leader in the state, but he didnt have time \nfor his family, his children.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone of us has our own vineyard. Our vineyard is our personal \nlife, (are we taking responsibility for ourselves), our mates, our \nchildren, and our God. You cant delegate that responsibility to \nothers no matter how hard you try. I have one more question, Who \nkeeps your vineyard?\u0014",

    "title": "MARTIN LUTHER'S MOST NOBLE WORDS",
    "words": "Martin Luther's Most Noble Words\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\"Since your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will \nanswer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am convicted by \nscripture and plain reason--I do not accept the authority of popes \nand councils for they have contradicted each other--my conscience is \ncaptive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, \nfor to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, \nI cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most notable words spoken in the Reformation, this \naccording to early printed reports, was Luther's reply at Worms when \nurged to recant. He uttered the memorable lines in German on this \nday, April 18, 1521, and then, upon request, repeated their gist in \nLatin for those who did not understand his native tongue. He was \nsweating, said witnesses. With a victory gesture he slipped out of \nthe room.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick the Wise, Luther's supporter was uneasy. Did the scriptures \ncondemn Luther or not? \"He is too daring for me,\" the elector \nadmitted. Nonetheless, on the next day, when asked to stand against \nLuther with the emperor, he did not sign the condemnation although \nthe other four electors did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the Emperor, he reasoned that a single friar who went contrary \nto the whole church could not possibly be right. Descended from a \nlong line of Christian emperors, he felt that to accept Luther's view \nwas to betray the faith of his fathers. He would take prompt action \nagainst Luther, he vowed. But since Luther had been given safe \nconduct to Worms, he allowed him to depart in safety. \u0014\n\u0014\nLuther did not leave Worms at once. For several days a committee \nreasoned with him, begging him not to rend the church in two. They \npointed out that war would surely come to Germany. Melanchthon, his \nbeloved associate, might be killed. Luther could not help but be \nmoved, but his determination held. God's word must be followed \nwhatever the cost. To this confrontation his stand against \nindulgences had finally brought him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are grounds to doubt that Luther said \"Here I stand. I cannot \ndo otherwise.\" Although the earliest printed versions contain these \nlines, the official transcripts do not. Whether spoken or not, the \nwords convey the brave monk's attitude. When Luther left Worms, the \nReformation was irrevocable.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was at his noblest at Worms. His bold words have \nstirred men's imagination through subsequent centuries, for they have \nthe same ring to them as Peter's famous defiance of the Sanhedrin. \n\"Judge for yourselves whether we ought to obey God or men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "title": "MARY MCLEOD BETHUNE, A PIONEER FOR BLACK PEOPLE",
    "words": "She started a school for African-American girls with $1.50. The \nschool bordered the town dump. Make-shift desks and chairs were made \nfrom discarded crates and boxes. There were five students at the \ntime, and the students made ink for pens from elderberry juice and \npencils from burned wood.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the the local Ku Klux Klan heard about the school, they \nthreatened to burn it down. There were reports that they waited \noutside the school, but she stood in the doorway, unwilling to back \ndown or leave her school. Other stories say that she and her students \nstarted singing spirituals. The Ku Klux Klan eventually left.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary McLeod Bethune was born on July 10, 1875 in a log cabin on a \ncotton farm in South Carolina, the 15th of 17 children of former \nslaves. Most of her brothers and sisters were born into slavery; she \nwas the first child born free. She started working in the fields by \nthe age of 5. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, she accompanied her mother, delivering white peoples \nwash. When she was given permission to enter the white children's \nnursery, she saw a book, which fascinated her. A white girl would \nquickly snatch the book from her hands, telling her she didn't know \nhow to read. That's when Mary realized the only difference between \nwhite and black folk was the ability to read and write.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she got the opportunity, McLeod attended a one-room black \nschoolhouse, walking five miles to and from the school. When she got \nhome, she would teach her parents and siblings what she learned. She \nthen got an opportunity to attend the Moody Bible Institute in 1895, \nbecoming the first African American student to graduate from the \nschool.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe decided then she would become a missionary, sharing what she \nlearned. But, she would be informed that no one wanted or needed a \nblack missionary. \u0014\n\u0014\nRather than give up her dreams, she decided more than ever that she \nwould eventually teach.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlash forward to 1904, when after moving to Florida, she started the \nEducational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls, which \ninitially had five girls aged six to twelve. With limited resources, \nshe was determined to make the school a success, even when the Ku \nKlux Klan threatened her. But, eventually she received donations and \nsupport from the community, and the school grew to 30 girls by the \nend of the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nBooker T. Washington would tell her of the importance of white \nbenefactors to fund her school, so she started traveling and \nfundraising, receiving donations from John D. Rockefeller and \nestablishing contacts with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.\u0014\nHer little school would become even more successful after it merged \nwith a private institute for African-American boys and became known \nas the Bethune-Cookman School. She was president of the college from \n1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947, becoming one of the few women in the \nworld to serve as a college president at that time.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter she found that one of her students needing medical care was \ndenied the care she needed and was placed on an outside porch of the \nlocal white hospital instead of a room with a bed, she used her \nfunding sources and connections to open the first black hospital in \nDaytona, Florida.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the Turning Point Suffragist Memorial Association, \nMcLeod became \"one of the 20th centurys most powerful and celebrated \nadvocates for civil rights and suffrage\",  holding \"prominent roles, \nincluding president, in the National Association of Colored Women \n(NACW). She also served as president of the Florida Federation of \nColored Womens Clubs, where she fought against school segregation \nand sought healthcare for black children. Under her leadership, the \nNational Council of Negro Women (NCNW) was founded as a unifying \nvoice for African American womens organizations.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs chapter president of the Florida chapter of the National \nAssociation of Colored Women, she would become so well known for her \nwork registering black voters that once again she received threats \nfrom the Ku Klux Klan. And, like before, she did not back down.\u0014\nWith her friendship with the Roosevelts, she would become appointed \nas a national adviser to president Roosevelt, becoming part of what \nwas known as his Black Cabinet and advising him on concerns of black \npeople and would be called the First Lady of the Struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she passed away on May 18, 1955, she was recognized across the \ncountry. One newspaper suggested \"the story of her life should be \ntaught to every school child for generations to come\" and The New \nYork Times noted she was, \"one of the most potent factors in the \ngrowth of interracial goodwill in America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her own words before she died, she wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I leave you love. I leave you hope. I leave you the challenge of \ndeveloping confidence in one another. I leave you a thirst for \neducation. I leave you a respect for the use of power. I leave you \nfaith. I leave you racial dignity. I leave you a desire to live \nharmoniously with your fellow men. I leave you a responsibility to \nour young people.\"\u0014\nIf I have a legacy to leave my people, it is my philosophy of living \nand serving. I think I have spent my life well. I pray now that my \nphilosophy may be helpful to those who share my vision of a world of \nPeace, Progress, Brotherhood, and Love.\u0014",

    "title": "MAYFLOWER SAILED, TAKING PILGRIMS TO NEW ENGLAND",
    "words": "Mayflower Sailed, Taking Pilgrims to New England\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most significant chapters in American history opened on \nthis day, September 6, 1620. After failed attempts to sail from \nEngland, leaving behind her sister ship Speedwell, the Mayflower \nsailed from Plymouth for the New World. Aboard were 101 passengers. \nBy today's standards the ship was little bigger than a yacht. Ninety \nfeet long and twenty-six feet wide, it hardly seemed the vessel to \nalter world history.\u0014\n\u0014\nCramped in so small a space and subject to rough weather, the \npassengers suffered a good deal. The sailors cursed the pious \nPilgrims, whom they detested. Food consisted of dried fish, cheese \nand beer. The only sanitary accommodation was a slop bucket. There \nwas nowhere to bathe. Seasickness was rampant during storms. With \nlittle air below decks, the conditions were nauseating at the best. \nDespite this, only one passenger died at sea. However bad matters \nwere aboard ship, they would prove far worse in the \"hideous and \ndesolate wilderness\" which soon confronted them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months and five days after sailing, the ship landed at Cape Cod. \nBefore going ashore the Pilgrims signed the famous Mayflower Compact. \nThis not only made them a completely religious entity but broke \npolitical ground, too, in that it placed them under their own \ngovernance while still paying formal respect to the king of England. \nThe compact was essentially a church covenant, signed by most of the \nadult men who were aboard. It probably staved off a mutiny, for \ntensions were running high.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their destination, the Pilgrims were a long while making up their \nminds where to settle. The sailors grumbled and wanted to force them \noff ship before all the provisions were consumed. Fortunately, some \nof the men who first went ashore found berries and corn which could \nsupplement their rations. The ship remained over winter. Inadequately \nprepared, the Pilgrims died by the dozens. Less than half survived \nthe first winter. Shelter was lacking. The houses they built were of \nwattle and clay. But enough settlers survived to establish a \ncommunity and to open an incomparable chapter in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a social contract as embodied in the Mayflower Compact \nwould become important in the theories of John Locke, Rousseau and \nothers. Christian forms had a good deal of influence in shaping the \ncharacter of early American governments which were largely the \ncreation of Christian exiles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBradford, William.

    "words": "'Alarming': 52 Percent of Evangelical Churchgoers Reject Absolute \nMoral Truth\u0014\nMichael Foust | ChristianHeadlines.com Contributor | Wednesday, \nOctober 7, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\n'ALARMING': 52 PERCENT OF EVANGELICAL CHURCHGOERS REJECT ABSOLUTE \nMORAL TRUTH  \u0014\n\u0014\nA slight majority of evangelical churchgoers believe there is no \nmoral absolute truth, while three-quarters think people are \nbasically good, according to a new report that its authors call \nalarming.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poll by the Cultural Research Center (CRC) at Arizona Christian \nUniversity examined the views of attendees of evangelical, \nPentecostal/charismatic, mainline Protestant and Catholic churches on \n51 beliefs and behaviors.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the findings, the survey discovered that a majority of \nevangelicals (52 percent), Pentecostals/charismatics (69 percent), \nmainline Protestants (58) and Catholics (69 percent) say there is no \nabsolute moral truth that applies to everyone, all the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the question of sin, a large majority of evangelicals (75 \npercent), Pentecostals/charismatics (76 percent), mainline \nProtestants (81 percent) and Catholics (84 percent) disagree with the \nstatement, People are not basically good; we are sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Christianity is rapidly conforming to the values of the \npost-Christian secular culture, the reports authors wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nSignificantly, the survey only examined the beliefs of church \nattendees, not limiting it to those who have professed certain \nbeliefs or who say they have embraced Christs teachings. Still, its \nfindings likely will disturb many within the Christian community.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey also found that among evangelical churchgoers:\u0014\n\u0014\n43 percent believe Jesus sinned.\u0014\n43 percent do not believe that there is a common, God-given purpose \nto humanity.\u0014\n42 percent seek moral guidance primarily from sources other than the \nBible.\u0014\nA news release from the Cultural Research Center (CRC) at Arizona \nChristian University called the results alarming for evangelicalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat makes that trend so significant is that evangelical churches, \nby definition, teach that the Bible is the authoritative word of God \nthat teaches not only salvation by grace alone but also an array of \nlife principles that are meant to drive ones thoughts and actions, \nCRC said in the release.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Barna, director of research at the Cultural Research Center, \nsaid the data represents a post-Christian Reformation driven by \npeople seeking to retain a Christian identity.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, the theology of this reformation is being driven by \nAmerican culture rather than biblical truth, Barna said. The \nworldviews embraced by the adherents of these distinct religious \ncommunities reflect contemporary, worldly influence, rather than \nbiblical influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe findings are based on a January survey of 2,000 U.S. adults.\u0014\n--------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n58 Percent of Americans Believe Moral Truth 'Is Up to Each \nIndividual,' New Poll Finds\u0014\nMichael Foust | ChristianHeadlines.com Contributor | Thursday, June \n4, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly six in 10 Americans believe identifying moral truth is up to \neach individual, while barely four in 10 say God is the basis of \ntruth, according to a new survey.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe findings are part of the American Worldview Inventory and were \nreleased by George Barna, director of research at the cultural \nresearch center at Arizona Christian University.\u0014\n\u0014\nA total of 58 percent of U.S. adults agreed that identifying moral \ntruth is up to each individual; there are no moral absolutes that \napply to everyone, all the time, according to the survey. \nSurprisingly, 48 percent of adults identified as born-again \nChristians agreed with the statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe survey, released last month, was based on interviews with 2,000 \nU.S. adults in January.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere living in an America increasingly unmoored from its founding \nin biblical truth, said Len Munsil, president of Arizona Christian \nUniversity. Even in the most basic questions of life, like how we \nmake moral choices, were choosing to lean completely on our own \nunderstanding to decide whats right and wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Americans were asked what is the basis of truth, 42 percent \nresponded God, 16 percent inner certainty and 15 percent \nscientific proof. The other answers included tradition (5 percent), \npublic agreement (4 percent), there is no truth (5 percent) and \ndont know (13 percent). \u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelical church attendees (72 percent), Pentecostal church \nattendees (70 percent) and born-again Christians (69 percent) were \namong the most likely to say God is the basis of truth. The survey \nfound a political divide on the issue, with Republicans (59 percent) \nand political conservatives (62 percent) saying God is the basis of \ntruth, while Democrats (36 percent) and political liberals (26 \npercent) were less likely to answer God. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a nation we are becoming increasingly self-reliant. We trust \nourselves or our discoveries rather than the truth principles God \nprovides, Barna said. The diminished role of God in peoples lives \nhighlights why just 6 percent of American adults possess a biblical \nworldview. \u0014\n\u0014\nIts one thing to lack theological clarity regarding biblical \nperspectives on immigration policy or the end times, he said. Its \na much more serious condition when the general public outright \nrejects God as the source of truth, the Bible as the conveyance of \ntruth, and the very importance of integrating a known, proven and \nstable source of truth into our daily decision making and lifestyle.\u0014",

    "title": "MASSACHUSETTS LAW AGAINST THE QUAKERS",
    "words": "Massachusetts Law Against Quakers\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion was taken seriously in the seventeenth century in Europe and \nAmerica because most people still believed that their faith dealt \nwith issues of truth, not simply the opinions of men. In the colony \nof Massachusetts there were strict laws governing the religious \nbeliefs of society. If you didn't agree with those beliefs, the \ncolonial leaders thought you should go live somewhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuakers were frequently asked to leave Massachusetts. The group had \nbeen founded in the 1640s by the Englishman George Fox. After finding \nno peace for his soul in the churches of his day, Fox had begun to \ngive up all hope when he had the experience of a voice speaking to \nhim. He believed that this inner voice was the voice of God, and that \nhe could receive direct revelation through the Holy Spirit. Fox began \nspeaking of hie new, inward spiritual faith, and the Society of \nFriends--known as Quakers--followed his teachings. They emphasized \nthe direct revelation of Christ to the individual's soul and \nminimized an ordained ministry and the traditional forms of worship \nin the church. Many Christians objected to the Quakers' belief in an \ninner revelation separate from the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 1656, the ship Swallow anchored in Boston harbor with two \nQuaker women from Barbados on board. The two women, Mary Fisher and \nAnn Austin, had come to Boston to share their Quaker faith. When they \nlanded, however, they were kept on board the ship while their \nbelongings were searched and over 100 books were confiscated. They \nwere then hurried off to jail where they were stripped of their \nclothing and inspected for signs of witchcraft. Five weeks later, the \ncaptain of the Swallow was placed under 100 bond to take the women \nback to Barbados. But two days later, another ship with eight more \nQuakers came to dock! These Quakers were imprisoned for eleven weeks \nbefore they were shipped back to England. They were able to convert \none man to their Quaker faith, Nicholas Upsall, but he fled to Rhode \nIsland to avoid punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the influx of Quakers, on this day October 14, 1656, \nMassachusetts enacted a law against the \"cursed sect of heretics \nlately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers...\" \nIt declared that any shipmaster bringing a Quaker into the colony \nwould be fined 100. Any colonist possessing a Quaker book would be \nfined 5. Any Quaker coming within the jurisdiction of the colony \nwould be arrested, whipped, and transported out of the colony without \nconversing with anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, some Quakers felt they simply had to share their beliefs in \nMassachusetts. Robert Fowler built a small craft, the Woodhouse, and \nloaded it with Quakers bound for New England. They landed in Rhode \nIsland, and some entered Massachusetts to spread their views. Quaker \nMary Clark went to Boston to test the law, and she soon had twenty \nstripes of a 3-corded whip \"laid on with fury\" and then spent twelve \nweeks in prison. Even so, the Quakers continued to arrive. So, in \nOctober, 1658, stronger laws were passed. Between 1659 and 1661, four \nQuakers were sent to the gallows.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen King Charles II heard of that, he said all Quakers were to be \nsent to England for trial. There were no more Quaker hangings in \nMassachusetts, and no Quakers were sent to England for trial; but \npunishments and deportations from the colony continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nJones, Louis Thomas. \"The Quakers of Iowa.\" Iowa History Project. \nhttp://iagenweb.org/history/qoi/QOIPt1Chp2.htm.

For months, Michelangelo \nBuonarroti had worked in secret. Curiosity was aflame. What had he \naccomplished? Had he succeeded in transferring his skill as a \nsculptor to work with fresco (paint in plaster)?\u0014\n\u0014\nPope Julius II, as impatient as ever, demanded that Michelangelo \nunveil the ceiling of the Sistine chapel although it was far from \ndone. High on the scaffolding, his face just inches from the ceiling, \npaint dripping into his eyes, Michelangelo had completed only the \ncentral vault.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulius prevailed. Down came the scaffold, erected with such labor. On \nthis day, November 1, 1509, the public surged into the chapel to see \nwhat Michelangelo had wrought.\u0014\n\u0014\nPainters could only gape in astonishment. Michelangelo, who had \nearlier revolutionized sculpture, now did the same with painting. His \nnine groups of stories from Genesis stole the breath of \ncontemporaries. He made his figures seem to be in perspective and \ndistributed them across the vault with an astonishing inner rhythm to \ntell the stories of creation, the fall of man, and sacred history. \n(Years later, he added the Last Judgment to the wall behind the \naltar.) His rivals immediately began to ape his techniques.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichelangelo infused much of his art with Christian feeling. An \nadmirer of the reformer Savonarola, his sonnets show that he \ngenuinely desired to know God and considered himself unworthy of him:\u0014\n\u0014\nO my dear God, matched with the much I owe\u0014\nAll that I am were no real recompense:\u0014\nPaying a debt is not munificence.\u0014\nAlthough he had flaws of temper, Michelangelo's art and life reveal \nan individual concerned for God's glory. A contemporary wrote, \n\"Buonarroti, having lived for ninety years, there was never found \nthrough all that time anyone who could with right and justice impute \nto him a stain or any ugliness of manners.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he found dealing with Pope Julius a strain. Once when \nMichelangelo threatened to leave Rome, Julius, in a fury, said he \nwould have him flung from the scaffold. Michelangelo immediately took \nit down and refused to add the gold leaf and touch-ups that Julius \nwanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCross, F.

    "title": "MARY THE SINLESS",
    "words": "Mary, the Sinless\u0014\n\u0014\nA number of venerable beliefs about Mary originated in a little-known \nbook. Even those who know little about the veneration of Mary in \nchurch history have probably encountered a number of beliefs about \nher that cant be found in the Gospel accounts: the names of her \nparents, for example, or her supposed immaculate conception (birth \nwithout sin). Many of these come from a single source: the \nProtevangelium or the Gospel of James.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough rejected as uncanonical in the sixth century, this book \nprovided the material for many of the most important medieval \nlegends, artistic representations, and theological beliefs about \nMary. A Jewish-Christian work of the second century, it is an infancy \nnarrative with extensive elaborations attesting to the sanctity and \nspecial powers of Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nA VERY OLD TESTAMENT BIRTH\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gospel of James tells the story of how Marys parents, Joachim \nand Anne, childless in their old age, were blessed by the birth of \nthis special child. If the story has a familiar ring, it is because \nit closely parallels the biblical account of Isaac.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Protevangelium also portrays Joseph as an old man, a widower with \ngrown children, at the time of Marys espousal to him. Recognizing \nher extraordinary purity and set-apartness, Joseph becomes more of a \ncaretaker than a husband to Mary.\u0014\n\u0014\nA number of early church fathers, including John of Damascus and \nSophronicus, cited or commented on this account of Marys conception, \nbirth, and life, and it evolved during the Middle Ages into various \nother stories about Anne. Other apocryphal Gospels contributed \nmaterial, including the Mary Gospel of Pseudo Matthew. These \nnarratives focus on Annes childlessness through 20 years, at which \npoint Joachim became a recluse out of shame. The couples prayers \nwere eventually answered: an angel appeared to each individually, \npromising a child who will become known to the whole world. Joachim \nand Anne were reunited at the Golden Gate (the subject of a painting \nby Drer), and eventually the child, Mary, was born.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Protevangelium, the story resembles that in I Samuel 1 \nconcerning the barren Hannah, whose prayer for fruitfulness is \nlikewise answered (Hannah and Anna or Anne are variants of one \nname). Like Hannahs child, Mary is sent up to the temple to be \nraised as a virgin (a historical improbability), there to help weave \na new veil of true purple, the royal color.\u0014\n\u0014\nPURE FROM THE FIRST \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Protevangelium also contributed to the belief in Marys \nimmaculate conception: from the first moment of her conception, she \nwas preserved from the stain of original sin. The Protevangelium \ndraws a parallel between Marys conception and that of John the \nBaptist, sanctified in Elizabeths womb (Luke 1:15), seeming to \nsuggest that the con-jugal begetting of Mary was somehow devoid of \nsinful taint.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile some more elaborate justifications for a sinless Mary have \nbeen offered, especially in the later Middle Ages, this is still \nessentially the position of the modern Catholic Church: Sanctifying \ngrace was given to her before [original] sin could have taken effect \nin her soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis view, though often challenged, has had notable champions. In \nrefuting Pelagius, Augustine is among those who declare that while \nall those justified by grace have known sin, he cannot, for the \nhonor of the Lord, even question whether Mary might have sinned \n(Nature and Grace, 100.36).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term immaculate conception, relating strictly to Marys own \nconception, appeared in the formal liturgy first in 1854 (Pius IX), \nthough the feast was adopted for the entire Roman Church in 1476 by \nSixtus IV.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Lyle Jeffrey, Christian History, Issue 103\u0014",

    "words": "MOTHER OF GOD?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the story of the Nativity makes clear that Mary is the \nphysical mother of Jesus, the nature of her motherhood was hotly \ndisputed in the Christological controversies of the fourth and fifth \ncenturies. Was she in fact the mother of the second person of the \nHoly Trinity, or was she simply the mother of Christs human nature?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs early as the second century, Bishop Irenaeus wrote, The Virgin \nMary . . . being obedient to his \u0014\nWord received from the angel the glad tidings that she would bear \nGod. Two centuries later, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria taught \nthat the Word of God was inexpressibly, inexplicably, \nincomprehensibly and eternally . . . born in time here below, of the \nVirgin Mary, the Mother of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, in the early fifth century, the influential Patriarch of \nConstantinople, Nestorius, began to challenge this way of speaking \nabout Mary. Around 428 he preached a famous sermon attacking the use \nof the term Theotokos, or God-bearer, to describe the mother of \nJesus. It would be more fitting, Nestorius alleged, to call her \nChristotokos, the one who bore the man Jesus Christ. To refer to her \nas the bearer of God was to exalt her unduly. A human woman could not \npossibly birth the eternal Word: No one can bring forth a son older \nthan herself!\u0014\n\u0014\nNestoriuss position was rejected at the Council of Ephesus in 431, \nwhich decreed that Mary was in fact the one who gave birth to the \nsecond person of the Trinity. The bishops claimed it is fitting and \nproper to call her the Theotokos, not because she was the origin of \nGod, but because the baby she delivered in Bethlehem possessed a \nhuman nature mysteriously joined to the eternal nature of God. To \nreject the term Mother of God, they argued, is to deny the full \ndivinity of Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatholic and Orthodox believers continue to celebrate this \nunderstanding of the Nativity on the first of January with a feast \nhonoring the Theotokos.\u0014\n\u0014\nSarah E.

    "title": "MICHAEL SERVETUS BURNED AT THE STAKE BY CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "Question: \"Why did John Calvin have Michael Servetus burned at the \nstake for heresy?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnswer: John Calvin was a highly influential leader in the Protestant \nReformation. Born in France and educated in civil law, Calvin \neventually fled Catholic France and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, \nwhere he instituted many reforms. Under Calvins leadership, the city \nof Geneva became a haven for other Reformers who fled persecution in \ntheir own countries; also, by 1540 the city began moving toward a \ntheocracymoral law and civil law were one and the same. In 1553 came \na confrontation with a heretic named Michael Servetus, who was \neventually executed in Geneva for his heresy; this incident has been \na source of controversy ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael Servetus was a Spanish physician and theologian who rejected \northodox Trinitarian doctrine. According to Servetus, God is one \nsingle person. He contended that the persons of the Trinity are \nactually forms in which God has chosen to manifest Himself. \nAccording to Servetus, Christ was made a man by God, and His human \nnature prevents Him from being God. Servetus concluded God is \neternal, but Jesus Christ is not. In his denial of the Trinity, \nServetus was seen as a heretic by Catholics and Protestants alike. \nJohn Calvin briefly corresponded with Servetus, but broke off all \ncommunication after the first few letters, as it was apparent that \nServetus was unyielding in his denial of the Trinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1552 the Spanish Inquisition took action against Servetus, but he \nescaped their hands. Later, the French Inquisition declared Servetus \nworthy of death but had to burn him in effigy, due to his escape. In \nAugust 1553, Servetus traveled to Geneva where he was recognized and \nat Calvins request was imprisoned by the city magistrates. The trial \nof Michael Servetus lasted through October, at which time the Council \nof Geneva condemned him to death. Servetus was burned at the stake on \nOctober 27, 1553. The Calvinists and the Catholics both wanted him \ndead, but the Calvinists got to him first.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe condemnation and death of Michael Servetus has been a black mark \non John Calvins record for centuries. Was the burning of Servetus \njustified, or was it cold-blooded murder? God will judge. In \ncontemplating the history of Calvin and Servetus, it is good to \nremember the following facts:\u0014\n\u0014\n The laws in Switzerland made heresy punishable by death; Servetus \ndeath was thus justified in the eyes of the Geneva Council. Plus, the \ncouncils of Berne, Zurich, Basle, and Schaffhausen were consulted, \nand they all encouraged the verdict and punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\n Calvin agreed with the sentence of death passed on Servetus; \nhowever, he urged that in mercy Servetus be executed by the sword, \nnot by burning. The council rejected his suggestion.\u0014\n\u0014\n Michael Servetus was the only heretic ever executed in Geneva in \nCalvins lifetime. In comparison, between 3,000 and 10,000 people \nwere executed by Catholics in Spain alone during the Inquisition. As \ntragic as Servetuss death was, it should be kept in perspective.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wretched matter of Calvin and Servetus should teach us at least \ntwo things: 1) the Reformers were not perfecteven great men such as \nJohn Calvin can make serious mistakes; and 2) the New Testament \nchurch was never designed to double as a civil government.\u0014",

    "words": "Mary Slessor Tried to Transform Nigeria\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1914, Mary Slessor, a world-famous missionary to Nigeria, fell so \nill that she had to be taken by canoe to hospital. A few weeks later \nshe collapsed again. As she lay semi-conscious she whispered \"O God, \nrelease me.\" She died on this day, January 13, 1915, mourned by \nthousands of Nigerians. The Scotswoman had worked among them for \nthirty-nine years.\u0014\n\u0014\nA harsh childhood prepared Mary for Africa. At eleven she prepared \njute and flax for weavers. In time, she became a skilled weaver, able \nto manage two sixty-inch looms at once. Although exhausted, for she \nwas \"wee and thin and not very strong,\" Mary made the most of \nopportunities. She snatched whatever schooling she could get. If she \nwas too tired to follow the arithmetic, the teacher punished her by \nmaking her stand. On early winter nights, she dodged drunks and \nthieves as she walked home in the dark to do her chores and face her \ndrunken father. Often her mother pushed her out into the street so \nthat her dad couldn't beat her.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter she became a Christian, Mary held Bible classes for children \nwhose lives were as bleak as her own. She taught them that they could \nhave friendship with Christ. She took groups into the countryside for \npicnics and raced with them. Such behavior raised the eyebrows of the \nstuffy people in the pews who wanted things done \"properly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne gang rejected Mary's message, jeering and literally slinging mud \nat her. These toughs surrounded her while their leader whirled a lead \nweight on a string, coming closer and closer to her face. Praying \ninwardly, she determined not to duck or run. Even when the lead \ngrazed her forehead, she stood with steady eyes. The ringleader \ndropped the weight. \"Its OK boys. She's game!\" He made his whole gang \nattend meeting. \"What is courage, but faith conquering fear?\" she \nasked later.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn August 5, 1876 she sailed for Africa. There she saw cruel gods \ncarved of wood and stone. The Nigerians sacrificed humans to these \nidols. Mary put her life on the line to rescue slaves and women from \ndeath. She fought against judgment by ordeal. A person suspected of \ndoing wrong might be forced to eat poison beans; or boiling oil might \nbe poured over him. Every one tested by these methods proved to be \n\"guilty.\" Such cruelty infuriated Mary. When a man poured boiling oil \non the hands of an eleven year old boy, Mary grabbed a scoop of the \nscalding liquid and chased the man to slop oil on him and \"prove\" \nthat he was not innocent either.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother evil she fought was the treatment of wives after a husband's \ndeath. A chicken was beheaded in front of the unlucky women. \nDepending on how it flopped, the wife was pronounced guilty or \ninnocent of her husband's death. The legs of \"guilty\" wives were \nbroken and the women thrown alive into their husband's grave.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nigerians enslaved and branded each other. When a chief died, \ndozens of slaves were killed. Unwanted babies were thrown into the \nbush. Twins were buried alive or thrown into the forest, their mother \ndriven off to die. The tribes fought, danced and drank. Sometimes \nthey ate one another. Everyone lived in terror. A secret society \nknown as the Egbo went around in masks and beat people. Once Mary \nshowed how weak they really were by chasing a group of Egbo and \ntearing off one sheepish man's mask.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy her bold actions, Mary made a major contribution in bringing an \nend to the worst abuses. Gradually she helped Nigerians recognize \nthat lives are worth saving. She succeeded because she trusted God. \n\"God and one are always a majority,\" she declared.\u0014\n\u0014\nResources:\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted and arranged from Christian History Institute's Glimpses \n#128.\u0014",

    "title": "MY QUEST TO FIND THE WORD \"HOMOSEXUAL\" IN THE BIBLE",
    "words": "My quest to find the word homosexual in the Bible\u0014\nED OXFORD  |  AUGUST 10, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\niThe first appearance of the word \"homosexual\" in an English \ntranslation of the Bible was placed in 1 Corinthians 6:9 by \ntranslators of the Revised Standard Version.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was born and raised in a Southern Baptist church by two incredibly \namazing parents who dearly love the Lord. It was a great experience. \nI remember Sunday school and Training Union, contributing to Lottie \nMoon and Annie Armstrong for foreign and home missions, and many \nother traditions that still bring fond memories.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy heart for missions began as a kid in that SBC church and, \nultimately, resulted in answering Gods call to help fulfill the \nGreat Commission by serving overseas in Japan. I later returned \nstateside and enrolled in Talbot Seminary to grow in my understanding \nof Gods word.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was my Southern Baptist roots where I gained a deep appreciation \nfor Scripture. My hearts desire was to do my part in spreading the \ngospel. I wanted to share Christ and disciple others and was gearing \nup for a lifetime of furthering the kingdom of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, I was gay.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod cant use me\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving heard many sermons throughout my life, I was convinced God did \nnot want me  nor could God use me. I was an abomination. I was \ndamaged goods. I tried to change. Oh, I tried so hard! Prayer and \nfasting. Reparative therapy. The only thing that changed was that I \nexperienced more and more depression.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo I just held on to the hope that God would one day provide a way  \nsome special pill, an accomplished therapist, or I would just \nmiraculously wake up straight.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch taught me that gay people were horrible and nasty. They had an \nagenda. They wanted to destroy the family and, ultimately, the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Christian friends were angry with me that I wouldnt (couldnt) \ngive up being gay, and my gay friends were angry that I wouldnt give \nup on the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this wasnt me; I didnt want to destroy the church. I love Gods \nchurch. And I love God with all my heart.\u0014\n\u0014\nI recognized in my teenage years that I was same-sex attracted and \nthought it was just a stage I would grow out of. During college, I \nrealized it was not going away and in fact was getting more intense.\u0014\n\u0014\nDepression continued. Pain. Self-hatred.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Christian friends were angry with me that I wouldnt (couldnt) \ngive up being gay, and my gay friends were angry that I wouldnt give \nup on the church. I felt homeless.\u0014\n\u0014\nA revelation in Bible study\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day during my personal Bible study and devotional, I was reading \nActs chapter 10 where Peter saw a vision of God letting a sheet \ndescend with all kinds of unclean animals. Peter was disgusted by \nwhat he saw, but God told him not to call them disgusting because God \ncreated these things and God had made them clean.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I reflected on those words, the thought came to my mind: What if \nGod was OK with gays? I immediately dismissed such a notion as \nhorrible and satanically influenced. However, Gods Spirit continued \nto work on me, even seeming to offer the question, Well, what would \nyou do if an angel came down and told you that God was OK with you \nbeing gay? (Kind of like Pauls road to Damascus experience.)\u0014\n\u0014\nI was shocked! I could not believe my mind entertained such a notion. \nThe Bible is clear on this issue, so there is no reason for debate. \nIf I were to hear this from an angel, I would have written it off as \nSatan disguising himself as an angel because I felt Gods word was \nclear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, I was declaring to God that the only way I would ever change my \nmind about homosexuality was if God showed me through Scripture. In \nthat moment, I had set a condition before God. God was going to have \nto convince me that Scripture was teaching something different than \nwhat I thought it was teaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nDigging into the Greek and Hebrew\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout a decade later, after many episodes of extreme depression, I \ndecided I wanted to dig into this with all my heart, soul and mind. I \nwanted to know the truth, regardless of what it entailed or revealed. \nI did not set out to prove or disprove any preconceived narratives. \nInstead, I only sought facts in order to weigh the evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nI started with the Greek and Hebrew texts and realized I needed to \nstudy the historical context of each of these texts in order to \nclearly understand the passages. So I put my seminary training of \nGreek and Hebrew to work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe English word homosexual was not in any Bible until 1946.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the many things I discovered was that the English word \nhomosexual was not in any Bible until 1946, when it appeared in the \nRevised Standard Version. I was shocked. I wanted to know who put it \nin there and how they came to that conclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy research led me to the Yale University archives, where the RSV \ntranslation notes are held. In September 2017, I traveled to Yale \nwith author and researcher Kathy Baldock and spent many days \nsearching for the answer to the question, Why did this translation \nteam make the historic decision to put the word homosexual into the \nBible for the first time?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe RSV translation team kept meticulous notes; we even found a \ngrocery shopping list. This team of 22 men were extremely godly and \nahead of their time. The letters they left behind showed how they \nencouraged churches and church leaders to include Blacks and women on \ncommittees where important decisions were being made.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther Allan Weigle, head of the RSV translation team, has been \ncalled the father of the modern Sunday school movement because he \nintroduced curriculum that could be used to teach children about \nBible stories. He was a big advocate for missions in Japan and China. \nAnd one time he received a letter from an elderly lady asking that he \nwrite Congress requesting the discontinuation of the poll tax. \n(Citizens in her town were required to pay $1 for a voter \nregistration card. But poor families could not afford this and \ninstead spent that $1 on much needed food, thus preventing their \nrepresentation in elections). Weigle enthusiastically agreed and \nwrote a letter to Congress.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer in the archives\u0014\n\u0014\nThe RSV committee decided the word homosexual was an inaccurate \ntranslation of malakoi and arsenokoitai in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and \nreplaced it with sexual perverts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the third day at Yale we found the answer  after we got to know \nthis wonderful team of translators. The answer was found in an \nexchange of letters between a seminary student and Weigle. This \nseminary student challenged the usage of the word homosexual in 1 \nCorinthians 6:9 and provided a detailed outline of his reasoning. \nWeigle responded and admitted that the translation team had indeed \nmade a mistake and would seek to correct it in their next update.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Weigle had just signed a contract stating that he would not \nmake any changes in the RSV for 10 years. During those 10 years, \ntranslation teams were working on the translations of the first New \nAmerican Standard Bible, The Living Bible and New International \nVersion Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nA subcommittee of the RSV translation team voting on one of many \ndecisions required to create a new English translation of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe then went to research in the translation notes of the NASB, TLB \nand NIV Bibles. It turns out these versions used the RSV as their \nbasis for including the word homosexual in their translations, not \nknowing that the RSV had retracted its decision.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe RSV committee decided the word homosexual was an inaccurate \ntranslation of malakoi and arsenokoitai in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and \nreplaced it with sexual perverts. An example of sexual perverts \nwould be a dirty old man exposing himself to children on a \nplayground. The RSV team admitted that the Greek word arsenokoitai \nwas not condemning homosexuals, but instead those who were abusive in \ntheir pursuit of sexual encounters.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorical context of Pauls time\u0014\n\u0014\nThe historical context shows that pederasty, sex with slaves, temple \nprostitution and other abusive forms of sex were prevalent in the \nfirst century when the Apostle Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. Even though \nthe Bible contains six verses that appear to condemn homosexual \nactivity, it contains more than 200 verses that condemn heterosexual \nactivity. So as researchers it is important for us to determine the \ntype of homosexual or heterosexual activity being condemned.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is important for us to determine the type of homosexual or \nheterosexual activity being condemned.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst century people had no context of same-sex, committed monogamous \nrelationships, therefore they would not be able to have the \nperspective we are able to see after 150 years of studying \nhomosexuality. We might as well ask them what they thought about \niPhones. They would have no frame of reference. But Paul definitely \ndid not approve of the reprehensible same-sex activity that involved \nvarious abuses. Hence his words in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three main English Bible versions of the 1970s (NASB, TLB, NIV) \nare the translations I grew up on. They are the most influential \nEnglish translations in our lifetime. Since their publication some 40 \nyears ago, we have seen the largest amount of teen and young adult \nsuicide in the history of the world. How can this be? In part, it is \nbecause we have been giving the wrong advice, advice shaped after the \nword homosexual entered the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince our time in the Yale archives, I have done an enormous amount \nof investigation. I traveled thousands of miles, spent tens of \nthousands of dollars on research, and interviewed hundreds of people. \nI ultimately realized that the evidence is incredibly overwhelming. I \neventually had to admit that I had been wrong about homosexuality. I \nhad to admit that my church and my denomination had been wrong about \nhomosexuality. My Southern Baptist background taught me to approach \nBible study as a Berean, and the Bereans in Acts 17 wouldnt even \nbelieve the Apostle Pauls words until they studied the Scriptures \nand did their own due diligence.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo for me to continue down the path of a non-affirming theology would \nhave required me to discard the volumes of irrefutable facts I had \nuncovered from intense research.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe were wrong about slavery too\u0014\nAll this reminds me of how we Southern Baptists made that atrocious \nmistake 200 years ago regarding slavery. Some Southern Baptist \npastors felt that if we abolished slavery, we might as well do away \nwith the New Testament because we wouldnt be following it anymore. \nThey actually believed they were being obedient to Gods word by \nholding on to slavery. Ridiculous, huh?\u0014\n\u0014\nLooking back from our 21st century perspective, we find it difficult \nto comprehend that pastors taught such things. But for them, it was \nreal. It was a matter of following their (misguided) understanding of \nGods word in order to hold on to slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo much damage has been done. Too many lives have been lost. Its \ntime to fix this.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEd Oxford lives in Long Beach, Calif. He is a graduate of Miami \nUniversity and Talbot School of Theology. A former staff member with \nCampus Crusade for Christ, he now works in the financial services \nindustry. He and Kathy Baldock are the author of a forthcoming book, \nForging a Sacred Weapon: How the Bible Became Anti-Gay. Their \nresearch also will be featured in a new documentary, 1946: The \nTranslation that Shifted a Culture. This column is adapted from a \nletter sent to key Southern Baptist pastors by the Tyler Clementi \nFoundation.\u0014",

    "title": "MASTER MENDELSSOHN REVIVED MASTER BACH",
    "words": "Master Mendelssohn Revived Master Bach\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Sebastian Bach believed in the resurrection. The \"crucifixus\" \nof his Mass in B minor ended with low register voices to suggest \nChrist going down into the grave and the next chorus breaks forth in \njoy to express resurrection. Bach's music went through a resurrection \nof its own. Virtually forgotten at his death, the bulk of his work \nlay neglected for almost a century. Fish vendors in the market \nwrapped their ware in Bach manuscripts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's life was defined by poverty. But in music he poured out \nwealth. Every form he touched, he improved. He perfected the \n\"well-tempered\" scale which by dividing every octave into twelve \nequal distances allowed any key on the organ to start a scale. His \nkeyboard technique used all five fingers where three had been the \nnorm. The Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained \nmusicians such as Beethoven. Beethoven remarked: \"He should not be \ncalled Bach (brook) but Meer (sea).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery note Bach wrote was dedicated to Christ. Throughout his \nmanuscripts appear cryptic abbreviations such as \"I. N. J.\" standing \nfor In Nomine Jesu; that is, \"In the Name of Jesus.\" According to \nhim, music's aim and purpose is to glorify God and provide recreation \nfor the mind. \"Where this is not observed there will be no real music \nbut only devilish hubbub.\" He poured emotion into his music which \nbecame the mother of Romanticism. His portrayals of Christ's passion \nmade frequent use of dissonance. Combining expressive melodies with a \nrhythmic bass line, he conveyed, according to William H. Scheide, \n\"the union of the divine and human in the person of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man's work fell into neglect was regrettable. Those near \nhim simply did not recognize his genius. Shortly after Bach died one \nBurgomaster remarked unfeelingly, \"The school needed a cantor and not \na Kapellmeister.\" For fifty years no Bach piece was published \nseparately on its own merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's revival was largely owing to another Christian composer. Felix \nMendelssohn was in awe of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. He arranged to \nhave Bach's St. Matthew Passion played on this day March 11, 1829, \nalmost exactly a century from the date of its first, long-forgotten \nperformance. Mendelssohn himself conducted. \"Never,\" wrote one \nparticipant, \"have I known any performance so consecrated by one \nunited sympathy.\" More than 1,000 people were unable to get tickets. \nTwo further concerts had to be scheduled at once. So great was the \nsensation that composer Hector Berlioz marveled, \"There is but one \ngod--Bach and Mendelssohn, his prophet.\" Today many consider Bach the \ngreatest composer who ever lived. Mendelssohn's oratorios Elijah and \nPaul are his own monuments to faith. Mendelssohn died at thirty six, \nworn out with overwork.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bach, Johann Sebastian.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch. Edited by F. L.

    "title": "MYTHS OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM",
    "words": "Myths of \nAmerican exceptionalism:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of the Chosen Nation holds that God Almighty chose the \nUnited States for a special mission in the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of Natures Nation claims that while other nations are built \non human ideals, the United States is rooted in the natural order, in \nGods own design, in the way things are meant to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of the Christian Nation contends that the Christian religion \ninformed the American founding and continues to shape the nations \nideals and behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of the Millennial Nation suggests that the United States, \nthrough the power of its democracy, will eventually lead the world \ninto a golden age of freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of the Innocent Nation contends that while other nations may \nhave blood on their hands, the purity of its ideals renders the \nUnited States perpetually innocent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2012, nine years after that book appeared in print, a Black \nscholar named James Noel turned my world upside down. I had just \ngiven a lecture on the American myths at the national meeting of the \nAmerican Academy of Religion when Noel kindly but firmly invited me \nto think more deeply.\u0014\n\u0014\nProfessor, he said, you completely left out the most important of \nall the American myths. And what might that be? I asked. You left \nout, he replied, the defining American myth  the myth of white \nsupremacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as I knew, Bellah never had argued that white supremacy was \none of the American myths, much less the driving American myth, and \nneither had I. But James Noel, who saw the nation through the eyes of \nblackness, helped me discern truths about my nation that I had never \neven considered.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Noel, who saw the nation through the eyes of blackness, helped \nme discern truths about my nation that I had never even considered.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the months to come, I shared my newfound insights with scholars \nand ordinary Americans, both Black and white. The response from \nwhites ranged from denial to bewilderment, but Blacks typically \nresponded with a simple question: What took you so long to figure \nthis out?\u0014\n\u0014\nWith affirmations like that, I approached my publisher about a second \nedition of Myths America Lives By  an edition that would place white \nsupremacy front and center.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat second edition grappled with the question, What would it mean \nfor the doctrine of American exceptionalism if white supremacy were, \nindeed, the defining American myth? It now seemed clear to me that \nwhite supremacy had colored and corrupted each of those myths.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even in the second edition, I wondered, could we somehow divorce \nthese myths from the doctrine of white supremacy? And if so, did they \nhave at least some redemptive potential? I still could not free \nmyself from the notion that at least some of the American myths might \nyet serve the nation well.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that was before the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, inspired by one \nbranch of the American government. The rioters implicitly embraced \nvirtually all the American myths. They assaulted police on behalf of \na nation that, in their view, was chosen to be white. They built a \nnoose for Vice President Pence on the grounds that he had betrayed \nthis whitened Christian nation. They hunted for Speaker Nancy Pelosi \nsince, from their perspective, she had betrayed the white and natural \norder of things.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rioters implicitly embraced virtually all the American myths.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe insurrection helped me finally to see that the doctrine of \nAmerican exceptionalism, with all its constituent myths, is so \nentwined with whiteness that it never can serve all the American \npeople. It can serve white people. It can serve rich people, even \npeople of moderate means. But it will never serve people of color and \nit will never serve the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard T.

They also hold to the beliefs that success is defined \nby personal happiness, owning property fosters economic inequality, \nabortions and pre-marital sex are okay, and getting even with others \nis defensible.\u0014\n\u0014\nGen X and the Millennials have solidified dramatic changes in the \nnations central beliefs and lifestyles, George Barna, CRC Director \nof Research, explained in a statement. The result is a culture in \nwhich core institutions, including churches, and basic ways of life \nare continually being radically redefined.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it comes to beliefs in personal salvation, 40 percent of people \n55 and over identify as born-again Christians, whereas a mere 16 \npercent of Millennials meet the criterion.

    "title": "MANY YOUNG JEWISH ADULTS CLAIM NO RELIGION",
    "words": "Reaction & Response: Many Young Jewish Adults Claim No Religion\u0014\nby Zach Dawes Jr | May 20, 2021 | \u0014\n\u0014\nYounger Jewish adults in the U.S. are more likely to say they have no \nreligion, according to a Pew Research Center report published on May \n11.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile 60% of respondents aged 18-29 are Jews by religion, 40% are \nJews of no religion. This is the highest percentage of any age \ngroup.\u0014\n\u0014\nJews by religion refers to respondents who said their present \nreligion is Jewish, the report explained, while Jews of no \nreligion identifies respondents who consider themselves to be \nJewish ethnically, culturally or by family background and have a \nJewish parent or were raised Jewish, but they answer a question about \ntheir current religion by describing themselves as atheist, agnostic \nor nothing in particular rather than as Jewish.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy comparison, 33% of those aged 30-49, 19% of those aged 50-64 and \n16% of those 65 and older all are Jews of no religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nOverall, 27%  more than one in four  of all Jewish adults are Jews \nof no religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe youngest respondents (aged 18-29) were also the most likely group \nto be affiliated with Orthodox Judaism (17%), compared to 11% of 30- \nto 49-year-olds, 7% of 50- to 64-year-olds and 3% of those 65-plus.\u0014\n\u0014\nRespondents 65 and older were most likely to identify with Reform \nJudaism (44%), compared to 35% of those 50-64, 37% of those 30-59 and \n29% of those 18-29.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey were also the most likely group to identify with Conservative \nJudaism (25%), compared to 22% of respondents 50- to 64-year-olds, \n11% of those 30-49 and 8% of those 18-29.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince 2013, affiliation with both Reform Judaism and no particular \nbranch has increased two points (to 37% and 32%, respectively) while \naffiliation with both Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism has \ndeclined one point (to 17% and 9%, respectively).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn terms of political affiliation, a strong majority of three of the \nfour traditions surveyed identify as Democratic / lean Democratic \n(Reform, 80%; no particular branch, 75%; Conservative, 70%). By \ncontrast, a strong majority of Orthodox respondents (75%) identify as \nRepublican / lean Republican.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile these generational shifts toward both Orthodoxy and secular \nJewishness have the potential, in time, to reshape American Jewry, \nthe new survey paints a portrait of Jewish Americans in 2020 that is \nnot dramatically different from 2013, the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCounting all Jewish adults  young and old, combined  the \npercentages who identify as Orthodox, Conservative and Reform are \nlittle changed. The size of the adult Jewish population is also \nremarkably stable in percentage terms, while rising in absolute \nnumbers, roughly in line with the total U.S. population.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe full report is available here. The topline results are available \nhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nI reached out to several Jewish faith leaders, asking for their \ninsight and perspective regarding the trends observed in the Pew \nsurvey data. Here is what they said:\u0014\n\u0014\nJack Moline -- 'The Pew Study contains at least three important \nfindings for the United States Jewish community, said Jack Moline, \npresident of Interfaith Alliance, a Conservative rabbi and member of \nthe Good Faith Media strategic advisory board.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first is that not much has changed in seven years, a relief in a \ntime when not much seems to be stable. The second is that Jews in \nAmerica are a lot like everyone else, which ought to be obvious (but \nit is nice to have statistical validation!), he said. The third is \nthat the gap within the community between the very religious and the \nmuch less religious is more pronounced  and there seems to be little \nwill to bridge it. In and of itself, this finding is cause for deep \nconcern.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is also worth noting (as others have) that some of the questions \nposed (particularly about belief in God) presume a certain definition \nof faith commitment that may be valid in Christian circles, but is \ndifferently nuanced in among Jews, Moline said. All in all, there \nare some interesting sermons and blog posts to be expected in the \ncoming months!\u0014\n\u0014\nMelissa Balaban -- As Jewish leaders, our responsibility is to work \nin partnership with young people to catalyze Jewish experiences that \nmove them to deepen their relationship with our texts and \ntraditions, said Melissa Balaban, CEO and founding president of IKAR \nand the chair of the Jewish Emergent Network.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you go beyond the statistics, we consistently see that young \nJews are craving community that has depth, is spiritually compelling, \nrooted in justice and is a source of comfort and moral courage, she \nsaid. This has only become more apparent during this time of \nturmoil, uncertainty and fierce polarization.\u0014\n\u0014\nFred Guttman -- It did not surprise me that Jews felt that there was \nmore anti-Semitism. What surprised me the most was that there are now \n800,000 more Jews than there were in 2013, said Fred Guttman, a \nReform rabbi who has served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel in \nGreensboro, North Carolina, since 1995.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of this increase was due to an increase in conversion, which in \nitself is interesting because Jews do not actively seek converts. \nAside from the usual converts due to intermarriage, the study shows \nthat people converted after finding out about a DNA test from \nAncestry.com or 23andMe or because they found Judaism more open to \nLGBTQ people or because they started looking into Judaism on Google \nand wanted further study, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were other reasons including wanting to become a part of an \nancient people, a lack of doctrinaire theology and an attraction to \nJudaisms emphasis on social justice, Guttman said. All in all, I \nfound this to be quite surprising, even though we have noticed some \nof this in our congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have only one question for the sociologists. What is a Jew of no \nreligion? asked Steven Greenberg, founding director of Eshel, an \nOrthodox rabbi, educator, writer and speaker who has led the call for \nLGBTQ inclusion in the Orthodox world.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Greenberg -- Religion isnt a Jewish word. It has no true \nHebrew translation. Even the word dat that is used in Modern Hebrew \nis of Persian in origin and means law, not religion. Pew is bedeviled \nby categories that are fundamentally Protestant, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile that is the idiomatic context for many American Jews, still, \nquestions about Heaven and Hell? Really? Asking whether the Bible \nshould be taken literally, or not literally? This is a nonsensical \nquestion for anyone who knows the first thing about Jewish scripture \nand its interpretation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Jews dont experience Jewish religion as Christians \nexperience Christianity, Greenberg said. We are a people that share \nlanguage, music, food, humor, literature, rituals. Mitzvot, prayers \nand protests and passions, a land and a diaspora, a penchant for \ncontroversy and paradox and a profound spiritual and moral heritage.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps if we asked different questions, we might discover that many \nJews who have no religion do experience something like Yiddishkeit, \nhe said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nZach Dawes Jr, Good Faith Media\u0014",

    "words": "Friends Mourn Steve Austin, Former Pastor and Author Who Wrote about \nSuicide and Mental Health\u0014\nBob Smietana | Religion News Service | Friday, June 11, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\n(RNS)  Steve Austin, a former pastor who wrote candidly about his \nstruggles with mental health, has died.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice in Hoover, Alabama, confirmed that the body of Austin, whose \nfull name was Glenn Stephen Austin, was found in that city on Monday \n(June 7). The death is being investigated as a suicide.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral friends and his publisher also confirmed Austins death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAustin, 38, was a writer, podcaster and life coach from Alabaster, \nAlabama, known for his writing about faith and mental health. Hed \nrecently announced plans to start a program called Jesus Coaching \nto help people deconstruct your faith and uncover your true self in \na safe, confidential, supportive environment.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn blog posts and in his 2016 book, From Pastor to a Psych Ward, \nAustin wrote about being found unconscious in a hotel room by \nemergency responders after taking an overdose of medication in a \nfailed suicide attempt.\u0014\n\u0014\nI had been unconscious nearly 12 hours, he wrote. They thought I \nwas dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurviving that experience gave him a second chance. Austin, who had \nbeen abused as a child, spent years trying to reduce the stigma of \nmental illness in churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wanted people to know that they could love Jesus and have a \ntherapist, said Holly Oxhandler, an associate dean at the Diana \nGarland School of Social Work at Baylor University.\u0014\n\u0014\nOxhandler, who became friends with Austin because of their shared \ninterest in the intersection of mental health and faith, said she had \nbeen texting with him on Saturday about the possibility of meeting \nup. She and her family were driving home from vacation and their trip \ntook them close to the Birmingham area, where Austin and his family \nlived.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was messaging with him just this past Saturday late afternoon, \nsaid Oxhandler, who also co-hosts CXMH, a podcast about mental \nhealth and faith that Austin also co-hosted before Oxhandler joined \nin 2018.\u0014\n\u0014\nAustins life, she said, was filled with light and he devoted himself \nto helping others. He especially wanted his fellow Christians to know \nstruggling with mental illness did not diminish their faith or \ninherent worth in any way.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd he did not hide his own struggles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat honesty drew people to Austin, said author and therapist Aundi \nKolber, who had recently taken part in a faith and mental health book \nclub organized by Austin, where they discussed her book, Try Softer.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wanted people to know that they were loved, she said. He had \nthis way of being both witty and tender, which was such a great \ncombination.\u0014\n\u0014\nAustin was the author of three books, including Catching Your Breath: \nThe Sacred Journey From Chaos to Calm and Hiding in the Pews: Shining \nLight on Mental Illness in the Church. The latter is due out this \nsummer from Fortress Press.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortress Press is deeply saddened to learn of Steve Austins death \nand we extend condolences and prayers for Gods peace to his family \nand his many friends. Steves advocacy for greater recognition of \nmental health issues in the church made a remarkable impact and \nHiding in the Pews is a lasting testimony to that work, Will \nBergkamp, editor-in-chief of Fortress Press, told Religion News \nService. Honoring Steves legacy and message is of utmost importance \nand thus Fortress is currently in conversation internally and with \nhis close contacts about next steps, including the timing of \npublication.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Vore, who co-hosts the CXMH podcast about mental health and \nfaith with Oxhandler, told RNS he and other friends of Austin had \nbecome worried about him in recent days. Several were on the phone \ntogether, trying to figure out how to reach him, when they heard of \nhis death.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had one of the biggest hearts I had ever encountered, especially \nfor people going through hard times, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the last handful of years, Steve has called himself a lot of \nthings: life coach, emotional coach, pig raiser, church consultant, \nonline pastor, and more, Vore wrote in a blog tribute to his friend. \nSome titles never changed: he was a husband, a dad, and a damn good \nfriend to me. There was never a time I texted or called him that he \nwasnt there for me. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his Substack newsletter, Austin posted podcast episodes and \nreflections on mental health and faith, along with personal stories. \nHe recently wrote about coming out as queer, something he said hed \nhad to hide his whole life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you have any idea how exhausting it is to perform your whole life \nfor people who will only fully accept you if you deny anything about \nyourself that doesnt meet their approval? he wrote. For the past \nthree decades, Ive lived a lie, hoping to appease a group of people \nwho only support you if you follow their rules and live up to their \nunfair and unrealistic expectations.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian childrens book author Matthew Paul Turner, who a year ago \ncame out as gay, said he and Austin had become friends over the past \nyear. The two had been texting on Saturday when Austin dropped out of \ncontact.\u0014\n\u0014\nOxhandler described Austin as a beloved and tender wounded healer, \na term used by the late writer and priest Henri Nouwen. Austins own \nstruggles made him compassionate toward others, she said. And he made \npeople feel like they mattered.\u0014\n\u0014\nOxhandler said that when she spoke to Austin on Saturday, there were \nno indicators it would be their last conversation. She expressed deep \ngrief and said there is no making sense of his passing.\u0014",

    "words": "1566\u0014\nPhilip becomes Metropolitan of Moscow, chosen by Tsar Ivan IV the \nTerrible, who will have him strangled three years later because of \nhis bold stands against the Tsars blasphemies and cruelties.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the initial years of Philips hierarchical service (1567-68) \nthe terrors of the Oprichnina subsided, but not for long. Soon, \nlooting and murder of peaceful citizens resumed. In several private \nconversations, Philip tried to enlighten the Tsar, but seeing that \nhis arguments were not helping, decided to take action openly.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the beginning of the Liturgy for the Sunday of the Cross, \nMarch 21st, 1568, the Metropolitan was standing on the cathedra in \nthe middle of the church. Suddenly Tsar Ivan, accompanied by a group \nof oprichniki, entered the church. They all wore tall black hats and \nblack riassas, from within which shone knives and daggers. Ivan \napproached the Metropolitan from the side and three times bowed his \nhead to receive his blessing. The Metropolitan stood still, his gaze \ndirected at the icon of the Savior... Finally the boyars said: Holy \nMaster, the Tsar demands your blessing! The Hierarch turned to Ivan, \nas if not recognizing him, and said: In this strange apparel I do \nnot recognize an Orthodox tsar; nor do I recognize him in matters of \nthe realm. O pious one! Whose example do you follow, to so deform \nyour magnificence in this way? At no time since the sun has shone \nupon the earth has it been heard that pious Tsars should incite their \nown kingdom to rebel The Tartars and pagans have law and truth - but \nwe have it not! We, my lord, offer the bloodless sacrifice up to God, \nwhile beyond the altar the innocent blood of Christians is being \nspilled. I do not sorrow for those, who by the spilling of their \ninnocent blood are made worthy to join the Holy Martyrs; I grieve for \nyour poor soul. Although graced with the Image of God, you are \nnonetheless an ordinary mortal, and the Lord will exact all from your \nhands.\u0014\n\u0014\nIvan was seething with rage. He whispered threats, and banged his \nstaff upon the stone of the cathedra. Finally he exclaimed: Philip! \nDo you dare to oppose our authority? We will see if your strength be \ngreat! O Good Tsar, the hierarch answered, in vain do you try to \nfrighten me. I am but a stranger on this earth, struggling for the \ntruth, and no manner of suffering will silence me. Terribly \nirritated, Ivan left the church, but hid his anger only for a time.\u0014\n\u0014\n---\u0014\n \u0014\nOn November 8, the Feast of the Archangel Michael, the Holy Hierarch \nwas serving for the last time in the Cathedral of the Dormition. He \nwas standing on the cathedra, just as he had been when he denounced \nTsar Ivan the Terrible. Suddenly the doors of the church opened and \nthe boyar Basmanov entered with a host of oprichniki and ordered the \nreading of a document in which it was announced to the surprised \nfaithful that the Metropolitan was being defrocked. The oprichniki \nimmediately ripped the hierarchs vestments from him. Clothing him in \na torn monastic riassa, they led him out of the church. They sat him \nin a cart and, shouting expletives at him drove him to one of the \nMoscow monasteries. It was rumored that the Tsar wanted to burn the \nConfessor for Christ, and that only after intercession by the clergy \nwas Philip condemned to incarceration for life. At the same time, the \ntsar executed many of Philips relatives. The Terrible one sent the \nHoly Hierarch the head of Ivan Borisovitch Kolichev, Philips most \nbeloved nephew. Holy hierarch Philip received it reverently; after \nmaking a prostration before it, he kissed it and said: Blessed is he \nwhom Thou hast chosen and accepted, O Lord, and returned it to the \nsender. From morning to night the faithful gathered around the \nmonastery, wanting to at least catch a glimpse of the glorious \nhierarchs shadow, and told many stories of his miracles. Then Ivan \nordered that he be transferred to the Monastery of the Child in Tver.\u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, the Tsar and his warriors went into battle against \nNovgorod and Pskov. The Tsar sent the oprichnik Maliuta Skuratov \nahead of him to the Monastery of the Child. Three days earlier, St \nPhilip had prophesied his own coming repose and had prepared for it \nby Communing of the Holy Gifts. With a false air of humility, Maliuta \napproached the Hierarch and asked a blessing for the Tsar. St Philip \nsaid: Do not blaspheme, and do the deed for which you came. Maliuta \nthrew himself at the hierarch and strangled him to death. A grave was \nimmediately dug and Maliuta witnessed the Hieromartyr being lowered \ninto it on December 23, 1569. The relics of St Philip lay in the \nMoscow Cathedral of the Dormition, which had witnessed his enormous \nspiritual struggle.\u0014",

Dreadfully persecuted, he had been humiliated, had \nhis tongue cut out and his right hand chopped off. Monothelitism was \nthe heresy that Christ had a divine, but no human, will.\u0014\n\u0014\nSt. Maximus the Confessor\u0014\n\u0014\nOur venerable and God-bearing Father Maximus the Confessor (ca. \n580-662) was an Orthodox Christian monk and ascetical writer known \nespecially for his courageous fight against the heresy of \nMonothelitism. His feast days in the Church are celebrated on January \n21 and, for the translation of his relics, on August 13.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was born in the region of Constantinople, was well educated, and \nspent some time in government service before becoming a monk, having \nbeen a member of the old Byzantine aristocracy and holding the post \nof Imperial Secretary under Emperor Heraclius. Around 614, he became \na monk (later abbot) at the monastery of Chrysopolis. During the \nPersian invasion of the Empire (614), he fled to Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom about 640 on, he became the determined opponent of \nMonothelitism, the heretical teaching that Jesus Christ had only one \nwill. In this, he followed the example of St. Sophronius of \nJerusalem, who was the first to combat this heresy starting in 634.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaximus supported the Orthodoxy of Rome on this matter and is said to \nhave exclaimed: \"I have the faith of the Latins, but the language of \nthe Greeks.\" He argued for Dyothelitism, the Orthodox teaching that \nJesus Christ possessed two wills (one divine and one human), rather \nthan the one will posited by Monothelitism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Pyrrhus, the temporarily deposed Monothelite Patriarch of \nConstantinople, had declared his defeat in a dispute at Carthage \n(645), Maximus obtained the heresy's condemnation at several local \nsynods in Africa, and also worked to have it condemned at the Lateran \nCouncil of 649. He was brought to Constantinople in 653, pressured to \nadhere to the Typos of Emperor Constans II. Refusing to do so, he was \nexiled to Thrace. (Pope St. Martin of Rome was tried around the same \ntime in Constantinople, and thus deposed and exiled to Crimea.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 661 Maximus again was brought to the imperial capital and \nquestioned; while there, he had his tongue uprooted and his right \nhand cut off (to prevent him from preaching or writing the true \nfaith), and then was again exiled to the Caucasus, but died shortly \nthereafter.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, Maximus was exonerated by the Sixth Ecumenical Council \nand recognized as a Father of the Church.\u0014",

    "words": "The Minor Prophets, as you know, are called that because of the size \nof the book, not because theyre less important.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost scholars agree that this minor prophet was speaking to a \npostexilic community of Jews who had returned to Judah from Babylon. \nMuch of the book is written as a series of disputations (one side \nagainst another), and the prophet serves as an arbiter in these \nconflicts between the people and God. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to complaints that God has failed to exercise divine \njudgment, the prophet delivers a rebuttal, which raises several \npoints. God doesnt have vocal chords and never has had. God is \nspirit, not flesh and blood. Therefore, when God is speaking in this \nor any other text, it is the prophet speaking for him as he \nunderstands Gods inspiration to him. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis section addresses two broad themes, which are woven together \nthroughout the text: (1) divine judgment, the Day of the Lord, and \nthe character of God's justice, and (2) the purification of the \npeople.\u0014\n\u0014\nLike Amos and Jeremiah, the book of Malachi is guided by what we \nmight call a mediator, one who takes questions or remarks by one side \nand then conveys them to the other side with responses shared the \nsame way. Malachi is the one in the middle in this book but is also \nspeaking for God.\u0014\n\u0014\n A perfect example is found in 2:17. Malachi, continuing the \nconversation found in its previous verses, tells the people that God \nhas said they weary him with their words. And then the people \nanswer, Where have we wearied him? Then Malachi gives the answer: \nBy saying, All who do evil are good in the eyes of the LORD, and he \nis pleased with them (note the sarcasm in that remark) or Where is \nthe God of justice? This is the question that everything else in \nthis passage hinges on.\u0014\n\u0014\n118 times the OT refers to justice, its importance in the providence \nand goodness of God and how it is to be administered.  Solomons \ngreat request of God was that he be enabled to administer justice to \nhis people, and God said, I will do what youve asked. (1 Kings \n3:11) But thats not what his descendants wanted. They practiced \nanything but. Justice to them is what best serves my interest. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe people, newly restored in Judah, are skeptical of God's justice, \nbecause their practices of piety have yielded neither divine judgment \nagainst \"evildoers\" nor prosperity for the restoration community. \nTheir challenges to the prophet smack of self-righteousness, and they \nseemingly have failed to notice that their compromised worship \npractices, marital infidelity, and social injustice dishonor God.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow notice, please, what justice is. Justice acts with reference to \nthe needs and interests of all concerned. Justice is not a \nblood-thirsty attribute demanding revenge, but a desire for the \nprevalence of what is right. Justice is wanting to see something done \nsimply because it is right. Not just right for me. Justice and mercy \nare harmonious. They go together. \u0014\n\u0014\nMalachi faced indifference, caused by disappoint- \u0014\nment and skepticism, that led to a neglect of Temple service. Yet \nthere was a faithful nucleus in the community, but it was small \n(3:16). \u0014\n\u0014\nThey seek the coming of the Lord, they say, imagining that it will be \nfavorable for them. What theyre saying is, God needs to get in here \nand do something about this mess. The prophet, however, reminds the \npeople that the arrival of divine judgment rarely meets human \nexpectationsit is sudden, surprising, and often as much a judgment \nagainst the ones yearning for it as it is a judgment against their \nenemies (Amos 5:18). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Day of the Lord arrives, the prophet warns, all will be \nfound guilty and all will be deserving of punishment. In particular, \nin verse 5, the prophet warns that God's swift judgment will be \nexecuted upon the perpetrators of social injustice.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou may have already covered this in earlier lessons, but to \nunderstand the message of what we call the Minor Prophets, also \nreferred to as The Book of the Twelve, you have to understand the \nreturn from Babylon, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the restructuring \nof the Temple (the Second Temple or better known as \nZerubbabelsTempleabout 535 BC)  and the spirituality of those who \nreturned.  (The Temple was to them a perpetual reminder and visible \nsymbol of Gods presence and protection.) \u0014\n\u0014\nSacrifices were being offered there at this time. Although they \nfought like tigers with each other (sounds like a Baptist church to \nme) in trying to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and the Temple (see \nEzra, Nehemiah and Haggai), they eventually got it done. 20 years \nlater it was consecrated.  But the early zeal connected with building \nthe Temple seems at this point to have died out, and the religious \nlaxities and abuses which Malachi (about 450)  condemns are the same \nas those present under Ezra and Nehemiah. Just like their ancestors, \nthey began to wander from their commitment to God by getting lax in \ntheir devotion and dedication.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst Temple  Solomons (destroyed by Nechuchadnezzar in 587\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond Temple  Zerubbabels  516 B.C.  18 BC (One third larger \nthan Solomons Temple but did not contain all of the things that were \nin Solomons---which were stolen by the Babylonians.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerods Temple  18BC  65 AD. Destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.  \nLargest and most elaborate of all. Solomons Temple was a weenie in \ncomparison to Herods.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMixed marriages (explain) and divorces were present (2:10-17), the \npayment of tithes had been neglected (3:8-10) and blemished \nsacrifices were being offered  (1:6ff). The priests have shown \nthemselves lax in their liturgical duties (1:6-2:4) They have given \nfaulty instruction in the law and thereby caused many to stumble \n(2:5-9). \u0014\n\u0014\nTo add to the problem, the biggest issue they faced was these people \ndidnt think they had a problem. Other people had the problem. There \nwas nothing wrong with them. They were smug and confident in the \nbelief that since they were the chosen people, no calamity could come \nupon them. The worshipped the Lord with their lips, but their hearts \nwere far from him. Their lives were characterized by selfishness, \ngreed, immorality, and oppression of the poor. Amos would have been \nbrilliant in this setting. \"You sell the righteous for silver, and \nthe needy for a pair of sandals. There was no justice in the land. \nNotice that, please. NO JUSTICE in the land. Almost 200 years before \nthis message, Gods major complaint against the northern tribes was \nexactly the same thingno justice (Amos). \u0014\n\u0014\nPlease note that not in this message or any of the other prophets \ndoes God complain that the people dont believe the right things. Not \nonce.  It is never said, You dont have the right doctrines; you \ndont believe the right things. Your theology is shot. Never. So \nwhats Gods problem? Its their behavior, their total disregard of \ntheir personal sin and their failure to put a solid emphasis on \nseeing that justice above all other characteristics  is practiced to \nall people, including those outside the covenant. Despite past \npunishments, Israel has not yet changed its way and returned to the \nLord.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prophetsboth pre-Babylonian and post-Babylonian sought to warn \nthe people of the judgment of God coming upon. They all referred to \nit as The day of the Lord. These people were so arrogant and so out \nof touch with their spiritual relationship to God that their feeling \nwas, Bring it on! With all the stuff thats going on in this land, \nGod ought to have been here before now. He needs to clean up this \nplace. The prophets, all of them, (Amos, Micah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, \nIsaiah, Zephaniah, Malachi) all said, You dont know what youre \nasking for. When the day of the Lord comes, its going to be a \nterrible day. Hes going to clean house, and hes going to start with \nyou. You dont want that day to come.\u0014\n\u0014\nExample:  Amos  cities around Israel, then Israel\u0014\n\u0014\nI find that very, very interesting. I hear people today saying that \nGods judgment is going to comeat least shouldon America because of \nit sinful, God-ignoring ways. It sounds to me like theyre saying, \nBring it on. Its time he was doing that. These people deserve it. \nMy only problem with that is that when God starts to clean house, he \nmay be starting with you and with me, not those other people who are \napparently more blatant sinners than we churchy people.  \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n3:1. My messenger plays on the name of the prophet (Maliki). It does \nnot refer to a heavenly messenger. Neither does it refer to a \nspiritual being nor to the Angel of the Lord, but to an earthly \nmessenger of the Lord\u0014\n\u0014\n The Lord, however, will send his messenger (NO MENTIONI OF THE WORD \nMESSIAH OR JOHN THE BAPTIST IS IN THIS TEXT, although this text has \nbeen used to refer to John the Baptist or even Jesus himself) to \nprepare the day of his coming. (WEll look at that in just a \nminute.)His coming will purge the nation (3:1-6). If the people want \nto delight in the blessing of the Lord, they must be obedient to the \nlaws which he has revealed to them (3:7-12.) \u0014\n\u0014\nMalachi means my messenger. The messenger (3:1) is not named in \nthis book. Malachi was not used as a proper name for 500 years. About \nthe second century A.D. people began to refer to the book as Malachi.\u0014\n\u0014\n. Explain Historical-Manifold Fulfillment of O.T. prophecy.  Explain \nprophecy=forth-telling.  Examples:\u0014\n\u0014\nMatt 11:7-10\u0014\nAs John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd \nabout John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed \nswayed by the wind? 8 If not, what did you go out to see? A man \ndressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in \nkings' palaces. 9 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I \ntell you, and more than a prophet. 10 This is the one about whom it \nis written:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"'I will send my messenger ahead of you,\u0014\nwho will prepare your way before you.'   (Malachi 3:1) \u0014\n\u0014\n Mark 1:1-3\u0014\n\u0014\nThe beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. \u0014\n2 It is written in Isaiah the prophet:\u0014\n\"I will send my messenger ahead of you,\u0014\nwho will prepare your way\"   (Mal. 3:1)\u0014\n\u0014\n3 \"a voice of one calling in the desert,\u0014\n'Prepare the way for the Lord,\u0014\nmake straight paths for him.'\" (Isa. 40:3) \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not uncommon among Christians. (Isa. 53), but they could \nlater see in this figure what has been called a type of Christ. So \nthey read the text s if it was originally speaking of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n The Jew understood this text to talk about a Jewish leader who would \nhelp them see God moving amongst them. NOW, not 500 years later.  \u0014\n   \u0014\nThe character of the messengers coming (vv. 25)\u0014\n\u0014\nVV. 3-4  (The Message)\u0014\n \u0014\n  Hell be like white-hot fire from the smelters furnace. Hell be \nlike the strongest lye soap at the laundry. Hell take his place as a \nrefiner of silver, as a cleanser of dirty clothes. Hell scrub the \nLevite priests clean, refine them like gold and silver, until theyre \nfit for GOD, fit to present offerings of righteousness. Then, and \nonly then, will Judah and Jerusalem be fit and pleasing to GOD, as \nthey used to be in the years long ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat years is he referring to? It must be the early years of their \nentering the Promised Land because very shortly the influence of \nheathen neighbors turned them completely away from their first \ncommitment. There were some good kings, leaders who were genuinely \ncommitted to Gods will and way, but not many. Josiah was one of \nthese, but look at what he had to clean up.  \u0014\n    \u0014\n2 Kings 23:5-14\u0014\n\u0014\n5 He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah \nto burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those \naround Jerusalem  those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and \nmoon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. 6 He took \nthe Asherah pole from the temple of the LORD  to the Kidron Valley \noutside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and \nscattered the dust over the graves of the common people. 7 He also \ntore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes, which were in \nthe temple of the LORD  and where women did weaving for Asherah. \u0014\n\u0014\n8 Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and \ndesecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests \nhad burned incense. He broke down the shrinesa at the gates  at the \nentrance to the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which is on the \nleft of the city gate. 9 Although the priests of the high places did \nnot serve at the altar of the LORD  in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened \nbread with their fellow priests. \u0014\n\u0014\n10 He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so \nno one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter inb the fire to \nMolech. 11 He removed from the entrance to the temple of the LORD  \nthe horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They \nwere in the court near the room of an official named Nathan  Melech. \nJosiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun. \u0014\n12 He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the \nroof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built \nin the two courts of the temple of the LORD . He removed them from \nthere, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron \nValley. 13 The king also desecrated the high places that were east of \nJerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption  the ones Solomon \nking of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the \nSidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molechc the \ndetestable god of the people of Ammon. 14 Josiah smashed the sacred \nstones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with \nhuman bones. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord calls for his people to return (vv. 67a)\u0014\n\u0014\nReturn to me, and I will return to you.  What does return mean? To \nrenew or to use a better Baptist term, to rededicate. \u0014\nThe people refuse (v. 7b)\u0014\nWhen the people heard the Lords message, they asked, In what way \nshall we return? More sarcasm.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should not take this to mean that they were sincerely asking for \nguidance on the matter of returning to the Lord. Far from it! They \nwere essentially saying, With reference to what sin should we \nreturn? In other words, they were saying, We havent done anything!\u0014\n\u0014\nWith reference to the question, Whats wrong with us, Malachis \nanswer is found in the verses weve already seen (6-7), but now \ntheres something else thats wrong with them.  \u0014\n\u0014\nHe outlines them in 8 -10.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord answers their question (v. 8)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question opens with an interrogative particle used of questions \ndemanding a yes/no answer (though it could also be exclamatory, \nexpressing surprise). \u0014\n    \u0014\nThat same grammatical form is also used in Greek. Rom 6:1-2 What \nshall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 2 \nGod forbid. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe people had asked what they had done to necessitate a return to \nGod.  Whats wrong with us?  The Lord focuses on one. They had been \nrobbing him!\u0014\n\u0014\nThis shocking accusation only led to another insolent response: In \nwhat way have we robbed you? (v. 8)\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not the first time they had been given a promise like this. \nDeut 11:13-15 is the first time this promise was made to them).\u0014\n\u0014\n13 So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today  to \nlove the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with \nall your soul   14 then I will send rain on your land in its season, \nboth autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, \nnew wine and oil. 15 I will provide grass in the fields for your \ncattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe term for tithe is ma?aser, meaning tenth part. Moses had \ninstructed Israel that a tithe of everything from  the land, whether \ngrain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it \nis holy to the LORD (Lev 27:30). Also the entire tithe of the herd \nand flockevery tenth animal that passes under the shepherds \nrodwill be holy to the LORD (Lev 27:32). After Israel settled in \nthe land they were to bring the tithe annually to the sanctuary and \nconsume a portion of it, leaving the remainder with the Levites, who \nwere to share a tithe with the priests (Num 18:2132; Deut 12:519; \n14:2227).\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestion: Is this method of giving (the tenth) taught in the New \nTestament?  See Matthew 23:23\u0014\n\u0014\n23 \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! \nYou give a tenth of your spices  mint, dill and cummin. But you have \nneglected the more important matters of the law  justice, mercy and \nfaithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without \nneglecting the former. \u0014\n\u0014\nProsperity gospel preachers commonly use Luke 6:38, which is in a \nparagraph about judging others, and says, \"Give and it will be given \nto you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running \nover, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it \nwill be measured to you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n Deut. 8:18 is used by another \"Bible teacher\". He tells them that by \nclaiming it (\"he gives you the ability to produce wealth .. \") they \nwill prosper, this \"confirms the covenant\" God made with his people. \nThan as a prelude to asking for money, he tells the story of a woman \nwho claimed this verse in one of his meetings when she was 11 \npayments behind on her mortgage, and the place was being foreclosed \non, and the NEXT DAY the woman received $7,500.00 plus an automobile, \nand she had never owned an automobile \u0014\nin her life. He says this happens every day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Bible does say (Phil. 4:19) \"My God shall supply all of your \nneeds according to his riches in glory\", but it does not say that he \nis going to make us rich in the process or My God shall supply all \nof your needs IF you give him a lot of money. \u0014\n\u0014\nProverbs 3:9-10: Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best \npart of everything you produce. Then he will fill your barns with \ngrain, and your vats will overflow with good wine. \u0014\n\u0014\nTexas Megachurch Initiates Tithing Challenge with 100 Percent \nBlessing Guarantee     June 16, 2014 \u0014\n\u0014\nA megachurch in Texas has launched a tithing initiative that will \nrefund 100 percent of offerings it receives in a 90 day period if God \ndoes not follow his promise of blessing those who give. Fellowship \nChurch of Grapevine, Texas is urging members to participate in the \n90-Day Challenge, an idea based off of the Old Testament scripture \nverse Malachi 3:10. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe verse says, Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there \nwill be enough food in my temple. If you do, says the Lord of \nHeavens armies, I will open the windows of Heaven for you. I will \npour out a blessing so great you wont have enough room to take it \nin! Try it! Put me to the test! \u0014\n\u0014\nPastor Ed Young of Fellowship Church outside Dallas sparked the \ncampaign to live out the scripture. Each of us has a unique \nopportunity to be a part of the incredible life change happening \naround us at Fellowship Church by bringing our tithes and offerings \nto the House, reads the description of the initiative. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf you are not tithing already, the 90-Day Challenge is the best \nplace to start. We commit to you that is you tithe for 90 days and \nGod doesnt hold true to his promise of blessings, we will refund 100 \npercent of your tithe. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey (Ed Young)  stopped doing it 90 days later, and they wont talk \nabout why.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Fellowship Church is not the first congregation to attempt a \ntithing campaign with a refund guarantee. Pastor Miles McPherson of \nthe Rock Church in California led a 90-day offering campaign as well \nreports The Christian Post. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, I think you will be amazed to discover how much better you \nwill live on 90 percent of your income with your faith in the Lord \nverses 100 percent of your income and just your own strength. When we \nbring our first and best to God, He promises to bless the rest.\u0014",

    "title": "MY BEAUTIFUL, HAPPY SON",
    "words": "Back in July 2020 I wrote an essay that, in my personal filing \nsystem, I call reluctant father. I wrote this two months into \nSheenas pregnancy with our son, Arlo, and it was my way of coming to \nterms with the decades of my life wherein I assumed Id never be a \nfather, and how that was all changing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve gone back to read that essay countless times in the past year or \nmore, curious about how actually being a new father would change \nthose thoughts and feelings.\u0014\n\u0014\nI thought about writing a followup when Arlo was born, but I didnt \nfeel that I was prepared, because what I was experiencing was so new, \nso novel, so profound, I figured I would look back on it later and \nthink wow, what a clueless outlook from someone who really doesnt \nyet know.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis week, my son is six months old.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheena has an app on her phone that calculates the exact day he is \nsix months based on when he was born, and I think thats funny since I \ndont even know when I was born on the day of my birth, much less \nwhether my six months after birth day was celebrated properly on the \ncorrect day.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I will say is that this week, a major change took place in our \nsons life and how he lives it, and in retrospect, it directly \ncorresponds to what all the books say should happen at the six months \nmark.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, am I still a reluctant father? Am I even a good father? \nReluctant? Yes, still. Good? I dont know, time will tell, I think. \nWhat I do know is that kids still make me deeply uncomfortable - your \nkids, that is. I did NOT become a natural dad-guy. With Arlo, \nhowever, I am indelibly comfortable, happy, and ready to be the best \ndad I can be. \u0014\n\u0014\nI love Arlo so deeply, so fully, so intensely that it makes me \nphysically uncomfortable. I was putting him to bed thinking about \nwriting this essay and it made me physically and violently weep - a \nreaction I regularly have when I try to think, internally, about how \nI love that little boy. My sobbing woke him up from his shallow sleep \nso I had to pull myself together and be strong daddy long enough to \nget him to bed, but when I look at him or think of him, Im wrecked \nwith emotion, and the emotion is some strange combination of love, \nhappiness, pride, fear, and self-consciousness. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm still reluctant, also, in the way that I just dont know that I \ncan live up to what I believe a father should be - a model of \nfatherhood that was given to me by my own father who made me the man, \nhusband, and father I am today. I dont think Ill ever live up to \nwhat my father gave me, but I know my son sees me trying.\u0014\n\u0014\nI feel my shortcomings like I feel my years creeping up on me, but \nwhen I walk into the room and my sons face lights up, I know, at the \nvery least, that he thinks fondly of me now.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheena, my wife, who loves deeper than any human Ive ever met, also \ndoes a great job of reminding me that my existence and my love is \nappreciated, but I will still always be skeptical of my own value, \nand reluctant to accept my role as a father, much less a good one.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm so grateful that this week my beautiful, charismatic, smart, \nhappy son has reached this milestone and that I havent stifled him \nin any way I know. I love him, my wife, and my family as a whole so \ndeeply that I cant even express it fully. I hope that when my boy is \nmy age he looks back and is grateful for his father as I am for my \nown.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------------------------\u0014\nSheena Jeffers\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, my love. So beautifully written but its more than that: its \nyour truth. To witness your and his relationship IS SOMETHING. It \nalways gives me the best kind of chills! I am so happy to be part of \nthis very special family weve made here. I love you.\u0014\n\u0014\nAngela Layne\u0014\n\u0014\nYoure an amazing dad! Dont forget it and dont doubt it. That \nlittle boy adores you!\u0014\n\u0014\nFred R. Skaggs\u0014\n\u0014\nThe feelings you have and the emotions youre experiencing are as \nnormal as breathing. They will help you grow, and they will help you \nbe a better dad. Thank you for the inspiration they share. You are a \nwinner. Dont let anything convince you otherwise.\u0014",

The time \nfrom when the myth dates will explain why... \u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of the Great Wall of China being visible from space has \nlong been a fact ingrained in popular culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this oral tradition is actually a complete myth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe wall may indeed be an epic feat of human construction and \nperseverance, but it's not quite that epic.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe earliest known reference to the theory dates back to 1754, where \nEnglish antiquary William Stukeley writes in a letter:\u0014\n\u0014\nThis mighty wall [Hadrian's Wall] of four score miles [130km] in \nlength is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a \nconsiderable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned \nat the moon.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1895, journalist Henry Norman also made similar claims, stating:\u0014\n\u0014\n...besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of \nhuman hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsidering it wouldn't be until 1969 that humans set foot on the \nMoon, these were somewhat bold claims to make. They would later be \ndebunked, with NASA astronaut Alan Bean explaining:\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE ONLY thing you can see from the moon is a beautiful sphere, \nmostly white (clouds), some blue (ocean), patches of yellow \n(deserts), and every once in a while some green vegetation. No \nman-made object is visible on this scale. In fact, when first leaving \nearth's orbit and only a few thousand miles away, no man-made object \nis visible at that point either.\u0014\n\u0014\nA further example of just how invisible the Great Wall of China is \nfrom the Moon itself compares the sight as the equivalent of a human \nhair being viewed from 3km away!\u0014",

    "title": "MASSASCHUSETTS LAW AGAINST QUAKERS",
    "words": "Massachusetts Law Against Quakers\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion was taken seriously in the seventeenth century in Europe and \nAmerica because most people still believed that their faith dealt \nwith issues of truth, not simply the opinions of men. In the colony \nof Massachusetts there were strict laws governing the religious \nbeliefs of society. If you didn't agree with those beliefs, the \ncolonial leaders thought you should go live somewhere else.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuakers were frequently asked to leave Massachusetts. The group had \nbeen founded in the 1640s by the Englishman George Fox. After finding \nno peace for his soul in the churches of his day, Fox had begun to \ngive up all hope when he had the experience of a voice speaking to \nhim. He believed that this inner voice was the voice of God, and that \nhe could receive direct revelation through the Holy Spirit. Fox began \nspeaking of hie new, inward spiritual faith, and the Society of \nFriends--known as Quakers--followed his teachings. They emphasized \nthe direct revelation of Christ to the individual's soul and \nminimized an ordained ministry and the traditional forms of worship \nin the church. Many Christians objected to the Quakers' belief in an \ninner revelation separate from the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn July, 1656, the ship Swallow anchored in Boston harbor with two \nQuaker women from Barbados on board. The two women, Mary Fisher and \nAnn Austin, had come to Boston to share their Quaker faith. When they \nlanded, however, they were kept on board the ship while their \nbelongings were searched and over 100 books were confiscated. They \nwere then hurried off to jail where they were stripped of their \nclothing and inspected for signs of witchcraft. Five weeks later, the \ncaptain of the Swallow was placed under 100 bond to take the women \nback to Barbados. But two days later, another ship with eight more \nQuakers came to dock! These Quakers were imprisoned for eleven weeks \nbefore they were shipped back to England. They were able to convert \none man to their Quaker faith, Nicholas Upsall, but he fled to Rhode \nIsland to avoid punishment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the influx of Quakers, on this day October 14, 1656, \nMassachusetts enacted a law against the \"cursed sect of heretics \nlately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers...\" \nIt declared that any shipmaster bringing a Quaker into the colony \nwould be fined 100. Any colonist possessing a Quaker book would be \nfined 5. Any Quaker coming within the jurisdiction of the colony \nwould be arrested, whipped, and transported out of the colony without \nconversing with anyone.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, some Quakers felt they simply had to share their beliefs in \nMassachusetts. Robert Fowler built a small craft, the Woodhouse, and \nloaded it with Quakers bound for New England. They landed in Rhode \nIsland, and some entered Massachusetts to spread their views. Quaker \nMary Clark went to Boston to test the law, and she soon had twenty \nstripes of a 3-corded whip \"laid on with fury\" and then spent twelve \nweeks in prison. Even so, the Quakers continued to arrive. So, in \nOctober, 1658, stronger laws were passed. Between 1659 and 1661, four \nQuakers were sent to the gallows.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen King Charles II heard of that, he said all Quakers were to be \nsent to England for trial. There were no more Quaker hangings in \nMassachusetts, and no Quakers were sent to England for trial; but \npunishments and deportations from the colony continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diana \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nJones, Louis Thomas. \"The Quakers of Iowa.\" Iowa History Project. \nhttp://iagenweb.org/history/qoi/QOIPt1Chp2.htm.

    "title": "MOTHER OF THE REFORMATION",
    "words": "Mother of the Reformation\u0014\nChristian Hisitory Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Henry VIII had three wives named Catherine, Martin Luther had \nonly one. However, for one of the more famous spouses in history, \nlittle evidence survives about Katharine von Bora Luther.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was born in January of 1499, educated in at least two convents \nafter the remarriage of her father when she was six, and eventually \nbecame a nun at age 16 at the Cistercian convent in Nimbschen. The \nReformation arrived in Nimbschen by 1519, and Luthers influence \npenetrated the convent, affecting at least some residents, who soon \nsought to leave.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen families failed to remove their eager daughters (quite possibly \nbecause they had no economic provision for them at home), a small \ngroup of nuns applied for Luthers help. He arranged for a local \nmerchant who regularly delivered goods to the convent to leave with, \ninstead of empty barrels, 12 young women hidden in his wagon. Nine of \nthem made their way to Wittenberg in April 1523. When the nuns \narrived, one observer wrote, A wagon load of vestal virgins has just \ncome to town all the more eager for marriage than life. May God give \nthem husbands lest worse befall.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1525 Katharine was the final ex-nun left without a husband. \nAlthough she had several suitors, she rejected them all, finally \ndeclaring that she would only marry either Nicholas von Amsdorf (one \nof Luthers close colleagues) or Dr. Luther himself. She and Martin \nmarried in June of 1525, and she then found herself thrust into a \npublic spotlight of largely negative attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is likely, though, that Katharine lived without much direct \nexposure to the slanderous personal attacks on her marriage. Though \neducated and certainly able to read, even in Latin, she may have been \ntoo busy to care much about public opinion outside of her own local \narea. The care of the Luthers large household required great time \nand effort. Katharine managed a garden and several distant farms, the \nstables and kitchen, a brewery, and all the duties and servants that \nwent along with them. She also had six children in the space of eight \nyearsone daughter died in infancy, another died at 13.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe plague occasionally haunted Wittenberg, pushing Katharine into \nthe healers role. Her home, a former Augustinian cloister, was large \nand always filled with family, friends, and Luthers students who \nwere frequent boarders. Martin wrote that he did not love Katharine \nwhen they married, and he was afraid that she was proud. I am not \nmadly in love, he said to one friend, but I cherish my wife. To \nanother: Other women have worse faults. But he quickly developed \ndeep affection, calling her Lord Katie and my rib, and declaring \nI wouldnt give up my Katie for France or for Venice. She clearly \nsupported and respected his work, and while no doormat, she accepted \nher own vocation as being that of Christian wife and mother, the only \ncalling Luther saw open for women. He once remarked, In domestic \naffairs I defer to Katie. Otherwise I am led by the Holy Ghost.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Martins death in 1546, the family lost much of the financial \nsupport they had received while he was alive. War and plague forced \nthem to flee Wittenberg several times, and Katharine was never able \nto regain stability.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe wrote of Martin after his death, He gave so much of himself in \nservice not only to one town or to one country, but to the whole \nworld.  My sorrow is so deep that no words can express my \nheartbreak. I can neither eat nor drink, not even sleep. In 1552 she \nwas injured in an accident while moving to a new house. She died from \nher injuries at the age of 53, leaving four adult children and an \nenduring spiritual and social legacy.\u0014",

Soon the wind failed, so they \nsheltered in Yarmouth harbor to await a breeze. A storm came up that \nnight and a French ship dragged its anchor, bearing down upon the \nDove. The little ship had to run to sea to escape collision. The Ark \njoined her so they could stay together. However, they were separated \na few days later in a storm. The Dove flashed two lanterns to show \nshe was in trouble and disappeared from sight. \u0014\nOutfitted by Cecil Calvert, the Second Lord Baltimore, the Ark and \nDove were to settle a new American colonythe Province of Maryland. \nBaltimore named the colony for Queen Henrietta Maria. He appointed \nhis brother Leonard as its first governor.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaryland was Baltimores to colonize because of the faithful service \nof his father to the English crown. Lord Baltimore was leaving little \nto chance. He had studied previous colonization attempts and was \ndetermined to avoid their mistakes. He made careful provision for the \nsettlers and dispatched them on their way in winter so that they \nwould arrive in Spring with ample time to plant crops before the next \ncold season. Enjoying warm weather, they would not have to rush the \nconstruction of houses to the neglect of planting and other important \ntasks. Having struggled against cold in an earlier venture in \nNewfoundland, Lord Baltimore hoped the warmer climate of Maryland \nwould allow the transplanted English people to flourish.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Caribbean, the Ark paused to repair damage. Looking up one \nday, the small party shouted in joy. There was the Dove, intact and \nable to join them to complete the voyage. Between them, the two ships \ncarried about two hundred settlers, although the number is hotly \ndebated because the names of servants were not recorded.\u0014\n\u0014\nNervously, the voyagers sailed to Virginia. Virginians had little \nreason to welcome them, for Virginia claimed the area that King \nCharles I had carved out for Maryland. As Church of England \nbelievers, they were also suspicious of the Catholics. Nonetheless, \nCaptain Henry Fleet, who knew the local language, accompanied them as \nan interpreter. Once the Marylanders decided where they wanted to \nbuild, Fleet negotiated purchase of the land. Later, however, he \nturned against the colony. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe colonists built their first town, St. Marys City, along the \nChesapeake Bay. There they undertook enterprises to repay the \ninvestors who had financed their venture. But Baltimore, a Roman \nCatholic, was less interested in the colony as a speculative venture \nthan as a refuge for fellow Catholics, who had been persecuted in \nEngland since the Reformation era. Aboard the ship were two Jesuit \npriests. One of them, Father Andrew White, wrote an account of the \nvoyage, the initial settlement, and of the Jesuits' efforts to win \nconverts among Native Americans and Protestants. He and successive \nchroniclers recounted some success and many miracles.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe colonys charter promised religious freedom for Catholics. As \nonly seventeen of the original settlers were Catholic, this was an \nessential protection. In 1649, An Act Concerning Religion (the \nMaryland Toleration Act) guaranteed freedom of worship to all \nTrinitarian Christians. This early effort at religious liberty was an \nimportant step toward freedom of religion in the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Miserable Sundar Singh Had a Vision of Christ\u0014\n \u0014\nFOR MONTHS, Sundar Singh was like a person deranged. Though a Sikh (a \nmember of one of Indias major religious groups), he was attending a \nChristian school when his mother died. Consequently, he blamed the \nChristian God. Whereas before he was a quiet student, now he jeered \nin class and gathered a gang together to pelt Christian students with \ndirt and stones. Finally, he convinced his father to enroll him in a \ndifferent school, several miles away. There he contracted malaria and \nbecame seriously ill. When he recovered, he returned to the Christian \nschool. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow the fourteen-year-old boy asked serious questions and seemed more \nsubdued. However, his schoolwork was suffering. One day, he asked for \na Bible. His teachers praised God. It seemed their prayers had been \nheard. Sundar, however, had a different idea. At home, he built a \nfire and page by page tore up the Bible and burned it. His father saw \nwhat he was up to and commanded him to stop. Instead the boy thrust \nthe rest of the book into the flames. Although I believed that I had \ndone a very good deed by burning the Bible, I felt unhappy, he said \nlater. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe became so miserable that he could no longer bear life. Late on \nthis day, 19 December 1903,* he began to pray that God would reveal \nhimself if he really existed. If not, Sundar planned to throw himself \nin front of the morning train. For seven hours he prayed. O God, if \nthere is a God, reveal yourself to me tonight. \u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Sundar, his room filled with a glow. A man appeared \nbefore him with nail-pierced hands, saying, How long will you deny \nme? I died for you; I have given my life for you. He knew it was \nChrist. When the vision vanished, he ran, woke his father, and told \nhim he had become a Christian. Now his father thought he really was \nmad! \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Sundar persisted in his faith, his family pressured him with \nevery inducement they could think of: money, sex, responsibility to \nhis family, patriotism, lies, threats, and attacks on the Christian \nschool. Finally Sundar felt there was only one course he could take \nto make clear his allegiance to Christ: He cut his long hair, which \nwas the symbol of a Sikh. Then his father cast him out, We reject \nyou forever... We shall forget you as if you had never been born. As \nhe rode the train away from home, painful cramps wrenched his gut. \nHis family had poisoned his last meal! He staggered off the train and \ncrawled to a mission station. \u0014\n\u0014\nSundar, however, miraculously recovered. As soon as he came of age, \nhe was baptized. He donned the yellow robe of a holy man, preaching \nthroughout India and later around the world, funded by his father who \nhad then converted to Christianity. Sundar also made twenty trips \ninto Tibet, where he was severely persecuted. He counted these \nsufferings as a small price to pay to demonstrate love for Christ. \nWhen we have left this world, we will not have another chance to \nbear the cross for Christ, he said. In 1929, a sickly Sundar set out \nfor Tibet one last time and was not heard from again.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\n*The most trustworthy biography gives this date.

    "title": "MOGILA BROUGHT REVIVAL TO THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH",
    "words": "MOGILA BROUGHT REVIVAL TO THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH\u0014\n \u0014\nNational churches go through periods of decay and revival. In the \nseventeenth-century, Orthodoxy in eastern Europe was in decline. \nProtestants and Catholics moved into the area to fill the void. The \nperson most instrumental in reviving the Russian Orthodox Church was \nPeter Mogila.\u0014\n\u0014\nMogila was a scion of noble Moldavians. (Moldavia lies between the \nUkraine and Rumania.) The young man obtained his training from \nJesuits in Poland and mastered several languages, including Latin, \nthe universal language in which most of Europes scholars still \ncommunicated. Despite his Catholic education, Mogila remained \nfervently Eastern Orthodox. After a stint in the Polish army, he \nfounded a church in the Ukraine and then became a monk in 1625 at \nKievs famous Monastery of the Caves, founded in the eleventh century \nby Anthony of the Caves. Two years later, he became head of the \ncommunitys recently-established theological school.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis greatest contributions to the revival of his religious tradition \nwould come through education. Although no friend to Roman \nCatholicism, Mogila was impressed by Western educational methods and \nintroduced them into the school. Elected Metropolitan of Kiev in \n1633, he set the school on course to becoming the leading Orthodox \nacademy of all Russia, and indeed of the Eastern Church. A host of \nOrthodox bishops and seminarians would eventually get their training \nin theology and the sciences at Kiev. Extending the reach of his \nreforms, he founded several satellite schools and upgraded the \nprinting presses of his church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMogila adopted Latin for the classroom and even wrote his influential \nOrthodox Confession of the Catholic and Apostolic Eastern Church in \nLatin. Despite Western influences in this and in his many other \nwritings, their content was strictly Orthodox. The catechism was \napproved by the four Eastern Orthodox primates. The catechism was a \nvindication of Orthodox primacy in doctrine and Church jurisdiction, \nin opposition to the claims of both Reformers and Counter Reformers, \nsays the World Biographical Encyclopedia. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike Lutherans who view the eucharist through the teaching of \nconsubstantiation (where Christ is in and under the elements) and \nReformed Protestants who see it as a symbolic memorial, Mogila, like \nRoman Catholics, firmly taught transubstantiation. In the Moment of \nConsecration of the holy Gifts, the Priest must firmly and \nundoubtingly resolve within himself, that the Substance of the Bread, \nand the Substance of the Wine, are changed into the Substance of the \nvery Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, by the Operation or working of \nthe Holy Ghost... Unlike Catholics, who still restricted the laity \nfrom the cup in those days, Mogila insisted the wine was for all \nbelievers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the frequently divisive theological issue of faith vs. works, \nMogila insisted that while we are saved by faith in Christ, from whom \nall our hope comes, good works must accompany true faith as fruits \ncome from a good tree; otherwise we are not truly saved. And unlike \nmost Protestants, he taught the necessity of auricular confession to \na priest for the forgiveness of sins. \u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Mogila was more than a scholar. His diplomacy recovered many \nchurch buildings and lands that had been taken over by Catholics, \nincluding the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, which he also repaired. \nPeter Mogila died on this day 22 December 1646 (sometimes given as 31 \nDecember because of the difference in Eastern and Western church \ncalendars). For three centuries his theology and writings dominated \nthe Eastern Orthodox Churchcenturies known to historians as the \nMogila period. To this day his influence is felt, although his works \nhave been superseded by modern texts better suited to meet \ncontemporary needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "A  Baptist in Oklahoma introduced a bill in the state legislature \nthis month to mandate the use of the King James Bible as the \ntranslation for use in public schools. Senator George Burns wants \nclasses that teach the Bible as a historical text to no longer use a \nmulti-translation book. Instead, his legislation requires that the \nAuthorized Version of the Bible, which is more commonly known as the \nKing James Version of the Bible, shall be the primary text of the \ncourse. In addition, his bill making the KJV the Oklahoma Authorized \nVersion includes a provision that each school district library in \nthis state shall include the Authorized Version of the Bible, more \ncommonly known as the King James Version of the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurnss bill doesnt just mandate a specific translation. It also \nattempts to marshal state power to force his religious beliefs on \npublic schools. Hes a member of Lukfata Baptist Church in Broken \nBow, which includes in its 4,265-word statement of beliefs one \nbolded, underlined sentence: The King James Version of the Bible \nshall be the official and only translation used by this church. It \nthen adds for clarity, Special note: the King James Version and the \nNew King James Version are two different translations, and only the \nKing James Version will be the accepted translation used by Lukfata \nBaptist Church. No word on if the pastor preaches in Shakespearean \nverse (or if theyve decided to go full 17th century and try to \nsurvive a plague without vaccines). Burnss move would make King \nJames proud but likely spark a harsh response from his Baptist \nancestors. Trying to codify ones own convictions into law is just \nthe kind of state infringement of religious liberty that would \ninspire Helwys or other historical Baptist figures like Isaac Backus \nto protest even to the point of imprisonment (though well note that \nBurns isnt proposing to send any wayward teachers or librarians to \njail  though others have already gone there).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the Sooner State considers this extreme and clearly \nunconstitutional bill, lawmakers in other states have similarly \nsought to to authorize official Bible classes in public schools.

After being administered a lethal injection, \nshe had coughed, groaned, and stopped breathing. Among her last words \nwere I am going to be face to face with Jesus now . . . I will see \nyou all when you get there.\u0014\n\u0014\nTucker was the first woman executed in Texas in one hundred and \nthirty years. Schooled by her mother at a young age in prostitution \nand drug use, she had a far from ideal upbringing and had prided \nherself on her toughness. In 1983, Tucker and her boyfriend Danny \nGarrett murdered Jerry Dean and Deborah Ruth Thornton while casing \nDeans house to steal a motorcycle and its parts. Tucker and Garrett \nwere on drugs. Although Tucker insisted the murder was not \npremeditated, it was particularly violent. Afterward, she boasted of \nher role in the crime and even exaggerated her part, wanting to be \naccepted as no less tough than the men she hung around with. Her \nboasts were recorded by a wired informant and her arrest followed \nimmediately.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in jail, she attended a Christian puppet show. Impressed by the \nquality of peace in the performers, she stole a Bible (not realizing \nshe could have one for free), and began to read. I didnt know what \nI was reading and before I knew it, I was justI was in the middle of \nmy floor on my knees and I was just asking God to forgive me, she \nlater told TV host Larry King. God reached down inside of me and \njust literally uprooted all of that stuff and took it out, and poured \nhimself in.\u0014\n\u0014\nConvicted and sentenced to die, she blossomed in faith and led a \ndemonstrably Christian life for fourteen years on death row. She not \nonly testified to fellow death row inmates but also to the world at \nlarge through interviews. She did all the good she could in her \nlimited sphere of action. Her case became an international cause, \nboth because of her conversion and her gender. She married a prison \nminister. Two relatives of her victims became friends with her. One, \nRonald Carlson, asked that her death penalty be commuted to a lesser \nsentence.\u0014\n\u0014\nTucker herself said no difference should be made between men and \nwomen who committed similar crimes. However, she argued that after \nher conversion she was not the same person she had been when she \ncommitted the murder. Her case was appealed to the United States \nSupreme Court but the justices declined to hear it. Governor George \nBush and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles also rejected appeals \nfor clemency, sealing her fate.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite her death at thirty-eight years of age, Tuckers Christian \nwitness has lived on in articles, books, and even a movie. She \nrepresents proof that God can forgive the ugliest past, renew the \nmost hardened person, and give any life meaning.\u0014",

    "words": "MARY ROWLANDSON CLUNG TO GODS PROMISES DURING HER CAPTIVITY AND \nRESCUE\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we are in prosperity, Oh the little that we think of such \ndreadful sights, to see our dear friends and relations lie bleeding \nout their hearts-blood upon the ground, So lamented Mary Rowlandson. \nOn this day, 10 February 1675,* during King Philips War, \nNarragansett Indians attacked Lancaster, Massachusetts. As Rowlandson \nfled her burning house, she was shot in the side and her six-year-old \ndaughter, Sarah, was shot through the body. \u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the negotiations of colonial leaders and her minister husband \n(who had been away pleading for reinforcements when the disaster \nfell), she was ransomed for twenty pounds after being held hostage \neleven weeks and five days. Five years later, in part to declare the \nworks of the Lord as she had read in Psalm 118:17, she wrote \nAmericas first captivity narrative which she titled The \nSovereignty and Goodness of God: Being a Narrative of the Captivity \nand Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn it she remarked, I had often before this said, that if the \nIndians should come, I should chuse rather to be killed by them than \ntaken alive, but when it came to the trial, my mind changed; their \nglittering weapons so daunted my spirit, that I chose rather to go \nalong with those (as I may say) ravenous bears, than that moment to \nend my days. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe books two prominent themes were the misery of her captivity and \nGods never-failing presence. It is not my tongue or pen can express \nthe sorrows of my heart, and bitterness of my spirit, that I had at \nthis departure: but God was with me in a wonderful manner, carrying \nme along and bearing up my spirit, that it did not quite fail.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first night of her captivity, the Indian encampment bore a \nlively resemblance of hell. The second day it began to snow. The \ncold made her stiff and she could scarcely attend her feverish, \nwounded babe. I must sit all this cold, winter night, upon the cold \nsnowy ground, with my sick child in my arms, looking that every hour \nwould be the last of its life; and having no Christian friend near \nme, either to comfort or help me.\u0014\n\u0014\nLater, at the Indian town called Wenimesset (New Braintree), another \ncaptive suggested oak leaves would relieve her wounded side. \nRowlandson tried the remedy and it helped. However, Sarah died there \non 18 February. In her anguish, Rowlandson asked the Lord for relief. \nAlmost immediately she learned that her son Joseph and daughter Mary \nwere alive in a village about six miles away. Soon she was able to \nspeak with Joseph. And when an Indian raiding party returned the next \nday, one gave her a Bible from his plunder. She felt Jeremiah 31:16 \nwas given her as a promise: Thus saith the Lord, refrain thy voice \nfrom weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be \nrewarded and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnable at first to eat, by the second week she became so ravenous she \ncould eat almost anything. She earned food by knitting articles of \nclothing for her captors. She divided her book by removes, a remove \nbeing each time her captors changed location. In the thirteenth \nremove, she was told her son had been cooked and eaten. She reassured \nherself with the thought that the Indians were great liars, and so it \nproved. At the site of her twentieth remove, her ransom came, and she \nwas able to return to her folk. Soon afterward, Joseph and Mary got \nhome and the family was reunited to live in a house rented for them \nby kindly folk in Boston. Eventually they moved to Connecticut. \u0014\n\u0014\nRowlandson remarried after her husbands death, to Captain Samuel \nTalcott, and died a widow in Wethersfield, Connecticut, in 1711. The \nNorton Book of American Autobiography says that because of \nRowlandsons strong voice, her memoir became a model for later \nwriters who wrote about periods of crisis that were also times of \nspiritual transformation. \u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n-----\u0014\n* This story uses Rowlandsons own dates. Under the new calendar the \nattack would be 21 February 1676 and Sarahs death the 29th, which is \nhow some histories date the events.\u0014",

    "words": "Master Mendelssohn Revived Master Bach\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Sebastian Bach believed in the resurrection. The \"crucifixus\" \nof his Mass in B minor ended with low register voices to suggest \nChrist going down into the grave and the next chorus breaks forth in \njoy to express resurrection. Bach's music went through a resurrection \nof its own. Virtually forgotten at his death, the bulk of his work \nlay neglected for almost a century. Fish vendors in the market \nwrapped their ware in Bach manuscripts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's life was defined by poverty. But in music he poured out \nwealth. Every form he touched, he improved. He perfected the \n\"well-tempered\" scale which by dividing every octave into twelve \nequal distances allowed any key on the organ to start a scale. His \nkeyboard technique used all five fingers where three had been the \nnorm. The Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained \nmusicians such as Beethoven. Beethoven remarked: \"He should not be \ncalled Bach (brook) but Meer (sea).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery note Bach wrote was dedicated to Christ. Throughout his \nmanuscripts appear cryptic abbreviations such as \"I. N. J.\" standing \nfor In Nomine Jesu; that is, \"In the Name of Jesus.\" According to \nhim, music's aim and purpose is to glorify God and provide recreation \nfor the mind. \"Where this is not observed there will be no real music \nbut only devilish hubbub.\" He poured emotion into his music which \nbecame the mother of Romanticism. His portrayals of Christ's passion \nmade frequent use of dissonance. Combining expressive melodies with a \nrhythmic bass line, he conveyed, according to William H. Scheide, \n\"the union of the divine and human in the person of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man's work fell into neglect was regrettable. Those near \nhim simply did not recognize his genius. Shortly after Bach died one \nBurgomaster remarked unfeelingly, \"The school needed a cantor and not \na Kapellmeister.\" For fifty years no Bach piece was published \nseparately on its own merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's revival was largely owing to another Christian composer. Felix \nMendelssohn was in awe of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. He arranged to \nhave Bach's St. Matthew Passion played on this day March 11, 1829, \nalmost exactly a century from the date of its first, long-forgotten \nperformance. Mendelssohn himself conducted. \"Never,\" wrote one \nparticipant, \"have I known any performance so consecrated by one \nunited sympathy.\" More than 1,000 people were unable to get tickets. \nTwo further concerts had to be scheduled at once. So great was the \nsensation that composer Hector Berlioz marveled, \"There is but one \ngod--Bach and Mendelssohn, his prophet.\" Today many consider Bach the \ngreatest composer who ever lived. Mendelssohn's oratorios Elijah and \nPaul are his own monuments to faith. Mendelssohn died at thirty six, \nworn out with overwork.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bach, Johann Sebastian.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch. Edited by F.

    "title": "MARGARET CLITHEROW CRUSHED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH",
    "words": "MARGARET CLITHEROW CRUSHED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1970 Pope Paul VI canonized forty martyrs of England and Wales. \nThese Catholics had run afoul of English laws four centuries earlier. \nFor instance, a 1581 law had made it a crime to hold Catholic \nservices or give refuge to Catholic priests. In part this was owing \nto Catholic plots to unseat Queen Elizabeth I, whom Pope Pius V had \nexcommunicated and declared the illegitimate ruler of England.\u0014\nAmong the forty martyrs, priests and monks predominated, but three \nwomen were included. One of them, Margaret Clitherow, had hidden \npriests in Yorkshire so they could provide religious instruction and \nservices for Catholics. Apart from a few city records, such as a \nregister of her marriage to John Clitherow, most of what we know \nabout Margaret comes from a biography written by her last confessor, \nFather John Mush. \u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret was fifteen when she married John, and she converted to \nCatholicism about three years later. Although her husband remained \nwith the Church of England, he was not unsympathetic to his wifes \ncause: one of his own brothers was a priest. John paid Margarets \nfines for not attending the established church. However, Margaret \nkept her activities hidden from him as much as possible because, as \nbridgemaster, he was required to report Catholic activities. She \ninvented excuses, such as attending sick people, to visit sites where \nMass was secretly held. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1577, six years after her marriage, she was sent to prison for \nfailure to attend Church of England services. Over the next nine \nyears, she was imprisoned several more times for religious offenses, \nonce for twenty months. Despite the danger, she said, If Gods \npriests dare venture themselves to my house, I will never refuse \nthem. During one incarceration, she learned to read English. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was prudent, clean, hard-working, charitable, and faithful, and \nshe bore John at least two sons and a daughter who lived to \nadulthood. Evidently her influence on her children was strong: the \ntwo boys became Catholic priests and the daughter became a nun. Her \nattitude toward her servants was that she would not ask them to do \nany job she was not willing to do herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer personal religious observances included partaking of illegal \nMasses, walking barefoot to sacred sites, frequent fasting, \ntwice-weekly confession to priests, and similar mortifications. In \nspite of her absences while in jail, John declared her the best of \nwives. When she was condemned to death, he wept and said, Let them \ntake all I have and save her, for she is the best wife in all \nEngland, and the best Catholic also.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer condemnation came in 1586 after a scared, ten-year-old boy, \nthreatened by authorities, revealed where Margaret had hidden a \npriest. The authorities arrested her. To protect her children and \nservants from having to testify against her, she refused to enter a \nplea. As the law stood, the authorities had to punish her using a \ngeneral statute. They proceeded, although Wiggington, a leading \nPuritan minister, publicly warned them it was not right under Gods \nlaw to execute her on the word of a mere child. \u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless the city leaders sentenced her to be stripped naked and \npressed to death with a sharp rock under her back. Sentence was \ncarried out on this day 25 March, 1586in the tollbooth of the bridge \nwhere John was master. Told she must confess that she died for \ntreason, she replied, No, no, Mr. Sheriff, I die for the love of my \nLord Jesu. \u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret was placed under a door taken from her own house. Eight \nhundred pounds of rocks were piled on it. Her back broke on the sharp \nrock and her ribs cracked and the ends pushed through her chest. It \ntook her about fifteen minutes to die. Her last intelligible words \nwere Jesu! Jesu! Jesu! have mercy upon me!\u0014\n\u0014\nOther Notable Events\u0014\n304\u0014\nAgape, Chioma, and Irene, three sisters, are seized at Thessalonica \nduring Diocletians persecution.

    "words": "Lillian Trasher forced to Leave Egypt\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nLillian Trasher forced to Leave EgyptThe civilization on the Nile is \none of the most ancient in the world. And yet, a Christian woman of \nthe early twentieth century became known as \"The Mother of the Nile.\" \nWhat did Lillian Trasher do to win that accolade?\u0014\n\u0014\nLillian was born in Boston to a Quaker family that moved to Georgia \nafter the US Civil War. Although she left a fine Boston home for a \ncash-strapped farm, she delighted in the change. Later, when she had \nto live in Egypt on a coarse diet and hard work, she was used to it. \nNeighbors told her that she could have a true relationship with \nChrist and she believed them. As a young girl, she went into the \nwoods and prayed, \"Lord, I want to be your little girl.\" Then she \nadded bold words. \"Lord, if ever I can do anything for You, just let \nme know and I'll do it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter failing to get a newspaper job that she really wanted (she was \nhired, but staff mistakenly told her the job had been given to \nsomeone else) she served in a North Carolina orphanage that operated \non faith principles. She met Tom and felt sure he was to be her \nhusband. Ten days before the planned wedding, she heard a missionary \nfrom India speak and knew God meant her to be a missionary. Sobbing \nbitterly, she abandoned her marriage plans and told Tom she was going \nto Africa.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe holiness church she attended couldn't support her. So she sold \nall of her small belongings and raised money to go. A sister used the \nmoney to pay a debt, leaving Lillian with only $18--enough to take \nher as far as Washington, DC. She set out anyway, confident the Lord \nwould provide. He did.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1910 she was in Egypt. Then came long years of discouragement. She \nate the poorest food, including Besara, a cereal she detested. She \neven slept in jails as she built credibility with local authorities. \nFinally she announced that God was going to build a great Christian \norphanage in Egypt, one that would operate by faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod was going to do just that. But Egypt entered a period of \npolitical turmoil. The British ordered Lillian out of the country. On \nthis day, March 27, 1919 she stood at the rail of the boat and wept. \n\"Egypt, I love you!\" she said, vowing to return. In the United \nStates, the newly-formed Assemblies of God took her to heart. She \nreturned to Egypt in 1920 and promised the Lord she'd take whoever he \nsent to her orphanage. It was up to him to provide the food and funds.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe kept her word. And God kept his. Lillian became famous world \nwide. Which is why she is remembered as the \"Mother of the Nile.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurkin, Jim. \"The Profound Impact of Lillian Thrasher [sic] on My \nLife.\" http://www.verbo.org/site/durkin17.htm\u0014\nHowell, Beth Prim.

When he sent up a green flare, the bombers accompanying him \nknew it was the moment to attack. When his plane radioed Tora, Tora, \nTora, the Japanese knew the air attack had achieved complete \nsurprise. For the duration of the war and for years afterward, he \nconsidered the Pearl Harbor attack the most thrilling exploit of his \nlife. He tried to top his military success throughout the rest of \nWorld War II in attacking Ceylon and Australia. He also fought in the \nSolomon Islands and at the Battle of Midway. When it became apparent \nJapan would lose the war, he advocated fighting to the last man.\u0014\n\u0014\nNine years after Pearl Harbor, however, newspaper headlines \ntrumpeted, Pearl Harbor Hero Converts to Christianity.  What had \nhappened? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Japanese troops were disbanded, Fuchida was among them. He was \ndumbfounded when he learned that a war buddy had been kindly treated \nin American captivity. How could that be? Enemies were not supposed \nto be kind to each other! During the war trials following the allied \nvictory, an American offered Fuchida a religious pamphlet in a Tokyo \ntrain station. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite his Buddhist background, he took it because its title \nintrigued him: I Was a Prisoner of Japan. It was the story of Jake \nDeShazer whom the Japanese had cruelly mistreated as a prisoner of \nwar. DeShazer had been filled with hatred for his captors; but by \nreading the Bible he had learned to love the Japanese and after the \nwar had become an evangelist to them. His story moved Fuchida, who \npurchased a Bible so he could find out for himself why DeShazer was \nso changed.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading Lukes account of the Crucifixion, Fuchida was impressed when \nJesus said, Father, forgive them, for they dont know what they are \ndoing. He would write later, That date, April 14, 1950, became the \nsecond day to remember of my life. On that day, I became a new \nperson. My complete view on life was changed by the intervention of \nthe Christ I had always hated and ignored before.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly afterward, he stood on a platform with Jake DeShazer, both \nmen giving their testimonies. Fuchida went on to evangelize \nthroughout the Orient. He wrote the story of his conversion in From \nPearl Harbor to Golgotha. I now work at striking the death-blow to \nthe basic hatred which infests the human . . . . And that hatred \ncannot be uprooted without assistance from Jesus Christ. He is the \nonly One Who was powerful enough to change my life and inspire it \nwith His thoughts.\u0014\n\u0014\nFuchida died in 1976 of complications from diabetes.\u0014",

    "words": "Martin Luther's Most Noble Words\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nSince your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will \nanswer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am convicted by \nscripture and plain reason--I do not accept the authority of popes \nand councils for they have contradicted each other--my conscience is \ncaptive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, \nfor to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, \nI cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most notable words spoken in the Reformation, this \naccording to early printed reports, was Luther's reply at Worms when \nurged to recant. He uttered the memorable lines in German on this \nday, April 18, 1521, and then, upon request, repeated their gist in \nLatin for those who did not understand his native tongue. He was \nsweating, said witnesses. With a victory gesture he slipped out of \nthe room.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick the Wise, Luther's supporter was uneasy. Did the scriptures \ncondemn Luther or not? \"He is too daring for me,\" the elector \nadmitted. Nonetheless, on the next day, when asked to stand against \nLuther with the emperor, he did not sign the condemnation although \nthe other four electors did so.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs for the Emperor, he reasoned that a single friar who went contrary \nto the whole church could not possibly be right. Descended from a \nlong line of Christian emperors, he felt that to accept Luther's view \nwas to betray the faith of his fathers. He would take prompt action \nagainst Luther, he vowed. But since Luther had been given safe \nconduct to Worms, he allowed him to depart in safety.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuther did not leave Worms at once. For several days a committee \nreasoned with him, begging him not to rend the church in two. They \npointed out that war would surely come to Germany. Melanchthon, his \nbeloved associate, might be killed. Luther could not help but be \nmoved, but his determination held. God's word must be followed \nwhatever the cost. To this confrontation his stand against \nindulgences had finally brought him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are grounds to doubt that Luther said \"Here I stand. I cannot \ndo otherwise.\" Although the earliest printed versions contain these \nlines, the official transcripts do not. Whether spoken or not, the \nwords convey the brave monk's attitude. When Luther left Worms, the \nReformation was irrevocable.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin Luther was at his noblest at Worms. His bold words have \nstirred men's imagination through subsequent centuries, for they have \nthe same ring to them as Peter's famous defiance of the Sanhedrin. \n\"Judge for yourselves whether we ought to obey God or men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBainton, Roland H.

    "words": "MURDER, GUILT, UNJUST IMPRISONMENT, AND FAITH FORMED DOSTOEVSKYS \nWRITINGS\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1839, when Fyodor Dostoevsky was eighteen, Russian serfs murdered \nhis father, Mikhail. While unexpected, the homicide was not a random \ncrime. Mikhail, an Orthodox Christian and medical doctor, was a harsh \nand unsympathetic figure who often vented anger and sarcasm at his \nchildren and underlings. Apparently serfs reacted violently to one \nsuch outburst. No one ever was prosecuted for the crime. Considering \nthe shock his fathers death gave Dostoevsky, it is not surprisingly \nthat his writings explore murder and guilt, and true and false \nreligionor that he aligned himself against serfdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nDostoevsky completed his first novel, Poor Folk, in 1845. About then \nhe became interested in utopian schemes and formed connections with \nsocialist intellectuals. In 1847, he joined a group that criticized \nserfdom and governmental censorship. Denounced to the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs, Dostoevsky and his friends were arrested on this \nday, 23 April 1849. To criticize church or czar was considered \nrevolutionary. After spending months in prison, Dostoevsky was \nsentenced to death. At the last moment, while the prisoners actually \nstood before a firing squad, a messenger appeared with a reprieve \nfrom the czar. The execution turned out to be a cruel hoax, staged \nfor maximum effect. Dostoevskys writings would sometimes detail the \nlast thoughts of dying men.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of death, Dostoevsky was condemned to four years in a \nSiberian penal camp. As he was leaving Saint Petersburg in leg irons, \nthree women handed him a Gospel. He kept this under his pillow in \nprison and read it over and over, underlining passages that focused \non persecution of the just and of coming judgment. Living among \nRussias most depraved convicts and subject to the whims of sadistic \nguards, he lost his illusions about the inherent goodness of mankind. \nHe fictionalized some of the horrors he witnessed in another novel, \nHouse of the Dead, and developed the theme of forgiving those who \nwrong us. (His later quarrels with and estrangement from fellow \nwriters shows he found this advice easier to give than to follow.)\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years of exile at a military post followed his imprisonment. When \nhe returned to society, his writing showed the deepening impact of \nyears of suffering. In his great novels Crime and Punishment, The \nIdiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov, protagonists wrestle with \nconscience and with Christian ideals. Nihilism is deplored for its \nemptiness. The slanderous lying and double-dealing of revolutionaries \nare ruthlessly exposed. The human condition is laid bare. In the \nbackground of his novels, often indistinct, are Christ and the cross. \nIn Christianity Dostoevsky saw the hope for Russian salvation and \ntherefore had no use for atheism which he thought would destroy the \nspirit of the peasants.\u0014\n\u0014\nDostoevsky suffered from epilepsy and he struggled with gambling and \nimpulsive behaviors. These made life hard for him and his wife, Anna. \nHowever, in 1871, following serious losses at the gaming tables, \nDostoevsky underwent a shift of perspective, connected with two \nterrifying dreams, and never again gambled. Although his new \nself-control made his final years financially easier, another blow \nstruck. He and Anna lost their beloved son Alyosha. Dostoevsky sought \ncomfort and counsel from Ambrose of Optina, a famous Russian Starets \n(spiritual advisor). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Dostoevsky did not distinctly claim Christ as his personal \nsavior in his writings, he turned to Jesuss words again and again \nduring his many troubles. He rejoiced that as a child his parents \nbrought him up knowing the Bible stories. As he was dying in 1881, he \nhad Anna read his favorite Gospel passages to him. His epitaph is \nfrom John 12:24: Unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and \ndies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it bears much \nfruit.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

I even had the opportunity to meet him several \nyears ago at a conference Ive regularly attended. Nevertheless, \nthere is much more to his story than I knew before picking up this \nbook. Perhaps you would like to know more about this particular \nscholar of the Bible and ancient Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe memoirs subtitle reveals the central theme of the book. The now \nemeritus professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Emory \nUniversity, suggests that if one decides to write a memoir, one must \ndecide why such a venture is worthwhile not only for the author but \nfor those who end up reading the book. In making this point, he \nspeaks to the audience. Johnson has indeed had a long and influential \ncareer as a teacher, speaker, scholar, and author, but hes not a \ncelebrity. Potential readers arent going to pick it up to discover \njuicy gossip. So, he writes about the life of a scholar. As such, he \nwrites for potential scholars and for those who wonder what it is \nlike to be a scholar. So, here we have the story of one who became a \nscholar and what this means to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting a review of a memoir is always tricky because you want to \nshare enough information to entice readers to pick up the book \nwithout giving too much away. In other words, Eerdmans would prefer \nthat you, my reader, dont decide theyve got enough information \nabout Johnsons life, so they dont have to pick up a copy and read \nit for themselves. So, with that caveat, I can say thislike most \nmemoirs, this one starts at the beginning of Johnsons life. We learn \nabout his origins as a young boy living in a small town in Wisconsin. \nAlthough his father died not long after he was born, his mother made \nsure that he and his older siblings had a home, an education, and a \nreligious upbringing as a Roman Catholic. Unfortunately, his mother \nalso died early in life. This led to a rather peripatetic life that \nended up with him living and studying at a seminary at the age of \nthirteen. With that, he began his journey to becoming a monk, a \npriest, and a scholar. He loved God, the church, and reading. In \nfact, he read voraciously across a wide variety of genres. All of \nthis fed his search for knowledge.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn discussing his calling and formation as a scholar, Luke Timothy \nJohnson distinguishes between being an intellectual and a scholar. \nThe former is a person who is inquisitive, knowledgeable, and likely \nwell-read. What makes a scholar different, as we will see, is that \npersons commitment to a life of productive research that generally \nleads to the academic life, including teaching and writing. Its the \nacademic life that drives the conversation, as Johnson moves through \nseminary to ordination to his final decision to pursue scholarship. \nThis led eventually him to attend Yale and earn a Ph.D. in New \nTestament. All the while, he was a monk and a priest who assumed that \nthis would be his lifea scholar-monk. That was true until he met \nJoy, and everything changed. As we learn in The Mind in Another \nPlace, his decision to marry Joy would have significant ramifications \nfor his life (and hers). Of course, this decision meant leaving the \npriesthood. Because of Joys status as a divorced woman made life in \nthe Catholic Church difficult. Ill leave it to the reader to \ndiscover the full story, but it is both heartbreaking and \ninspirational at the same time. After he finished his Ph.D. he took \nup a non-tenure track position at Yale Divinity School, and then \ncontinued his journey to his final move to Emory with a decade-long \ntenure at Indiana University standing in between Yale and Emory. When \nhe arrived at Emory it was to take up the position of Robert W. \nWoodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we continue reading through the memoir, we learn more about the \nscholarly life, both its ups and downs. In his case, the pursuit of \nthe scholarly life included the impact of his marriage. This is an \nimportant part of the story that readers will want to consider \ncarefully. His situation might be unique and yet it points out \nchallenges faced by families when it comes to the scholarly life. As \nwe follow along with the story we learn about the nature of his \nwritings, both the scholarly and the popular, but we also learn more \nabout what it means to be a professor. Having spent some time in that \nrealm, I found some similarities and many differences between his \nexperiences and mine. What you will discover here is that there is a \nlot more to being a professor than simply teaching. You will learn \nabout being on committees and performing other forms of academic \nservice, some of which can be tedious!  You will also learn about the \nrelationships that emerge with students that take place outside the \nclassroom. This is part of why he wrote the memoir. He wants the \nnon-scholar to understand what it means to be a scholar. In this day \nwhen many question the value of higher education, including \ntheological education (why do you need an M.Div. to be a pastor when \nall you really need is an ability to read the Bible?), Johnson offers \na counter-response to the anti-elitism were seeing in our day. \nThough Ive yet to find someone who is willing to let their barber \nperform heart surgery!\u0014\n\u0014\nOne part of the story that some folks will be familiar with is \nJohnsons engagement with the Jesus Seminar. This engagement brought \nhim much attention and even a bit of celebrity. However, even though \nhe may have sold lots of books and gained notoriety, he confesses \nthat this wasnt a pleasant experience. While the Jesus Seminar folks \ngarnered a lot of attention, Johnson has raised the important \nquestion as to whether this popularity is due to good scholarship. \nWhile there are differences of opinion on this question, Johnson \nreiterates that hes still not a fan. For the most part, I agree with \nhis assessment. But you have to read the memoir to discover why he \nresponded as he did!\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the reader will discover, Luke Timothy Johnson is a complicated \nfigure. In some ways, hes rather conservative, especially in the way \nhe reads the New Testament. Part of this stems from his insistence on \nthe importance of engaging in serious exegesis. Part of it also has \nto do with his own religious convictions. He may have left the \npriesthood, but the priesthood stays with him. Nevertheless, while he \nwrites for and with the Roman Catholic Church, he reminds the reader \nthat he never sought the imprimatur of the church. Therefore, he \nremains free to do as he believes is right without seeking the \napproval of the church. In this regard, he has strongly supported the \nfull inclusion of women in ministry and the full inclusion of LGBTQ \nfolks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Ive noted, Johnson begins the story with his journey to become a \nscholar. This journey is explored in the four chapters that make up \nPart One. Part Two begins after Johnson finishes his doctoral work \nand takes the first steps in becoming a scholar (Part Two). Finally, \nin Part Three, a section titled A Scholars Virtues Johnson focuses \non two forms of virtueintellectual and moral. Regarding intellectual \nvirtues, Johnson includes curiosity, respect for evidence, mastery of \nthe subject, wide and critical reading (he encourages scholars to \nwrite book reviews of works in ones own field), imagination, and \nclarity and cogency. These mostly focus on cultivating the life of \nthe mind. Then there are the moral virtues, by which he means the \nemotional and volitional virtues that include courage, ambition (its \nnot what you think), discipline, persistence, detachment, \ncontentment, multitasking (he doesnt mean playing solitaire on your \nphone while you watch a TV show). In his view, both the intellectual \nand the moral virtues are required if one is committed to excellence \nas a scholar. This is what he sought, excellence, in his life as a \nscholar. It is according to these virtues that he judges himself. He \nmight not fully reach the standards he set for himself, but this is \nhis guiding principle.\u0014\n\u0014\nHopefully, Ive revealed enough about Luke Timothy Johnsons \nmemoirThe Mind in Another Place: My Life as a Scholarto entice you \nto pick up a copy and read it for yourself, without revealing too \nmuch. Its possible that others might not find the book as \ninteresting as I did, but if you are interested in what it means to \nbe a biblical or theological scholar, then you will find this to be \nnot only informative but intriguing. I read the memoir as one has \npursued the scholarly life, though as Johnson notes in his memoir \nthis is more difficult to accomplish outside the academy. I believe \nhes correct. Being an independent scholar and a pastor, Ive found \npursuing scholarship to be challenging. What I can say is that I \nthoroughly enjoyed reflecting on Johnsons descriptions of the \nscholarly life, some of which I sought after but ultimately failed to \nattain. One other thing, if youre concerned that this is written \nfrom an ivory tower for scholars, and therefore not accessible to the \nnon-scholar, I can safely say that Johnson writes with clarity and \nenergy such that he keeps the reader involved in the story. Part of \nthat may have to do with the wide variety of reading hes engaged in \nsince childhood. So, take and read and discover what it means to be a \nscholar.\u0014\n \u0014\nThis review originally appeared on BobCornwall.com.\u0014",

    "words": "ALTHEA BROWN EDMISTON, VERSATILE MISSIONARY\u0014\n \u0014\nOn this day, 14 May 1901, the Presbyterian Church in the United \nStates commissioned Althea Brown, an African American, as a \nmissionary. She had been inspired by another African American, \nWilliam Sheppard, who gave impassioned calls for African Americans to \nspread Christianity in Africa. After a year of preparatory studies in \nChicago, she left for the Belgian Congo [now Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo]. She was stationed at Ibanche and took on a range of tasks \nthat revealed her versatility.\u0014\nIn 1904, forces of a hostile king overran Ibanche station. The \nmissionaries hunkered down for two nights of terror before a small \ncontingent of fearful Congolese soldiers rushed them to safety.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following year, Althea wed fellow missionary Alonzo Edmiston. \nDemonstrating her versatility and her ability to make much of little, \nshe sewed all the wedding clothes herself. They had two sons, Herman \nand Alonzo, who mostly stayed with relatives in Alabama where they \nwould not be exposed to African diseases. The Edmistons took several \nmonths of leave in 1908 during a confidential conflict with the \nmission that almost prevented them returning. The record asserts that \nno moral delinquency was charged but reveals that mission leaders \nwere unhappy with the mindset instilled in the Edmistons by an \nunnamed schoolconjectured to be Altheas alma mater, Fisk University.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Althea had no linguistic training, she produced the first \ndictionary and grammar of the Bukuta language of Bushoong. (The \nlanguage is also variously called the Bukutu, Bakuba, or Bukuba.) \nBecause of a lack of funds, twelve years passed before she could \nprint her text, and then only because she raised the necessary $2,000 \nherself. The grammar incorporated local folk tales and hymns. She \nalso prepared school books in the Bukuta language. Because of her \nmeticulous nature and attention to detail, Africans nicknamed her \nMama Tshitolo, that is, Careful Plucking.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1921, the Edmistons furloughed in the United States. Fisk \nUniversity invited Althea to speak. She appealed for more workers for \nAfrica, expressing clearly the needs of the mission and of the people \nit was trying to help. Africa needs the very best trained men and \nwomen that can be found, men and women with sound bodies and trained \nminds, and with hearts thoroughly consecrated to Christ and His \nservice.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in Africa the following year, the pair were stationed at Mutoto. \nDuring the next few years the region was in turmoil. Alonzo trained \nAfrican evangelists who could minister among the unsettled people. \nMeanwhile, Althea and Alonzo translated the entire Bible into Bukuta. \nAlthea headed a girls home and a school system. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe died at Mutoto in 1937 of malaria and sleeping sickness, having \ngiven her life for Christ and the Congo.\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nMICHAEL SATTLER DEFENDED HIS ANABAPTIST FAITH TO THE END  \u0014\nMAY 20, 2022\u0014\n \u0014\nReturning from an Anabaptist conference in Schleitheim, Switzerland, \nMichael Sattler walked into a trap. He did not know that Catholic \nauthorities were lying in wait at Horb (on the Neckar River near \nRottenburg and Tbingen). He walked into their arms, captured along \nwith several other Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe captors found a confession of faith on Sattler. Swiss Brethren \nhad drafted this under his leadership. They titled it Brotherly \nAgreement of Some Children of God but we know it as the Schleitheim \nConfession. It taught Anabaptists to baptize only those who had faith \nand to ban those who persisted in sin after warnings. They were also \nto refuse to take oaths or to use weapons, and to regard the Lords \nSupper as a symbol rather than a sacrament.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing that the people of Horb loved and respected Sattler, the \nAustrians imprisoned him several miles away. From jail he wrote a \nletter of encouragement to the folk he had led to Christ at Horb. He \nexhorted them to be faithful, pure, and productive: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Remember the Lord who gave you a coin ... lest that one talent be \ntaken away from you. Place it at interest according to the command of \nthe Lord who entrusted it to you....Persevere in prayer, that you \nmight stand worthily before the Son of Man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSattler refused a lawyer. Because the accusations had to do with his \nfaith, he said he must answer them himself. When he asked the council \nto repeat the charges so he could defend against them, the clerk of \nEnsisheim, who was taking part in the proceedings, refused. Sattler \nclaimed to have the Holy Spirit, sneered the clerk. Let the Holy \nSpirit give him the details. Fairer judges overruled him. However, \nEnsisheims clerk continued his vicious attacks throughout the trial \nand at the sentencing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong charges against Sattler was that he had left the monastery \nwhere he was prior (the highest post below an abbot) and had broken \nhis vows by marrying. Yes, said Sattler. He had seen the wicked lives \nof the monks who debauched many women, and decided it was best to \nmarry. As for leaving monasticism, he did so after studying the \nletters of Paul and seeing that Christs righteousness, not monastic \nobservance, was the way to salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of his trial, he asked for Bible experts to examine him. \nThe Ensisheim clerk answered, Yes, you infamous, desperate rascal of \na monk, should we dispute with you? The hangman will dispute with \nyou, I assure you!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe clerk swayed the court to impose a cruel sentence. Sattler was to \nburn alive. His tongue was to be cut out first and his flesh torn \nseven times with red hot pincers. On this day 20 May 1527(or 21 May) \nAustrian authorities carried out the sentence on the archheretic. \nHe had enough tongue left to preach to onlookers before he was cast \ninto the flame. The judges drowned Sattlers wife \u0014\nand several other women.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "MARY DYER FACED DOWN LAWS BANNING RELIG. FREEDOM",
    "words": "MARY DYER FACED DOWN LAWS THAT BANNED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, in light of Mary Dyers end, she came to America seeking \nreligious freedom. A contemporary described her as a person of no \nmean extract or parentage, of an estate pretty plentiful, of a comely \nstature and countenance, of a piercing knowledge in many things, of a \nwonderful sweet and pleasant discourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith husband William, she settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in \n1635. Immediately the pair became involved in church life. Soon Mary \ntook sides in the big religious controversy of Boston, the so-called \nantinomian (against-the-law) movement led by Anne Hutchinson. \nHutchinson advocated Spirit-filled living (and a freer church) as \nopposed to a lifeless works-based system. When colony leaders \nexcommunicated Hutchinson, Dyer rose and walked out with her. \nMeanwhile Dyer miscarried a deformed and stillborn child. Boston \nleaders exhumed the corpse, examined it and declared that its defects \nindicated Dyers spiritual deformity. Their descriptions suggest \nanencephaly (water on the brain) and spina bifida (improperly formed \nspinal column).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638, the Dyers moved to Rhode Island where religious freedom was \nnot only permitted but prized. William Dyer became a leader in the \nnew colony. In 1650, Mary sailed to England leaving behind William \nand their six children. She became interested in the Shakers, an odd \nsect that forbade marriage. William joined her in England either \nlater that year or in 1651. When he returned to Rhode Island in 1653, \nMary remained in England. She became a Quaker around 1654 and did not \nreturn to America until 1657.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnaware that Boston had outlawed Quakers, she landed there. For ten \nweeks she languished in jail, not permitted to communicate with \nanyone. She smuggled a letter to William who arranged her release, \ncalling her conditions worse than hogs and dogs. Soon afterward, \nNew Haven expelled Mary; she had gone to Connecticut to spread the \nnew doctrines there. She wasnt done with Boston either. Like other \nQuakers, she felt obliged to look the bloody law in the face.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo visit Boston took courage. Puritans added penalty to penalty \nagainst Quakers. Among the cruelties heaped upon them were \nstarvation, exposure in the stocks and the pillory, whipping, fines, \nimprisonment, branding, mutilation (which could include having the \ntongue bored with red-hot instruments and ears cropped), seizure of \nproperty, banishment, or death. Persecutors paraded Quaker women in \npublic stripped to the waist, flogging their naked backs and chests.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1658, Dyer was jailed when she came to the support of friends. The \nfollowing year she was arrested a third time in Boston and sentenced \nto death. At the last minute, after making her watch the hangings of \ntwo Quakers, authorities gave her a pre-planned reprieve. They \nordered her to leave Massachusetts, never to return. She then spent a \nfew months with friends on Shelter Island (near Long Island) where \nshe preached to colonists and Indians.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, Mary Dyer returned to Boston. Arrested a fourth time, she \nwas sentenced to death. Given a final chance to renounce her faith, \nshe refused. Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord \nGod I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death. On this \nday, 1 June 1660, Boston leaders hanged Dyer. Loud drumming prevented \nthe crowd from hearing her final words, but a bystander reported she \nsaid, Yea, I have been in Paradise these several days and now I am \nabout to enter eternal happiness. Friends in Portsmouth, Rhode \nIsland, recorded the event (although they got the date wrong): She \nwas put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruil [cruel] \nhand as the martyrs were in Queen Marys time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer death is often credited with ending executions of Quakers in \nMassachusetts. Edward Burroughs described to King Charles the \ncolonial mistreatment of Quakers, likely mentioning her case, and \nCharles forbade Massachusetts from executing any more of the sect. He \ncommanded they be sent to England for disposition. However, \nMassachusetts authorities continued to whip Quakers until 1665.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "MIRACLES, TORMENTS, AND STEADFAST FAITH SHONE IN THE LIFE OF ST. \nERASMUS\u0014\nNOT ERASMUS OF ROTTERDAM (1466-1536).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reformers of the sixteenth century took a dim view of the \nveneration of saints that had prevailed in the church for centuries. \nThomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, objected to the very \nstories told about them: \u0014\n\u0014\n[F]oolish, erroneous, and superstitious things be read in the Feasts \nof St. Blase, St. Valentine, St. Margaret, St. Peter, the Visitation \nof Our Lady, the Conception, the Transfiguration, Corpus Christi, \netc., whereof some be most vain fables, some very superstitious, some \ndirectly against Gods Word and the laws of this realm, and \naltogether be full of error and superstition. \u0014\n\u0014\nBishop Stephen Gardiner acknowledged that a key source of such \nstories, the Golden Legend, might contain many foolish lying tales. \nEven the author of the Golden Legend, Jacobus de Voragine, Archbishop \nof Genoa, acknowledged that some of his material was apocryphal. \nHowever, he presented the story of St. Erasmus (St. Elmo) without any \nsuch qualification. \u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus appeared in the region of Campania in Italy in the late third \nand early fourth centuries. Through his preaching, many people \nconverted. When Emperor Diocletian heard of it, he sent soldiers to \narrest him. A cruel judge tried to break the saint through torments. \nMiraculously he survived them all. After suspending him in a position \ndesigned to break his veins, the judge had the torturers beat his \nhead, and himself spat in his face. He then ordered him beaten with \nlead mallets. When Erasmus remained resolute, his persecutors placed \nhim in a pit with venomous snakes. These had no effect on him, so the \njudge immersed him in fiery brimstone and oil, but the saint lay as \nif in cold water. So the judge stuffed the saints mouth with \ncombustibles and lit them. A storm caused the firepit to burn \nErasmuss persecutors while sparing him. The emperor chained \nErasmuss neck and threw him back into the snake pit but an angel \nkilled the snakes. Erasmus escaped unharmed to preach again. \u0014\n\u0014\nEmperor Maximian took over, employing a new round of tortures in the \nattempt to break Erasmus, including a white-hot metal cloak. An angel \nrescued Erasmus while his persecutors died from the device. \nImpressed, spectators became Christians. Threatened with another \nflaming cloak, Erasmus replied, \u0014\n\u0014\n\"My Lord and my God hath for me so much done and suffered more than I \nhave deserved. Wherefore I will suffer all that I may suffer for him. \n. . .\u0014\n\u0014\nErasmus continued to overcome ingenious torments. More angels \nappeared, idols disintegrated, he preached Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nArrested while preaching in Formia, Erasmus endured another round of \ntorments. (Anyone who cares to read the entire gruesome catalog can \nfind it at Medieval Sourcebook.) At their height, he had a vision of \nglory. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen was this holy man right glad and joyful, and he cast his eyes \nupward to heaven, with lifting up his hands, and there he saw, a \nclear shining crown come from heaven upon his blessed head.\u0014\n\u0014\nTradition says Erasmus died on this day, 2 June 304. Scholars find in \nhis story kernels of fact. And whereas Cranmer would have discarded \nany absurd tale, some Christians value them for their inspirational \nworth. Hippolyte Delehaye, a twentieth-century student of hagiography \n(biographies of saints), uttered a dangerous dictum that could \njustify almost any falsehood: Legend, like all poetry, can claim a \nhigher degree of truth than history itself. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere appears to be no historical basis for his passio.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

At the council, the Orthodox \nattempted to patch up past differences with Roman Catholics and \nachieve Christian unity because the eastern empire, hard pressed by \nMuslim armies, needed Roman help. \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Eugenius IV would only agree if the Eastern Orthodox patriarchs \nscrapped key points of their theology and accepted Roman Catholic \ndogma. Mark was the only bishop who refused to sign the resulting \nlop-sided agreement. He considered Roman Catholicism to be a \nheretical schism. Without consultation with the East, Rome had \nchanged the creed to declare that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both \nFather and Son. Rome also claimed the primacy of the pope over the \nentire church, whereas the Orthodox had always considered the pope \nonly first among equals of the five leading patriarchs. And the \nwestern church had adopted the notion of purgatorial fire, for which \nthe Orthodox found no warrant in tradition or Scripture. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark, a prolific writer and a leading theologian, was famous for such \nstatements as, It is impossible to recall peace without dissolving \nthe cause of the schismthe primacy of the Pope exalting himself \nequal to God, and the notion of a punishment prior to the Last \nJudgment and of a purification through a material fire is altogether \nforeign to the tradition of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe common people of the eastern empire agreed with Mark rather than \nwith the majority of their other political and religious leaders. By \nhis act of boldness, Mark became the rallying point for the \nopposition and kept the Orthodox Church true to its traditions. When \nit became apparent how influential Mark was among the lower clergy \nand people, Emperor John Paleologos imprisoned him for two years on \nthe island of Limnos. Mark wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\nIf there had been no persecution, the martyrs would not have shone, \nnor would the confessors have received the crown of victory from \nChrist and by their exploits strengthened and gladdened the Orthodox \nChurch.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeeble when released, Mark returned to Constantinople where he lived \nout his few remaining months. As his end approached, he requested \nGeorge Scholarios to take up the work of defending Orthodoxy. \nScholarios did, serving as patriarch of Constantinople under Muslim \nconquerors. \u0014\n\u0014\nHaving rejected communion with those who were willing to adopt the \nRoman rites in order to obtain union, Mark said,\u0014\n\u0014\nI am absolutely convinced that the farther I stand from him [the \nPatriarch] and those like him, the nearer I am to God and all the \nsaints; and to the degree that I separate myself from them am I in \nunion with the Truth and with the Holy Fathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark died on this day, 23 June 1444, after an excruciating two-week \nbattle with intestinal disease.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History\u0014",

    "words": "Godly Menno Simons Defended Anabaptist Theology in a Public Debate\u0014\n \u0014\nIN A TOUCHING AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH, Menno Simons described his \nChristian pilgrimage from Catholic priest to pacifist Anabaptist in \nthe Netherlands. He wrote that he did not open a New Testament until \nhe had been a priest for two years: he was afraid it would mislead \nhim. However, he was troubled by doubt whether the bread and wine of \nEucharist actually turned into Christs body. He confessed this \nsinful concern but found no peace. Finally he decided to see what \nthe Scriptures said. To his relief, he wrote, the Bible convinced him \nno such doctrine was taught. But now he became uneasy at the practice \nof infant baptism which he could not find in the Bible, either. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe began to study the Scripture and the writings of Protestant \nreformers in earnest and even gained a name as an evangelical \npreacher within the Catholic church. Meanwhile, he continued to live \nat ease, playing cards daily and teaching only those truths that \nwould not get him into trouble with his church. I wished only to \nlive comfortably and without the cross of Christ, he admitted. What \nforced him into a deeper commitment was the failed Anabaptist \nrevolution in the city of Mnster. Many people surrendered everything \nthey owned to follow the rebel cultand died for it. \u0014\n\u0014\nSimons realized that if he had preached the truth he had come to \nbelieve, some of those people might have escaped the massacre. Now he \ncommitted himself to preaching the truth publicly. Soon he left the \nCatholic church and became pastor to a small group of Anabaptists. He \nmarried. The imperial government placed a price on his head. His life \nwas one of continual flight, never able to stay long in one place. \u0014\n\u0014\nSimons rejected any hint of the militant Anabaptist teachings that \nhad led to Mnster. He developed a theology focused on the New \nTestament and on following the teaching and example of Jesus, with \nemphasis on holy living as the true indicator of conversion. He \ngained many followers as he moved about northern Germany and the \nNetherlands. However, he was known to have been sympathetic to views \non the Incarnation held by Melchior Hoffman, one of the leaders at \nMnster, and other reformers made false accusations against him and \nhis teaching. \u0014\n\u0014\nA case in point occurred in East Friesland. Countess Anna of \nOldenburg was a mild ruler. She brought in the Reformed pastor and \ntheologian John Lasco who was more tolerant regarding the execution \nof Anabaptists than many reformers. He was to head the state church \nand to investigate religious groups to determine which were \nheretical. Lasco invited Simons to a debate. \u0014\n \u0014\nThe discussion opened in Emden on this day, 28 January 1544 with at \nleast a small audience in attendance. Lasco and Simons discussed the \nincarnation, infant baptism, original sin, sanctification, and the \ntrue vocation of preachers. At the end Lasco asked for a written \nstatement. Simons obliged. Lasco claimed Simons held views which the \nAnabaptist leader stoutly disavowed. Nonetheless, Countess Anna \nordered him out of her territory. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the price on his head and all that his enemies tried against \nhim, Menno Simons lived to sixty-six and died a natural death. His \nideas lived on. The Mennonites, named for him, became the largest \nAnabaptist group and a worldwide movement.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "MASTER MENDELSSOHN REVIVED MASTER BACH",
    "words": "Master Mendelssohn Revived Master Bach\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Sebastian Bach believed in the resurrection. The \"crucifixus\" \nof his Mass in B minor ended with low register voices to suggest \nChrist going down into the grave and the next chorus breaks forth in \njoy to express resurrection. Bach's music went through a resurrection \nof its own. Virtually forgotten at his death, the bulk of his work \nlay neglected for almost a century. Fish vendors in the market \nwrapped their ware in Bach manuscripts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's life was defined by poverty. But in music he poured out \nwealth. Every form he touched, he improved. He perfected the \n\"well-tempered\" scale which by dividing every octave into twelve \nequal distances allowed any key on the organ to start a scale. His \nkeyboard technique used all five fingers where three had been the \nnorm. The Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained \nmusicians such as Beethoven. Beethoven remarked: \"He should not be \ncalled Bach (brook) but Meer (sea).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery note Bach wrote was dedicated to Christ. Throughout his \nmanuscripts appear cryptic abbreviations such as \"I. N. J.\" standing \nfor In Nomine Jesu; that is, \"In the Name of Jesus.\" According to \nhim, music's aim and purpose is to glorify God and provide recreation \nfor the mind. \"Where this is not observed there will be no real music \nbut only devilish hubbub.\" He poured emotion into his music which \nbecame the mother of Romanticism. His portrayals of Christ's passion \nmade frequent use of dissonance. Combining expressive melodies with a \nrhythmic bass line, he conveyed, according to William H. Scheide, \n\"the union of the divine and human in the person of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man's work fell into neglect was regrettable. Those near \nhim simply did not recognize his genius. Shortly after Bach died one \nBurgomaster remarked unfeelingly, \"The school needed a cantor and not \na Kapellmeister.\" For fifty years no Bach piece was published \nseparately on its own merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's revival was largely owing to another Christian composer. Felix \nMendelssohn was in awe of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. He arranged to \nhave Bach's St. Matthew Passion played on this day March 11, 1829, \nalmost exactly a century from the date of its first, long-forgotten \nperformance. Mendelssohn himself conducted. \"Never,\" wrote one \nparticipant, \"have I known any performance so consecrated by one \nunited sympathy.\" More than 1,000 people were unable to get tickets. \nTwo further concerts had to be scheduled at once. So great was the \nsensation that composer Hector Berlioz marveled, \"There is but one \ngod--Bach and Mendelssohn, his prophet.\" Today many consider Bach the \ngreatest composer who ever lived. Mendelssohn's oratorios Elijah and \nPaul are his own monuments to faith. Mendelssohn died at thirty six, \nworn out with overwork.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bach, Johann Sebastian.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch. Edited by F. L.

    "words": "Mary Jones and the Bible Society\u0014\n\u0014\nWales had experienced revival. One thing, however, was lacking. There \nwere not enough Bibles for everyone. Fifteen year old Mary Jones \nsaved her money and walked twenty-five miles to see the Reverend \nThomas Charles who sold Welsh-language Bibles. He had just sold his \nlast copy, but was so impressed with her diligence that he gave it to \nher anyway, telling her the other buyer would just have to wait.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Charles was a notable figure in the revival. Perhaps because \nof Mary's hunger for the word, he visited the Religious Tract Society \nin London in 1802 and pleaded with them for Scriptures. The Society \nhad to turn him away. Providing bibles just was not in their job \ndescription. As the members discussed the request, the Rev. Joseph \nHughes said, \"a society might be formed for the purpose--and if for \nWales, why not for the Kingdom; why not for the whole world?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy not indeed? Fifteen months later the spark of his suggestion \nbecame reality. On this day, March 7, 1804, The British and Foreign \nBible Society was formed. It was to be the first of many similar \norganizations throughout the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nKey supporters of the nascent society were members of the Clapham \nsect, those well-placed evangelicals who did so much to improve \nsociety in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The \nSociety was non-sectarian, representing a wide spectrum of Christian \nlife in Britain. It refused to distribute or print bibles with notes. \nToo often bibles had been printed with barbed comments aimed at other \nChristian denominations and they wanted no part of that. Auxiliaries \nof the main society quickly sprang up. 69 other Bible organizations \nformed in just ten years.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society began an immediate and useful \nwork. It funded trailblazing missionary William Carey in his \ntranslation work. When Morrison began to turn the Bible into Chinese \nthe Society generously assisted him, as it did Henry Martyn, who was \nworking on a Persian translation. The Society backed Translation of \nthe Gospel of John into Mohawk. As far away as the Pacific, the \nSociety funded a translation into Raratongan. Wherever Christian \nmissions spread around the globe, the Society could be found, lending \na hand. Within a hundred years it had distributed over 200 million \npieces of literature. By 1962 four fifths of the inhabitants of the \nglobe had the Bible in their own tongue, although 2000 small language \ngroups remained without any translation.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the start The British and Foreign Bible Society let missionaries \ndo their own translation. Other societies trained their own workers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty years or so after its birth, the society split. Many of its \nsupporters were opposed to including the apocryphal books in versions \nissued by the society. When the Society did not decide quickly enough \nagainst the practice, the Scots withdrew and formed their own highly \neffective society. Later a group of supporters, irate over the \ninclusion of Unitarians in the British and Foreign Bible Society, \nformed the Trinitarian Bible Society.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from Glimpses, a Christian History Institute publication.\u0014\nCarter, Mary.

His only defeat came in the 1919 Sanford Stakes at Saratoga at \nthe hands of the aptly named Upset. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe never started in the Kentucky Derby, but easily won the Preakness \nand Belmont. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe set track records for one mile, 1 1/8 miles, 1 3/8 miles, 1 1/2 \nmiles and 1 5/8 miles and was the leading money winner when he \nretired. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe easily carried 130 pounds or more in his two racing seasons and \nwould have started under at least 140 had he raced as a four year \nold.

    "words": "Mary Reed Contracted Leprosy Tending other Victims of the Disease\u0014\n \u0014\nMARY REED was born in Lowell, Ohio, in 1854. Converted to Christ at \nthe age of sixteen, she immediately recognized she was meant to serve \nin Christs kingdom. For ten years she taught school before going to \nIndia as a Methodist missionary in 1884 to work among women confined \nto zenanasthe courtyards of their homes. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer health soon faltered in the hot climate and the mission sent her \nto a cooler mountain retreat to recover. There she encountered many \npeople suffering from leprosy and gave them what help she could. She \ncontinued to serve as a missionary for several more years before \nill-health forced her to return to the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile in America she began to pay attention to some symptoms that had \ntroubled her for some time. For instance, she was experiencing a \ntingling sensation in one finger. Spots had developed on her body. \nOne day it dawned on her that she had probably contracted leprosy. \nBecause rural American doctors had little knowledge of the disease, a \nfirm diagnosis had to wait until she could speak with experts in New \nYork. They confirmed her suspicion. To protect her family from \nexposure, she left the United States abruptly without embracing her \ndearest relatives, telling only one sister the reason for her sudden \ndeparture. \u0014\n\u0014\nReed believed God had sent her the disease as a way of opening her \nway for a new work. A Mission to Lepers accepted her as \nsuperintendent of the Chandag Heights Leprosy Home at a beautiful \nlocation in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains. Sympathy for her \ncondition caused many people to support the work. For several years \nshe supervised Methodist mission work in the area, as well as \nmanaging and expanding the separate work of the Mission to Lepers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe disease continued its progress, attacking her vocal chords, too, \nbut advanced much more slowly than was usual. Although she \nadministered medicines to those at her missions and had no personal \nobjection to medicine, from the start she felt convinced the Lord did \nnot want her to employ any herself. In 1896, in answer to her prayers \nand the prayers of many others, her disease went into remission. \nCritics claimed she never had leprosy at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1898, exhausted by her role with the two missions, she left the \nMethodist work and devoted herself exclusively to those suffering \nfrom leprosy. Most of the people who came to Chandag Heights became \nChristians. Cast out from their families and offered no solace in \ntheir traditional religion, they found great appeal in Christianity. \nMany showed evidence of new life, turning from selfish and \nquarrelsome behavior to peaceable and service-oriented attitudes. \nSuch evidence of her usefulness caused Reed to write, Oh, how my \nheart goes out in praise and gratitude to Him who so wonderfully \nverifies his blessed promise, Lo, I am with you always. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Reed was an old woman, her leprosy began to spread again. \nThankfully, drugs now existed to control it and this time she felt no \nhindrance to using them. Almost completely blind by 1938, she \nretired. Five years later, on this day, 8 April 1943, she died at \nChandag Heights, faithful to Christ to the end. Jesus has enabled me \nto say not with a sigh but with a song, Thy will be done. She was \nburied at the foot of a chapel that she had built.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

His mother \nwas a complex womancaring but withdrawn, eternally angry and rarely \nsatisfied. His father was distant and physically abusive. It was not \nan easy life, but it instilled in young Harry the hard-nosed \ntoughness of the city and the resilient spirit of the Caribbean \nlifestyle. It also gave him the drive to make good and channel his \nanger into actions that were positive and life-affirming. His journey \nled to the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he encountered an \nonslaught of racism but also fell in love with the woman he \neventually married. After the war, he moved back to Harlem, where he \ndrifted between odd jobs until he saw his first stage playand found \nthe life he wanted to lead. Theater opened up a whole new world, one \nthat was artistic and political and made him realize that not only \ndid he have a need to express himself, he had a lot to express.\u0014\n \u0014\nHe began as an actorand has always thought of himself as suchbut \nwas quickly spotted in a musical, began a tentative nightclub career, \nand soon was on a meteoric rise to become one of the worlds most \npopular singers. Belafonte was never content to simply be an \nentertainer, however. Even at enormous personal cost, he could not \nshy away from activism. At first it was a question of personal \ndignity: breaking down racial barriers that had never been broken \nbefore, achieving an enduring popularity with both white and black \naudiences. Then his activism broadened to a lifelong, passionate \ninvolvement at the heart of the civil rights movement and countless \nother political and social causes. The sections on the rise of the \ncivil rights movement are perhaps the most moving in the book: his \nclose friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr.; his role as a conduit \nbetween Dr. King and the Kennedys; his up-close involvement with the \ndemonstrations and awareness of the hatred and potential violence \naround him; his devastation at Dr. Kings death and his continuing \nfight for what he believes is right.\u0014\n \u0014\nBut My Song is far more than the history of a movement. It is a very \npersonal look at the people in that movement and the world in which \nBelafonte has long moved. He has befriended many beloved and \nimportant figures in both entertainment and politicsPaul Robeson, \nEleanor Roosevelt, Sidney Poitier, John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, \nRobert Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro, Tony Bennett, Bill \nClintonand writes about them with the same exceptional candor with \nwhich he reveals himself on every page. This is a book that pulls no \npunches, and turns both a loving and critical eye on our countrys \ncultural past.\u0014\n \u0014\nAs both an artist and an activist, Belafonte has touched countless \nlives. With My Song, he has found yet another way to entertain and \ninspire us. It is an electrifying memoir from a remarkable man\u0014",

    "title": "MILTON SOLD \"PARADISE LOST\" FOR A BARGAIN PRICE",
    "words": "Milton Sold Epic \"Paradise Lost\" for a Bargain Price\u0014\n \u0014\nJOHN MILTON was born in 1608 near the onset of the great power \nstruggle between king and Parliament. His Puritan family had suffered \nlosses for their faith, and it was natural that Milton should side \nwith the Puritans and Parliament. He would one day advocate the \nseparation of church and state and call for the kind of liberty that \nwestern nations came to enjoy in later centuries. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs a young man, he wrote poems that revealed his genius. The most \nfamous of these were LAllegro and Il Penseroso. Although he had \nalready conceived the idea of writing a great epic, for twenty years \n(1640-1660) he wrote only political pamphlets, including a Latin \ndefense of the English peoples execution of King Charles the First. \nHe served as Latin secretary to Cromwells regime. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Cromwell died and Charles II was restored to the English throne, \nMilton had to go into hiding. Friends even faked a funeral to make it \nappear that he was dead. By then, Milton was blind and very poor, and \nso he finally applied himself to the epic he had dreamed of writing. \nThe result was Paradise Lost, a poem in twelve books. To maintain its \nsolemn tone, he wrote largely in blank verse using the sturdiest \nmeter of English poetryiambic pentameter. He also employed an \nunobtrusive alliteration throughout the work. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe title refers to the fall of mankind when Eve plucked the \nforbidden fruit in the garden of Eden and shared it with Adam, a \nmoment Milton recreated with the lines:\u0014\n\u0014\nSo saying, her rash hand in evil hour\u0014\nForth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat.\u0014\nEarth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,\u0014\nSighing through all her works, gave signs of woe\u0014\nThat all was lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, April 27, 1667, Milton sold his magnificent epic, \nconveying the rights for Paradise Lost to Samuel Simmons. Because of \nthe cloud under which the poet lived, Simmons was uneasy to have it \nknown that he was the publisher and did not include his name on the \noriginal title page when he printed thirteen hundred copies that \nAugust. Milton received only 5 from the transaction, with the \npromise of five more if a second printing of thirteen hundred was \nrequired. It was, and he earned a second 5, but was dead before a \nthird printing was called for. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite its slow start, the masterpiece eventually sold millions of \ncopies and many readers ranked it as second only to the Bible for \nmagnificence. The work ends with Gods promise of restoration through \nJesus Christ. Next to God the Father, Christ is the most exalted \nbeing in the poem, described by Milton in this manner:\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond compare the Son of God was seen\u0014\nMost glorious; in him all his Father shone\u0014\nSubstantially expressd; and in his face\u0014\nDivine compassion visibly appeard,\u0014\nLove without end, and without measure grace.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, some critics complained that Miltons view of Christ was \nArianthat his Christ was a created being. Believers in the doctrine \nof predestination also objected that Adam and Eve were made free \nagents of their own sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n. . .they themselves decreed\u0014\ntheir own revolt, not I. If I foreknew,\u0014\nForeknowledge had no influence on their fault.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever its errors of theology, imagined or real, even Miltons \nenemies admit his epic surpassed anything done in English on that \nscale. Indeed, in all of Christian literature, only Dantes Divine \nComedy is considered superior.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "MY STRUGGLE WITH MARY",
    "words": "My struggle with Mary\u0014\n\u0014\nCan Jesus mother be redeemed from the churchs tendency to parcel \nher up into a patriarchal box and then label it glory?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Rachel Mann  December 8, 2023\u0014\n\u0014\nIm not the first and I wont be the last person to have an \nambivalent relationship with Mary, the mother of Jesus. There have \nbeen times in my life when Ive held a significant personal devotion \nto her. I found comfort in praying the rosary. Even now, decades on \nfrom using the rosary as a dedicated focus for prayer, I continue to \nbe moved by its acknowledgment that the Lord is with Mary, as well \nas its recognition of her eternal ministry of prayer: Pray for us \nnow and at the hour of our death. The idea that Mary is the queen of \nheaven is one to conjure with. It feeds my poetic imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet it is also fair to say that Mary can be a turnoff. She has been \nheld up, especially by the Catholic Church, as the ultimate role \nmodel for women, the icon of femininity. In the rosary, Marys value \nis shaped around her motherhood: Blessed art thou among women, and \nblessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. If I am indeed in awe of \nMary as the theotokosthe God bearermany feminists remind us that \nwhen Marys blessedness is framed merely in terms of her motherhood, \nthis can be bad news for ordinary women.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her classic essay Stabat Mater, Julia Kristeva points out how \nthe churchs genius for making Mary the icon of faithful womanhood is \na double-edged sword: Mary gives women an image of holiness and \nfemale power to which to aspire, yet one which no woman can actually \nachieve. For no ordinary woman can bear a child and remain \nperpetually sinless.\u0014\n\u0014\n In a world with few female role models, Mary runs the risk of \nsetting women up to fail: insofar as she has been used to convince \nwomen that their holiest identity is to be mothers, she also shows \nhow far short actual women fall of ideal motherhood. Certainly, for \nvery many women who cannot bear children, including me, the way in \nwhich Mary the mother is held as an icon for women has felt \noppressive.\u0014\n\u0014\nI feel as if Marys humanity has often been eroded away. So many \nstatues and paintings of her are sentimentalized. She is presented as \na middle-class simpering White woman dressed in pristine blue robes. \nIn emphasizing her virginity and suggesting that she was sinless, \ntraditional ideas about Mary redact out the facts of her female body.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore than that, there are reasons to be troubled by some of the \nbiblical representations of Mary, especially in this age of questions \naround consent. In the famous encounter between the angel Gabriel and \nMary, Gabriel announces that the Holy Spirit will come upon Mary and \novershadow her so that she shall bear Gods son. Feminist analysis \nof this encounter has ranged from concerns about the extent to which \nMary is set up as a compliant handmaid to questions about whether she \nis old enough to grant her consent to Gods plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt doesnt take much imagination to see how, for some, the images \ncreated by this encounter are troubling. A girl meeting the majesty \nof God, represented by an angel, is one thing; a girl being told she \nwill conceive a son via the overshadowing power of the Holy Spirit is \nanother. One can readily see how it is possible to read Gods call on \nMary as massively skewing power toward God.\u0014\n\u0014\nCan Mary be redeemed from the churchs tendency to parcel her up into \na patriarchal box and then label it glory? I think so. In The Book \nof Mary, poet Nicola Slee expands the frame of imaginative reference. \nHer poem In Praise of Marys Hairy Armpits invites the reader to \nkeep sight of Marys holiness whilst presenting her as a woman with \nemotional ups and downs, body odors, and periods.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn An Artists Litany to Mary, Slee takes the familiar claim that \nMary is queen and expands it: not simply queen of heaven but queen of \npoets, fools, and clowns. The poem re-centers Gods making to the \nfeminine: the Word who was from the beginning and through whom all \nthings are made is refracted through the figure of the queen of all \ncreativity. The one who carries God in her womb becomes the locus for \npoetic and priestly creativity. Slee links Jesus royal priesthood to \nMarys queenly authority and creativity.\u0014\n\u0014\nI acknowledge that the annunciation can be read as an unsavory \nencounter between power and vulnerability. Gabriels encounter with \nMary raises questions about consent and agency, questions I do not \nunderestimate. Yet I also find Marys response to the angel \nsignificant: Marys willingness to unite her will and purposes to \nthose of God is no mere afterthought. There is an extraordinary, \nquiet, and deeply prophetic determination when Mary says, Let it be \nwith me according to your word (Luke 1:38). She joins a long line of \nthose who take their place in Gods work of justice and love. Mary \nspeaks and claims her place. She will not simply be done to. She \ntransforms Gods invitation into service and action.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary is a peasant girl daring to speak to Gods ambassador. A girl \nwith no voice and little agency, she has courage and finds her own \nauthority. When she meets Gabriel, she may not yet realize it but she \nhas all the authority of a queen. As she embraces Gods invitation to \nbe the theotokos, she finds her prophetic voice. A few months after \nher encounter with Gabriel, Mary will proclaim her famous Magnificat. \nHer words of justice, comfort, and challenge echo down the ages and \nshape us still. The young girl who met the presence of God continues \nto disrupt and transform our troubled world. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRachel Mann\u0014\nRachel Mann is a priest in the Church of England, a theologian, and \nauthor of Spectres of God.\u0014",

    "title": "MARY SLESOR TRIED TO CHANGE NIGERIA",
    "words": "In 1914, Mary Slessor, a world-famous missionary to Nigeria, fell so \nill that she had to be taken by canoe to hospital. A few weeks later \nshe collapsed again. As she lay semi-conscious she whispered \"O God, \nrelease me.\" She died on this day, January 13, 1915, mourned by \nthousands of Nigerians. The Scotswoman had worked among them for \nthirty-nine years.\u0014\n\u0014\nA harsh childhood prepared Mary for Africa. At eleven she prepared \njute and flax for weavers. In time, she became a skilled weaver, able \nto manage two sixty-inch looms at once. Although exhausted, for she \nwas \"wee and thin and not very strong,\" Mary made the most of \nopportunities. She snatched whatever schooling she could get. If she \nwas too tired to follow the arithmetic, the teacher punished her by \nmaking her stand. On early winter nights, she dodged drunks and \nthieves as she walked home in the dark to do her chores and face her \ndrunken father. Often her mother pushed her out into the street so \nthat her dad couldn't beat her.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter she became a Christian, Mary held Bible classes for children \nwhose lives were as bleak as her own. She taught them that they could \nhave friendship with Christ. She took groups into the countryside for \npicnics and raced with them. Such behavior raised the eyebrows of the \nstuffy people in the pews who wanted things done \"properly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne gang rejected Mary's message, jeering and literally slinging mud \nat her. These toughs surrounded her while their leader whirled a lead \nweight on a string, coming closer and closer to her face. Praying \ninwardly, she determined not to duck or run. Even when the lead \ngrazed her forehead, she stood with steady eyes. The ringleader \ndropped the weight. \"Its OK boys. She's game!\" He made his whole gang \nattend meeting. \"What is courage, but faith conquering fear?\" she \nasked later.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn August 5, 1876 she sailed for Africa. There she saw cruel gods \ncarved of wood and stone. The Nigerians sacrificed humans to these \nidols. Mary put her life on the line to rescue slaves and women from \ndeath. She fought against judgment by ordeal. A person suspected of \ndoing wrong might be forced to eat poison beans; or boiling oil might \nbe poured over him. Every one tested by these methods proved to be \n\"guilty.\" Such cruelty infuriated Mary. When a man poured boiling oil \non the hands of an eleven year old boy, Mary grabbed a scoop of the \nscalding liquid and chased the man to slop oil on him and \"prove\" \nthat he was not innocent either.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother evil she fought was the treatment of wives after a husband's \ndeath. A chicken was beheaded in front of the unlucky women. \nDepending on how it flopped, the wife was pronounced guilty or \ninnocent of her husband's death. The legs of \"guilty\" wives were \nbroken and the women thrown alive into their husband's grave.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nigerians enslaved and branded each other. When a chief died, \ndozens of slaves were killed. Unwanted babies were thrown into the \nbush. Twins were buried alive or thrown into the forest, their mother \ndriven off to die. The tribes fought, danced and drank. Sometimes \nthey ate one another. Everyone lived in terror. A secret society \nknown as the Egbo went around in masks and beat people. Once Mary \nshowed how weak they really were by chasing a group of Egbo and \ntearing off one sheepish man's mask.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy her bold actions, Mary made a major contribution in bringing an \nend to the worst abuses. Gradually she helped Nigerians recognize \nthat lives are worth saving. She succeeded because she trusted God. \n\"God and one are always a majority,\" she declared.\u0014\n\u0014\nResources:\u0014\n\u0014\nExcerpted and arranged from Christian History Institute's Glimpses \n#128.\u0014",

One of those \nrepresentations is of an African girl, Manchi Masemola. (Her first \nname is often spelled Manche, but the family prefers Manchi.)\u0014\n\u0014\nMasemola was born into the Pedi tribe of South Africa around 1913. \nChristian missionaries had brought the gospel to the region in the \neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A minority of the Pedi accepted \nthe new faith but it was distrusted by the majority who held the \nancient tribal religion and considered Christianity treasonous \nbecause of its association with the colonialists. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1919, Augustine Moeka, an Anglican priest, established a mission \nat Marishane in behalf of the Anglican Community of the Resurrection. \nMasemola began attending baptismal classes with her orphaned cousin \nLucia. Fearful that she would not be marriageable and thus not bring \nthem a dowry, her parents demanded she quit the classes. Each time \nshe defied them, they beat her. Possibly they were so severe was \nbecause class attendance took her away from field work for a few \nhours. The beatings became so severe she predicted she would be \nkilledand baptized in her own blood. To keep Masemola from \nattending classes, her mother took her clothes. When this did not \nprevent her following Christ, her parents brought her to a spiritist \nwho prepared a concoction they compelled her to drink. Masemola, \nhowever, would not be dissuaded from her faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe end was not far off. As the story has long been told, on or \naround this day, 4 February 1928, Masemolas parents killed her and \nburied her beside a granite rock. Lucia confirmed this account. \nHowever, Masemolas mother, who became a Christian in 1969, denied \nthe charge of murder; and Masemolas father planted euphorbia trees \nin remembrance of Masemola and a younger sister who died about the \nsame time. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut beyond dispute, Masemola suffered severely for Christ. She was \nprobably fifteen when she died. Her ordeal was not without fruit. In \n1935, people began to visit her grave. Over subsequent years a \nmovement grew to honor her memory. Today pilgrims visit her grave \nannually on the first weekend of August. They hear a sermon that \nencourages them to walk in faith like Masemola.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "MARK INTRODUCTION",
    "words": "Scholars assign a composition date for Marks\u0014\nGospel between the years 65-70 C.E.during the time\u0014\njust before the 66 C.E. Jewish revolt against Rome or\u0014\nwhile the revolt was underway. Traditionally the community\u0014\nfor which Mark wrote this Gospel was located\u0014\nin Rome, but recently more scholars believe the community\u0014\nwas at home in the Galilee of northern Israel or perhaps \u0014\njust north of Galilee in southern Syria. There are implications\u0014\nfor locating Mark in such a time and place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis part of the world was largely rural. The people\u0014\nwere mostly peasants living in small villages. They\u0014\nworked long, hard hours in their fields or shops for\u0014\nsubsistence wages. Despite their low wages, they were\u0014\nheavily taxed by Rome, the Herodians who ruled\u0014\nGalilee, and the temple system in Jerusalem. They\u0014\nexisted, therefore, on the edge of survival. Should\u0014\nfamine or illness or a greater tax burden arise, they\u0014\nwere forced to borrow money from upper-class folk\u0014\nwho charged exorbitant interest. This caused many\u0014\npeasants to live in virtual debt slavery. They had poor\u0014\nquality food and virtually no access to health care. Is it\u0014\nany wonder that hunger, illness, and indebtedness\u0014\nshow up so frequently in stories of Jesus in Galilee?\u0014\n\u0014\nPeasants might have turned to the chief priests in\u0014\nJerusalem for help, but the chief priests had cast their\u0014\nlot with the Romans. They cooperated with Rome in\u0014\norder to maintain their power over the temple system\u0014\nin Jerusalem. The temple was not only the center of\u0014\nJewish worship, it also served as the storehouse for the\u0014\ntithes and taxes required of the people, so that it was\u0014\nthe center of the economic system of the day. Furthermore,\u0014\nthe chief priests control of the temple systems\u0014\nreligious and economic might gave them political\u0014\npower in the land. Americans are accustomed to our\u0014\nseparation of church and state, but religion, politics,\u0014\nand economics were thoroughly intertwined in firstcentury\u0014\nIsrael.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus the chief priests, Roman officials, and Herodians,\u0014\nwho comprised less than five percent of the population,\u0014\nwere politically powerful and economically\u0014\nwell off, and the chief priests could claim Gods sanction\u0014\nfor their privilege and status. They lived lavishly\u0014\nand could anticipate a life span of sixty to seventy\u0014\nyears. Peasants, by contrast, might live thirty to forty\u0014\ndifficult years with no voice in the religious-politicaleconomic\u0014\ndecisions that affected their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should not be surprised, therefore, at the discontent\u0014\nand unrest that was ever-present in first-century\u0014\nIsrael, erupting periodically in various protests and liberation\u0014\nmovements, and finally exploding in full revolt\u0014\nin the year 66 C.E. Jewish zealots wanting to drive the\u0014\nGentiles from their land, members of messianic movements\u0014\nhoping to restore the Davidic kingdom and\u0014\napocalyptic groups looking for God to judge Romes\u0014\nevil joined forces in a violent uprising against Roman oppression \u0014\nin the spring of that year. The days were\u0014\ntense and filled with threats of violence between the\u0014\nJewish patriots and Romans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Markan community was a relatively new community,\u0014\nlocated on the edge of Israel and socially on\u0014\nthe margins of the political, economic, and religious\u0014\npower structures. In the midst of such revolts, tension,\u0014\nand fear during those times, how should the Markan\u0014\ncommunity live out its faith in Jesus as the Jewish\u0014\nMessiah?\u0014",

    "title": "MARGARET CLITHEROW PRESSED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH",
    "words": "MARGARET CLITHEROW, \"BEST WIFE,\" WAS PRESSED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH\u0014\n\u0014\nIN 1970 Pope Paul VI canonized forty martyrs of England and Wales. \nThese Catholics had run afoul of English laws four centuries earlier. \nFor instance, a 1581 law had made it a crime to hold Catholic \nservices or give refuge to Catholic priests. In part this was owing \nto Catholic plots to unseat Queen Elizabeth I, whom Pope Pius V had \nexcommunicated and declared the illegitimate ruler of England.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the forty martyrs, priests and monks predominated, but three \nwomen were included. One of them, Margaret Clitherow, had hidden \npriests in Yorkshire so they could provide religious instruction and \nservices for Catholics. Apart from a few city records, such as a \nregister of her marriage to John Clitherow, most of what we know \nabout Margaret comes from a biography written by her last confessor, \nFather John Mush. \u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret was fifteen when she married John, and she converted to \nCatholicism about three years later. Although her husband remained \nwith the Church of England, he was not unsympathetic to his wifes \ncause: one of his own brothers was a priest. John paid Margarets \nfines for not attending the established church. However, Margaret \nkept her activities hidden from him as much as possible because, as \nbridgemaster, he was required to report Catholic activities. She \ninvented excuses, such as attending sick people, to visit sites where \nMass was secretly held. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1577, six years after her marriage, she was sent to prison for \nfailure to attend Church of England services. Over the next nine \nyears, she was imprisoned several more times for religious offenses, \nonce for twenty months. Despite the danger, she said, If Gods \npriests dare venture themselves to my house, I will never refuse \nthem. During one incarceration, she learned to read English. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe was prudent, clean, hard-working, charitable, and faithful, and \nshe bore John at least two sons and a daughter who lived to \nadulthood. Evidently her influence on her children was strong: the \ntwo boys became Catholic priests and the daughter became a nun. Her \nattitude toward her servants was that she would not ask them to do \nany job she was not willing to do herself. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer personal religious observances included partaking of illegal \nMasses, walking barefoot to sacred sites, frequent fasting, \ntwice-weekly confession to priests, and similar mortifications. In \nspite of her absences while in jail, John declared her the best of \nwives. When she was condemned to death, he wept and said, Let them \ntake all I have and save her, for she is the best wife in all \nEngland, and the best Catholic also.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer condemnation came in 1586 after a scared, ten-year-old boy, \nthreatened by authorities, revealed where Margaret had hidden a \npriest. The authorities arrested her. To protect her children and \nservants from having to testify against her, she refused to enter a \nplea. As the law stood, the authorities had to punish her using a \ngeneral statute. They proceeded, although Wiggington, a leading \nPuritan minister, publicly warned them it was not right under Gods \nlaw to execute her on the word of a mere child. \u0014\n\u0014\nNonetheless the city leaders sentenced her to be stripped naked and \npressed to death with a sharp rock under her back. Sentence was \ncarried out on this day 25 March, 1586 in the tollbooth of the bridge \nwhere John was master. Told she must confess that she died for \ntreason, she replied, No, no, Mr. Sheriff, I die for the love of my \nLord Jesu. \u0014\n\u0014\nMargaret was placed under a door taken from her own house. Eight \nhundred pounds of rocks were piled on it. Her back broke on the sharp \nrock and her ribs cracked and the ends pushed through her chest. It \ntook her about fifteen minutes to die. Her last intelligible words \nwere Jesu! Jesu! Jesu! have mercy upon me!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "MICHAEL SATTLER DEFENDED HIS ANABAPTIST FAITH TO THE END\u0014\n \u0014\n[Above: Title page of the Schleitheimer Confession (1527), bearing \nSattler's name. Originally uploaded by GregorHelms / public domain, \nWikimedia File:Titelseite Schleitheimer Artikel.jpg]\u0014\n\u0014\nRETURNING from an Anabaptist conference in Schleitheim, Switzerland, \nMichael Sattler walked into a trap. He did not know that Catholic \nauthorities were lying in wait at Horb (on the Neckar River near \nRottenburg and Tbingen). He stepped into their arms, captured along \nwith several other Anabaptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe captors found a confession of faith on Sattler. Swiss Brethren \nhad drafted this under his leadership. They titled it Brotherly \nAgreement of Some Children of God but we know it as the Schleitheim \nConfession. It taught Anabaptists to baptize only those who had faith \nand to ban those who persisted in sin after warnings. They were also \nto refuse to take oaths or to use weapons, and to regard the Lords \nSupper as a symbol rather than a sacrament.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowing that the people of Horb loved and respected Sattler, the \nAustrians imprisoned him several miles away. From jail he wrote a \nletter of encouragement to the folk he had led to Christ at Horb. He \nexhorted them to be faithful, pure, and productive:\u0014\nRemember the Lord who gave you a coin ... lest that one talent be \ntaken away from you. Place it at interest according to the command of \nthe Lord who entrusted it to you....Persevere in prayer, that you \nmight stand worthily before the Son of Man.\u0014\n\u0014\nSattler refused a lawyer. Because the accusations had to do with his \nfaith, he said he must answer them himself. When he asked the council \nto repeat the charges so he could defend against them, the clerk of \nEnsisheim, who was taking part in the proceedings, refused. Sattler \nclaimed to have the Holy Spirit, sneered the clerk. Let the Holy \nSpirit give him the details. Fairer judges overruled the man. \nHowever, Ensisheims clerk continued his vicious attacks throughout \nthe trial and at the sentencing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the charges against Sattler were that he had left the monastery \nwhere he was prior (the highest post below an abbot) and had broken \nhis vows by marrying. Yes, said Sattler. He had seen the wicked lives \nof the monks who debauched many women, and decided it was best to \nmarry. As for leaving monasticism, he did so after studying the \nletters of Paul and seeing that Christs righteousness, not monastic \nobservance, was the way to salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\nNear the end of his trial, he asked for Bible experts to examine him. \nThe Ensisheim clerk answered, \"Yes, you infamous, desperate rascal of \na monk, should we dispute with you? The hangman will dispute with \nyou, I assure you!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe clerk swayed the court to impose a cruel sentence. Sattler was to \nburn alive. His tongue was to be cut out first and his flesh torn \nseven times with red hot pincers. On this day 20 May 1527 (or 21 May) \nAustrian authorities carried out the sentence on the archheretic. \nHe had enough tongue left to preach to onlookers before he was cast \ninto the flame. To complete their work, the judges drowned Sattlers \nwife and several other women.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n----- ----- -----\u0014",

    "title": "MARY DYER, QUAKER MARTYR",
    "words": "\u0014\nIRONICALLY, in light of Mary Dyers end, she came to America seeking \nreligious freedom. A contemporary described her as\u0014\na person of no mean extract or parentage, of an estate pretty \nplentiful, of a comely stature and countenance, of a piercing \nknowledge in many things, of a wonderful sweet and pleasant discourse.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith husband William, she settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in \n1635. Immediately the pair became involved in church life. Soon Mary \ntook sides in the big religious controversy of Boston, the so-called \nantinomian (against-the-law) movement led by Anne Hutchinson. \nHutchinson advocated Spirit-filled living (and a freer church) as \nopposed to a lifeless works-based system. When colony leaders \nexcommunicated Hutchinson, Dyer rose and walked out with her. \nMeanwhile Dyer miscarried a deformed and stillborn child. Boston \nleaders exhumed the corpse, examined it and declared that its defects \nindicated Dyers spiritual deformity. Their descriptions suggest \nanencephaly (water on the brain) and spina bifida (improperly formed \nspinal column).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1638, the Dyers moved to Rhode Island where religious freedom was \nnot only permitted but prized. William Dyer became a leader in the \nnew colony. In 1650, Mary sailed to England leaving behind William \nand their six children. She became interested in the Seekers, \ndisaffected English Christians who were seeking truth outside formal \nchurches. William joined her in England either later that year or in \n1651. When he returned to Rhode Island in 1653, Mary remained in \nEngland. Her association with the Seekers led her to Quaker founder \nGeorge Fox. She became a Quaker around 1654 and did not return to \nAmerica until 1657.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnaware that Boston had outlawed Quakers, she landed there. For ten \nweeks she languished in jail, not permitted to communicate with \nanyone. She smuggled a letter to William who arranged her release, \ncalling her conditions worse than hogs and dogs. Soon afterward, \nNew Haven expelled Mary; she had gone to Connecticut to spread the \nnew doctrines there. She wasnt done with Boston either. Like other \nQuakers, she felt obliged to look the bloody law in the face.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo visit Boston took courage. Puritans added penalty to penalty \nagainst Quakers. Among the cruelties heaped upon them were \nstarvation, exposure in the stocks and the pillory, whipping, fines, \nimprisonment, branding, mutilation (which could include having the \ntongue bored with red-hot instruments and ears cropped), seizure of \nproperty, banishment, or death. Persecutors paraded Quaker women in \npublic stripped to the waist, flogging their naked backs and chests.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1658, Dyer was jailed when she came to the support of friends. The \nfollowing year she was arrested a third time in Boston and sentenced \nto death. At the last minute, after making her watch the hangings of \ntwo Quakers, authorities gave her a pre-planned reprieve. They \nordered her to leave Massachusetts, never to return. She then spent a \nfew months with friends on Shelter Island (near Long Island) where \nshe preached to colonists and Indians.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward, Mary Dyer returned to Boston. Arrested a fourth time, she \nwas sentenced to death. Given a final chance to renounce her faith, \nshe refused. Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord \nGod I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death. On this \nday, 1 June 1660, Boston leaders hanged Dyer. Loud drumming prevented \nthe crowd from hearing her final words, but a bystander reported she \nsaid, Yea, I have been in Paradise these several days and now I am \nabout to enter eternal happiness. Friends in Portsmouth, Rhode \nIsland, recorded the event (although they got the date wrong): She \nwas put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruil [cruel] \nhand as the martyrs were in Queen Marys time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer death is often credited with ending executions of Quakers in \nMassachusetts. Edward Burroughs described to King Charles the \ncolonial mistreatment of Quakers, likely mentioning her case, and \nCharles forbade Massachusetts from executing any more of the sect. He \ncommanded they be sent to England for disposition. However, \nMassachusetts authorities continued to whip Quakers until 1665.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "MAKING SENSE OF KOSHER LAWS",
    "words": "Making Sense of Kosher Laws\u0014\n Biblical Archaeology  July 06, 2024  \u0014\n\u0014\nSeder meal. The origins of Jewish dietary or kosher laws (kashrut) \nhave long been the subject of scholarly research and debate. \nRegardless of their origins, however, these age-old laws continue to \nhave a significant impact on the way many observant Jews go about \ntheir daily lives. One of the more well-known restrictions is the \ninjunction against mixing meat with dairy products. Not only do most \nJews who observe kashrut avoid eating any meat and milk products \ntogether, many also wait a certain amount of time30 minutes to a few \nhoursbetween eating meat and dairy.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything the foods touch must be kept completely separate. A fully \nkosher household, for example, might have two or more different sets \nof flatware, tableware and cooking ware for making and serving meat \ndishes separate from dairy-based dishes. Some families even use two \ndifferent dishwashers in order to maintain the separation. Outside \nthe house, some Jews keep kosher by eating only at kosher restaurants \nwhile others have no problem eating non-kosher foods, so long as they \nmaintain a kosher home.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what are some of the other laws of kashrut, and how are they to \nbe explained? Many of the dietary restrictions outlined in \nDeuteronomy and Leviticus prohibit the consumption of certain \nunclean animals that either dont chew their cud or dont have \ncloven hooves, such as pigs, camels and rabbits. Likewise, while the \nHebrew Bible permits the eating of fish with fins and scales, \nshellfish like lobsters and crabs are an abomination. Why were such \nseemingly innocuous physiological traits so objectionable to the \nearly Israelites?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne possible reason may be that the Israelites wanted some way to \ndistinguish themselves from their non-Hebrew neighbors. \nArchaeological excavations of Iron Age I sites in Israel have shown \nthat while pigs were a popular part of the Philistine diet, they were \nentirely absent from the herd-based economy of the Israelites. \nAccording to Ronald Hendel, such culinary distinctions soon became \ncodified markers of cultural identity, whereby the Philistine treat \nbecame an Israelite taboo.* Perhaps similar efforts to affirm \nIsraels uniqueness lay at the heart of other animal prohibitions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut according to kashrut, even permissible animals have to be \nprepared in a certain way in order to remain kosher. As explained in \nDeuteronomy 12:23-24, for example, the blood of a slaughtered animal \ncannot be ingested, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat \nthe life with the flesh. The Israelites, like many ancient peoples, \nbelieved that an animals blood carried the soul of the animal and \ntherefore should not be consumed.** Thus, before a piece of meat \ncould be cooked, it had to be fully drained of its blood. Though not \ndiscussed in the Bible, traditional kosher methods for doing this \ninclude broiling the meat or a combination of soaking and salting.\u0014\n\u0014\nKosher law also forbids the consumption of wine that has been made, \nbottled or handled by non-Jews. Although this prohibition does not \nappear in the Hebrew Bible, it seems to have been followed as early \nas the second century A.D. In antiquity, wine was often used in \nlibation rituals to various deities; for Jews this meant that any \npagan wine could potentially have been made or used as a sacrifice \nto a foreign god. Thus, in order to avoid coming into contact with \ncontaminated wine, Jews began making and bottling their own wine in \naccordance with Jewish law.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotes\u0014\n*Ronald S. Hendel, Of Sacred Leopards and Abominable Pigs, Bible \nReview, October 2000.\u0014\n\u0014\n**Bryan Bibb, Whats a Pleasing Sacrifice? Bible Review, October \n2004.\u0014",

Nineteen of them  14 women and five men  were hanged, \nfive died in jail, and one man was pressed to death with stones after \nrefusing to enter a plea. The confusion stems from the fact that \nthose found guilty of witchcraft in Europe (where it was treated as \nheresy) were burned at the stake. Burning was supposedly a way to \npurify the convict, and also as a threat to uncover conspiracies, \naccording to The Salem Witchcraft Trials: A Legal History author \nPeter Hoffer. Hanging them, meanwhile, was punitive.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth: Marie Antoinette Said Let Them Eat Cake\u0014\nIts gone down in history as one of the most out-of-touch quotes of \nall time  one that emblematized the last queen of Frances disregard \nfor her own people. Theres just one problem: Marie Antoinette never \nsaid it. The actual words in question, quils mangent de la \nbrioche, come from Jean-Jacques Rousseaus autobiographical book \nConfessions, in which he wrote: At length I remembered the last \nresort of a great princess who, when told that the peasants had no \nbread, replied: Then let them eat brioches.That passage was \nwritten in 1765, at which time Marie Antoinette was still a child and \nhad yet to step foot in the country she helped rule from 1774 until \nthe French monarchy was abolished in 1792, a year before her \nexecution. After accidentally stepping on the executioners foot, she \nspoke her last words, which were considerably more polite than the \nquote so often attributed to her: Pardon me, sir, I did not do it on \npurpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth: Napoleon Was Short\u0014\nDespite having a certain complex named after him, Napoleon Bonaparte \nwas of average height for his time. Part of the confusion stems from \nthe nickname Le Petit Caporal, which makes him sound little but \nwas actually a term of endearment among his troops. Theres also the \nfact that inches were measured differently in 19th-century France \nthan they are today. The former was equivalent to 2.71 centimeters, \nwhereas the current measurement is 2.35 centimeters, which explains \nwhy he was only considered 5 feet, 2 inches tall when he died. Most \nestimates put him closer to 5 feet, 6 inches or 5 feet, 7 inches  \nnot exactly a towering figure, but average or slightly above average \nby 18th-century standards.\u0014\n\u0014\nMyth: Albert Einstein Failed Math\u0014\nThough its often cited as evidence of his humble beginnings, \nEinstein didnt actually fail math. I never failed in mathematics, \nEinstein said in 1935 when presented with a Ripley's Believe It or \nNot! headline claiming he had. Before I was 15 I had mastered \ndifferential and integral calculus. The anecdote is often retold to \ninspire the rest of us not to let early setbacks deter us from \nchasing our dreams and reaching our full potential  a worthy \nsentiment to be sure, just not one supported by the evidence in this \ncase.\u0014",

    "title": "MAN 'O WAR CAME CLOSE TO PERFECTION",
    "words": "Man o' War \ncame close to perfection\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Larry Schwartz\u0014\nSpecial to ESPN.com\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen thoroughbred racing needed a boost, Man o' War unleashed his \nblazing speed and came to the rescue. Though he competed for only two \nyears, he energized a reeling sport. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a Thickness to Man o' War that probably came from his \nvoracious appetite.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet's look at the world of racing that Man o' War entered in 1919: \nRacing in New York had been eliminated in 1911 and 1912 because of \nantigambling legislation led by Gov. Charles Hughes. Other states had \ntaken up Hughes' crusade. Many stables had folded and some of the \nbigger ones had moved to Europe. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile racing was legalized again in 1913, World War I soon dominated \nthe public's attention. Attendance and purses were at record lows \nwhen Man o' War made his debut on June 6, 1919.\u0014\n \u0014\nBy the time he retired 16 months later, he was a national hero, \njoining Babe Ruth as the first shining stars of the Roaring Twenties. \nThe charismatic horse's popularity had brought fans back to the \ntrack. \u0014\n\u0014\nMan o' War went to the post 21 times and won 20 races. He won one \nrace by an incredible 100 lengths and triumphed in another carrying \n138 pounds. He whipped a Triple Crown champion by seven lengths in a \nmatch race. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe brought international recognition to Kentucky breeders and made \nthe United States the racing center of the world. When he retired, he \nheld five American records at different distances and had earned more \nmoney than any thoroughbred. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a mid-century Associated Press poll, he was overwhelmingly voted \nthe greatest thoroughbred of the first half of the 20th century. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did Man o' War perform like a superstar on the track, the \nchestnut-colored horse (though he was nicknamed \"Big Red\") looked \nlike one. At 3, he was a strapping 16.2 hands (about 5-foot-6) and \nweighed about 1,125 pounds with a 72-inch girth. His appetite also \nwas huge, as he ate 12 quarts of oats every day, or about three \nquarts more than the average racehorse. He ran in big bounds as well, \nwith his stride measuring an incredible 25 to 28 feet. \u0014\n\u0014\nBred by August Belmont II, son of the founder of Belmont Park and for \nwhom the Belmont Stakes was named, the future champion was foaled on \nMarch 29, 1917 at Nursery Stud near Lexington, Ky. His sire was Fair \nPlay and his dam was Mahubah, the daughter of Rock Sand, the 1903 \nwinner of Britain's version of the Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, \nthe Epsom Derby and the St. Leger). He was 15 generations removed \nfrom the Godolphin Arabia, one of three Arab and Barb stallions \nconsidered to be the founders of the thoroughbred line. \u0014\n\u0014\nOriginally, Belmont's wife named the horse My Man o' War, after her \nsoldiering husband, who was stationed in France during World War I, \nbut the \"My\" was later dropped. \u0014\n\u0014\nBelmont's military involvement prompted him to sell his entire 1917 \nyearling crop. Sportsman Samuel Riddle, owner of the Glen Riddle \nFarm, was the beneficiary of this decision. Accepting the judgment of \ntrainer Louis Feustel, Riddle purchased the rangy colt, who seemed \ntoo large for a yearling, for $5,000 at the Saratoga yearlings' \nsales. \"As soon as I saw him, he simply bowled me over,\" Riddle said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the beginning, Man o' War's aversion to the bridle and saddle \ncaused problems. \"He's nice and he's smart, but don't ever try to \nforce him or you'll come out second best every time,\" a stable boy \nsaid. \"Ask him and he'll do what you want. Push him and it's all \noff.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nUnder Feustel's training, patience paid off, and the energy of Man o' \nWar was harnessed. His debut, in a five-furlough maiden race against \nsix other 2-year-olds at Belmont, was no contest. The fans reportedly \nscreamed and pounded the rail as jockey Johnny Loftus tightened the \nreins at the stretch, slowing Man o' War to a virtual canter. But the \nhorse still won by six lengths. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"He made half-a-dozen high-class youngsters look like $200 horses,\" \nwrote the turf editor of the New York Morning Telegraph. \u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing his smashing debut, Man o' War won three stakes races, at \nthree different New York tracks, in the next 17 days. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis winning streak was at six when Man o' War raced in the Sanford \nStakes at Saratoga on Aug. 13. It is Man O' War's most remembered \nrace -- because it is the only one he would lose. \u0014\n\u0014\nStarting gates were not yet used, and horses were led up a tape \nbarrier. A fill-in starter had difficulty getting the horses ready \nand they milled around. While Man o' War apparently was backing up, \nthe tape was sprung. Man o' War \"was almost left at the post,\" the \nLouisville Courier-Journal reported. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a slow start, Man o' War was third as the field headed for home \nin the six-furlough race. Blocked by close quarters, he had to go to \nthe outside in the final eighth. Though he gamely made up ground, he \nmissed by a half-length of overtaking the winner, who at 115 pounds \ncarried 15 fewer pounds than the 11-20 favorite. The winner was \nnamed, rather appropriately, Upset. \u0014\n\u0014\nBig Red, who beat Upset in their six other meetings, finished the \nyear with easy victories in the Hopeful and Futurity, giving him nine \nvictories in 10 races. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1920, Man o' War won all 11 of his races, with Clarence Kummer \naboard nine times. Big Red didn't race in the Kentucky Derby because \nRiddle believed that a soft-boned 3-year-old should not have to run \n1 miles in early May. Instead, he set his sights on the Preakness \n(Man o' War held off an Upset charge to win) and Belmont (a 20-length \nvictory in a two-horse field). \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter winning the Travers against two horses at Saratoga, only one \ncolt challenged Man o' War in his next race. Well, it wasn't exactly \na challenge as Big Red, the 1-100 favorite, defeated Hoodwink by 100 \nlengths in the 1 5/8th-mile Lawrence Realization at Belmont Park. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe was 1-100 again in winning the Jockey Cup at Belmont Park, and \nthen he was saddled with the excessively high weight of 138 pounds \nfor the Potomac Handicap. After being a bit fractious at the post, he \nassumed command and won easily. \u0014\n\u0014\nMan o' War's last race was against Sir Barton, who in 1919 had become \nthe first to win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont. Like most \nmatch races, it was hardly competitive. At Kenilworth Park, in \nWindsor, Ontario, Man o' War won the $75,000 purse and $5,000 Gold \nCup by defeating the older Canadian-owned horse by seven lengths. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Riddle was informed that Man o' War would have to carry even \nmore than 138 pounds as a 4-year-old, he retired his horse to stud. \nMan o' War held American records for the fastest mile, 1 1/8 miles, 1 \n3/8 miles, 1 miles and 1 5/8 miles. His total earnings were \n$249,465, a record at the time. \u0014\n\u0014\nDon't feel sorry for Man o' War because he stopped racing so young. \nHe proved to be quite a stud. In 1926, his issue won $408,137, \nbreaking a 60-year-old record. Among his 386 registered foals were 64 \nstakes winners, including 1937 Triple Crown winner War Admiral, 1929 \nKentucky Derby winner Clyde Van Dusen and Battleship, the winner of \nthe 1938 Grand National Steeplechase in England. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1921, a Texas oil millionaire, William Waggoner, offered $500,000 \nfor Man o' War. Riddle turned him down, as he did when Waggoner \nincreased his offer again, first to $1 million and then a blank \ncheck. \"The colt is not for sale,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Man o' War spent most of his life in Kentucky, he never \nraced there. He died there, though, at the age of 30 of a heart \nattack on Nov. 1, 1947 in Lexington.\u0014",

    "words": "Maturity, Fathers\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent issue of the MovieMinistry.com newsletter, Marc Newman \ntalks about the recent movie Peter Pan: \"Historically, the same \nperson who plays the father of the Darling children also plays \nCaptain Hook. I always thought that joining the characters of father \nand Hook was a malicious attack on fathers, until I saw the latest \nversion of Peter Pan. In the film, Mrs. Darling tells her children \nthat their father is \"brave\" in a most particular way. Mr. Darling \nwas possessed of many potent desires and longings, but he chose to \nlay them aside in order to nurture and care for his wife and \nchildren. She says that he put his dreams in a drawer, and that they \ntake them out now and again to look at them  but the drawer is \ngetting harder and harder to close because of all the dreams that \nhave been stuffed inside. In Peter Pan, Hook is not the \ndisciplinarian Dad unveiled, but the father's undisciplined dreams \ngrown to full, cruel, self-serving stature outside the civilizing \ninfluence of maturity. The father has paid for this self-denial, and \nthe children have benefited by his sacrifice.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The meaning of the film strongly reflects the message of Scripture. \nWe are told that when we mature, we are to \"put away childish things\" \n(1 Cor. 13:11). And in earlier verses, those childish behaviors are \nspelled out: jealousy, arrogance, selfishness, prickliness, and love \nof sin (I Cor. 13: 4-6). In the same breath we are told that we must \nreceive the Kingdom of God \"like a child\" (Mark 10:15). I Cor. 13 \nalso explains those childlike qualities: kindness, rejoicing, belief, \nand hope (4-7). There is a tension between the childish and the \nchildlike that can only be resolved by maturity. While we are not to \nremain childish, we are to be childlike.\" (www.movieministry.com)\u0014",

    "words": "Marilyn \nManson Describes Hell on Earth\u0014\n\u0014\nBrian Warner once said:Initially I was drawn into the darker side of \nlife. But it's really just human nature. I started to learn that \neverything that's considered a sin is what makes you a human being. \nAll the seven deadly sins are man's true natureto be greedy, to be \nhateful, to have lust. Of course you have to control them; but if \nyou're made to feel guilty for being human, then you're going to be \ntrapped in a never-ending sin-and-repent cycle that you can't escape \nfrom, and you're going to be miserable. Ultimately you'll be living \nin your own hell. So there's no need to worry about going to hell, \nbecause hell will be on earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I don't agree with everything Brian Warner saysyou might know \nhim as Marilyn Mansonbut he says a couple of interesting things. He \nsays there's a certain naturalness to sin. He says feeling guilty for \nbeing human can lead to misery. He talks about a cycle of sin and \nshame many of us know something about. He's right when he says you \nhave to learn to control sin even though it feels so natural. I think \nhe's wrong in what he says about having hell on earth, because there \nare a lot of ways to experience a hell on earth. One is to be plagued \nby guilt and shame for sin, to live in what he called a never-ending \ncycle of sin and shame, but the other is to fail to control sin, to \nlet sin take over your life or take over our culture and our world.\u0014\n\u0014\nCitation: Brian McLaren, \"Sin 101: Why Sin Matters,\" Preaching Today \n#243\u0014",

On Tuesday, authorities released a \nfourth man, Robert Mnisi, 34, after he agreed to cooperate with the \nprosecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities have not filed formal charges against farm owner Mark \nScott-Crossley, 34, and two farm workers, whom The Associated Press \nidentified as Simon Mathebula and Richard Mathebula. Police await the \nresults of DNA tests on the remains, which could take several weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\nA judge Tuesday postponed a bail hearing for the men. The next \nscheduled hearing is March 30.\u0014\n\u0014\nMnisi said Tuesday that Scott-Crossley strangled Chisale and then \nordered him to throw the body to the lions at a breeding facility \nseveral miles from the farm where they were working. The farm laborer \nspoke to CNN from a holding cell before he was released.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Then he say to me, 'Doctor pick it up [Chisale's body] and throw it \nin the lions,' \" said Mnisi, who said Scott-Crossley put a gun to his \nhead when he objected. \"He say, 'Hey, if you don't want to listen to \nme, I'll shoot you. Get inside there.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\nScott-Crossley recently fired Chisale, and police said they think \nChisale was assaulted when he returned to the farm to collect his \npersonal belongings. Earlier, Chisale filed charges, accusing \nScott-Crossley of burning clothes the worker had left at the farm.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso in a holding cell, Scott-Crossley said Tuesday he welcomes the \nmedia attention the case is receiving.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So, you must follow it to the end so that once the truth is out, \nthere's no sweeping anything under the carpet,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2004 CNN.\u0014",

If \nby some miracle I beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it \nis not necessary to claw, whine meow, try to turn the knob, or get \nyour paw under the edge and try to pull the door open. I must exit \nthrough the same door I entered. (In addition, I have been using the \nbathroom for years..canine or feline attendance is not mandatory.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proper order is kiss me, then go smell the other dogs or cats' \nbutt. I cannot stress this enough. It would be such a simple change \nfor you.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo pacify you I have posted the following message on our front \ndoor.....\u0014\n\u0014\nRules for Non-pet owners who visit and like to complain about our \npets: \u0014\n\u0014\n1. They live here; you don't. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. If you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the \nfurniture. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. I like my pet better than I like most people. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. To you it's an animal. To me he and/or she is an adopted son \nand/or daughter who is short, hairy, walks on all fours and is speech \nchallenged.\u0014\nDogs and cats are better than kids. They eat less, don't ask for \nmoney all the time, are easier to train, usually come when called, \nnever drive your car, don't hang out with drug using friends, don't \ndrink or smoke, don't worry about buying the latest fashions, don't \nwear your clothes, don't need a gazillion dollars for college, and if \nthey get pregnant, you can sell the results.\u0014",

    "words": "Keep the joy of loving the poor and share this joy with all you meet. \nRemember works of love are works of Peace. God Bless you.\" \u0014\n- Mother Teresa \u0014\n\u0014\nBorn Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia, \nin the former Yugoslavia, she was the youngest of three children. In \nher teens, Agnes became a member of a youth group in her local pairsh \ncalled Sodality. Through her involvement with their activities guided \nby a Jesuit priest, Agnes became interested in missionaries. At age \n17, she responded to her first call of a vocation as a Catholic \nmissionary nun. She joined an Irish order, the Sisters of Loretto, a \ncommunity known for their missionary work in India. When she took her \nvows as a Sister of Loretto, she chose the name Teresa after Saint \nThrse of Lisieux. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn Calcutta, Sister Teresa taught geography and cathechism at St. \nMary's High School. In 1944, she became the principal of St. Mary's. \nSoon Sister Teresa contracted tuberculosis, was unable to continue \nteaching and was sent to Darjeeling for rest and recuperation. It was \non the train to Darjeeling that she received her second call -- \"the \ncall within the call\". Mother Teresa recalled later, \"I was to leave \nthe convent and work with the poor, living among them. It was an \norder. I knew where I belonged but I did not know how to get there.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1948, the Vatican granted Sister Teresa permission to leave the \nSisters of Loretto and pursue her calling under the jurisdiction of \nthe Archbishop of Calcutta. \u0014\n\u0014\nMother Teresa started with a school in the slums to teach the \nchildren of the poor. She also learned basic medicine and went into \nthe homes of the sick to treat them. In 1949, some of her former \npupils joined her. They found men, women, and children dying on the \nstreets who were rejected by local hospitals. The group rented a room \nso they could care for helpless people otherwise condemned to die in \nthe gutter. In 1950, the group was established by the Church as a \nDiocesan Congregation of the Calcutta Diocese. It was known as the \nthe Missionaries of Charity\u0014",

    "words": "Ali, Muhammad (boxer) (1942- ), American boxer, one of the greatest \nfighters in the history of the sport. Colorful, talented, and \nsometimes controversial, Ali entertained fans and intimidated \nopponents. His boxing style involved graceful footwork and powerful \njabs. He also became famous for bragging about himself, often in his \nown verse. Ali once described his skills by saying that he could \nfloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee. In 1978 he became the \nfirst boxer to win the world heavyweight championship title three \ndifferent times. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Greatest\u0014\n\u0014\nAli was born in Louisville, Kentucky. His birth name was Cassius \nMarcellus Clay, Jr., named after famed Kentucky abolitionist Cassius \nMarcellus Clay. Clay began boxing at the age of 12, after his bicycle \nwas stolen and a police officer suggested that he learn how to box. \nBy age 18 Clay had amassed an amateur record of 100 wins in 108 \nfights. This included six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, the 1959 \nInternational Golden Gloves heavyweight title, and a gold medal as \nthe light heavyweight champion at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, \nItaly.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter returning from the Olympics, Clay turned professional. He \nfought his first professional bout on October 29, 1960, and defeated \nTunney Hunsaker. As Clay continued to win over the next few years, he \nbecame more vocal about his successes, and he was given the nicknames \nLouisville Lip and Mighty Mouth. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1964 Clay had recorded 19 professional wins and had earned a \nchance to challenge heavyweight champion Sonny Liston. At 22 years \nold, Clay was considered a serious underdog. Nonetheless, he \npredicted that he would knock Liston out in the eighth round. Clay \nneeded even less time to make good on his claim. His jab-and-dance \ntechnique tired Liston, who failed to come out of his corner at the \nstart of the seventh round. Clay was crowned the new world \nheavyweight champion and proclaimed himself The Greatest.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1964 Clay converted to Islam, joined the Nation of Islam (see \nBlack Muslims), and assumed the name Muhammad Ali. In 1965 he \ndefended his title in a rematch against Liston, a bout that lasted \nonly 2 minutes 12 seconds. During the first round Ali caught Liston \nwith a hard blow, so quick that it was dubbed the phantom punch \nbecause few fans saw it. Liston fell, and although he regained his \nfeet before the count was finished, the referee ended the fight in \nAlis favor. Six months later Ali successfully defended his title \nagainst former champion Floyd Patterson. Ali retained his title with \nvictories in five more bouts before 1967.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Controversial Champion\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1967, in the middle of the Vietnam War, Ali refused to be inducted \ninto the United States Army on the grounds that he was a black Muslim \nminister and therefore a conscientious objector. He had thrust \nhimself into the middle of a period of volatility in American \nsociety. Ali was an outspoken African American at a time when the \ncountrys commitment to civil rights was being widely questioned. He \nwas also one of the most prominent conscientious objectors against \nthe war, which was attracting more and more protest. Ali was \nconvicted of draft evasion, and his popularity plummeted. Early in \n1967 he was stripped of his heavyweight title and the title was \ndeclared vacant. When he was subsequently banned from fighting in the \nUnited States, Ali filed a number of court appeals.\u0014\n\u0014\nAli was allowed to return to the ring in late 1970, but in his \nabsence Joe Frazier had taken the world heavyweight title. After \nthree years without a championship fight against a serious \ncompetitor, Ali entered the ring in March 1971 for a highly promoted \nbout with Frazier. Because both Ali and Frazier carried undefeated \nrecords, the bout was billed as The Fight of the Century. Ali lost \nthe 15-round battle, and Frazier retained his title. Later that year \nthe Supreme Court of the United States overturned Ali's draft evasion \nconviction.\u0014\n\u0014\nChampion Again\u0014\n\u0014\nAli faced Frazier again in January 1974 at Madison Square Garden in \nNew York City. Frazier had lost the heavyweight title to George \nForeman in 1973, and therefore both boxers were mounting major \ncomebacks. After the former champions battled for 12 rounds, Ali won \nby unanimous decision and gained the right to challenge Foreman for \nthe heavyweight title.\u0014\n\u0014\nAli and Foreman agreed to a bout to be held in Kinshasa, Zaire (now \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC). The match was dubbed by \nmany The Rumble in the Jungle, and it attracted worldwide \nattention. It was originally scheduled for early September 1974, but \nafter Foreman suffered a serious cut above his right eye during \ntraining the fight was delayed until late October. Ali used the extra \ntime to train in Kinshasa. He savored the media limelight, made \nfriends with locals, and challenged and taunted Foreman at press \nconferences and meetings. Despite Alis confidence, many believed \nthat he was past his prime and would fall to the younger opponent.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the fight began, observers were surprised by Alis strategy. In \nthe weeks leading up to the bout, he had loudly predicted that he \nwould beat Foreman with graceful footwork, taking advantage of his \nquickness to dance around Foreman. But his performance in the ring \nwas much different. Ali hugged the ropes and opened himself up to a \nbarrage of Foreman punches during the early rounds. Foreman became \nweary as the fight progressed, however, and Ali fought back with \nwell-placed, powerful punches. This successful technique was later \ndubbed rope-a-dope. A knockout in the eighth round secured Alis \nvictory and gained him his second world heavyweight title. The fight \nand the weeks leading up to it were captured in the film When We Were \nKings, which was released in 1996 and won an Academy Award for best \ndocumentary. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter defending his title against three different challengers early \nin 1975, Ali agreed to fight Frazier in Manila, Philippines, in \nOctober of that same year. Once again, Ali predicted victory. Before \n28,000 boxing fans and 700 million television viewers, Ali outlasted \nFrazier and defended his title in a brutal 15-round battle Ali called \nThe Thrilla in Manila.

After his boxing career ended, Ali donated \nmuch of his time to various charities and humanitarian missions \naround the world. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall \nof Fame in 1990, and in 1996 he was awarded the honor of lighting the \nOlympic torch in Atlanta, Georgia, to begin the Summer Olympic Games. \nAt the end of the century, many publications listed him as one of the \n20th centurys greatest and most influential athletes. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1984 Ali was first diagnosed with Parkinson syndrome, a medical \ncondition closely related to Parkinson disease. Symptoms include body \ntremors, slurred or difficult speech, rigid limbs, facial \nimmobilization, and other neurological problems. The disorder \nsometimes develops in boxers, because of the repeated blows to the \nhead they suffer over a long career. As the former champion coped \nwith the condition, he became a strong advocate for more research \nmoney for Parkinson disease and related conditions.\u0014",

    "title": "MUTILATING AFRICA'S DAUGHTERS:LAWS UNENFORCED, PRACTICES UNCHANGED",
    "words": "By TINA ROSENBERG\u0014\n\u0014\nJuly 5, 2004, NEW YORK TIMES\u0014\nEDITORIAL OBSERVER \u0014\n\u0014\nMariam Bagayoko was a powerful and respected person in Bamako, the \ncapital of Mali. Now she is shunned and criticized by many of her \nneighbors. Ms. Bagayoko used to perform what the West has come to \nknow as female genital mutilation, a practice inflicted on more than \n90 percent of girls in Mali. \u0014\nIn 1988, she began to get visits, sometimes twice a week, from \nKadidia Sidibe, the director of a Bamako women's group opposed to the \npractice. At first, Ms. Bagayoko hid when her visitor approached. But \nafter seven years, Ms. Sidibe's photos and videos of mutilated girls \nwith serious health problems finally persuaded her to stop. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday she runs a group of former circumcisers, as they are called in \nmuch of Africa, who talk to Mali's women in prenatal care clinics and \nat markets, and train teenagers to speak in schools. When she tries \nto convince women not to mutilate their daughters, Ms. Bagayoko says, \nshe may be accused of betraying their culture for Western money and \ndepriving girls of the chance to marry, thus condemning them to \npoverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this month in Nairobi, Kenya, Ms. Bagayoko met eight other \nformer circumcisers from various countries who now work against the \npractice. The meeting was organized by Equality Now, a New York-based \ngroup that finances African women's organizations that fight female \ngenital mutilation. At least 130 million women in Africa have been \ncircumcised, and two million more girls undergo the practice every \nyear in 28 African countries, mostly in the continent's north and \ncentral areas.\u0014\n\u0014\nFemale circumcision is just beginning to get attention in Africa, and \nabout 13 countries now punish the practice with jail terms. But with \nthe exception of Burkina Faso, where the government has vigorously \nenforced the laws, the laws are largely irrelevant. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven in some places where it is illegal, medical personnel perform \ncircumcisions in government hospitals. The only solution is to change \nattitudes on the village level, and that's where people like Ms. \nBagayoko come in.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout 15 percent of those who undergo genital mutilation, mainly \nwomen in the Horn of Africa, suffer the most dangerous and extreme \nversion, infibulation. Isnino Shuriye, who was also at the Nairobi \nmeeting, performed infibulations among the Somali community in \nnorthern Kenya. She would cut off the clitoris and all the labia of \n7-year-old girls. She would sew up the girls to be totally smooth, \nwith a pencil eraser-sized opening for menses and urine. Each girl's \nlegs were bound together for weeks so scars could form. Ms. Shuriye \nused no anesthetic.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll types of female circumcision have huge psychological and physical \ndangers. Some girls bleed to death during the operation, or die of \ntetanus or infection shortly after. But for infibulated women, the \ndangers are even greater. Many infibulated women suffer constant \ninfections and other health problems because urine and blood back up. \nTheir husbands must bring a knife to their wedding night to cut them \nopen. Childbirth often is fatal for infibulated women and their \nbabies, and their wounds make them much more vulnerable to the AIDS \nvirus.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the health problems that convinced Ms. Bagayoko never budged Ms. \nShuriye. Members of the group Womankind brought doctors to talk to \nher, but she felt that they were just trying to plant Western \nideologies. Ms. Bagayoko said that although many women suffer \ngynecological problems, \"people say it's because of bad spirits. It's \nnot attributed to the circumcision.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe practice damages girls in other ways. Sophia Noor of Womankind \nKenya says that many girls are so traumatized by the pain that they \nnever go back to school after they are circumcised. The economic and \nsocial effects of girls' leaving school by age 7 are incalculable.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite these problems, the practice thrives. Many Muslims, and not \nonly Muslims, believe uncut women to be dirty. Women who can feel \nsexual pleasure are considered impossible to control and so are \nunmarriageable. \"I know many families that have decided not to \ncircumcise their daughters,\" says Ms. Bagayoko. \"But they can't talk \nabout it openly lest their daughters be shunned.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne strategy that has proved effective is persuading religious \nleaders to dispel the widespread, erroneous belief that Islam calls \nfor circumcision.

    "words": "Standing before a joyful crowd packing St. Peter's square in November \n1950, Pope Pius XII declared \"that the Immaculate Mother of God, the \never Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, \nwas assumed body and soul to heavenly glory.\" By this proclamation \nthe pope defined belief in Mary's assumption into heaven as a dogma, \nor divinely revealed teaching, of the Catholic Church. However, \nbelief that Mary \"fell asleep\" at the end of her life and was \nmiraculously transported to heaven dates back to the early medieval \nchurch and has been a source of devotion for centuries in the \nCatholic and Orthodox traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Scripture reveals nothing about the manner of Mary's death, \ntraditions surrounding her life after Christ's resurrection soon \narose in the church. References to her dormition (literally \"falling \nasleep\") and assumption appear as early as the seventh century. In \nthe most famous account, St. John Damascene (d. 749) passed on a \nstory reportedly told at the Council of Chalcedon (451) that Mary had \ndied in the presence of the Apostles, but when they opened her tomb \nthey found it empty, \"wherefrom the Apostles concluded that the body \nwas taken up to heaven.\" By the end of the eighth century, feasts \ncelebrating Mary's dormition included prayers referring to her \nassumption as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary's bodily assumption into heaven has traditionally been \ncelebrated as the firstfruits of Christ's resurrection. Catholic and \nOrthodox believers affirm that because Mary was assumed body and soul \ninto heaven, she experiences the resurrected glory for which all \nChristians hope. Vatican II teaches that \"she shines forth on earth  \na sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrim people of God.\" Her \nassumption serves as a promise of the work that God will do for all \nbelievers, and as a reminder that resurrected humanity will be an \nuncorrupted union of body and soul.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe exact origin of the Feast of the Assumption is not known, but \nlike many Marian practices, it seems to have a very early beginning. \nCelebrated in Palestine before the year 500, probably in August, it \nwas also kept by the early Egyptian monks, though in January. The \n6th-century church in Gaul borrowed the feast, as it did many other \nthings, from the Eastern monks, again celebrating it in January. In \nthe Greek Church, some followed the monastic dating of January, \nothers the Palestinian dating of August. Finally Emperor Maurice (d. \n602) set the feast for the Greek Empire on 15 August. In the \nChristian West, the feast seems to have been adopted somewhat later, \nbut was observed as one of the principal festivities of Rome by the \ntime of Sergius I (700).\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "How do we know 10 of the disciples were martyred?\u0014\nSteven Gertz \u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we know that every apostle except John died for his faith, and \nare those sources reliable?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tradition of apostles' martyrdom goes back at least to the \nbeginning of the third century. In his third commentary on Genesis, \nOrigen of Alexandria (ca. 185-254) writes that the apostles divided \nup the work of evangelizing the world between themPeter, for \nexample, took Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bithynia, and at \"the \nlast came to Rome, and was crucified head-downwards; for he requested \nthat he might suffer thus.\" According to Origen, other apostles went \nelsewhere; Thomas was assigned Parthia (today's India), and John was \ngiven \"Asia.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nScholars debate as to where Origen picked up his informationsome \nargue that he drew from the roughly contemporary Acts of Thomas, an \napocryphal book relating Thomas' adventures as a missionary in India. \nThat book states that Jesus' original 11 disciples \"divided the \ncountries among them, in order that each one of them might preach in \nthe region which fell to him and in the place to which his Lord sent \nhim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there are other sources to consider as well. Eusebius (ca \n260-341) wrote perhaps the most complete history of the apostles, \nthough he merely quoted other bishops for his authority. Acts 12: 2 \ntells us, for example, that Herod Agrippa had James, the brother of \nJohn, executed. To this, Eusebius adds the story told by the bishop \nClement of Alexandria (d. ca. 215)Origen's mentorthat \"the person \nwho led James to the judgment-seat was moved when he saw him bear \nwitness, and confessed that he himself was also a Christian.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOr take the death of Philip, which bishop Polycrates of Ephesus \n(130-196)again via Eusebiuswrote that Philip \"has fallen asleep in \nHierapolis, [as have] also his two daughters who grew old in \nvirginity.\" It's debatable whether Polycrates actually meant Philip \nwas martyred, since he also mentions that the apostle John \"has \nfallen asleep at Ephesus.\" (Tradition has it that John died \npeacefully in his old age, after being returned from his exile in the \nisland of Patmos.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAre these sources reliable? Can Christians stand on the testimony of \nthese early church fathers to make the case for these martyrdoms? We \ncan, if we accept that in the first couple centuries of the church, \nmuch of the Christian story was passed on by word-of-mouth, and \nbishops of the church would guard these stories zealouslyespecially \nwith heretical sects threatening the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n*If you're looking for brief summaries of the apostles' missionary \njourneys and martyrdoms, check out The Martyr's Mirror, a \n17th-century Mennonite panorama of Christian martyrs.\u0014",

    "words": "'Moral Values' Tops Voters' ConcernsBut What Does It Mean?\u0014\nSexual morality probably trumped social justice concerns, say \nobservers.\u0014\nBy Kevin Eckstrom and Michele M. Melendez, Religion News Service | \nposted 11/04/2004 9:15 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTONForget Iraq. Forget terrorism. Forget the economy. The \nbiggest factor shaping people's votes Tuesday (Nov. 2) was the mother \nof all sleeper issues\"moral values.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn nationwide exit polls, one in five voters said moral values were \nthe most important issue in casting their votes, outpacing every \nother major topic. Those \"values\" voters overwhelmingly went for \nPresident Bush over Sen. John Kerry, 79 percent to 18 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stronger-than-expected role of moral values signals that the \nnation's values agenda is likely to be dominated by \"social morality\" \nconcerns for abortion, gay marriage, and stem-cell researchissues \nvital to Bush's base. The election also marks a defeat for \nprogressive groups who tried to cast \"social justice\" concerns of \npoverty, war, and the environment as moral issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nEither way, Jim Wallis, a self-described progressive evangelical, \nsaid neither blue states nor red states should try to claim a corner \non the values market.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The right wants to say these are the only moral values, the left \nwants to say only our issues are moral values,\" said Wallis, convener \nof the Washington-based Call to Renewal anti-poverty group. \"The \ntruth is there are moral values across the spectrum.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJust how did values become so important, especially in a race \ndominated by terrorist threats at home and abroad? Wallis faulted the \nDemocrats for a self-inflicted wound on abortion. Kerry's party \nalienated values-driven voters who could have been wooed by his \ndomestic policies but could not stomach his party's ardent support of \nabortion rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Ohio, for example, where moral values ranked second (behind the \neconomy), Kerry lost among Catholics 55 percent to 44 percent, which \nmay have been enough to swing the crucial state into Bush's column. \nWallis said a \"more sensible, reasonable and centrist\" policy on \nabortion could have helped Kerry, especially within his own church.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There are millions of votes at stake in that Democratic mistake,\" he \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nConservatives, meanwhile, say the winning formula was a simple one. \nBush's embrace of socially conservative values rallied his \nevangelical base, who turned out in record force for him at the polls.\u0014\n\u0014\nPart of what got them there, at least in some states, were \nconstitutional amendments to ban gay marriage. Voters who did not \nfavor legal recognition for gay couples broke for Bush by a 2-1 ratio.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can tell you this,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the \nWashington-based Family Research Council, a conservative group. \"It \nwas the values voter that ushered the president down the aisle for a \nsecond term.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nValues voters were not sequestered in Bush's solid red states. Ohio \nwas narrowly propelled into Bush's column by the 85 percent of voters \nwho ranked values as the second-most important issue. In Iowa, a \nsought-after swing state, 87 percent of values voters went for Bush. \nAnd in Wisconsin, where Kerry eeked out a close win, 82 percent of \nthose whose decision was guided by moral values voted for President \nBush.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reason why values may have emerged as so important is because \npollsters did not survey the topic four years ago. John Green, an \nexpert on religion and politics at the University of Akron, said \n\"moral values\" can mean different things to different voters. But \ntypically, \"When ordinary people think of morality, they think of \ntraditional sexual morality.  They don't think of social justice.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, other factors such as record-breaking voter registration \nand anti-war sentiment drew voters to the polls. But if \nvalues-oriented voters dominated the pack, Bush had a clear advantage \nbecause many of those values are reinforced when those same voters \npack churches on Sunday mornings.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the exit polls, Bush won handily among frequent \nchurch-goers, and pulled even with Kerry among people who attend once \na month or less. Bush drew 60 percent of weekly attenders, compared \nto Kerry's 39 percent, while Kerry led Bush among non-church-goers, \n64 percent to 34 percent.\u0014\n\u0014\nBush drew 75 percent of white evangelicals, 58 percent of Protestants \nand 24 percent of Jews, a slight rise from 2000. Kerry had 41 percent \nof Protestants and 76 percent of Jews. The exit polls, conducted by \nEdison Media Research and Mitofsky International for major media \norganizations, did not include Muslim voters.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the coveted Catholic vote, Bush held a slight edge nationally \nover Kerry, 51 percent to 48 percent. Richard Land, president of the \nSouthern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said \nKerry's arms-length relationship with his church came back to haunt \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Kerry said, `I will have a secular government, I will not allow my \nCatholic values to interfere with my public policy,\"' Land said. \"The \npresident said, `I'm a man of faith and my faith will impact my \npublic policy' and  the American people took Bush's vision over \nKerry's.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile Bush's values agenda seems mostly clear cut, the thornier \nquestion is what lies ahead for two groups who struggled to employ \nreligious language to shape the values debateDemocrats and religious \nprogressives.\u0014\n\u0014\nGreen, for one, said the challenge for Kerry's party is to develop a \nlanguage of faith that appeals to values-minded voters. \"One of the \nlessons to the Democratic Partythey need to explore the social \njustice issues and their connections to faith,\" Green said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWallis, who pushed Kerry to talk more openly about how his faith \naffects his policies, said it came as \"too little, too late.\" He also \nsaid the Democrats need to confront their own inner demons.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The secular fundamentalism of the left is as much a problem as the \nreligious fundamentalism of the right,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdelle M.

    "words": "Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, the 7th Marquess of \nLondonderry, stood at the forefront of Britains social and political \nworld in the 1930s. Married to the leading light of Londons social \nscene, cousin to Winston Churchill, and confidant of the King, \nLondonderry served as Secretary of State for Air from 1931 until his \ndismissal in 1935. The owner of vast coal fields and landed estates, \nLord Londonderry was one of Britains grandest aristocrats at a time \nwhen one-tenth of one percent of the population owned almost a third \nof the nations wealth.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, in his own words, this scion of the establishment backed the \nwrong horse, supporting Adolf Hitler and advocating a policy of \nfriendship with Germanys Nazi Party. Ruined by his disastrous \npolitical and moral miscalculations and widely viewed as Hitlers \nleading British apologist, Londonderry, the only Cabinet member to \nadvocate such views, suffered a final irony when the Luftwaffe \ndestroyed his magnificent London home during the Blitz.\u0014\n\u0014\nA leading expert on Nazism\u0014\n\u0014\nDrawing on Londonderrys extensive correspondence with family, \nfriends, and colleaguessome 10,000 letters in allas well as from \nhis own remarkable scholarship, Ian Kershaw, the definitive \nbiographer of Adolf Hitler, illuminates this controversial figure and \nthe Anglo-German milieu in which he became infamous. In the process, \nKershaw reveals the wide support, both in and out of aristocratic \ncircles, Londonderrys ideas enjoyed, and precisely how he ended up \nas the scapegoat for a position far more popular than anyone would \nlike to acknowledge today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lure of appeasement\u0014\n\u0014\nLondonderry, Kershaw writes, had no truck with the fanatical \nFascists, wide-eyed cranks and mystics who fell for Hitler lock, \nstock and barrel. Instead, he believed that only friendship with \nGermany could secure global peace. There were really only two things \nI could do, Londonderry later claimed, build an Air Force, or try \nto make friends with the Germans. They wouldnt let me do either. As \nKershaw shows, however, friendly ties with Germany quickly took \nprecedence, leading directly to Londonderrys break with Churchill.\u0014\n\u0014\nArtfully written and based on his trademark mastery of both archival \nand printed sources, Ian Kershaw has again produced a dazzlingly \noriginal study of Nazi ideology and the men who followed it. Fans of \nKershaws monumental work on Hitler wont want to miss this brilliant \naddition to the literature on World War II. 384 PAGES\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Ian Kershaw has taught at the University of \nManchester, at the Ruhr University in Bochum, West Germany, at the \nUniversity of Nottingham, and since 1989 has been Professor of Modern \nHistory at the University of Sheffield. He is the author, most \nrecently, of the definitive biography of Hitler.

    "title": "MARY AT THE CROSS",
    "words": "Mary at the Cross\u0014\nFrom three little verses in John has come a rich tradition of song \nand art.\u0014\nBy Patrick Henry Reardon\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with Gabriel's Annunciation to Mary (Luke 1:26-38), her \nVisitation to Elizabeth (1:39-56), and Jesus' birth and infancy \n(2:7,16; Matthew 2:11), one other biblical scene depicting the mother \nof Jesus is especially prominent in the history of Christian art: \nJesus' death on the cross (John 19:25-27).\u0014\n\u0014\nAlone among the evangelists, it is John who informs us that \"standing \nby the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary \nthe wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and \nthe disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \n'Woman, behold, your son!' Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, \nyour mother!' And from that hour the disciple took her to his own \nhome\" (ESV).\u0014\n\u0014\nTender meditations\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries this scene of immense tenderness immediately \npreceding the death of Jesus has inspired, not only many Byzantine \nikons, works of statuary beyond count, and numerous paintings in \nevery generation, but also a wealth of hymns penned and sung by \nChristians in both East and West. The poetry and imagery of these \ndiverse hymns share the common purpose of bringing the Christian \nimagination into a vivid awareness of the pain and dereliction of \nJesus' mother standing by his cross, as he entrusts her to the care \nof \"the disciple whom he loved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat has prompted Christians to think so long and lovingly on this \ntheme?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe emotional impulse to dwell on the sorrow of Jesus' mother at the \nfoot of the Cross had its root in the very love symbolized by the \nCross. Simply put, Jesus died because he loved us. And such \nsacrificial love elicited a responding love from the believing heart. \nChristian emotional response to the sufferings of Jesus, then, has \ntraditionally been deep and abiding. We sense this in the devout \ntenderness of Paul's assertion, \"I have been crucified with Christ. \nIt is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life \nI now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved \nme and gave himself for me\" (Gal. 2:20 ESV). Paul was one of the \nfirst of those Christians who, from the very beginning, have \ndemonstrated a sustained, overwhelming disposition to \"survey the \nwondrous Cross where the young Prince of Glory died.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have always known, of course, that the victory of the \nCross is inseparable from the Lord's Resurrection. They have never \nbeen in doubt that Jesus was \"raised for our justification.\" Yet, \ntheir warmest sentiments have traditionally been directed to the \nharsher fact that He \"was delivered up for our offenses\" (Romans \n4:25). From the beginning, that is to say, they were disposed to \ndwell in imagination, distress, and deep empathy on the thought of \nwhat Jesus endured on their behalf. Even his wounds were treasured, \nbecause He \"Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that \nwe, having died to sin, might live for righteousnessby whose stripes \nyou were healed\" (1 Peter 2:24).\u0014\n\u0014\nEntering the sorrowful scene\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat did this sort of reaction look like in the early church? We have \nan answer from the eyewitness account of the nun Egeria, a pilgrim \nfrom Gaul who recorded her experience of the Good Friday services in \nJerusalem probably held around 381-4:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The entire time from the sixth to the ninth hour is occupied by \npublic readings. They all concern the things that Jesus suffered; \nfirst they have the psalms on this theme, then the Apostolic Epistles \nand Acts which deal with it, and finally the passages from the \nGospels. In this way they read the prophecies about what the Lord was \nto suffer, and then the Gospels about what He did suffer. Thus do \nthey continue the readings and hymns from the sixth to the ninth \nhour, showing to all the people by the witness of the Gospels and the \nwritings of the Apostles that the Lord actually suffered everything \nthe prophets had foretold. They teach the people, then, for these \nthree hours, that nothing which took place had not been foretold, and \nall that was foretold was completely fulfilled. Dispersed among these \nreadings are prayers, all fitting to the day. It is impressive to see \nthe way all the people are moved by these readings, and how they \nmourn. You could hardly believe how every single one of them weeps \nduring those three hours, old and young together, because of the way \nthe Lord suffered for us\" (The Travels of Egeria, 37).\u0014\n\u0014\nIf such were their own emotions when they pondered the price of their \nsalvation, it is no wonder that Christians were also disposed to take \nnote of the internal suffering of Jesus' mother. When they found \nthemselves in devout imagination at the foot of the Cross, it was \nimpossible that they would not observe the mourning mother who stood \nthere with them. If they themselves wept (for three hours, said \nEgeria!) at the vivid remembrance of Jesus' suffering, how could they \nnot take note of the sorrows of Mary? In any case, it is an \nhistorical fact that they did. The history of Christian art testifies \nto the fact in great abundance. Among the four canonical evangelists, \nJohn's Gospel dominates traditional portrayals of the scene on \nCalvary. When paintings and statuary portray sorrowing figures \ngathered at the foot of the Cross, these figures are invariably the \nones listed in John's Gospel, which alone records the presence of \nJesus' mother and \"the disciple whom Jesus loved.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\" stood the mother, weeping\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's account also dominates the hymns both East and West that deal \nwith the crucifixion. And so here, too, Mary is prominent. Compared \nto the East, Western hymnody on the theme of Mary's sorrow at the \nsufferings of Jesus is sparse, with the one notable exception being \nthe immensely popular Stabat Mater. It is nearly impossible to \nexaggerate the fervor and devotion this hymn has inspired since it \nwas first sung in the 14th century.\u0014\n\u0014\nComposed in three-line segments (terza rima), the hymn establishes \nits theme in the first of its nineteen stanzas: Stabat Mater \ndolorosa/ Juxta crucem lacrimosa/ Dum pendebat Filius, commonly \nparaphrased as \"At the cross her station keeping/ Stood the mournful \nmother weeping/ Close to Jesus to the last.\" Through the subsequent \nstanzas the hymn keeps repeating the same theme, meditating on the \nsword that Simeon predicted would pierce the heart of Mary. The hymn \nthen beseeches Mary herself, \"Let me share with thee his pain/ Who \nfor all my sins was slain/ Who for me in torments died.\" As though to \nidentify its singers with that beloved disciple who stood beside her \nat the cross, the hymn addresses Mary as \"mother.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe observe in these lines the same impulses Egeria had described \n1,000 years earlier: a strong, emotive appreciation of Christ's love \nas he died in torment and a craving to be united to that love (\"let \nme share\") in personal devotion. This is how Christians traditionally \ninterpreted Paul's assertion, \"I have been crucified with Christ. It \nis no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough its ascription to the leader of the strict Franciscan \n\"Spirituals,\" Jacopone (\"Crazy Jim\") da Todi (1230?1306?), is \ndubious, the Stabat Mater does seem to have been particularly popular \namong his fellow Franciscans. We find it in several missals (Mass \nbooks) of the 14th century, and in 1727 the hymn appears for the \nfirst time in the Roman Breviary (the daily prayerbook for monks and \nclerics), where it is assigned to a special liturgical feast \ninstituted at Rome that year, The Feast of Mary's \"Seven Sorrows.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOutside of that limited liturgical usage, the Stabat Mater is perhaps \nmore often sung as part of the popular practice of the Way of the \nCross, a devotional service that traces the path of Jesus' sufferings \nthrough fourteen \"stations\" (stopping places) from Pilate's tribunal \nall the way to Jesus' grave. Following the prayers and meditations \nassociated with each of these \"stations,\" it has long been customary \nto sing a stanza or so of the Stabat Mater. Indeed, since that hymn \nwas removed from the Roman Mass by the liturgical reforms of Vatican \nII, it is likely that many Catholics do not often sing it any more \noutside of the Way of the Cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nHymns of the Christian East also dwell tenderly on Mary's presence at \nthe foot of the cross. In the East, however, this image of Mary \nbeside the cross is usually woven into the larger story of the Lord's \npassion, rather thanas in the Westisolated in individual hymns. \nProbably the best examples of this thematic weaving are to be found \nin the \"Lamentations\" sung in the Byzantine rite of Matins (morning \nprayer) for Holy Saturday, though by long custom it is invariably \nchanted on the night of Good Friday. In this lengthy liturgical \nservice (lasting three hours and more in an average Orthodox \ncongregation), these Lamentations set the tone.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough this lengthy hymn (185 stanzas!) does not directly address \nthe mother of Jesus, it repeatedly describes her sorrow, dwelling on \nher wrenching empathy with the sufferings of her Son. We find such \nlines as \"Thy virgin mother mourned, sighing 'Woe is me, O Light of \nthe world! Woe is me, mine Illumination! O most beloved Jesus,'\" and \n\"Thy pure mother, O Savior, in thy death lamented with thee \nmourning,\" and \"The virgin mother, the bride of God, cried out: 'Who \nwill give me the water for tears, that I may weep for my sweet \nJesus.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hour, the Glory, and the Woman\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch riches of music and art, all inspired by three little verses in \nthe Gospel according to John. What, we may ask, was in John's own \nmind as he wrote about Mary at the cross of her son?\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us step back to another scene near the beginning of John's \ngospel; namely, the wedding feast of Cana (John 2:1-12). These two \nportrayals, both found only in John among the evangelists, have \nseveral things in common. First, Mary does not appear in John's \nGospel outside of these two places. Second, in both places she is \ncalled only \"the mother of Jesus\" and never named. Third, in each \ninstance Jesus addresses his mother as \"Woman\" (gyne). Fourth, in \nboth cases a \"new family\" is formedin the first scene by the wedding \nitself, and in the second scene by a kind of adoption, in which the \nbeloved disciple \"took her to his own home.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's \"mother of Jesus\" does play an important part near the \nbeginning of his account of the Lord's ministry, in \"the first of his \nsigns,\" wherein he \"manifested his glory\" at Cana (John 2:11). In the \ndialogue leading up to this manifestation, Jesus seems at first to \nbridle at his mother's hint that he relieve the shortage of wine at \nthe wedding feast. He explains to her, \"My hour has not yet come\" \n(2:4). These words closely tie this scene at Cana to the scene at the \ncross later on. When the \"hour\" of the passion does finally come, it \nwill once again be in reference to the manifestation of Jesus' glory: \n\"Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also \nglorify you\" (John 17:1). John uses similar language of Jesus' \nmother, telling us that it was \"from that hour the disciple took her \nto his own home\" (19:27). When the hour arrives for the King to be \nidentified upon the throne of the cross (19:19), John is the only one \nof the evangelists to speak of the King's mother (p. 38) standing \nbeside it (19:26).\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother feature linking John's depictions of Cana and the cross is \nthe word \"woman,\" by which Jesus addresses his mother in both places. \nThough this bare expression strikes the modern ear as impolite, \nperhaps even harsh, it was in fact a formal and decorous way for \nwomen to be addressed in biblical times (see, for example, Matthew \n15:28; Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 20:13).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary the symbol of the church\u0014\n\u0014\nIn John's Gospel the word \"woman,\" gyne, seems especially \nsignificant. Besides at Cana and at the Cross, the Lord elsewhere \nuses this same word \"woman\" to portray the coming \"hour\" of His own \npassion: \"When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her \nhour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer \nremembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into \nthe world\" (John 16:21 ESV). This sorrow of the childbearing \"woman\" \nis likened to the sorrow experienced by the disciples of Jesus at his \ncoming passion: \"I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the \nworld will rejoice.  but I will see you again and your hearts will \nrejoice, and no one will take your joy from you\" (16:20, 22 ESV). The \n\"woman\" facing the hour of the Lord's passion, then, is identified \nwith the Messianic congregation itself, rather as we find in chapter \n12 of the Book of Revelation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the community of faith can symbolize the mother of the Messiah, \nthen the physical mother of the Messiah can certainly symbolize the \ncommunity of faith. Indeed, this symbolic development is hardly \nsurprising. The mother of Jesus, after all, is portrayed in much of \nthe New Testament as the model Christian. According to Luke, she \n\"kept all these things and pondered them in her heart\" (Luke 2:19 \nNKJV). She declared herself \"the maidservant of the Lord,\" eager for \nGod's will to be accomplished in her life (1:38 NKJV). Indeed, in the \nwhole New Testament she is the first to speak of \"God my Savior\" \n(1:47). If all Christians feel in their depths the love of Christ \npoured out for them upon the Cross, would this not be supremely true \nof his mother who stood in faith beside it?\u0014\n\u0014\nConsequently, John places the mother of Jesus within the company of \nChristian believers, herself even serving as a sign and symbol of \nthat community. Luke, we recall, portrays Mary in the midst of the \nchurch in the upper room, awaiting the coming of the Holy Spirit \n(Acts 1:14). John for his part depicts her within that even smaller \nchurch gathered beside the cross to bear witness to the Lord's \nredemptive death, clinging there to the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" \nand who now takes her into his own home. Together they both bear \nwitness as Jesus, \"bowing his head, handed over the Spirit\" \n(paredoken to Pneuma19:30).\u0014\n\u0014\nThat scene has haunted generations of believers since the church's \nbirth. Through song and art, worshippers have entered the deep sorrow \nof Mary and the beloved disciple, and bathed with them in the blood \nand water that flow forever from his sacred side.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry Reardon is a senior editor of Touchstone: A Journal of \nMere Christianity (www.touchstonemag.com).\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

When evening set in and he had not yet \nreturned, the family became alarmed and called the local police.\u0014\n\u0014\nSearch efforts became frantic as the night drew on and a severe storm \nblew in.  The family, the police and rescue teams continued without \nsuccess, slowly beginning to fear the worst.  The hunt lasted for 12 \nhours through the night and into the following morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen on Saturday, Francisco's uncle was amazed to find the boy \ncompletely unharmed, warm and totally dry.  The three dogs had lain \non top of him while he slept and protected him from the rain and wind \nof the stormy night in the mountains.\u0014\n\t\u0014\n\u0014\nRescuers were equally shocked but not entirely surprised that the \ndogs had saved the boy.  Two of the three dogs are Catalan Shepherd \ndogs, bred to herd and look after flocks of sheep.  A spokesperson \nfor the Portuguese League of Animals explains, \"Once a dog becomes \npart of the family, it knows its place and loyally guards the \nchildren.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps not far from the scene of this drama is a region of Portugal, \nSephardi, where the occidental branch of European Jews once settled.  \nOld Ladino texts impart the wisdom of this tribe in many proverbs, \nsuch as: \"The greater love is a mother's, then comes a dog's, then a \nsweetheart's.\"\u0014",

    "words": "\u0014\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina two sports were all the rage in New \nOrleans. One was the blame game, attributing all local and state \nincompetence to the feds. The other was inventing and spreading \nstories of murder and mayhem -- killings, rapes, firing at rescuers, \nbodies stacked like cordwood. \u0014\nBut the accounts turned out to be grim fairy tales. They were also \nhardly harmless sensationalism -- if there be such a thing; because \nof them people suffered and apparently died.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the horrors that never happened:\u0014\n\u0014\n* Editor & Publisher headlined an article, \"Mortuary Director Tells \nLocal Paper 40,000 Could Be Lost in Hurricane,\" while the French \npaper Liberation ran a detailed report on 1,200 people drowning in a \nsingle school. \u0014\n\u0014\n* CNN claimed snipers were taking potshots at helicopters trying to \nevacuate patients from hospitals, while separately CNN host Paula \nZahn breathlessly spoke of \"reports\" of \"bands of rapists, going \nblock to block.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n* To be fair and balanced, we note that Fox News's Geraldo Rivera \nclaimed from the scene that \"Yesterday the sun set on a scene of \nterror, chaos, confusion, anarchy, violence, rapes, murders, dead \nbabies, dead people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n* Oprah Winfrey's special report from New Orleans was wall-to-wall \nhysteria. Mayor Ray Nagin told her \"They have people standing out \nthere, have been in that frickin' Superdome for five days watching \ndead bodies, watching hooligans killing people, raping people.\" \nPolice Chief Eddie Compass (since resigned) added that \"little babies \n[are] getting raped.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWinfrey herself, knowing how trusting (or gullible) her audience is, \ntold them that in the Superdome \"gangs banded together and had more \nammunition, at times, than the police.\" \u0014\nIf all of this sounds like something from a post-apocalyptic zombie \nmovie, that's pretty much what it was said professional rabble-rouser \nRandall Robinson. Four days after the storm \"thousands of blacks in \nNew Orleans are dying like dogs,\" he wrote, and \"have begun eating \ncorpses to survive.\" Just four days and already feasting on your \nfriends?\u0014\n\u0014\nNumerous articles since then have revealed there's no evidence any of \nthe above took place. The death toll for all of Louisiana, which is \nrather bigger than just New Orleans, appears to be about 1,000. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet for all of the talk about violent deaths that never materialized, \nit appears that the talk itself led to real deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, efforts to evacuate by helicopter some of the 200 \npatients at New Orleans' Charity Hospital were halted for a day \nbecause of reports of sniper fire. According to CNN's Dr. Sanjay \nGupta, two patients died awaiting evacuation. \"The inability to get \npeople out of these hospitals is frightening,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nCould he have known false reporting from his own employer had \ncontributed to this nightmare?\u0014\nThe evacuation of the Superdome, where conditions may not have been \nas bad as described but were bad enough, was also halted because of \nunconfirmed reports of shooting at military helicopters. \u0014\n\"We have suspended operations until they gain control of the \nSuperdome,\" said the head of the ambulance service handling the \nevacuation of sick and injured people from the structure. He added \nthat while the National Guard said it was sending 100 military police \nofficers to gain control of the situation, \"That's not enough . . . . \nWe need a thousand.\"\u0014\nAs to the military (active and Guard), the only heroes to come out of \nthe debacle, the fast-flying rumors forced them to launch combat \noperations before switching to rescue mode. They also had to wear \nheavy body armor in terrific heat, which I know from experience slows \nyou down in those conditions. Regardless that they weren't really \nnoshing on their neighbors, the last thing stranded residents needed \nwas hampered rescuers.\u0014\n\u0014\nNagin also ordered virtually the entire police force to abandon \nsearch-and-rescue efforts in order to stop the non-existent \"roving \nbands.\" Turns out some of the worst criminals were his own police, \nbut even New Orleans' not-so-finest weren't killing or raping.\u0014\n\u0014\nPres. Roosevelt's famous statement that \"the only thing we have to \nfear is fear itself,\" was certainly an overgeneralization. But those \ntrusted to relay the most accurate information available as opposed \nto the most grabbing must realize that fear can hurt and fear can \nkill.\u0014",

    "words": "Jan 4, 1:30 PM  2004\u0014\nBurned Boy's Mother Was Accused of Abuse \u0014\n\u0014\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman charged with killing her \n3-year-old son on Christmas Day by scalding him with hot water as \npunishment for soiling his diaper has been investigated at least six \ntimes for abuse allegations since 1997, records show.\u0014\n\u0014\nValerie Love Kennedy, 30, was accused Oct. 12 of using drugs in front \nof two of her other children, a 10-month-old and a 2-year-old, \naccording to a report from ChildNet, the private agency supervising \nstate child placements in Broward County.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth of the children showed signs of physical abuse when a doctor \nexamined them this week, prosecutor Phillippa Hitchins said Tuesday \nin court. Kennedy has had 10 children, with two dying at birth. It \nwas unclear if any children remained in her custody before her arrest.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2001, \"medical neglect and physical abuse\" led the state to remove \nfive children from Kennedy's house, authorities said. That case led \nthe state to remove Jaquez Mason from Kennedy two months after his \npremature birth in 2002, according to ChildNet and Broward County \nsheriff's investigators.\u0014\n\u0014\nJaquez was placed with his maternal grandmother, Annie Love Williams, \nwith a court ruling that Kennedy could have no contact with him. But \nKennedy had the child at her home on Christmas Day, when she \nallegedly burned the boy, sheriff's officials said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams then didn't get him proper medical care for his third-degree \nburns, keeping him at her home for a week before he died on New \nYear's Day, officials said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSheriff's officials said that preliminary reports from medical \nexaminers showed that Jaquez \"probably would have survived\" had he \nreceived proper medical care.\u0014\n\u0014\nKennedy is in jail without bail on a murder charge. Williams, 51, was \ncharged with aggravated manslaughter and is free on $10,000 bail.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nAbuse allegations had also been made against Williams before the \nboy's death.\u0014\nIn December 2003, a call to an abuse hot line alleged that Williams \nhad ignored a child who had tied a string so tightly around her \nfinger that it cut off circulation. Eventually the tip of her finger \nwas amputated, \u0014\nChildNet reported. Williams later said the girl never mentioned any \npain.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "title": "MORE TO WORSHIP THAN MUSIC",
    "words": "More to Worship than Music\u0014\nAre you giving non-musicians a voice?\u0014\nby Nancy Beach\u0014\n\u0014\nMy family once visited a church known for its compelling teaching, \ndynamic community, and outreach to the non-churched. At the beginning \nof the service, the congregation was invited to stand. After 30 \nminutes of singing, my husband, a non-musician, looked at me, his \neyes begging for mercy. The worship team, lost in their passion, had \nno idea that people like my husband were nowhere near as enraptured \nby the experience. That made me wonder what non-musical folks might \nsay if they had a voice in the worship planning process.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Please choose singable songs.\u0014\nMost people don't sing much in public, other than at sporting events \nwhere they routinely massacre the national anthem. Songs that \ncaptivate musicians should be carefully screened to determine whether \naverage people can pick up the melody. When worship planners ignore \nthis, we risk leaving out many in the pews who can't express \nthemselves through difficult music.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Must we repeat so much?\u0014\nWhile some repetition is strategicto learn a song and to enter into \nthe richness of the lyricsthe non-musician loses patience sooner \nthan others if songs repeat. Too rarely in our churches do we leave \npeople wanting more!\u0014\n\u0014\n3. May I please sit down?\u0014\nSome parts of the musical worship almost demand that we stand \ntogether, others are opportunities for sitting down. Tell me when I \ncan sit. (Not only the elderly will thank you.) Whatever posture we \nadopt, standing is not the only way to express reverence before God.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. Stretch me with the lyrics.\u0014\nWorshipers long for lyrics that deepen our understanding of God's \ntruth, expand our awareness of God's holiness, increase our capacity \nto express longings to God. Unfortunately, too many songs use the \nsame tired and predictable phrases. Watch for patterns and ruts that \nno longer breathe freshness of thought and spirit into your people. \nSearch for (or better yet, write) songs and hymns that usher new life \ninto worship simply because they are well written.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Worship is more than singing.\u0014\nNon-musicians are not wired to sing non-stop for 30 minutes. It is a \ngift to break up singing with other art forms including video, dance, \nScripture, and performance music. When we creatively draw the \ncongregation into God's presence, even non-musicians (like my \nhusband) will encounter the wonder and strength that comes from \nmeeting God.\u0014\n\u0014\nNancy Beach is teaching pastor and creative arts director at Willow \nCreek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois.\u0014",

    "title": "MAO: THE UNKNOWN STORY  --- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "In the epilogue to her biography of Mao Tse-tung, Jung Chang and her \nhusband and cowriter Jon Halliday lament that, \"Today, Mao's portrait \nand his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of the \nChinese capital.\" For Chang, author of Wild Swans, this fact is an \naffront, not just to history, but to decency. Mao: The Unknown Story \ndoes not contain a formal dedication, but it is clear that Chang is \nwriting to honor the millions of Chinese who fell victim to Mao's \ndrive for absolute power in his 50-plus-year struggle to dominate \nChina and the 20th-century political landscape. From the outset, \nChang and Halliday are determined to shatter the \"myth\" of Mao, and \nthey succeed with the force, not just of moral outrage, but of facts. \nThe result is a book, more indictment than portrait, that paints Mao \nas a brutal totalitarian, a thug, who unleashed Stalin-like purges of \nmillions with relish and without compunction, all for his personal \ngain. Through the authors' unrelenting lens even his would-be heroism \nas the leader of the Long March and father of modern China is exposed \nas reckless opportunism, subjecting his charges to months of \nunnecessary hardship in order to maintain the upper hand over his \nrival, Chang Kuo-tao, an experienced military commander.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsing exhaustive research in archives all over the world, Chang and \nHalliday recast Mao's ascent to power and subsequent grip on China in \nthe context of global events. Sino-Soviet relations, the strengths \nand weakness of Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese invasion of China, \nWorld War II, the Korean War, the disastrous Great Leap Forward, the \nvicious Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War, Nixon's visit, and the \nconstant, unending purges all, understandably, provide the backdrop \nfor Mao's unscrupulous but invincible political maneuverings and \nbetrayals. No one escaped unharmed. Rivals, families, peasants, city \ndwellers, soldiers, and lifelong allies such as Chou En-lai were all \nsacrificed to Mao's ambition and paranoia. Appropriately, the \nauthors' consciences are appalled. Their biggest fear is that Mao \nwill escape the global condemnation and infamy he deserves. Their \nastonishing book will go a long way to ensure that the pendulum of \nhistory will adjust itself accordingly. --Silvana Tropea\u0014\n-----------------------\u0014\n 10 Second Interview: A Few Words with Jung Chang and Jon Halliday\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: From idea to finished book, how long did Mao: The Unknown Story \ntake to research and write?\u0014\nA: Over a decade.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: What was your writing process like? How did you two collaborate on \nthis project?\u0014\nA: The research shook itself out by language. Jung did all the \nChinese-language research, and Jon did the other languages, of which \nRussian was the most important, as Mao had a long-term intimate \nrelationship with Stalin. After our research trips around the world, \nwe would work in our separate studies in London. We would then \nrendezvous at lunch to exchange discoveries.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: Do you have any thoughts about how the book is, or will be \nreceived in China? Did that play a part in your writing of the book?\u0014\nA: The book is banned in China, because the current Communist regime \nis fiercely perpetuating the myth of Mao. Today Mao's portrait and \nhis corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, \nand the regime declares itself to be Mao's heir. The government \nblocked the distribution of an issue of The Far Eastern Economic \nReview, and told the magazine's owners, Dow Jones, that this was \nbecause that issue contained a review of our book. The regime also \ntore the review of our book out of The Economist magazine that was \ngoing to (very restricted) newsstands. We are not surprised that the \nbook is banned. The regime's attitude had no influence on how we \nwrote the book. We hope many copies will find their way into China.\u0014\n\u0014\nQ: What is the one thing you hope readers get from your book?\u0014\nA: Mao was responsible for the deaths of well over 70 million Chinese \nin peacetime, and he was bent on dominating the world. As China is \ntoday emerging as an economic and military power, the world can never \nregard it as a benign force unless Beijing rejects Mao and all his \nlegacies. We hope our book will help push China in this direction by \ntelling the truth about Mao.\u0014\n------------------------------\u0014\n Breakdown of a BIG Book: 5 Things You'll Learn from Mao: The Unknown \nStory\u0014\n\u0014\n1. Mao became a Communist at the age of 27 for purely pragmatic \nreasons: a job and income from the Russians.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Far from organizing the Long March in 1934, Mao was nearly left \nbehind by his colleagues who could not stand him and had tried to \noust him several times. The aim of the March was to link up with \nRussia to get arms. The Reds survived the March because Chiang \nKai-shek let them, in a secret horse-trade for his son and heir, whom \nStalin was holding hostage in Russia.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Mao grew opium on a large scale.\u0014\n\u0014\n4. After he conquered China, Mao's over-riding goal was to become a \nsuperpower and dominate the world: \"Control the Earth,\" as he put it.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Mao caused the greatest famine in history by exporting food to \nRussia to buy nuclear and arms industries: 38 million people were \nstarved and slave-driven to death in 1958-61. Mao knew exactly what \nwas happening, saying: \"half of China may well have to die.\"\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n Jung Chang, author of the award-winning Wild Swans, grew up during \nthe Cultural Revolution; Halliday is a research fellow at King's \nCollege, University of London. They join forces in this sweeping but \nflawed biography, which aims to uncover Mao's further cruelties \n(beyond those commonly known) by debunking claims made by the \nCommunist Party in his service. For example, the authors argue that, \nfar from Mao's humble peasant background shaping his sympathies for \nthe downtrodden, he actually ruthlessly exploited the peasants' \nresources when he was based in regions such as Yenan, and cared about \npeasants only when it suited his political agenda. And far from \nhaving founded the Chinese Communist Party, the authors argue, Mao \nwas merely at the right place at the right time. Importantly, the \nbook argues that in most instances Mao was able to hold on to power \nthanks to his adroitness in appealing to and manipulating powerful \nallies and foes, such as Stalin and later Nixon; furthermore, almost \nevery aspect of his career was motivated by a preternatural thirst \nfor personal power, rather than political vision. Some of the book's \nclaims rely on interviews and on primary material (such as the \nanguished letters Mao's second wife wrote after he abandoned her), \nthough the book's use of sources is sometimes incompletely documented \nand at times heavy-handed (for example, using a school essay the \nyoung Mao wrote to show his lifelong ruthlessness).

Major\u0014\n\u0014\nNearly three decades after his death, a huge portrait of Mao Zedong \nstill is mounted on Beijing's Gate of Heavenly Peace, its expression \na faintly paternal smile, its message that the Chairman is watching \nover the Revolution whose victory he proclaimed from that very spot. \nNearby his mortal remains, looking like a grotesque confection of \nmarzipan, lie in a glass sarcophagus in the Chairman Mao Memorial \nHall in Tiananmen Square. In the square itself, private vendors do a \nbrisk business in vintage Mao buttons and other memorabilia.\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly the cult of Mao is alive and well...as it most emphatically \nshould not be, in the view of Jung Chang and her coauthor-husband Jon \nHalliday. Mao, they argue, has gotten a free pass for far too long. \nThe Chinese Revolution was of such vast importanceridding China of \nthe twin evils of Western economic imperialism and Japanese \nterritorial aggressionthat Mao, as its leader, has been almost \nentirely free from critical scrutiny. His life has been replaced by \nhis legend, in which his errors pale in comparison to his \naccomplishments. It is time, the authors say, to take another look.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe monster behind the myths\u0014\n\u0014\nThis re-examination of Maos life and works is audacious, dazzling, \nbreath-taking in the range of its sources, the candor of its \ninformants, the comprehensiveness of its reappraisal. Mao emerges \nhere as an almost inhuman bundle of egotism, ambition, and \nruthlessness. He betrayed everyone, starting with those closest to \nhimhis revolutionary comrades in arms as well as his wives and \nchildren; Mao seems to have been totally devoid of the capacity for \nbasic human affection, let alone loyalty. The glorious Long March is \ndepicted as a fraud, begun (with the famous break-out from the \nJiangsi Soviets) with the collaboration of Nationalist forces and \ncontinued with conscript troops and porters under threat of \nexecution. The Anti-Rightest Campaign, the Great Leap Forward, and \nthe Cultural Revolution were, in this view, even more maniacal than \nwe had thought.\u0014\n        \u0014\nOne might demur, just a bit. This is a fine book, and a compelling \nread, but it does sometimes become polemical. In every case where the \nevidence is open to interpretation, the judgment goes against the \nlate Chairman. The authors, I think, would not disagree with that \nassessment. Why, they might ask in return, should they give Mao a \nbreak? He has been treated by history far more gently than, say, \nHitler, Stalin, or Idi Amin; its time to look at the other side of \nthe coin.\u0014\n\u0014\nA searing indictment\u0014\n\u0014\nIn her now-classic memoir Wild Swans, Jung Chang told the intimate \nstory of herself, her mother and her grandmother, three women whose \nlives were indelibly marked by China's turbulent 20th century. Now \nJung Chang and Jon Halliday widen the focus, from the biographies of \nthree ordinary women to the biography of a titanic man whose actions \nshook China and the world for more than fifty years. Drawing on both \npersonal experience and massive, meticulous research, they portray \nMao as a monster whose downfall in the eyes of the world is long \noverdue. This book is a hard-hitting prosecutors brief: not always \nfair, but always mesmerizing. 832 pages  32 pages of photographs and \nmaps\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHORS: Jung Chang holds a doctorate in linguistics from \nYork University, the first person from the Peoples Republic of China \nto receive a doctorate from a British University. Jon Halliday is a \nformer Senior Visiting Research Fellow at Kings College, University \nof London.\u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE REVIEWER: John S. Major taught East Asian history at \nDartmouth College from 1971 to 1984 and later was director of the \nChina Council of the Asia Society.\u0014",

So she \u0014\nplayed with her children, and gathered flowers for\u0014\nthem along the way, and bathed them in the clear streams; and \u0014\nthe sun shone on them, and the young Mother cried,\u0014\n\"Nothing will ever be lovelier than this.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThen the night came, and the storm, and the path was\u0014\ndark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother \u0014\ndrew them close and covered them with her mantle, and the children \nsaid, \u0014\n\"Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and no harm can come.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and\u0014\nthe children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. \u0014\nBut at all times she said to the children,\" A little patience and we \nare there.\"\u0014\nSo the children climbed, and when they reached the top\u0014\nthey said, \"Mother, we would not have done it without you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the mother, when she lay down at night looked up\u0014\nat the stars and said, \"This is a better day than the last, for my \u0014\nchildren have learned fortitude in the face of hardness.

    "title": "MANHUNT  -  A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "MANHUNT\u0014\nby James L. Swanson \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most celebrated actors of his age, John Wilkes Booth would \nultimately achieve a very different sort of fame. Twenty-six years \nold, impossibly vain, preening, emotionally flamboyant, possessed of \nraw talent and splendid lan, writes James L. Swanson, Booth was \nwilling to throw away fame, wealth, and promise for his cause. On \nthe night of April 14, 1865, Good Friday, Booth did just thathe \nentered Washington, D.C.s Fords Theatre and assassinated President \nAbraham Lincoln, the tyrant who had smashed his beloved Confederacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSic Semper Tyrannis\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Manhunt, author and Lincoln scholar James L. Swanson re-creates \nnot only Booths horrific deed but the unprecedented 12-day chase \nthat followed, culminating in Booths own death by gunfire. From the \nbotched plot to assassinate Secretary of State William H. Seward, \nfoiled by Sewards frail daughter, to the network of Southern \nsympathizers that shielded the killer as he fled the nations capital \n(which was still decorated in honor of the wars end), crossed the \nPotomac, and hid himself in the woods of Maryland and Virginia, \nSwanson offers an almost hour-by-hour account of both the commission \nof the crime and its extraordinary conclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nHailed by Lincoln biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin as a triumphant \nbook that will mesmerize the reader from start to finish just as \nthe actual manhunt mesmerized the nation, and proudly presented by \nthe History Book Club in this exclusive paperback edition, Manhunt \ntells the unforgettable true story of one of the most shocking crimes \nin American history. \u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: James L. Swanson has written for a variety of \npublications, including The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, \nand American Heritage. He is the coauthor of Lincolns Assassins: \nTheir Trial and Execution and is a member of the advisory committee \nof the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                           The \nGreatest Manhunt in American History \u0014\n\u0014\nFor 12 days after his brazen assassination of Abraham Lincoln, John \nWilkes Booth was at large, and in Manhunt, historian James L. Swanson \ntells the vivid, fully documented tale of his escape and the wild, \nmassive pursuit. Get a taste of the daily drama from this timeline of \nthe desperate search. \u0014\n\u0014\nApril 14, 1865\u0014\nAround noon, Booth learns that Lincoln is coming to Ford's Theatre \nthat night. He has eight hours to prepare his plan.\u0014\n10:15 pm: Booth shoots the president, leaps to the stage, and escapes \non a waiting horse.\u0014\nSecretary of War Edwin Stanton orders the manhunt to begin.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nApril 15\u0014\nAbout 4:00 am: Booth seeks treatment for a broken leg at Dr. Samuel \nMudd's farm near Beantown, Maryland. Cavalry patrol heads south \ntoward Mudd farm.\u0014\nConfederate operative Thomas Jones hides Booth in a remote pine \nthicket for five days, frustrating the manhunters.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 19\u0014\nTens of thousands watch the procession to the U.S. Capitol, where \nPresident Lincoln lies in state. Wild rumors and stories of false \nsightings of Booth spread.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 20\u0014\nStanton offers a $100,000 reward for the assassins, and threatens \ndeath to any citizen who helps them.\u0014\nAfter hiding Booth in Maryland, Jones puts him in a rowboat on the \nPotomac River, bound for Virginia. More than a thousand manhunters \nare still searching in Maryland. In the dark, Booth rows the wrong \nway and first ends up back in Maryland.\u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nApril 20-24\u0014\nBooth lands in the northern neck of Virginia, and Confederate agents \nand sympathizers guide him to Port Conway, Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 24\u0014\nBooth befriends three Confederate soldiers who help him cross the \nRappahannock River to Port Royal and then guide him further southwest \nto the Garrett farm.\u0014\nUnion troops in Washington receive a report of a Booth sighting. They \nboard a U.S. Navy tug and steam south, right past Booth's hideout at \nthe Garrett farm.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 25\u0014\nThe 16th New York Calvary, realizing their error, turns around and \nsurrounds the Garrett farm after midnight that night.\u0014\n\u0014\nApril 26\u0014\nWhen Booth refuses to surrender, troops set the barn on fire, and \nBoston Corbett shoots the assassin. Booth dies a few hours later, at \nsunrise. \u0014\n\u0014\nApril 26-27\u0014\nBooth's body is brought back to Washington, where it is autopsied, \nphotographed, and buried in a secret grave.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early days of April 1865, with the bloody war to preserve the \nunion finished, Swanson tells us, Abraham Lincoln was \"jubilant.\" \nElsewhere in Washington, the other player in the coming drama of the \npresident's assassination was miserable. Hearing Lincoln's April 10 \nvictory speech, famed actor and Confederate die-hard John Wilkes \nBooth turned to a friend and remarked with seething hatred, \"That \nmeans nigger citizenship. Now, by God, I'll put him through.\" On \nApril 14, Booth did just that. With great power, passion and at a \nthrilling, breakneck pace, Swanson (Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial \nand Execution) conjures up an exhausted yet jubilant nation ruptured \nby grief, stunned by tragedy and hell-bent on revenge. For 12 days, \nassisted by family and some women smitten by his legendary physical \nbeauty, Booth relied on smarts, stealth and luck to elude the best \ndetectives, military officers and local police the federal government \ncould muster. Taking the reader into the action, the story is shot \nthrough with breathless, vivid, even gory detail. With a deft, \nprobing style and no small amount of swagger, Swanson, a member of \nthe Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, has crafted pure narrative \npleasure, sure to satisfy the casual reader and Civil War aficionado \nalike.\u0014",

They say the \ne-mail was private, and they don't intend to publicly condemn its \nremarks. That will probably change. Wichman says he never\u0014\nintended the e-mail to be made public, and wouldn't have used the \nsame strong language if he'd known it was going to get out.\u0014",

If convicted, she could be sentenced to life in prison \nwithout parole.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiller, who has a record of minor offenses, was being held in lieu of \n$2 million bail and did not have an attorney on record. Her next \ncourt date was set for Nov. 17\u0014\n\u0014\nPoma wouldn't say how or why Miller is to have killed her children, \nwho ranged in age from 11 days to 1 year. He also wouldn't identify \nher brother, whom he said had known all along but would not be \ncharged, and wouldn't say what might have motivated him to finally \nturn in his sister.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We would never have this if he didn't come forward,\" in August 2005, \nPoma said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe killings began in San Diego County in December 1965 with the \ndeath of Sherry Scott, who was 11 days old, and continued a month \nlater with her sister, Carla Scott, who was 1, Poma said. Both were \ndeemed natural deaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifteen months later, Miller's 3-month-old son, David, died in Long \nBeach, Poma said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy February 1970, Miller had moved north to Mendocino County where \nher mother lived. Her 9-month-old daughter, Kimberly, died in \nCalpella, about 100 miles north of San Francisco.\u0014\n\u0014\nInvestigators were suspicious at the time because Miller told them \nabout the deaths of her other three children, Poma said. She wasn't \ncharged, but county officials removed two other children from her \nhome and she never regained custody.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe children, now adults, live in California but don't have contact \nwith Miller, Poma said. He would not identify the surviving children \nor the men who fathered them and Miller's other children.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Flames were tearing through her \nsecond-story apartment in Brooklyn yesterday morning, and she was \nscreaming for help.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo men had raced to her aid, but they could not get into the \nwood-frame building. Thinking fast, they stretched out a quilt as a \nmakeshift net.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Nazli dropped her month-old boy, tossed out his twin brother, and \nthen helped two older children jump from the windowsill. All four \nlanded safely. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Ms. Nazli had a fifth child, a 5-year-old girl, who may have been \nafraid to jump. Ignoring pleas from neighbors, she refused to leave \nher. The mother and her daughter, Nimrah Naseer, were overcome by \nsmoke and were unconscious when rescuers reached them. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe did a great job in saving her children, said Bob Treiland, 47, \na firefighter from Ladder 166 who drove the first truck to arrive at \nthe fire at 148 Bay 50th Street, off Cropsey Avenue, in the Gravesend \nneighborhood.\u0014\n\u0014\nI guess I know where she is coming from, he said, adding that he \nhas two small children. She would rather die than leave her child up \nthere, and it is just something about a parents instincts.\u0014\nIt was not until Firefighter Treiland and his colleagues arrived and \nplaced portable ladders against the building that they were able to \nclimb into the apartment, find Ms. Nazli and her daughter lying \nunconscious about three feet apart in the front bedroom, and carry \nthem out, officials said.\u0014\n\u0014\nYesterday, Ms. Nazli and Nimrah were listed in serious condition at \nJacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, where they had been transferred \nfor treatment of their injuries, officials said. The other children, \nincluding the twins, Mugees and Mubeen, their brother Umar, 10, and \nsister Shamail, 4, were listed in stable condition at Coney Island \nHospital in Brooklyn, officials said.\u0014",

The lack of external burns ruled out an open flame, \nscalding water, heating pad or other possible cause of death that \nwould have damaged the skin, Betz said.\u0014\n\u0014\nArnold's lawyer, Jon Paul Rion, said she had nothing to do with her \ndaughter's death. She was stunned when investigators told her that a \nmicrowave might have been involved, he said.\u0014\n\"China - as a mother and a person - was horrified that such an act \ncould occur,\" Rion said.\u0014\n \u0014\nArnold was arrested initially after the baby's death, then released.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a lengthy investigation before prosecutors found enough \nprobable cause to issue another arrest warrant, said Greg Flannagan, \na spokesman for the county prosecutor's office.\u0014\n\u0014\nA microwave was taken as evidence, police Sgt. Gary White said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMunicipal Judge Bill Littlejohn set Arnold's bond Tuesday at $1 \nmillion. Arnold participated in the hearing from the county jail by a \nvideo hookup, giving \"yes\" and \"no\" answers to procedural questions. \nShe declined interviews through her attorney, who said his client \nplans to plead not guilty.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2000, a Virginia woman was sentenced to five years in prison for \nkilling her month-old son in a microwave oven.\u0014\n\u0014\nNerve damage can occur quickly with microwave injuries, said Louis \nBloomfield, a professor of physics at the University of Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ovens' electromagnetic waves cook primarily through the presence \nof water in food, the water molecules heating up as they are twisted \nback and forth about 2.5 billion times a second, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe night before Paris Talley was taken to the hospital, Arnold and \nthe child's father went out for a short time and left Paris with a \nbaby sitter, Rion said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother didn't sense anything out of the ordinary until the next \nmorning, when the child was found unconscious, Rion said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe baby's father, Terrell Talley, said his daughter was fine when he \nand Arnold arrived home after leaving her in the care of the baby \nsitter, his sister.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I went in the house, my baby was sitting in the car seat, she \nwas asleep and she was alive,\" he said. \"The baby sitter ain't had \nnothing to do with it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis sister, Lionda Talley, did not return a call for comment.\u0014\n\u0014\n---\u0014\n\u0014\nAssociated Press writers Dan Sewell in Cincinnati and Erica Ryan in \nColumbus contributed to this story.\u0014",

She was cleared of \nfirst-degree murder charges that would have sent her to prison for \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors allege Hamm and then-boyfriend Maurice LaGrone Jr. \nplanned the deaths because the children were in the way of their \nrelationship. Hamm and LaGrone, who was convicted of first-degree \nmurder, have maintained the car accidentally rolled into the water as \nLaGrone tried to back up from a boat ramp.\u0014\n\u0014\nHamm had faced a sentence ranging from probation to 20 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer mother, Ann Powers, said she was pleased with the sentence, while \nprosecutors were disappointed. The children's father had said he \nwanted the maximum sentence imposed.\u0014\n\u0014\nPowers had argued for leniency, saying she didn't think Hamm meant \nfor her children to die.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't think there's any intent. ...

    "words": "While sex is a vital and fun part of marriage, many couples agree \nthere is one thing that's even better: Laughing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a recent Reader's Digest survey (2006)), married couples \nin the United States are happier and more fulfilled in their unions \nthan ever before. When husbands and wives chose from a list of \noptions the factors that were most important for a good marriage, \nlaughter--specifically, time spent talking, laughing and having \nfun--was deemed far more important than either the quality or \nfrequency of sex.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding 1: Marriage Isn't Broken\u0014\n\u0014\n    * When the 1,001 married people surveyed were asked if they would \nmarry their spouse all over again, 71 percent agreed they would.\u0014\n    * 62 percent of respondents said \"I love my spouse even more than \nwhen we were first married.\"\u0014\n    * 61 percent of respondents married for 21 years or more find \ntheir marriage is better than the typical American marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding 2: Laughter is More Important Than Sex\u0014\nWhen husbands and wives chose the factors most important for a good \nmarriage from a list of options, the following items rose to the top \nand fell to the bottom:\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Trust: 63 percent\u0014\n    * Time spent talking, laughing, having fun: 52 percent\u0014\n    * Compatibility: 30 percent\u0014\n    * Quality of sex:13 percent\u0014\n    * Frequency of sex: 9 percent\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding 3: Guys Get Mushy About Marriage, Too\u0014\nIn the survey, participants were asked to write verbatim answers to \nquestions regarding their marriage. In reviewing the hundreds of \nresponses from men, researchers were struck at the preponderance of \nhighly emotional, positive and sensitive answers. The comments were \nin strong contrast to common stereotypes of men as emotionally \ndetached.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen asked to describe their most cherished marriage moments, men \nsaid:\u0014\n\u0014\n    * \"Kissing in the snow.\"\u0014\n    * \"The look of joy and happiness on her face as she came toward \nme at the altar.\"\u0014\n    * \"The first and every time we make love.\"\u0014\n    * \"I can't believe how lucky I am to have the woman of my dreams. \nI cherish every moment of every day that I'm with her.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding 4: Being Married Has Its Perks\u0014\n\u0014\n    * Infidelity is not a challenge most married couples face, \naccording to the survey. When asked to choose from a list of \nchallenges experienced while married, \"buying a new home\" was noted \nas a challenge by 55 percent of respondents making it the most \npopular answer, while \"infidelity\" was at the bottom of the list at \n13 percent.\u0014\n    * Women are funnier than their husbands expected at the start of \ntheir marriage with 47 percent of men saying their wives' sense of \nhumor was \"better than expected.\"\u0014\n    * When asked to choose from a list of things they miss from when \nthey were single--including \"being more adventurous sexually,\" \n\"living by my own rules\" and \"dating\"--most often men and women said \n\"nothing at all\" (41 percent).\u0014\n\u0014\n(Source: The Reader's Digest Marriage Survey)\u0014",

However, \nSeabiscuits literal granddaddy, Man o War, is, with the possible \nexception of Secretariat, the most impressive and accomplished \nThoroughbred racehorse of all time, and Man o Wars story, beginning \nin the years immediately following World War I, is every bit as \ndramatic as his offsprings.\u0014\n\u0014\nHorseracing expert Dorothy Ours offers a biography of the phenomenal \nMan o War that is worthy of this great horses legacy. In so doing, \nshe also tells the story of an America entering the Roaring \nTwentiesa country eager to forget the hardships of the Great War, \nthrow off the restraints of post-Victorian Puritanism, and plunge \nheadlong into the celebrity-mad Jazz Age. Just as Major League \nBaseball had been severely tarnished by the Black Sox scandal of \n1919 (the rigging of the World Series between the Chicago White Sox \nand the Cincinnati Reds), so had horseracing, always subject to the \nmachinations of gamblers, suffered profound blemishes from race \nfixing and drugging during that same yearthe year that Man o War \nbegan to race. Both sports were in desperate need of heroes who could \nrestore confidence and integrity, and, at the same time, win back the \nfavor of a disillusioned American public. Baseball got Babe Ruth; \nhorseracing got Man o War.\u0014\n\u0014\nChain Lightning\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the spring of 1917, a foal with an outstanding pedigree was born \non a horse farm owned by a man whose aristocratic family name has \nbecome synonymous with racing in AmericaAugust Belmont Jr., the \nchairman of New Yorks Jockey Club. At the time, Belmont, rather \nremarkably, was serving in the U.S. Army after volunteering despite \nhis age of sixty-five. The army made Belmont a major in the \nQuartermaster Corps and sent him to France. To honor his service, \nBelmonts wife, Eleanor, named the colt Man o War. Nevertheless, \nit was not Belmonts destiny to enjoy the success of Man o Warhe \nwould place the yearling up for sale, and a group led by Samuel Doyle \nRiddle, the scion of a Pennsylvania textile family, would buy the \nhorse at a Saratoga Springs auction. Unto them would befall the \nglory, and the woe, of owning what would become the most famous horse \nin the world. By 1920 Man O War would win 20 of 21 starts, breaking \nan unprecedented number of time records and wowing crowds with his \nmajestic, reddish-brown-coated good looks.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Dorothy Ours traces Man o Wars compelling rise to stardom, we \nfollow the horse and the people who surrounded him; its a \nfascinating ride indeed. 352 pages ?6 1/8\" x 9\"  16-page b&w photo \ninsert\u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the Author: Dorothy Ours is a well-established racing \nauthority.

    "words": "MAKE SURE YOUR DAUGHTERS KNOW! & EVERYONE ELSE \u0014\n\u0014\nThis was written by a guy from KVLY-TV in Fargo. This is true. Scary! \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is something that happened to us on the way back from vacation \nlast week. At first I didn't think much of it until now. The reason \nwe were a little suspicious is we had been riding in a jeep all day \nwith 100 degree temps and we stopped at a truck stop for something to \ndrink. When I was leaving, a young girl followed me out and asked \nwhat kind of cologne I was wearing. \u0014\n\u0014\nWell, after 7 hours in the car sweating, I don't think you could tell \nif I was or was not wearing any cologne. We just got in the jeep and \nsaid no thanks. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen it was about 3 weeks ago, I was at a service station in \nBirmingham getting gas. It was about 9:30 PM. I was approached by 2 \nmen and 2 women in a car. The man that was driving asked me 'What \nkind of perfume do you wear?' \u0014\n\u0014\nI was a bit confused and I asked him 'Why?' He said, 'We are selling \nsome name brand perfumes, at cheap prices.' I said I had no money. He \nthen reached out of the car and handed me paper that was laminated; \nit had many perfumes on it. I looked quickly at it and gave it back. \nI said, have no money. He said it is OK, we take check, cash, or \ncredit cards. Then the people in the car began to laugh. I just got \nin my car and said no thanks. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen I received this e-mail yesterday and it sent chills up my spine. \nPlease read this. It is no joke. Here is the e-mail I was sent: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Dear Friends: \u0014\n\u0014\nI know not all of you are women that I am sending this to, but am \nhoping you will share this with your wives, daughters, mothers, \nsisters, etc. Our world seems to be getting crazier by the day. Pipe \nbombs in mail boxes and sickos in parking lots with perfume. Be \ncareful. I was approached yesterday afternoon around 5:30 PM in the \nWal-Mart parking lot by two males asking what kind of perfume I was \nwearing. Then they asked if I'd like to sample some fabulous scent \nthey were willing to sell me at very reasonable rate. I probably \nwould have agreed had I not received an e-mail warning of a \"Wanna \nsmell this neat perfume?\" scam. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe men continued to stand between parked cars, I guess to wait for \nsomeone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going towards them, pointing \nat them and told her about how I was sent an e-mail at work about \nsomeone walking up to you at the malls or in parking lots and asking \nyou to SNIFF PERFUME that they are selling at a cheap price or at \nleast compare to which one you like best. \u0014\n\u0014\nTHIS IS NOT PERFUME...IT IS ETHER! \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you sniff it, you'll pass out. They'll take your wallet, your \nvaluables and heaven knows what else. If it were not for this e-mail, \nI probably would have sniffed the 'perfume' but thanks to the \ngenerosity of an e-mailing friend, I was spared whatever might have \nhappened to me. I wanted to do the same for you. \u0014\n\u0014\nPLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS AND PLEASE BE ALERT \nAND BE AWARE. IF YOU ARE A MAN AND RECEIVE THIS, PASS IT ON TO YOUR \nWOMEN FRIENDS. \u0014\n\u0014\nLadies, this happened to me yesterday and I didn't smell the perfume \neither, thanks to this email. This is true. Believe me, I know. I was \nover by Big Lots in the parking lot at lunch time when I was \napproached. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo either day or night, it does not matter. There were 3 guys \ntogether when I was approached. I called the police when I got back \nto my desk. \u0014\n\u0014\nLike the email says above, LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS - YOUR \nFRIENDS, FAMILY, CO-WORKERS, whomever. It helped me. The first \u0014\nthing that popped into my head was this e-mail warning.\u0014",

    "title": "MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS",
    "words": "Maslow's hierarchy of needs. \u0014\nIn 1943 Maslow came up with his hierarchy of needs pyramid. Look it \nup if you need more info.\u0014\n\u0014\n5. Actualization\u0014\n4. esteem\u0014\n3. love/belonging\u0014\n2. safety\u0014\n1. physiological\u0014\n\u0014\nMaslow took this idea and created his now famous hierarchy of needs. \nBeyond the details of air, water, food, and sex, he laid out five \nbroader layers: the physiological needs, the needs for safety and \nsecurity, the needs for love and belonging, the needs for esteem, and \nthe need to actualize the self, in that order. \u0014\n1. The physiological needs. These include the needs we have for \noxygen, water, protein, salt, sugar, calcium, and other minerals and \nvitamins. They also include the need to maintain a pH balance \n(getting too acidic or base will kill you) and temperature (98.6 or \nnear to it). Also, theres the needs to be active, to rest, to sleep, \nto get rid of wastes (CO2, sweat, urine, and feces), to avoid pain, \nand to have sex. Quite a collection! \u0014\nMaslow believed, and research supports him, that these are in fact \nindividual needs, and that a lack of, say, vitamin C, will lead to a \nvery specific hunger for things which have in the past provided that \nvitamin C -- e.g. orange juice. I guess the cravings that some \npregnant women have, and the way in which babies eat the most foul \ntasting baby food, support the idea anecdotally. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. The safety and security needs. When the physiological needs are \nlargely taken care of, this second layer of needs comes into play. \nYou will become increasingly interested in finding safe \ncircumstances, stability, protection. You might develop a need for \nstructure, for order, some limits. \u0014\nLooking at it negatively, you become concerned, not with needs like \nhunger and thirst, but with your fears and anxieties. In the ordinary \nAmerican adult, this set of needs manifest themselves in the form of \nour urges to have a home in a safe neighborhood, a little job \nsecurity and a nest egg, a good retirement plan and a bit of \ninsurance, and so on. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. The love and belonging needs. When physiological needs and safety \nneeds are, by and large, taken care of, a third layer starts to show \nup. You begin to feel the need for friends, a sweetheart, children, \naffectionate relationships in general, even a sense of community. \nLooked at negatively, you become increasing susceptible to loneliness \nand social anxieties. \u0014\nIn our day-to-day life, we exhibit these needs in our desires to \nmarry, have a family, be a part of a community, a member of a church, \na brother in the fraternity, a part of a gang or a bowling club. It \nis also a part of what we look for in a career. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. The esteem needs. Next, we begin to look for a little self-esteem. \nMaslow noted two versions of esteem needs, a lower one and a higher \none. The lower one is the need for the respect of others, the need \nfor status, fame, glory, recognition, attention, reputation, \nappreciation, dignity, even dominance. The higher form involves the \nneed for self-respect, including such feelings as confidence, \ncompetence, achievement, mastery, independence, and freedom. Note \nthat this is the higher form because, unlike the respect of others, \nonce you have self-respect, its a lot harder to lose! \u0014\n\u0014\nThe negative version of these needs is low self-esteem and \ninferiority complexes. Maslow felt that Adler was really onto \nsomething when he proposed that these were at the roots of many, if \nnot most, of our psychological problems. In modern countries, most of \nus have what we need in regard to our physiological and safety needs. \nWe, more often than not, have quite a bit of love and belonging, too. \nIts a little respect that often seems so very hard to get! \u0014\n\u0014\nAll of the preceding four levels he calls deficit needs, or D-needs. \nIf you dont have enough of something -- i.e. you have a deficit -- \nyou feel the need. But if you get all you need, you feel nothing at \nall! In other words, they cease to be motivating. As the old blues \nsong goes, you dont miss your water till your well runs dry!\u0014",

Reports of a six-year-old \nboy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens \nsuspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher \nfired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the \njob they themselves failed to do in disciplining their unruly \nchildren. It declined even further when schools were required to get \nparental consent to administer Aspirin, sun lotion or a sticky \nplaster to a student, but could not inform the parents when a student \nbecame pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense lost the will to live as the Ten Commandments became \ncontraband; churches became businesses; and criminals received better \ntreatment than their victims. Common Sense took a beating when you \ncouldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the \nburglar can sue you for assault.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed \nto realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a \nlittle in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.\u0014\n\u0014\nCommon Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust; \nhis wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, \nReason. He is survived by three stepbrothers; I Know my Rights, \nSomeone Else is to Blame, and I'm a Victim.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. If \nyou still remember him, pass this on. If not, join the majority and \ndo nothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor unknown\u0014",

Therefore, \nand Id say this is true north             of the Mason-Dixon Line as \nwell as south of it  to be called maam is as close \nas                    anyone in the U.S. can get to being referred to \nas royalty.

    "title": "MEGACHURCH PROBE CHALLENGES ALL CHURCH MINISTRIES",
    "words": "Megachurch Probe Challenges All Church Ministries\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry L. McSwain\u0014\n12-12-07\u0014\n\u0014\nSen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) dropped a bomb on a small segment of \nthe church world in the United States on Nov. 6. But it has the \npotential of creating shock waves that may have long-term effects for \nmany congregations in church-state relations, financial \naccountability and understanding of clergy income and taxes.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley \nrequested the records of six megachurch ministries that happen to be \ntelevision-based and generally identified with the \"word of faith\" \nprosperity gospel movement. The six pastors and their respective \nministries and some spouses were requested to provide a variety of \ndocuments to the committee by Dec. 6. The ministers are Paula and \nRandy White, Creflo and Taffi Dollar, Joyce and David Meyer, Kenneth \nand Gloria Copeland, Benedictus (Benny) Hinn and Bishop Eddie Long. \nSince two of these ministries are located in Atlanta, the media of \nthis city have been saturated with both reports and commentary on the \nissues involved.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs of the date of his deadline for response, each of the ministries \nhas replied in some form with Creflo Dollar and Bishop Eddie Long \nannouncing they will not comply unless subpoenas are issued.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike most of the ministries, Grassley has been forthcoming with his \nrequests, posting copies of his letters on his Senate Web page. One \ncan read exactly what he asks--records of board actions with minutes \ndocumenting them, approved compensation for ministry leaders, \nexplanation of certain expenditures reported to his staff and \ndocumentation of travel and other expenses.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly Joyce Meyer has been equally forthcoming in responding--one can \nread audit letters, the amount of her salary, and an explanation on \nher ministry website of the \"commode\" for which she reportedly spent \n$23,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sermons have already begun on the satanic power being unleashed \nagainst God's anointed by this probe of highly visible ministry \nleaders. What are the issues and potential outcome of this initiative \nby a tithing, Baptist, Christian senator?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first outcome will likely be greater attention to governmental \nreporting requirements for churches, even small ones. They are \nseveral and are ignored by a host of churches, large and small. At a \nminimum, all churches must report to the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) a W-2 for all employees or a Form 1099 for any compensation \ngiven in excess of $800 in a year. Second, the church must maintain \nrecords of giving to the church by its members and provided \ndocumentation to them if they choose to deduct such giving from their \nindividual tax returns.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome churches have formalized non-profit corporations, usually \ntax-exempt 501(c)3 corporations. If they have done so, and they are \nindeed a church engaged in worship and spiritual activities, they are \nexempt from one very important reporting requirement of all other \ncharitable, non-profit corporations--an annual submission of a Form \n990 to the IRS.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a report of revenues, expenditures, the salaries and benefits \nof the highest paid employees, and other pertinent information. Such \ninformation is public so one can secure the 990 information on most \ncharitable organizations like the Red Cross, hospitals, colleges and \nuniversities, and all other non-exempt organizations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe IRS has no such information on churches. Grassley could influence \nthe Finance committee to consider legislation requiring 990 reporting \nfrom churches and should he do so advocates of church-state \nseparation should scream \"NO!\" It is none of the government's \nbusiness to collect such information on houses of worship.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the issue is different when you look at the industrialization of \nthe church in post-modern America. Why should a non-profit ministry \nset up for the purpose of publishing books, tapes, educational \nmaterials or televising the preaching of a church pastor be exempt \nfrom such reporting? Many of the kinds of abuses Sen. Grassley is \nreviewing would be avoided if such were the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would also eliminate the deception of the tap dance done by \nBaptist denominational leaders to avoid making public the levels of \ncompensation of leaders of their ministries and agencies that are not \nspecifically houses of worship. Shareholders of Coca-Cola can read \nthe salary of its CEO. So should members of denominations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second outcome of this Grassley shockwave is likely to be more \nintense IRS scrutiny of clergy income. If one looks carefully at the \npotential abuses of these ministries, all of whom collect more than \n$25 million in revenue each year, the real issue is whether their \nleaders are properly reporting taxable income.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe senator's probe will never be able to determine that given the \nconfidentiality of such IRS information. However, the public will \nbecome aware if one or more of these clergy are indicted by the IRS. \nWillfully and knowingly failing to report one's income is a felony. \nAn IRS audit might just be a far worse consequence for these \nministers than Grassley's request for information.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe third consequence ought to be a new level of conversation within \nthe church itself and among clergy about income and taxes. It is \nunethical for clergy to view themselves as less responsible than any \none else for the payment of their taxes. When pastors model \ntechniques of enriching themselves by schemes to avoid taxes, they \nweaken the Christian's responsibility to honesty and integrity. The \nalso reduce the government's capacity for responsible fiscal \naccountability. Yes, honesty with the government is a Christian \nvirtue!\u0014\n\u0014\nIn reality, a host of pastors and lay leaders of churches large and \nsmall understand too poorly IRS requirements as it relates to housing \nallowances, Social Security, Medicare and taxable income.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the practices of many churches, especially non-denominational \nand African-American ones, is to provide a love offering from the \nmembers to their pastor in place of salary. This technique is, for \nsome, a way of avoiding the reporting of income. The IRS definition \nof a gift is money given with no provision of services nor \nexpectations of such. When one gives a \"love offering\" to another for \na sermon preached, a seminar led or some expectation of a visit when \nin the hospital, that is not a gift. It is compensation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is the abuse of the practice that ought to concern all church \nleaders. In Sen. Grassley's letter to Ken and Gloria Copeland, he \ninquires about a $2 million \"love offering\" given to them by a host \nof friends and ministry colleagues at their 40th anniversary \ncelebration. It is altogether fair for Sen. Grassley to determine \nwhether such monies were indeed gifts or were checks from churches \ngiven by members who were eligible for a charitable deduction on \ntheir taxes. If they were, it was not a gift!\u0014\n\u0014\nThe final consequence of the senator's questions may be some \nsignificant analysis of the accounting firms that advise these \nministries. It is interesting to observe the interlocking connections \namong them with several employing the same firm for their accounting \nservices and audits.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet's not forget, it was Sen. Grassley's staff that was able to \nunravel the intricacies of Arthur Anderson's accounting fiascos in \nthe Enron case when the IRS seemed unable to do so. Neither Arthur \nAnderson nor Enron exist anymore.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLarry McSwain is professor of ethics and leadership at McAfee School \nof Theology in Atlanta.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nSen. Charles Grassley is a member of Prairie Lakes Church in Cedar \nFalls, Iowa, affiliated with the Baptist General Conference\u0014",

His brother \nEdgar, who had been working with him on the platform, was killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomehow, Alcides Moreno survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was given roughly 24 pints of blood and 19 pints of plasma and \nunderwent an operation to open his abdomen in the emergency room \nbecause, his doctor said, they did not want to risk moving him to an \noperating room. As December went on, he endured nine orthopedic \noperations.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet somehow, Alcides Moreno, the man who fell from the sky, survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his hospital room, amid all the machines that helped keep him \nalive, his wife, Rosario, lifted his hand again and again to stroke \nher face and her hair, hoping against hope that a simple tactile \nsensation would remind him, would help bring him back.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen on Christmas Day, Alcides Moreno reached out  and stroked the \nwrong face.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently he tried to do it to one of the nurses, Rosario Moreno \nsaid on Thursday, describing how she chided him, gently, when she was \ntold what had happened.

    "words": "After 3 Die, Questions on Why Erratic Mother Kept Custody\u0014\nBy RICHARD G. JONES and COREY KILGANNON\u0014\n\u0014\nThey could have been sleeping. The three children, all in pajamas, \nlay neatly arranged in a bed in their Long Island apartment  Michael \nDemesyeux, 5, on one side; his half-sister, Jewell Ward, 6, on the \nother; and Innocent Demesyeux, 18 months old, in the middle.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt almost looked like they were cuddled up together for the night, \nsaid Detective Lt. Michael Fleming of the Nassau County Police \nDepartment.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the three children had been drowned, Jewells throat had been \nslashed and all showed signs of possible poisoning, the Nassau County \npolice said on Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nassau County police commissioner, Lawrence W. Mulvey, described \nthe chilling scene as most horrific.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven before police officers arrived at the apartment of Leatrice \nBrewer in New Cassel on Sunday morning, they knew that something was \nhorribly wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nMinutes earlier, they said, Ms. Brewer, 27, had calmly called 911 to \nsay that she had killed her sons and daughter. Lieutenant Fleming \nsaid that according to police policy, confessions are usually \nwithheld, but I would like to say that she did admit killing the \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no doubt about it, he added. She even spelled her name \nfor the 911 operator.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen shortly before the police arrived at the brick apartment \nbuilding on Prospect Avenue about 9 a.m., the authorities said she \njumped from the second-floor window, fracturing a vertebra in the \nfall.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Brewers arraignment on murder charges was postponed until \nTuesday on the advice of doctors at the Nassau University Medical \nCenter, according to a spokesman for the district attorney.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the authorities searched for a motive in the slaying, relatives \nand neighbors questioned why Ms. Brewer, who most seemed to agree was \ntroubled, was allowed to retain custody of her children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe father of two of Ms. Brewers children, Innocent Demesyeux, said \nhe had warned officials of the county Child Protective Services about \nher erratic behavior and alleged drug abuse. A child custody hearing \nhad been scheduled in Family Court on Monday.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo people who were briefed on the agencys handling of the case \nconfirmed that there had been many accusations of neglect and abuse \nfiled against the Brewer family in recent years, including one that \nresulted in a visit last Friday. One of them said that workers had \ntried to visit the home on three consecutive days  no one was home \non the first day  before meeting with Ms. Brewer. There were no \nimmediate indications of what caseworkers found.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously something went seriously wrong, and we need to determine \nwhether part of that wrong was with the system itself, said the \nNassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, who promised a full \ninvestigation into the handling of the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Suozzi said that his review would include the Department of \nSocial Services and the Nassau County police.\u0014\n\u0014\nA union representative, Jerry Laricchiuta, said that child welfare \nworkers were jolted by the childrens deaths, but cautioned against \nplacing blame on caseworkers who had apparently investigated \ncomplaints that Ms. Brewer was abusing her children.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Nassau, as in most jurisdictions, child welfare workers \ninvestigating abuse complaints may ask a family court judge for the \nemergency removal of the child from the home if he or she is in \nimminent danger. Those steps were apparently not taken in the Brewer \ncase. Im sure in hindsight, everybody can say that its apparent \nthat something was wrong, Mr. Laricchiuta said. These judgment \ncalls  and thats what they are, judgment calls  can have a \ndevastating effect, either way.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said his office had not yet been in contact with the caseworker, \nwhom agency officials declined to identify.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Laricchiuta said that most caseworkers at the agency were \nburdened with heavy caseloads. Although the Child Welfare League of \nAmerica has indicated that caseworkers should have no more than 12 \nactive cases a month, officials said that the 46 investigators in \nNassau County currently handled about 1,043 cases  an average of 23 \neach.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2006, the last year for which comprehensive statistics are \navailable, there were 5,759 completed investigations into allegations \nof abuse and neglect in Nassau. In 1,512 of those cases, or 26.3 \npercent, the accusations were determined to be valid. The other 4,247 \ncomplaints were classified as unfounded. In New York State, 150,777 \ninvestigations into abuse and neglect allegations were completed for \n2006. Of those, 49,820 or 33.4 percent, were valid and the rest were \nclassified as unfounded.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichard Wexler of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform \nsaid that Nassaus child welfare agency shared many of the same ills \nas other agencies. My general perception of Nassau is that its \nbasically your typical mediocre system, Mr. Wexler said. What you \nread about the system is that its not that its exceptionally bad \nand its certainly no model.\u0014\n\u0014\nHigh caseloads and overburdened workers in the county, Mr. Wexler \nsaid, was a prescription for calamity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey get so overwhelmed that workers make bad decisions in both \ndirections, he said, referring to workers who demand that children \nbe removed from their homes unnecessarily and those who allow \nchildren to remain when they might be in danger.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Prospect Avenue in the hamlet of New Cassel, neighbors were \nstruggling on Monday to reconcile two conflicting images of Ms. \nBrewer, who had six previous arrests  four felony charges and three \nmisdemeanors  which included weapons and assault charges. Some \ndescribed her as doting on her children; others said that she was \ntroubled and battled drug addiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoland Fisher, 22, who said he knew Ms. Brewer and visited her and \nplayed with her children, said she was a loving mother who was \nconstantly cooking for them and planning parties and vacations and \nbuying them presents.\u0014\n\u0014\nI never saw any sign of her being hurtful to her kids, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSatina Fenner, 26, who said she knew Ms. Brewer since grammar school \nand attended middle and high school with her in Westbury, said she \nnoticed that Ms. Brewer became more troubled after her mother died in \n2004, and after Ms. Brewer and Mr. Demesyeux split up months ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople can snap, Ms. Fenner said, and I think she just snapped.\u0014",

She penned \nthose words back in 1959  and, according to the book, she continued \nto wrestle with feelings of doubt for the rest of her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat same year, Mother Teresa wrote to the Archbishop of Calcutta \nabout the things she was feeling: I find no words to express the \ndepths of the darkness.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a 1979 letter, she wrote to Father Michael Van der Peet, a priest \nwho was her spiritual confidant: Jesus has a very special love for \nyou. [But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that \nI look and do not see  Listen and do not hear  the tongue moves [in \nprayer] but does not speak  I want you to pray for me  that I let \nHim have [a] free hand. That letter, incredibly, was mailed just a \nfew months before she went to Oslo, Norway, to claim her Nobel Peace \nPrize.\u0014\n\u0014\nMother Teresa knew, of course, how much people the world over admired \nher for what she was doing, picking up the sick and dying from the \nstreets of Calcutta and caring for them in their last days. She knew \nshe had plenty of admirers who, as soon as she herself died, would \npropose her for sainthood. If I ever become a saint, she wrote, in \nher later years, I will surely be one of darkness.\u0014\n\u0014\nCited by David Van Biema, Mother Teresas crisis of faith, TIME, \nThursday, August 23, 2007; and, James Martin, A Saints Dark Night, \nThe New York Times, August 29, 2007.\u0014",

Four \nyears ago, officials had projected the shift would come in 2050.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe main reason for the accelerating change is significantly higher \nbirthrates among immigrants.

Their humble homes are under \nwater, forcing them onto the roofs. Schools are canceled. Hunger is \nnow intense. Difficult lives have become untenable ones and, if that \nwas not enough, hurricane season has only just reached the \ntraditional halfway mark.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne can see the misery in the eyes of Edith Pierre, who takes care of \nsix children on her roof in the center of Gonaves, a city of about \n300,000 in Haitis north. She has strung a sheet up to shield them, \nsomewhat, from the piercing sun. The few scraps of clothing she could \nsalvage sit in heaps off to a side. Now I have nothing, she said \nbefore pausing a minute, staring down from the roof at the river of \nfloodwater and then saying again in an even more forlorn way: \nNothing.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the home of Daniel Dupiton, who leads the local Red Cross, \ndisplaced relatives, friends and complete strangers have moved in, \nmore than 100 in all, taking up every inch of floor space as well as \nthe surrounding yard. There are official shelters, and then there \nare unofficial ones, like my house, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore misery in Haiti is an almost unfathomable thing. Already the \npoorest place in the Western Hemisphere, it has become even more \ndestitute. Haitians were struggling to feed themselves before the \nhurricanes battered their agricultural lands, killed their livestock \nand washed away their tiny stores of rice. Now, the country will be \neven more dependent on imports, and the high food prices across the \nglobe will only increase the sting.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now  suffering has been turned up a notch.\u0014",

How do you think children view mice today  after Tom and \nJerry? \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Even creatures that are repulsive by nature, by logic, and according \nto Islamic law have become wonderful and are loved by children. Even \nmice.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mickey Mouse has become an awesome character, even though according \nto Islamic law, Mickey Mouse should be killed in all cases.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLast month Mr Munajid condemned the Beijing Olympics as the \"bikini \nOlympics\", claiming that nothing made Satan happier than seeing \nfemales athletes dressed in skimpy outfits.\u0014",

He walked up and \nstood silently next to me, not looking or smiling at me. Then he used \nhis sandaled foot to draw a cross in the dirt.

Videos of \nexecutions are posted on the Internet, as taunts, as warnings. \nCorpses are dumped on playgrounds, with neatly printed notes beside \nthem. And very often, the heads have been removed. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen someone rolled five heads onto the dance floor in a cantina in \nMichoacan state two years ago, even the most hardened Mexicans were \nshocked. Now ritual mutilations are routine. In the border city of \nTijuana, 37 people were slain over the weekend, including four \nchildren. Nine of the adults were decapitated, including three police \nofficers whose badges were stuffed in their mouths. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"There is a new and different violence in this war,\" said Victor \nClark Alfaro, the founder of the Binational Center for Human Rights, \nwho moves around Tijuana accompanied by bodyguards. \"Each method is \nnow more brutal, more extreme than the last. To cut off the heads? \nThat is now what they like. They are going to the edge of what is \npossible for a human being to do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAn estimated 4,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence \nsince 2007, when President Caldern flooded the border and other drug \nhot zones with 20,000 Mexican troops and thousands of federal agents. \nNovember was the bloodiest month so far, with at least 700 killings, \naccording to tallies kept by Mexican newspapers. Some victims had no \nconnection to the drug trade, police say.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"They are making a joke about the authority of the government. All \nthe killings and all so public. They are broadcasting that there is \nno government that can stop them. They are geniuses at marketing. \nThey commit these spectacular murders. They decapitate people. They \nlight people on fire,\" Aguirre said. \"Who is not going to pay \nattention to that?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The hyperviolence, the grotesque acts, the decapitations, dumping \nbodies in schoolyards, going after families, this is the work of what \nI call terrorist mafias,\" said John P. Walters, the White House drug \npolicy chief, who pushed for $400 million in U.S. aid to Mexico to \nfight the drug war. The first part of that money was released \nWednesday.\u0014",

It revealed that the number of Americans who identified \nthemselves as Christians had dropped 10 percent (from 86 percent to \n76 percent) in almost 20 years (1990-2008). \u0014\n\u0014\nThe concern should not be focused on losing power and control. \nSeventy-six percent is still a very healthy majority. The more \nalarming trend is the growing number of Americans who describe \nthemselves as having no religious affiliation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis group has doubled since 1990 and reflects 20 percent of those \nliving on the West Coast and 22 percent of those living in the New \nEngland states.

Hark said after the \nhearing. \"She would have lived.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDanieal _ once a chubby-cheeked child who beamed in photographs taken \non school trips _ had deteriorated in the years since her father \nsplit with a stepmother in Arizona and she returned to her mother's \ncare in Philadelphia. She lost more than half her body weight and \nnever left the dark, squalid house for school or even fresh air.\u0014\n\u0014\nDanieal suffered from cerebral palsy and could not walk. In her last \ndays alive, during an August heat wave, the bedridden girl had flies \nand maggots hovering near her open sores and could muster only enough \nenergy to ask a brother for \"water.\" He begged their mother to call \nan ambulance but was rebuffed, according to the grand jury report.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I do accept my part in my daughter's death. I wish I could have done \nmore than I did to save her,\" Andrea Kelly told a judge Wednesday, as \nan older son listened from the back row, the lone child in \nattendance. The minor-age children have been in foster care since \nDanieal's death.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors will now focus on the remaining defendants, including \nsocial worker Julius Murray, who is charged with involuntary \nmanslaughter, a misdemeanor. Murray worked for MultiEthnic Behavioral \nHealth, a city contractor paid to help DHS provide services to needy \nfamilies.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe grand jury charged that Murray rarely if ever made the required \ntwice-a-week visits and that he and a company owner forged reports to \ncover up their inaction.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Though it was her mother who actually killed her, there are many \nlayers of blame for what happened to Danieal Kelly: from parents, to \ncaseworkers, to supervisors, to administrators,\" states the 258-page \ngrand jury report, issued last year.\u0014\n\u0014\nMurray insists he made the visits, said his lawyer, Will Spade.\u0014\n\u0014\nAssistant District Attorney Ed McCann called such an assertion \n\"ludicrous.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This child's decline cold not have been missed by anyone,\" McCann \nsaid Wednesday. \"If anyone would have been in that house in the \nmonths prior to her death, they would have seen a child starving to \ndeath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe father, Daniel Kelly of Darby, Pa., is charged with child \nendangerment for allegedly deserting his daughter after they moved \nback to Philadelphia.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, the parents have a civil suit pending against the city on \nbehalf of Danieal's estate, a suit the mayor and district attorney \nonce deemed \"obscene.\" Lawyers involved say the likely beneficiaries \nare Danieal's siblings, especially if both parents are convicted.\u0014",

    "title": "MARRIED WITH BANKRUPTCY",
    "words": "IN times of economic crisis, Americans turn to their families for \nsupport. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in \nour sky-high divorce rate. But this wont necessarily represent an \nincrease in happy marriages, nor is the trend likely to last. In the \nlong run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current \ncrisis will probably do the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled \ntogether to survive huge job losses. The divorce rate, which had been \nrising slowly since the Civil War, suddenly dropped in 1930, the year \nafter the Depression began. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the \nwork force was unemployed, it had declined by around 25 percent from \n1929. But this does not mean that people were suddenly happier with \ntheir marriages. Rather, with incomes plummeting and insecure jobs, \nunhappy couples often couldnt afford to divorce. They feared that \nneither spouse would be able to manage alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nToday, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples \nwill risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing \nmarket meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their \nseparations by selling their homes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter financial disasters (and natural ones as well) family members \nalso tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their \ncommunities. In a 1940 book, The Unemployed Man and His Family, the \nsociologist Mirra Komarovsky described a family in which the husband \ninitially reacted to losing his job with tireless search for work. \nHe was always active, looking for odd jobs or washing windows for \nneighbors. Another unemployed man initially enjoyed spending more \ntime with his young children. These mens spirits were up, and their \nwives were supportive. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain. The men \nKomarovsky studied eventually grew discouraged, their efforts \nfaltered, and their relationships with their wives and teenage \nchildren often deteriorated. Across the country, many similar \nfamilies were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale. For \nsome, the hardships of life without steady work eventually \noverwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The \ndivorce rate began to rise again in 1934 when employment picked up, \nproviding some unhappy couples with the income they needed to \nseparate. The rate rose during the rest of the decade as the recovery \ntook hold.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillions of American families may now be in the initial stage of \ntheir responses to the current crisis, working together and \nsupporting one another through the early months of unemployment. \nDuring the Depression this stage seemed to last a year at most. \nToday, it might last longer. Wives now share with their husbands the \nburden of earning money, and the government provides more assistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut history suggests that this response will be temporary. By 1940 \nthe divorce rate was higher than before the Depression, as if a \npent-up demand was finally being satisfied. The Depression destroyed \nthe inner life of many married couples, but it was years before they \ncould afford to file for divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nTodays economic slump could well generate a similar backlog of \ncouples whose relationships have been irreparably ruined. So it is \nonly when the economy is healthy again that we will begin to see just \nhow many fractured families have been created.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew J. Cherlin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, is the author of The Marriage-Go-Round: The State of \nMarriage and the Family in America Today.\u0014",

When he was finally caught, Rosalio Reta told \ndetectives here that he had felt a thrill each time he killed. It was \nlike being Superman or James Bond, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nI like what I do, he told the police in a videotaped confession. I \ndont deny it.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Reta was 13 when he was recruited by the Zetas, the infamous \nassassins of the Gulf Cartel, law enforcement officials say. He was \none of a group of American teenagers from the impoverished streets of \nLaredo who was lured into the drug wars across the Rio Grande in \nMexico with promises of high pay, fancy cars and sexy women. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a short apprenticeship, the young men lived in an expensive \nhouse in Texas, available to kill whenever called on. The Gulf Cartel \nwas engaged in a turf war with the Sinaloa Cartel over the Interstate \n35 corridor, the north-south highway that connects Laredo to Dallas \nand beyond, and is, according to law enforcement officials, one of \nthe most important arteries for drug smuggling in the Americas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young men all paid a heavy price. Jesus Gonzalez III was beaten \nand knifed to death in a Mexican jail at 23. Mr. Reta, now 19, and \nhis boyhood friend, Gabriel Cardona, 22, are serving what amounts to \nlife sentences in prisons in the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther young Americans in their circle who the police say worked for \nthe Zetas have also ended up in prison, have fled into hiding in \nMexico or have disappeared in the permanent way that people wrapped \nup in the Mexican drug trade tend to go missing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the minds of many Americans, the Rio Grande divides Mexico, a \ncorrupt land where drug cartels often seem to have the upper hand, \nfrom the United States, a nation of law and order, where the \nauthorities try to keep criminal gangs in check. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut the reality on the border is much more complex. The Mexican drug \ncartels recruit young men from both countries and operate their \nsmuggling and murder-for-hire rings on both sides of the divide, \nthough under slightly different rules of engagement. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat complexity was reflected in the short but bloody careers of Mr. \nReta, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Cardona, who are linked to crimes in both \ncountries, according to trial transcripts, court documents and \ninterviews with detectives and family members.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two teams of assassins took direction from Lucio Quintero, or El \nViejon, a capo in the Zetas across the river, trial records show. \nThey received $500 a week as a retainer and $10,000 to $50,000 for \neach assassination, and the triggerman was given two kilos of cocaine.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to their retainers, the assassins received perks. At one \npoint, Mr. Reta was given a new $70,000 Mercedes, for a job well \ndone. Family members described how the young men would go to parties \nhosted by cartel capos. To keep up morale, the drug leaders would \nraffle off automobiles, firearms and even dates with attractive \nwomen, the family members said, speaking on the condition of \nanonymity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey Just Seduce You\u0014\n\u0014\nDetective Garcia described Mr. Cardona as the ringleader of the \nAmerican cell of assassins, a savvy, brash young man who orchestrated \nat least five murders in Laredo of people connected to the Sinaloa \nCartel. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a deal with prosecutors, Mr. Cardona eventually pleaded guilty to \nkidnapping two American teenagers  one of whom had drug-gang \nconnections  in March 2006 at a Mexican nightclub, taking them to a \ncartel safe house and stabbing them to death with a broken bottle. \nInvestigators say he had collected the victims blood in a glass and \ntoasted La Santa Muerte, a personification of death worshiped by some \nMexicans. A federal judge sentenced Mr. Cardona to life in prison in \nMarch.\u0014",

I was barely old enough to be in World War II as a teenager. \nAs a PFC in an infantry company in Normandy, my unit was caught in \nheavy artillery fire, and many were wounded -- including me. Now it \nso happened that some of the members of our company were \nMexican-Americans. They spoke Spanish among themselves, and generally \nassociated only with each other, playing games we did not understand, \nand playing a banjo at all hours. We gringos didn't care much for \nthose fellows. It wasn't that they were bad. We just didn't \nunderstand them. We came from the midwest, most of us, and had never \nmet anyone very different from ourselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs heavy artillery fire rained down on our position, casualties were \nheavy, eventually numbering over 100 of the 180 men in our company. I \nmyself was unable to walk and could only lie there until strong arms \ngathered me up and I was carried to safety from the firing. As I \nlooked into the face of my rescuer, I was surprised to realize it was \nthe Mexican-American man whom I had disliked the most. I never saw \nthat man again. I don't even know whether he survived, because when \nhe carried me to safety, he went out again under fire to help some \nother injured soldier. But I learned how shameful my selfish little \nattitude had been, how much I had to learn\u0014",

    "title": "MICHAEL SERVETUS, KILLED BY CHRISTIANS FOR HIS VIEWS",
    "words": "In 1553 Servetus published yet another religious work with further \nanti-trinitarian views. It was entitled Christianismi Restitutio, a \nwork that sharply rejected the idea of predestination and the idea \nthat God condemned souls to Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, \ninsisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself \nthrough thought, word or deed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo Calvin, who had written his summary of Christian doctrine \nInstitutes of the Christian Religion, Servetus' latest book was an \nattack on universally held Christian belief. Calvin sent a copy of \nhis own book as his reply. Servetus promptly returned it, thoroughly \nannotated with critical observations. Calvin wrote to Servetus, \"I \nneither hate you nor despise you; nor do I wish to persecute you; but \nI would be as hard as iron when I behold you insulting sound doctrine \nwith so great audacity.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn time their correspondences grew more heated until Calvin ended \nit.\\[14] Servetus bombarded Calvin with several extraordinarily \nunfriendly letters. \\[15] Thus, Calvin's antagonism against Servetus \nseems to have been based not simply on his unorthodox views but also \non Servetus's tone of superiority mixed with personal abuse. Calvin \nstated of Servetus, when writing to his friend William Farel on 13 \nFebruary 1546:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Servetus has just sent me a long volume of his ravings. If I consent \nhe will come here, but I will not give my word for if he comes here, \nif my authority is worth anything, I will never permit him to depart \nalive (\"Si venerit, modo valeat mea autoritas, vivum exire nunquam \npatiar\").\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 4, 1553 Servetus was arrested by Roman Catholic authorities, \nand imprisoned in Vienne. He escaped from prison three days later. On \nJune 17, he was convicted of heresy by the French Inquisition, \n\"thanks to the 17 letters sent by Jehan Calvin, preacher in \nGeneva\"\\[18] and sentenced to be burned with his books. An effigy and \nhis books were burned in his absence.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeaning to flee to Italy, Servetus inexplicably stopped in at Geneva, \nwhere Calvin and his Reformers had denounced him. On August 13, he \nattended a sermon by Calvin at Geneva. He was immediately recognized \nand arrested after the service\\[19] and was again imprisoned.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf paedobaptism Servetus had said, \"It is an invention of the devil, \nan infernal falsity for the destruction of all Christianity.\"\\[22] In \nthe case the procureur gnral (chief public prosecutor) added some \ncurious sounding accusations in the form of inquiriesthe most odd \nsounding perhaps being, \"whether he has married, and if he answers \nthat he has not, he shall be asked why, in consideration of his age, \nhe could refrain so long from marriage.\" To this oblique imputation \nof unchastity, Servetus replied that rupture had long since made him \nincapable of that particular sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 24 October Servetus was sentenced to death by burning for denying \nthe Trinity and infant baptism. When Calvin requested that Servetus \nbe executed by decapitation rather than fire, Farel, in a letter of \nSeptember 8, chided him for undue lenience. The Geneva Council \nrefused his request. On 27 October 1553 Servetus was burned at the \nstake just outside Geneva with what was believed to be the last copy \nof his book chained to his leg. Historians record his last words as: \n\"Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me.\"\u0014",

Several large counties across the country are experiencing \nunprecedented increases in the number of unclaimed deceased  not \nonly the dead people who could not be identified, were indigent or \nwere estranged from their family, but also apparently the growing \nnumber whose loved ones simply cannot afford to bury or cremate them. \nThe phenomenon has increased costs for local governments, which have \nto dispose of the bodies.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"People were picking the bodies up last year,\" says Albert Samuels, \nchief investigator at the medical examiner's office in Wayne County, \nMich., which includes Detroit. \"Across the board, I'm finding the \nnumbers are on the rise of either families who are not coming forward \nto claim bodies or they're signing releases saying they can't afford \nto bury someone, which taxes the county resources because then the \ncounty is responsible for burying these people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Let's not forget that this is not just a financial issue,\" Murphy \nadds. \"The sense that I get from our investigators is that when \npeople are emotionally strapped already [because of their finances], \nthis is almost like the icing on the cake. It sort of breaks their \nback. It's hard enough when you're dealing with the death of a loved \none. Then add in all the additional social pressures that go along \nwith it, and it can make things seem insurmountable.\"\u0014",

    "title": "MILENNIAL VIEWS OF REVELATION",
    "words": "Postmillennialism says the world will be won to Christ through \naggressive evangelism and missions. Christians will grow more Christ \nlike until He will rule the world through His people in this \ngradually-developed millennial kingdom. Then Christ will return \nbodily to establish a new heaven and a new earth. This view gave \nmajor impetus to the modem mission movement and has recently \nreappeared in modified interpretations.\u0014\n\u0014\n           2. Amillennialism interprets Revelation symbolically to \napply to the constant battle between God and Satan, good and evil, \nand the church and the world until Christ returns bodily at the end \nof time. The millennial kingdom (ch 20) applies to the rule of God in \nbelievers' hearts throughout history. The tribulation period (7:14; \nchs 89) refers to the troubles God's people pass through because \nevil people and forces persecute the church. This view accepts that \nthe seals, trumpets, and vials recapitulate the         continuing \nwarfare between God and Satan. See Series in Revelation Chart.\u0014\n\u0014\n           3. Premillenniallsm has developed two distinct forms\u0014\n\u0014\n                (a)  Dispensational premillenniallsm sees in chapters \n23 the division of history into seven identifiable church ages, the \nlast age representing the present time, that of apostasy. The church \nis raptured at the end of chapter 3. Chapters 422 represent the \nend time after the rapture of the church, that is the deliverance of \nthe church from the great tribulation. The seals judgment (ch 6) \noccurs during the first half of the tribulation period during which \ntime 144,000 Jewish converts will be saved by joining the kingdom \n(rather than by grace though faith; the dispensation of grace will be \nover). The trumpets judgment (chs 8-9) also occurs during the \ntribulation. During the great tribulation, the raptured church will \nbe with Christ receiving assignments of millennial rule after the \ntribulation. During the millennium the Israelite Temple and \nsacrificial system will have been reestablished.\u0014\n\u0014\n              (b)  Historical premlllennialism applies chapters 13 \nto the church of the first century and more generally to later \ncenturies without separating history into different ages, just as \nother Scripture applies to all ages. Chapters 422 deal with events \nfrom Christ's crucifixion to His return and into eternity. The \nrapture (which to them refers to meeting Christ in the air) occurs at \nthe beginning of the millennium at which time Christ returns to \nearth. The seals judgment (ch 6) depicts general historical trends \nleading up to the end. The 144,000 refers to the church on the \nthreshold of the tribulation. (Some say to old Israel.) The trumpets \njudgment (chs 89) refers to a tribulation period in which the church \nis on earth. Jews will be used by God during the tribulation, but \nthey will be saved by grace through faith just as all previous \nbelievers.\u0014\n\u0014\n              Both premlllennial views believe a literal antichrist \nwill appear, and both believe in a literal battle\u0014\nof Armageddon. Christ will rule in a literal millennial kingdom. The \ntwo views differ on the details of the millennial kingdom, the number \nand nature of the resurrection(s) and judgment(s), and on the meaning \nof the New Jerusalem.\u0014",

He wrote \nplays and popular religious books, most notably The Greatest Story \nEver Told in 1949 . \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Oursler used to tell a story from his youth. It was about Anna, a \nformer slave who, after emancipation, was hired by the family for \nmany years. She used to take care of him when he was a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe remembered her sitting at the kitchen table, her hands folded and \nher eyes gazing upward as she prayed, \"Much obliged, Lord, for my \nvittles.\" He asked her what vittles were and she replied that they \nwere food and drink. He told her that she would get food and drink \nwhether or not she gave thanks, and Anna said, \"Yes, we'll get our \nvittles, but it makes 'em taste better when we're thankful.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nShe told him that an old preacher taught her, as a little girl, to \nalways look for things to be grateful for. So, as soon as she awoke \neach morning, she asked herself, \"What is the first thing I can be \ngrateful for today?\" Sometimes the smell of early-morning coffee \nperking in the kitchen found its way to her room. On those mornings, \nthe aroma prompted her to say, \"Much obliged, Lord, for the coffee. \nAnd much obliged, too, for the smell of it!\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYears later, after Fulton had left home, he received a message that \nAnna was dying. He returned home and found her in bed with her hands \nfolded over her white sheets, just as he had seen them folded in \nprayer over her white apron at the kitchen table so many times \nbefore. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe wondered what she could give thanks for at a time like this. As if \nreading his mind, she opened her eyes and gazed at the loving faces \naround her bed. Then, shutting her eyes again, she said quietly, \n\"Much obliged, Lord, for such fine friends.\"\u0014",

    "title": "MR. BOARD BELIEVED THE BIBLE BUT...",
    "words": "Mr. Board believed the Bible, \nbut it wasnt enough\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I hear of a new battle over the Bible, I am reminded of Mr. \nBoard in south Georgia. Years ago, I was the 25-year-old pastor of \nZion Hope Baptist Church in the south Georgia pines near Tifton. The \nchurch building sat serenely on a hill overlooking the road, with the \nparsonage to the left and the cemetery behind it  a little white \nframe sanctuary, joined by a newer fellowship hall and classroom \nbuilding. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sundays about 60-70 people showed up, and they were wonderful \nfolks. Most were farmers, either full-time or in their off-hours, as \nthey struggled to draw a living from the south Georgia soil. Very few \nof our members were well-off financially, but due to their \nfaithfulness the Zion Hope Baptist Church had stood for 114 years in \nthat community. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the congregation was an older lady who always came to church alone \n Mrs. Board. I dont remember her first name now, if I ever knew it, \nbecause I respectfully called her Mrs. Board. One of our deacons \npulled me aside one Sunday, and told me that Mr. Board never came to \nchurch, hadnt been baptized, and was probably not a Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nUndaunted by the prospect of facing an unbeliever in our midst, I \ndecided to go visit Mr. and Mrs. Board. I found their modest frame \nhouse on the unpaved sand road  south Georgia has a lot of sand  \nturned in their driveway, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Board sitting in the \nbackyard. Mrs. Board was snapping beans, and Mr. Board was keeping \nher company.\u0014\n\u0014\nI sauntered up, introduced myself to Mr. Board, greeted Mrs. Board, \nand sat down on the metal chair they pulled up. For several minutes, \nwe made the kind of small-talk folks make in south Georgia  about \nthe weather, the crops, the Atlanta Braves, and finally the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt what I thought was an appropriate pause in the conversation, I \nasked Mr. Board if he had ever committed his life to Christ. He said, \nNo, sir, Ive never done it. Then I said, Mr. Board, do you \nbelieve the Bible? I was ready to whip out my new, pocket-size \nleather New Testament and take Mr. Board on a walk down the Roman \nRoad to Salvation. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo my complete and utter surprise, Mr. Board said, Yes, sir, I \nbelieve every word in it. I was stunned. I probably sat there with \nmy mouth hanging open, because I had never had anyone say this to me \nwho was not a Christian. Frankly, Mr. Board threw me a curve ball, \nand I stood there flat-footed. I couldnt think of a response. In my \nmind, I was trying to figure out how someone could believe the Bible, \nbut not trust Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nI dont remember the rest of the conversation. I just remember \nleaving there confused, and frustrated. As the years have passed, I \nhave thought about what Mr. Board said that day I sat in his \nbackyard. \u0014\n\u0014\nI now realize that Mr. Board was expressing a profound respect for \nthe Bible, but not a personal acceptance of its message. Which is not \nunlike our battles over the Bible  we have head knowledge that has a \nhard time getting to our hearts. \u0014\n\u0014\nA year later, I left that church and never saw Mr. Board again. I \nhope his respect for the Bible eventually became a love for its \nAuthor. Because believing every word in it isnt enough.\u0014\n                            -- Chuck Warnock\u0014",

    "title": "MISISING A PERFECT GAME, WITNESSING A PERFECT GRACE",
    "words": "John Tadlock\u0014\n\u0014\nUntil June 3, 2010 most of us had never heard of Armando Galarraga. \nBut now, even if you are not a baseball fan, you probably know a part \nof his story: Galarraga is the 25-year old journeyman pitcher for the \nDetroit Tigers, who came within one out of accomplishing that rarest \nof baseball achievements, the so-called \"perfect game.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nGalarraga's career record (21-18) was underwhelming to say the least. \nBut he came oh-so-close to doing what had been done twice during the \ncurrent season and only 20 times in the 141-year history of Major \nLeague baseball.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this midweek game, not one of the previous batters had reached \nfirst base. That's when the 27th batter, Cleveland Indians' infielder \nJason Donald, stepped into the batter's box. He proceeded to slice a \ngrounder to the right side of the infield. This forced the first \nbaseman to field the ball, throwing it to Galarraga, who was running \nto cover first. The Tigers and their fans started celebrating. \nEveryone knew Donald was out by a half step. Game over. \u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone, that is, except umpire Jim Joyce. Joyce, inexplicably to \nmost, called Donald safe. The first-base umpire blew the call, ending \nGalarraga's bid for Major League baseball's 21st perfect game.\u0014\n\u0014\nDetroit manager Jim Leyland leapt out of the dugout to protest \nloudly, and many of the fans vainly booed the call. Such protests are \nmostly theater because the only thing rarer than a perfect game is a \nreversed call. Donald remained on first. Galarraga composed himself \nand disposed of the next batter. Twenty-eight up, 27 down. Galarraga \nended up one out shy of the record book.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been a lot of second-guessing following that blown call. \nShould baseball commissioner Bud Selig overturn the umpire's call? \nNo. He said he would not.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould baseball now implement instant replays as there are in \nfootball? Many who understand baseball at its core say no. Why? \nBecause it diminishes the human element in this most human of sports. \u0014\n\u0014\n Sadly, emotions stretched way beyond the lines of propriety. \nGalarraga and Joyce became hot topics on Twitter. At least one \nanti-Joyce Facebook page popped up, and a website was launched with \nthe goal of terminating the services of Joyce as an umpire in the \nmajors. There were reports of death threats against Joyce and some of \nhis family, yet another example of the erosion of civil discourse in \nthis country, even at her highest levels. \u0014\n\u0014\n Happily there is another story to tell. Despite their rarity in \nprofessional sports, every now and again, there is a bright and \nshining moment that provides us with a fleeting glimpse of the \nall-too-rare goodness. \u0014\n\u0014\n In the time since Joyce's blown call, we were able to see, not just \none, but several moments that the less-than-human precision of the \ninstant replay camera would have stolen from us.\u0014\n\u0014\n The first one came immediately after the game, when Galarraga \ncelebrated his team's win, brushing aside questions about the blown \ncall by observing humbly, thankfully and truthfully that this was the \nbest game he had pitched in his career. \u0014\n\u0014\n I know nothing about Galarraga's family of origin, but I am guessing \nthat while he was still very young, he started learning the \nimportance of a healthy self-sufficiency  that sometimes just \nknowing you have done well becomes its own reward. No blame. No \nrecriminations. Just character and grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n We saw another grace moment from umpire Joyce. After he had watched \na replay immediately after the game, he quickly admitted he had blown \nthe call. No excuses. He immediately, emotionally and publicly \napologized to Galarraga. Another deeply moving symbol of character \nand grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n Arguably, the best moment came the next day when Joyce was scheduled \nto be the umpire behind the plate. Each team is responsible for \nbringing the starting lineup to the home plate umpire. Usually the \nmanager, a coach or the team captain does this. \u0014\n\u0014\n But this time Galarraga himself emerged from the Detroit dugout. He \nshook hands with Joyce, who was so emotional that he couldn't speak. \nWith his head bowed, Joyce accepted the lineup card. And with his lip \nclearly trembling and tears glistening in his eyes, he gently touched \nGalarraga on the arm. Some in the crowd booed. Many in the crowd, \ntouched by such an act of extravagant grace and elegance, cheered \nheartily for both.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a very human moment, but it was more than that to me. It was a \nmoment when the membrane that separates heaven from the earth grew \nmuch thinner.\u0014",

    "title": "MASKEPETOON, THE GHANDI OF THE PRAIRIES",
    "words": "Maskepetoon The Indian Chief\u0014\n \u0014\n One evening Maskepetoon was deeply moved by the missionary's address \non our Lord's dying prayer, \"Father, forgive Maskepetoon, the most \npowerful chief of his tribe of North American Indians.\" This chief \nreveled in cunning ambuscades, midnight attacks, and all that goes to \nmake savage warfare. \u0014\n\u0014\n But the Gospel Herald once carried the following story of his \nconversion under the early Methodist missionaries:\u0014\n\u0014\n One evening Maskepetoon was deeply moved by the missionary's address \non our Lord's dying prayer, \"Father, forgive them.\" The next day a \nband of Indians was approaching, in which was the man who had \nmurdered Maskepetoon's only son. His son, sent into a secluded \nvalley, had never returned; and the son's companion said that he had \nfallen over a precipice, though in fact he had murdered him. Unknown \nto the murderer, the tragedy had been witnessed by some Indians who \nlater reported it to the bereaved chief. \u0014\n\u0014\n When the two bands were within a few hundred yards of each other, \nthe eagle eye of the old chief detected the murderer, and, drawing \nhis tomahawk from his belt, he rode up till he was face to face with \nthe man who had murdered his son. \u0014\n\u0014\n Maskepetoon, with a voice tremulous with suppressed feeling, yet \nwith an admirable command over himself looking the man full in the \neyes said: \"You deserve to die. I sent him with you, his trusted \ncompanion. You betrayed my trust and cruelly killed my only son! You \nhave done me and my tribe the greatest injury that is possible. You \ndeserve to die; but for what I heard from the missionary at the camp \nfire last night, I would already have buried this tomahawk in your \nbrains! The missionary told us that, if we expected the Great Spirit \nto forgive, we must forgive the greatest wrong. \u0014\n\u0014\n \"You have been my worst enemy, and deserve to die!\" With deep \nemotion he continued, \"As I hope the Great Spirit will forgive me, I \nforgive you.\" Then, hastily pulling his war bonnet over his face, \nMaskepetoon bowed down over his horse's neck and gave way to an agony \nof tears. \u0014\n\u0014\n For years Maskepetoon lived a devoted Christian life. He preached to \nothers. And after influencing many of his own tribe to turn from \nkilling their enemies, the Blackfeet, he gave them no other weapon \nbut the \"Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n But a bloodthirsty chief of that vindictive tribe [the Blackfeet], \nremembering some of their fierce conflicts of other days, and, \nperhaps, having lost by Maskepetoon's own prowess some of his \nrelatives in those conflicts, seized his gun, and, in defiance of all \nrules of humanity, coolly shot down the converted chieftain. \u0014\n\u0014\n Who can say that forgiveness is not a costly thing? Maskepetoon \nsuffered a broken heart to forgive the murderer of his son. Then it \ncost him his life to forgive his enemies, to go to them unarmed and \npreach to them forgiveness of sin. \u0014\n\n                                                                                       \nPrairie Overcomer\u0014\n\u0014\nFew Aboriginal people enjoy as much recognition in the non-Aboriginal \nworld as Chief Maskepetoon: John McDougall often wrote about \nMaskepetoon's admirable acts; Alberta author and historian Grant \nMacEwan called him \"the Ghandi of the Prairies\"; Sunday school books \nrelate the stories of his ability to forgive; history books associate \nhim with the truce negotiated at Wetaskiwin/Peace Hills; and at Red \nDeer's Collicut Centre he is included in a mural that celebrates the \nregion's past. \u0014\n\u0014\nMaskepetoon is the central figure in many Alberta stories that \nportray him as a model of morality and peace. One such account \ndescribes how Maskepetoon walked into a Blackfoot camp, alone and \nunarmed, to negotiate peace. Big Swan, a war chief, killed him \nimmediately. Maskepetoon was consequently called a \"martyr of peace,\" \na man who died because of his Christian devotion to goodwill and \nnon-violence. However, some Crees interpreted his actions as not \nthose of a peacemaker, but rather those of a warrior who demonstrated \nhis bravery by walking into the enemy camp unarmed and unassisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn additional episode highlights the Chief's remarkable propensity \nfor forgiveness: when Maskepetoon met the Blackfoot man who had \nkilled his father, he invited the man into his lodge, forgave him and \npresented him with a chief's costume.\u0014",

    "words": "Invictus (2009) tells the story of how Nelson Mandela (portrayed by \nMorgan Freeman), in his first term as the president of South Africa, \nshowed unconditional support and enthusiasm for the nation's mostly \nwhite rugby team in an effort to bring about reconciliation in an \napartheid-torn land. But in one scene early in the film, we learn \nthat Mandela's efforts at racial reconciliation did not stop with the \nrugby team. He sought opportunities for reconciliation at every \nturneven in the way he put together his security team.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs this scene begins, we see five black men sitting in a small \noffice. They comprise Mandela's security team. The leader of the \nteam, Jason Tshabalala, says, \"We need more men.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother man asks, \"Did you talk to Brenda about it?\" [Brenda is \nMandela's Chief of Staff.]\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes,\" Jason replies. \"Yesterday.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a knock at the door.\u0014\n\u0014\nThinking it must be a secretary with the president's agenda for the \nday, Jason says, \"Ah! That must be Jessie with the schedule. Come in, \nbeautiful!\" To the team's surprise, four white men dressed in suits \nenter the room.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlarmed, Jason says, \"What's this?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Mr. Jason Tshabalala?\" one of the men says. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's me,\" Jason replies. \"Am I under arrest?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Captain Feyder and team reporting for duty, sir.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"What duty?\" Jason says. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're the presidential bodyguard,\" the man replies. \"We've been \nassigned to this office.\" The man reaches into his jacket and takes \nout a sheet of paper. \"Here are our orders.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nJason takes the sheet and scans it quickly. \"You're Special Branch, \nright?\" [During Apartheid, the Special Branch of the South African \npolice forces was a unit designed to suppress any movements that \nresisted apartheid.]\u0014\n\u0014\nCaptain Feyder nods, confirming Jason's suspicions before quickly \nreferencing once more the papers in Jason's hands: \"You'll see that \nthey've been signed.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Well, I don't care if they are signed,\" Jason says. \"Just wait \nhere.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJason exits the room and the scene shifts to a secretary opening a \ndoor for Jason that leads into Mandela's office. Mandela is seated at \nhis desk.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sorry to disturb you, sir,\" Jason says.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You look agitated, Jason,\" Mandela says.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That's because there are four Special Branch cops in my office.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Oh? What did you do?\" Mandela says.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nothing,\" Jason replies. \"They say they are presidential bodyguards, \nand they have orders signed by you.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nJason hands the papers to Mandela.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ah, yes,\" Mandela says. \"Well, these men have special training. They \nhave lots of experience. They protected de Klerk.\" [F. W. de Klerk \nwas the last president of apartheid-era South Africa.]\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes,\" Jason says, \"but it doesn't mean that they have to.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"You asked for more men, didn't you?\" Mandela says, cutting Jason's \ncomments short.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jason says. \"I asked\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMandela cuts him off again, saying, \"When people see me in public, \nthey see my bodyguards. You represent me directly. The rainbow nation \nstarts here.

Maybe even these four guys in my office tried. And they \noften succeeded.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Yes, I know,\" Mandela calmly replies. \"Forgiveness starts here, too. \nForgiveness liberates the soul.

In recent months, the Food and Drug \nAdministration has been seriously weighing approval of Botox for \ntreatment of chronic migraines, a remedy that has been cited as \nbeneficial in new studies and which was ratified last month in \nBritain. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe charges of illegal marketing cover the first half of this decade, \nbefore the F.D.A.s review. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe settlement also represents the latest in a series of prominent \ndeals by drug makers to resolve criminal and civil allegations, and \nit closely follows news that the federal government has expanded an \ninvestigation into the overseas practices of several big \npharmaceutical companies involving suspected bribery of foreign \nofficials. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn this case, the governments civil complaint said that Allergan had \nillegally, vigorously and, without any thought to the possible \nnegative health effects to which it subjected patients, promoted \nBotox for uses that had not been deemed safe and effective by the \nF.D.A. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe company developed and put in place a wide-ranging marketing \nprogram, according to the complaint, that included paying kickbacks \nto doctors to induce them to prescribe Botox for conditions  like \npain and severe spasms in the limbs of children with cerebral palsy  \nnot included in the drugs label. \u0014\n\u0014\nFederal prosecutors also accused the company of teaching doctors how \nto get reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid for off-label uses by \nputting in the codes for an approved treatment. \u0014\n\u0014\nAllergan denied the kickback and fraud allegations, Caroline Van \nHove, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in an e-mail, calling the \nclaims totally unproven civil accusations. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the settlement, Allergan agreed to plead guilty to one criminal \nmisdemeanor charge and to pay $375 million to the government for \nmisbranding Botox, through promotions for unapproved uses. \u0014\n\u0014\nAdditionally, Allergan agreed to pay $225 million to resolve civil \ncharges that it had caused false claims to be submitted to Medicare, \nMedicaid and other government health programs, although the company \ndenied those allegations.\u0014",

    "words": "Mom's hug revives baby that was pronounced dead\u0014\nPremature infant stirs to life after two hours of 'kangaroo care'\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Michael Inbar  msnbc  9/3/10\u0014\nTODAYshow.com contributor \u0014\n\u0014\nModern medicine often works wonders, but an Australian mom now knows \nfirsthand the true miracle that can come from a mother's touch. \u0014\n\u0014\nKate Ogg was told her newborn son Jamie had died after efforts to \nresuscitate the premature infant had failed shortly after his birth. \nBut when Kate was given the chance to say goodbye to the apparently \nlifeless baby, she and her husband, David, found they were instead \nsaying hello to the newest member of their family.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow 5 months old and healthy, baby Jamie and his twin sister, Emily, \nappeared on TODAY Friday with their proud parents, who told the \namazing tale of what happened to them in a Sydney, Australia, \nhospital last March.\u0014\n\u0014\nLoving embrace \u0014\n\u0014\nKate Ogg told TODAY's Ann Curry that she knew her babies were in \ndanger when she gave birth just 27 weeks into her pregnancy. Daughter \nEmily survived the premature birth, but son Jamie languished  and \nafter 20 minutes of trying to get him to breathe, doctors pronounced \nhim dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Kate was told Jamie didn't make it, nurses placed the baby \nacross Kate's bare chest so Kate and David could reconcile themselves \nto his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wanted to meet him and to hold him and for him to know us, Kate \nOgg told Curry. If he was on his way out of the world, we wanted for \nhim to know who his parents were and to know that we loved him before \nhe died.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut a strange thing happened on their way to farewell. After five \nminutes, Jamie began displaying short, startled movements. As Kate \nand David looked on, his movements became more pronounced.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill, the baby's doctor told the parents any movements were purely \nreflex, and their son was not alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nKate and David nonetheless reveled in their son's movements, even \nthough they believed he was dead. We'd resigned ourselves to the \nfact we were going to lose him; we were just trying to make the most \nof those last precious moments, Kate said.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Ogg told Curry the couple had hoped for an extra minute or \ntwo with their son, but it eventually extended more than two hours. \nBut no one was more surprised than David and Kate when their \nseemingly dead son opened his eyes. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe thought, 'What a blessing, we get to see his eyes before he \npasses away,'  Kate said. But they stayed open!\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that point, the couple began to think their baby might not be dead \nafter all. I think half of us said [then], 'What if he actually \nmakes it?'  David said. If he does, this would just be a miracle. \nThe other half was saying, 'No, he's been declared dead, this is \npurely instinct.' \u0014\n\u0014\n'Kangaroo care' \u0014\n\u0014\nDavid and Kate were practicing what Australians call kangaroo care. \nActually, it is widely practiced throughout the world, especially in \npoorer countries where incubators may not be available for premature \nbabies. An infant is held skin-to-skin to their mother or father, \ngenerating heat for the newborn much like a baby kangaroo receives in \nits mother's pouch.\u0014\n\u0014\nKate had heard of kangaroo care before. [The baby] comes out of you, \nand all of a sudden there isn't the warmth or smell of the mother or \nthe sound of their heartbeat. And so putting him back on my chest was \nas close to him being inside me where he was safe.\u0014\n\u0014\nJamie continued to come around as he lay across Kate's chest. He \nbegan grabbing at his mother's finger, as well as his father's. And \nwhen Kate put a dab of breast milk on her finger, Jamie eagerly \naccepted it. \u0014\n\u0014\nKate finally began to believe her baby was actually alive. We \nthought, 'He's getting stronger  he's not dead,'  she said. But the \nfamily wasn't getting any encouragement from their doctor. While the \nOggs urged hospital personnel to summon him, they were repeatedly \ntold what they were seeing was still just reflex from a baby already \ndeclared dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nKate Ogg told Curry they had to fib to get the doctor to return to \nher bedside. We kept saying, 'He's doing things dead babies don't \ndo, you might want to come and see this,'  she told Curry.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the skeptical doctor still didn't return. So David said, 'Go and \ntell him we've come to terms with the baby's death, can he just come \nand explain it.' That made him come back.\u0014\n\u0014\nKate Ogg told the London Daily Mail the doctor was in disbelief when \nhe arrived back at the bedside. He got a stethoscope, listened to \nJamie's chest and just kept shaking his head. He said, 'I don't \nbelieve it, I don't believe it.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1dr. \nLisa Eiland of the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City told \nNBC News there may actually be a good grounding in science for what \nseemed like a miracle. What's important is the warmth that the \nmother provides and the stimulation that the baby may have received \nfrom hearing the mother's heartbeat, Eiland said. So those are all \nthings that may have helped the baby in terms of going down the path \nto living as opposed to the path of death.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor his part, David Ogg gives all the credit to his very strong, \nvery smart wife for the family's now being able to enjoy raising \nJamie right along with his sister Emily.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe instinctively did what she did, Ogg told The Daily Mail. If \nshe hadn't have done that, then Jamie probably wouldn't be here.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2010 MSNBC Interactive.\u0014",

    "words": "September 10, 1752 \u0014\nMoravians Settled North Carolina\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nToday it takes only a few hours to drive across North Carolina from \neast to west. In the 1750s, the same route was a gruelling trek. On \nthis day, September 10, 1752 (new calendar),* an expedition of \nMoravian men under the leadership of August Gottlieb Spangenberg set \noff from Edenton, North Carolina. They headed west at the invitation \nof John Carteret, the Earl of Granville, proprietor to much of the \ncolony.\u0014\n\u0014\nSpangenberg was a good choice as leader. Born in Prussia, he came \nunder the influence of Count von Zinzendorf, the dedicated leader of \nthe Moravians. (Moravians were exiled Protestants from what is now \nCzechoslovakia.) Spangenberg did not join the Moravians at once, but \nwhen he was dismissed from the theological faculty at the University \nof Halle because of his religious views, he united with the small \nevangelical group. Zinzendorf sent him to America where he negotiated \nland in Georgia for Moravians who expected to be expelled from \nGermany. Spangenberg founded several other Moravian settlements and \neventually became the American bishop for his sect.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Moravian reputation for sober hard work was well-known to \nCarteret. He felt that if he could point to a flourishing community \nof these godly folk on his land, he could attract more settlers. \nAlthough the first English settlement in the New World had been at \nRoanoke, North Carolina, the state lagged behind others in \ndevelopment owing to mismanagement, high taxes and the economic \nrivalry of neighboring Virginia. John Carteret's offer to the \nMoravians aimed to improve matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut December saw the Moravians lost in the mountains. Eventually, \nthey recovered their bearings and selected the best land they could \nfind. They bought 99,000 acres in what is now Forsyth County. \nSpangenberg named the area Wachau after a valley in Austria.\u0014\n\u0014\nHaving staked out their land, the Moravians settled it the next year, \nsending a team of fifteen unmarried men to the region. Among these \nmen were represented all of the essential professions and skills of \nthe day: minister, surgeon, shoemaker, cooper (barrel maker), \nseive-maker, business manager, carpenter and so forth. One secret of \nMoravian success was their practicality.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe little band created their first settlement at a place they named \nBethabara. They cut two and a half miles of road, cleared land, \nplanted crops, made furniture, imported livestock, constructed an \noven for baking, built homes, and even opened a mill. Within six \nyears, there were seventy Moravians living at Bethabara.\u0014\nThe little town's palisade served as a fort during the French and \nIndian War. After the war ended in 1760, the Moravians planted the \ncities of Bethania and Salem.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica's Moravians under Spangenberg were deeply concerned with \nmission work among the Native Americans. In fact, Spangenberg even \nwrote a lengthy pamphlet on missions. His philosophy of missions \ncould be summed up in a few excerpts from that pamphlet. \"In our \nlabour among the heathen, we will particularly endeavor, that they \nbecome converted to Christ Jesus with all their heart.\" And, \"To \ncomprise the whole briefly together, the labors of the brethren among \nthe heathen aim at this, that they might be enabled to say of a \ntruth: 'Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, \nwe die unto the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the \nLord's.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n*Note: Under American reckoning, the date would still have been \nAugust 30. On September 2, 1752, Britain adopted the Gregorian \ncalendar and September 14 followed September 2 in North Carolina. \nHowever, Protestant Germans had adopted the Gregorian calendar 52 \nyears earlier.

    "words": "September 6, 1620 \u0014\nMayflower Sailed, Taking Pilgrims to New England\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most significant chapters in American history opened on \nthis day, September 6, 1620. After failed attempts to sail from \nEngland, leaving behind her sister ship Speedwell, the Mayflower \nsailed from Plymouth for the New World. Aboard were 101 passengers. \nBy today's standards the ship was little bigger than a yacht. Ninety \nfeet long and twenty-six feet wide, it hardly seemed the vessel to \nalter world history.\u0014\n\u0014\nCramped in so small a space and subject to rough weather, the \npassengers suffered a good deal. The sailors cursed the pious \nPilgrims, whom they detested. Food consisted of dried fish, cheese \nand beer. The only sanitary accommodation was a slop bucket. There \nwas nowhere to bathe. Seasickness was rampant during storms. With \nlittle air below decks, the conditions were nauseating at the best. \nDespite this, only one passenger died at sea. However bad matters \nwere aboard ship, they would prove far worse in the \"hideous and \ndesolate wilderness\" which soon confronted them.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo months and five days after sailing, the ship landed at Cape Cod. \nBefore going ashore the Pilgrims signed the famous Mayflower Compact. \nThis not only made them a completely religious entity but broke \npolitical ground, too, in that it placed them under their own \ngovernance while still paying formal respect to the king of England. \nThe compact was essentially a church covenant, signed by most of the \nadult men who were aboard. It probably staved off a mutiny, for \ntensions were running high.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt their destination, the Pilgrims were a long while making up their \nminds where to settle. The sailors grumbled and wanted to force them \noff ship before all the provisions were consumed. Fortunately, some \nof the men who first went ashore found berries and corn which could \nsupplement their rations. The ship remained over winter. Inadequately \nprepared, the Pilgrims died by the dozens. Less than half survived \nthe first winter. Shelter was lacking. The houses they built were of \nwattle and clay. But enough settlers survived to establish a \ncommunity and to open an incomparable chapter in American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe idea of a social contract as embodied in the Mayflower Compact \nwould become important in the theories of John Locke, Rousseau and \nothers. Christian forms had a good deal of influence in shaping the \ncharacter of early American governments which were largely the \ncreation of Christian exiles.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nBradford, William.

    "words": "September 24, 656 \u0014\nMaximus the Confessor Faced Heretics\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nYou are full of pride. You think that you are the only Orthodox \ntheologian, the only person being saved, and that everyone else is a \nheretic and perishing!\" Troilus and Sergius, agents of the emperor in \nConstantinople, leveled their accusation against Maximus, the abbot \nof Chrysopolis Monastery whom they were interrogating.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When all the people in Babylon were worshipping the golden idol, the \nThree Holy Youths* did not condemn anyone to hell,\" retorted Maximus. \n\"They did not concern themselves with what others were doing, but \ntook care only for themselves, so as not to fall away from true \npiety.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe added, \"God forbid that I should condemn anyone, or say that I \nalone am being saved. However, I would sooner agree to die than, \nhaving fallen away in any way from the right faith, endure the \ntorments of my conscience.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nMaximus was a man of great ability. Born in Constantinople around \n580, he was well educated and served as secretary to Emperor \nHeraclius. But in 626, Maximus became a monk. At that time a heresy \nknown as Monothelitism raged in the eastern half of the Roman Empire. \nMonothelites taught that Christ's divine will had swallowed up and \ndestroyed his human will so that in effect he had only one will. \nMaximus stoutly denied this.\u0014\n\u0014\nChrist's incarnation was the whole point of human history, Maximus \nargued, because it was intended to restore the equilibrium lost when \nAdam fell into sin. If Christ was not fully God and fully man, he \nsaid, then salvation was void.\u0014\n\u0014\nInsisting on religious unity among their subjects, emperors tried to \nforce compromise teachings on them. Many eastern bishops accepted \nthese faulty doctrines, published in the Ecthesis and the Typos. \nMaximus rejected both.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of 655, when he was about seventy-five years old, Maximus \nwas sent to Constantinople for trial. Accused of conspiracy and the \nabsurd charge of causing the loss of the emperor's North African \nholdings, Maximus was sent into exile in Thrace, where he suffered \ncold and hunger.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the emperor's command, one of the traitor bishops, Theodosius of \nCaesarea in Bithynia, went to see the old abbot. With him were two \nofficials, Theodosius and Paul. They met on this day, September 24, \n656. Maximus shredded their arguments so thoroughly that the bishop \npromised to submit. Maximus said it was not to him, but to Rome that \nhe must submit. Maximus was a strong advocate of the primacy of the \nPope--a fact that the Roman Church cites in backing up its claim to \nauthority over all Christians. Theodosius argued that the Lateran \nCouncil of 649 was invalid because the emperor never authorized it. \nMaximus replied that if emperors made councils valid, rather than \npious faith, then several rigged councils held by wicked emperors \nmust be accepted even though what they taught was contrary to \nOrthodox faith. The old abbot could not be moved from his staunch \ndefense of true doctrine.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years after this meeting, Maximus, then in his eighties, was \nagain dragged in for questioning. When he refused to buckle to \nSergius and Troilus, they cut out his tongue, lopped off his right \nhand and sent him into exile again. His tough old body had taken all \nthe punishment it could bear: he died that August, unbroken in his \nconfession of the Christ he loved. Because of this, he is called \nMaximus the Confessor. \u0014\n\u0014\n[*Maximus was referring to Shadrack, Mesheck and Abednego, who \nrefused to bow to an image that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.

    "words": "In the Shadow of Mount Hood \u0014\nMeeting God in the mystery of grief. \u0014\nFrank A. James III \u0014\n\u0014\nAn Honest Question posed from a Broken Heart\u0014\n\u0014\nOne question haunts me: Where was God when Kelly was freezing to \ndeath on Mount Hood? For me, it is not whether I should ask such a \nquestion, but how I ask it. One can ask the question in a fit of \nrage, shaking one's fist at God. Many of us, if we are candid, have \ndone that. But once the primal anger settles to a low boil, we \ncanand, I would submit, shouldask the question.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not suggesting that mere mortals can stand in judgment of God or \ncall him to account. God does not report to me. But an honest \nquestion posed from a broken heart is to my mind a good and righteous \nthing.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo ask this hard question is an act of faith. It presupposes a \ngenuine relationship in which the creature actually engages the \nCreator. If God is my Father, can't I humbly ask why he did not come \nto Kelly's rescue? For me, to not ask this question would be a \nfailure to take God seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, where was God? I don't know. i may never know. Perhaps the \nbiggest challenge for my faith is to come to terms with what Martin \nLuther called the hiddenness of GodDeus absconditus. Contemporary \nchristians are often uncomfortable admitting that God sometimes hides \nfrom us. But King David was unafraid to ask, \"Why, O Lord, do you \nstand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?\" (Ps. \n10:1).\u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as I know, God never answered David. Even more bewilderingGod \nwas not only silent, he also commemorated his silence for posterity. \nBy including the Psalms in the Holy Book, God made his hiddenness a \npart of Israel's worship and preserved it for all humanity to ponder. \nIt boggles my mind to imagine throngs of Israelites singing the \nchorus, \"Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?\"year after \nyear, century after century, millennium after millennium. This must \nhave been a gut-wrenching experience, and I suspect it was often sung \nwith tears.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am still trying to make sense of Kelly's death. I don't know why \nGod did not rescue Kelly from the cold grip of the mountain. What I \ndo know is that my relationship with God has entered another \ndimensionone more mystifying and more honest.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity Today, 10/5/10\u0014",

    "title": "MISINTERPRETED SCRIPTURE PROTECTS ABUSERS",
    "words": "Misinterpreted \nScripture Protects Domestic Abusers\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Quentin Kennison\u0014\nOctober 4, 2010 \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile domestic violence occurs in all socio-economic, ethnic and \nreligious communities, there is something particularly heinous about \nits occurrence in Christian communities that claim a high view of the \nBible. One reason for this is the misuse of the Bible as an \ninstrument for promoting rather than preventing the abuse. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the tools the batterer will sometimes use to his (occasionally \nher) advantage is the threat that if a battered spouse chooses to \ndivorce, she (sometimes he) is being disobedient to God. The batterer \nwill justify this position by using passages like Malachi 2:16 (\"'I \nhate divorce,' says the Lord God of Israel ,\") and Matthew 19:1-12 \n(\"anyone who divorces  except for unfaithfulness  commits \nadultery\").\u0014\n\u0014\nIn light of this, and since October is Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, I have been reflecting on some significant words of Jesus in \nMatthew's Gospel. On several occasions Jesus comments on \"binding\" \nand \"loosing\" as indicators of the church's role as witnesses of \nChrist (Matthew 16:19), responding to sin (Matthew 18:18) and of \nreligious leaders who tie down people with unnecessary burdens \n(Matthew 23:4). I have been thinking of these words in connection \nwith what many in the church teach about divorce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two trains of thought on the two main passages under \nconsideration (Matthew 16:19 and Matthew 18:18). One suggests that \nJesus is asserting the priority of heavenly binding and loosing and \nthat the church is only coming to God's preferred conclusion. In \nother words, what is being bound or loosed on earth is a reflection \nof what God has already bound or loosed in heaven. This is an opinion \nthat has merit theologically, though it may be more textually \ndifficult.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other train of thought is that God is giving to the discerning \ncommunity (church) the freedom to act where there is not a precise \nruling in the Scripture. This idea matches the rabbinical traditions \nof Jesus' day and makes a great deal of sense. It suggests the \nfreedom and responsibility of Christians in community to discern \nGod's voice on difficult matters and to live by those choices.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegarding domestic violence and divorce, either application has \nsignificant implications. If we accept the teaching that binding and \nloosing are a reflection of the heavenly, then it seems clear that \nthe civil and religious authorities granting the official divorce \ndecree are doing so in compatibility to what has already been \nacknowledged in God's rule. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we accept the teaching that God's people, in discerning God's will \non these things, have the responsibility to bind or loose, then as \nthe situation warrants we should not prohibit people from divorcing \nabusers as the abuser has already destroyed the marriage covenant \nwith violence. \u0014\nI suspect these interpretations are more compatible than they may at \nfirst appear. Good interpretation makes several assertions.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, that the texts dealing with divorce do not give a clear \nteaching in relation to domestic violence. In fact, most of the texts \nprohibiting divorce are actually intended to protect women (the \npeople most socially vulnerable in both the Old Testament and New \nTestament contexts). Read the context of Malachi 2 in its entirety \nand this becomes clear. The same is true of Matthew 19. \u0014\nIn both settings, husbands were arbitrarily divorcing their wives, \nleaving them vulnerable to poverty, prostitution or worse. The \nteachings were meant to stop such neglectful practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, if, because of the broken covenant, God has already released \na person from a spouse who is intent on beating, demeaning and \nabusing her or him, then we should recognize that the continued \ninsistence that these people are married is an unnecessary burden \nwith which we have bound the abused spouse.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThird, failure to permit, or perhaps even to help, an abused spouse \nget out of an abusive relationship is tantamount to committing the \nkind of hypocrisy for which Jesus condemned the Pharisees. It refuses \nto address the sin of the abuser, allowing him (or her) to continue \nin sin and forfeits our role to be Christ's witnesses of liberty in \nthe world. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is more pronounced for pastoral leaders who maintain the status \nquo and actually abuse Scripture's intent.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a tragedy. Some in our culture surely use it as an easy \nescape hatch. That aside, we must avoid making the assumption that \ndivorce is a sin for the victim of domestic abuse. We must embrace \nthat divorce may be a necessity for these victims. Their lives may \ndepend on it.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuentin Kinnison is a contemporary Christian ministries professor and \nthe program director of Christian ministry and leadership at Fresno \nPacific University.\u0014",

It also threatens the American Dream, insofar as adults \nwho do not get and stay married are less likely to strive, to succeed \nand to save for the future.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis stark assessment emerges from a new report, \\When Marriage \nDisappears: The Retreat from Marriage in Middle America, sponsored by \nthe National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia and the \nCenter for Marriage and Families at the New York-based Institute for \nAmerican Values.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report explores marriage trends among three segments of American \nsociety: high school dropouts (12 percent of the adult population), \nthose with high school diplomas who didn't go on to college (58 \npercent of adults) and college-educated men and women (30 percent). \u0014\nThese segments of society reveal sharp differences in the marriage \nexperience, and expectations for it. But the most striking finding is \nthis: Marriage has declined most precipitously among the \"moderately \neducated\"that is, those with a high school education, who make up \nthe biggest number of adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe breakdown of marriage and family has afflicted the poorest \nAmericans for more than a generation. What is happening today is a \nwidening gulf between the middle class, where a sharp decline in \nmarriage is at work, and the most educated and affluent Americans, \nwhere marriage indicators are either stable or improving.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of us need to adjust our thinking to recognize that the greatest \nthreat to marriage may be the shrinking commitment of couples in \nmiddle class havens such as Wichita, Kansas, or Greenfield, Mass., \nnot in rich enclaves such as Grosse Pointe, Mich., or blighted \nneighborhoods such as East St. Louis. Not surprisingly, the dangers \nposed by a class-based disappearance of marriage also have \nimplications for the decline of religious belief and worship, as well \nas beliefs about the moral or cultural underpinnings of family life.\u0014\n\u0014\n Just as getting married changes individuals, failing to marry delays \nor defers personal maturity. For earlier generations, marriage \nfunctioned as a gateway to acceptance of adult responsibilities and \nhabitsincluding attendance of religious servicesthat reinforce \nthose responsibilities. Narrowing or closing that gateway has \nprofound effects.\u0014\nFor full article, see Word\\My Documents\\Marriage Marginalized in the \nMiddle\u0014",

Heartwarming, isn't it? Or is it? Mary's \nsituation may not be as idyllic as it seems. If Mary was serene and \npeaceful, it was in spite of, not because of her lot in life. She was \npoor. She was young, fourteen, maybe. She was uneducated. She was \npregnant out-of-wedlock. Joseph had lurking suspicions about her \npregnancy. Her mother and father aren't mentioned at all.

    "title": "MELCHIADES, BISHOP OF ROME",
    "words": "December 10, 314 \u0014\n\u0014\nMelchiades Bishop of Rome\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nMelchiades (also known as Miltiades) became Bishop of Rome (pope) in \n311 at a moment when profound events were shaking the world and the \nchurch. He lived only three years longer, but, although he did not \ndie a martyr, he is included in the list of Roman martyrs. This was \nprobably because he suffered under the fierce persecution of the \nEmperors Diocletian and Galerius. During that persecution, an earlier \nBishop of Rome, Eusebius, was sent into exile. For a few months, \nthere was no Bishop of Rome. It was Melchiades who replaced Eusebius.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine rose to power and put an end to the persecution of the \nChristians. That is how it came to be that a new age for the church \ndawned while Melchiades was still pope. One of Constantine's early \nacts was to give the Lateran Palace to the popes. This became the \ncenter from which the Western church administered its affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelchiades was in the thick of that administration, because the first \nmajor split in the church occurred while he was Bishop of Rome. \nDuring the persecutions, some Christians handed over rare pieces of \nScriptures to the government's agents in order to escape torture. \nThis was considered betrayal by other Christians. After the \npersecution was over, these \"weaklings\" wanted back in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Christians, who had suffered torture rather than give up copies \nof Scripture, said the failed Christians should only be let back in \nwith severe penalties.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn North Africa, a number of Christians claimed that bishop Caecilian \nof Carthage had been consecrated by a traitor. Therefore, they argued \nthat he was not a lawful bishop. These North Africans elected a \nbishop of their own. He soon died and Donatus took his place. The \nsplinter sect that they formed became known as Donatists. The \nDonatists said they would break away from other Christians if \nCaecilian was not removed. Constantine asked Melchiades and another \nbishop to handle the matter. At the request of the Donatists, bishops \nfrom Gaul were included in the investigation. (Gaul had not suffered \npersecution and therefore was considered neutral on the issue of \ntraitors.) Melchiades, the bishops from Gaul and some Italian bishops \ninvestigated the situation. They declared Caecilian the legitimate \nbishop.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Donatists carried through their threat and broke away from the \nuniversal church, setting up rival bishops in North Africa. They \nbecame a thorn in Constantine's side. Because of his other \ninvolvements, he had to allow them to exist as an independent sect.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelchiades condemned Donatus but said the other Donatist bishops \ncould keep their offices if they returned to the universal church. \nSt. Augustine, also a North African, later praised Melchiades' \ndecision, calling it very moderate. But the Donatists claimed that \nMelchiades made the decision he made because he himself was a \ntraitor--one of those who had delivered the Scriptures into the hands \nof the persecutors. St. Augustine said there was no grounds for this \nlie.\u0014\n\u0014\nMelchiades died on January 10, 314, but for unknown reasons, his \nfeast on the Roman Calendar is shown on this day, December 10th.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nButler, Alban. \"Pope Saint Miltiades.\" Various editions. \u0014\n\"Condemnation by Pope Melchiades.\" \nhttp://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/heresy05.htm \u0014\n\"Donatism.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

    "title": "MESSIANIC INTERPRETATIONS OF ISAIAH 9:2-7",
    "words": "Usage has affected the form and the content of Isaiah 9:2-7 \ndramatically, and of course, of other religious texts as well. While \nthe precise details of the environment in which Isaiah 9:2-7 had its \norigins are unknown to us, it is likely that life conditions had been \ndifficult for the Israelite people and for their nation. Now, \nhowever, there was reason to be hopeful. A young man, a descendant of \nKing David, was being acclaimed as the new king. There was an \nexpectation that, unlike their recent kings, this one would be wise, \ncompassionate, strengthened by God, as concerned for them as a loving \nfather would be, a king whose reign would be a reign of justice and \nof peace. Unfortunately, the hopes and the dreams of the people were \nnever realized. Once the king had power and authority, his power and \nhis authority were misused and lost and the people again suffered, \nsometimes even more than they had earlier. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the ancient Israelites and the Jews who came after them \nexperienced repeated injustices and hardships, their hopes for an \nideal king repeatedly rose and fell. Especially when for long periods \nof time they had no autonomy as a nation, their hopes and \nexpectations for their own fair and just \"king\" and \"messiah\" were \nembellished by their poets and heroes. The poetic expressions of \nfaith in Isaiah 9:2-7 and in Isaiah 11:1-9 are evidence of their \nefforts and they remain useful as expressions of Messianic \nexpectations for Jews today. For many Orthodox Jews, expectations of \nthe coming of a truly worthy earthly ruler sent by God continue, even \nafter countless disappointments. For most non-Orthodox Jews, these \ntexts are treasured as expressions of the coming Messianic Age of \njustice and of peace, for which they should strive.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor followers of Jesus whose efforts eventually resulted in the \nChristian tradition, these same texts initially provided expressions \nof hope that were similar to those of Jews who did not become \nChristians. Many of these followers of Jesus developed a belief that \nJesus was the ideal Messianic King, not merely human, but also \ndivine. Their usage of Isaiah 9:2-7, and of other Israelite-Jewish \ntexts, affected the form and the content of the texts. Long before \nHandel composed his magnificent \"Messiah,\" and certainly ever since \nthat time, translations of Isaiah 9:2-7, and most of all of the \ntitles given to the ideal king in the latter portion of Isaiah 9:6 \nwere affected for Christians in ways that departed significantly from \nthe texts and translations used by Jews. As is well known, in most of \nour Christian translations into the English language we see the \nadjectives beginning in upper case form as \"Wonderful!\" \"Counselor,\" \nor \"Wonderful Counselor,\" as \"Mighty God,\" \"Everlasting Father,\" and \n\"Prince of Peace.\" The usage has almost indelibly affected the form \nand the content of Isaiah 9:2-7, for Christians differently than for \nJews.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes this mean that we should not use Isaiah 9:2-7 as it has evolved \nfor us? Should we use instead the text only in its most primitive \npossible form? No. We should no more do that than we should use only \nChristmas trees cut live from the forest or make and utilize only \nautomobiles that are like the first horseless carriages. We should \nuse and enjoy fully the text of Isaiah 9:2-7 as we have it, while at \nthe same time fully appreciating and respecting Jews who use it as it \nhas been affected by their\u0014",

Among them was Marie Durand. She had been in the tower \nthirty-eight years.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Tower of Constance stood on swampy land near the Rhone River, in \nAigues Mortes, France, not far from the Mediterranean Sea. Built by \nDuke Philip the Bold, the tower was designed in imitation of \nJerusalem architecture. The stronghold also served as a lighthouse, \nwith a lantern in the top-most tower, known as \"the beacon of \nCharlemagne.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the French Civil Wars between Protestants and Catholics \nfollowing the Reformation, the tower fell into Protestant control. \nBut in 1632 Louis XIII regained it. King Louis XIV converted it to a \nwomen's prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe female prisoners were kept in the upper room. A little light and \nair came through narrow windows. In the center of the floor was an \nopening onto the guardroom below. The authorities saw this as the \nperfect place to hold and torture those they considered to be \nheretics. But at least one prisoner refused to yield. Inscribed on \nthe wall is the slogan \"Register,\" meaning \"Resist!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1730 a fifteen-year-old Huguenot girl was arrested and taken from \nher home in Bouchet-de-Pransles. Her name was Marie Durand; her crime \nwas to have a brother who was a Protestant minister; they held \nProtestant meetings in their home. Pierre Durand was known as the \n\"Pastor of the Desert,\" a reference to the mysterious woman described \nin Revelation 12:6.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnable to lay hands on Pierre, the government arrested Marie's father \nin 1728. Before he was taken to prison, Etienne Durand married his \nyoung daughter to Matthew Serres, whom he hoped could protect her. \nMarie's arrest separated the young couple. Matthew was soon \nimprisoned with his father-in law at a fort. In 1732, Pierre was \ncaptured and hanged.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Marie entered the Tower--so cold in Winter and so hot in \nSummer--it was as if a ray of sunshine had penetrated its darkness \nand despair. Although just fifteen, she became the tireless Christian \nfocus of the Tower, and remained the spiritual leader of the \nprisoners for thirty-eight years. She nursed the ailing, wrote \nletters for those who could not write, and (after a psalter was \nallowed) read psalms aloud each evening. She encouraged her \nfellow-prisoners to sing Huguenot hymns. Not all the women were \nChristians. Some were crude. But the prisoners knew her family; they \nsympathized with her youth and they respected her for her piety. All \nwere blessed through her.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarie wrote to churches and government officials with appeals for \nimproved prison conditions. Her appeals were even relayed to the \nphilosophers Voltaire and Rousseau. Thanks to Marie's efforts, the \nprisoners were allowed a copy of the Psalms and permitted to take air \non the rooftop. She never recanted her faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisgusted with prison conditions, the governor of Languedoc ordered \nthe captives released despite the objections of King Louis XV. After \nher release, Marie returned to her childhood home. Her husband and \nfather were dead. An Amsterdam Walloon church supported her for the \nrest of her life. She died in 1776.\u0014\n\u0014\nSource:\u0014\n\u0014\nLambert, Nadine. \"Marie Durand.\" \nhttp://www.protestants.org/faq/histoire/htm/ durand.htm\u0014\n\"Marie Durand (1712-1776).\" \nhttp://www.protestants.org/faq/histoire/htm/ durand.htm\u0014\nSnyder, Ann.

Where did they get these stories from?\u0014\n          Obviously, a lot of things had happened in Jesuss life, and\u0014\n         his followers must have told stories, but when his followers\u0014\n         converted people to believe in Jesus, these people were then\u0014\n         responsible for telling the stories, and when they converted\u0014\n         people, then those people started telling the stories. These \nwere\u0014\n         stories that were being passed on by word of mouth, year \nafter\u0014\n         year, decade after decade, until somebody bothered to write\u0014\n         them down. It appears that in the process of retelling these\u0014\n         stories, a number of the stories got changed, and many \nstories\u0014\n         actually came to be made up.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          The Gospels came to be written many years after the stories\u0014\n         of Jesus had been in circulation throughout the Roman world.\u0014\n         The earliest accounts we have are the New Testament Gospels\u0014\n         of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These books were actually\u0014\n         written anonymously. The authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke,\u0014\n         and John were highly educated, Greek-speaking Christiansas\u0014\n         opposed to Jesuss followers, who were Aramaic-speaking peas-\u0014\n         ants from Galilee. These authors of the Gospels lived in \ndiffer-\u0014\n         ent parts of the empire several decades after the death of \nJesus.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Reconciling Differences\u0014\n         Well, where did they get their stories from? They got their\u0014\n         stories from the oral traditions that had been in \ncirculation,\u0014\n         and they may well have had written sources at their disposal\u0014\n         that no longer survive. It is clear that these earliest \nauthors\u0014\n         of the Gospels had some sources in common. We know this\u0014\n         because we can compare these Gospels with one another,\u0014\n         and in a number of instancesMatthew, Mark, and Luke, at\u0014\n         leastthey tell the same stories in the same sequence, using\u0014\n         the same wording.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The way that happens is that they were all copying the same\u0014\n         sources (unless you want to say that its a divine miracle, \nwhich\u0014\n         is fine, bu~ if you say its a divine miracle, you can \nexplain the\u0014\n         similarities~ but then you have got to explain the massive \ndif-\u0014\n         ferences between these accounts). For over 150 years, \nscholars\u0014\n         have been convinced that these authors all had the same \nsourc-\u0014\n         es at their disposal, specifically that Mark was the first \nGospel\u0014\n         written, that Matthew and Luke both had access to Marks Gos-\u0014\n         pel and copied a number of its stories. That would explain \nwhy\u0014\n         Matthew and Luke have the same stories in the same sequences\u0014\n         as Mark, but when they tell different stories not found in \nMark,\u0014\n         they occur in different parts of the Gospels, in Matthew and\u0014\n         Luke. They used Mark as a source, and  then plugged in other \u0014\n         sources wherever they felt it was appropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Each of these accountsMatthew,  Mark, Luke, and Johnis \u0014\n         different from  the others, sometimes in minor details that \nare \u0014\n         difficult to reconcile. For example, both Mark and John \nindicate\u0014\n         that Jesus died sometime during the Passover feast.  Marks \u0014\n         Gospel is quite explicit that Jesus died the day after the \nPassover \u0014\n         meal was eaten (Mark 14:12 and 15:25). John is also\u0014\n         quite explicit about which day Jesus died. In Johns Gospel,\u0014\n         Jesus died the day before the Passover meal was eaten (John\u0014\n         19:14). He died on the day of preparation for the Passover. \nThis\u0014\n         is a minor detail, but they disagree, and one would have to \nask,\u0014\n         Why?\u0014\n\u0014\n          Sometimes the emphases differ in these Gospels. For exam-\u0014\n         ple, what did Jesus actually preach? Well, in Marks Gospel, \nhe\u0014\n         preaches about the coming Kingdom of God that people need\u0014\n         to prepare for. He doesnt talk about himself. In Johns \nGospel,\u0014\n         he doesnt talk about the coming Kingdom of God that people\u0014\n         need to prepare for.\u0014\n\u0014\n          In Johns Gospel, Jesus talks about himself, and thats \nabout\u0014\n         the only thing he talks about: Who he is. He is the one who \nhas\u0014\n         come from heaven to reveal the truth that will bring \nsalvation.\u0014\n         Hes the one who has come from above. Well, its a different\u0014\n         emphasis. Sometimes the different emphases have to do with\u0014\n         major points. For example, how did Jesus meet his own death?\u0014\n\u0014\n         According to Marks Gospel, Jesus appears to be quite\u0014\n         disturbed, he is in deep passion, hes anxious about his \u0014\n         coming death. In Lukes Gospel, Jesus isnt anxious at all.\u0014\n         Hes calm and in control until the very end. Well, these\u0014\n         Gospels had different emphases.\u0014\n         \u0014\n         Q and Other Missing Gospels\u0014\n\u0014\n         It is precisely these kinds of differences that make the \nGospels\u0014\n         so difficult for historians to use to establish what actually\u0014\n         happened in Jesuss lifetime. These books were not meant to\u0014\n         be historically objective biographies of Jesus; they were \nmeant\u0014\n         to be proclamations of the good news of the salvation that \nJesus\u0014\n         himself brought. There were, by the way, other Gospels writ-\u0014\n         ten as well, some of which still survive, although the major-\u0014\n         ity of them dont. Some of the earliest accounts of Jesus \nhave\u0014\n         unfortunately been lost, including a document that scholars\u0014\n         have calledsince the 19th centuryQ. Q is a reference to an\u0014\n         early source that no longer survives but at one time \napparently\u0014\n         did exist.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Matthew and Luke borrowed a number of stories from the\u0014\n         Gospel of Mark, but they have other stories. They must have\u0014\n         gotten them from some source. Scholars call this other source\u0014\n         Q from the German word Queue (which means source).\u0014\n         Q, unfortunately, no longer survives, but it was available to\u0014\n         Matthew and Luke.\u0014\n\u0014\n         There are other Gospels, though, outside of the New Testa-\u0014\n         ment, that do survive. Some of them are quite ancient, and\u0014\n         some of them may record historically accurate information\u0014\n         about Jesus. All of these Gospels, whether they are in\u0014\n         the New Testament canon or outside of it, each has\u0014\n         its own personal perspective on the understanding of\u0014\n         Jesus. But in the canonical Gospels, Jesuss death is the\u0014\n         point of the story. The entire Gospels move toward his\u0014\n         death and his Resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Community Books\u0014\n\u0014\n         All of these books, the Gospels both within and out-\u0014\n         side of the New Testament, were meant as community\u0014\n         books, intended to teach Christians in the church\u0014\n         what Jesus said, did, and experienced. Yet they all differ in\u0014\n         their message.\u0014\n\u0014\n          We may think of Christianity today as one thing,\u0014\n         even though we recognize that theres a good deal of\u0014\n         variety in what Christians believe and practice, but in fact,\u0014\n         Christianity is and always has been many different things. \nThe\u0014\n         religion about Jesus is many different things. Thats \nespecially\u0014\n         true in earliest Christianity of the first three centuries, \nas\u0014\n         evidenced in these many Gospels that were written, read, and\u0014\n         revered as sacred books that revealed the truth about what\u0014\n         Jesus said, did, and experienced.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Thus, the religion of Jesus became the religion about Jesus \nas\u0014\n         soon as his followers came to believe that Jesus had been \nraised\u0014\n         from the dead. Then, they began to call him the Son of Man, \nthe\u0014\n         Son of God, the Messiah, the Lord, and they told stories \nabout\u0014\n         him that changed in the process of transmission and were \neven-\u0014\n         tually written down by different people at different times \nwho\u0014\n         had different perspectives of the stories in the Gospels.\u0014",

    "words": "February 14, 269 \u0014\n\u0014\nMartyrdom of St. Valentine\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nToday we exchange cards expressing love or appreciation for one \nanother. According to tradition, on this day, February 14, 269, a \nyoung man named Valentine was executed in Rome for his faith. But \nwhat does our exchange of sentimental cards have to do with a third \ncentury martyr?\u0014\n\u0014\nActually, the connection is not at all clear. Valentine was martyred \nthe day before the pagan festival to the goddess Februata Juno at \nwhich boys drew girls' names for acts of sexual promiscuity. Were \nlegends about the martyr's death modified to replace the heathen \ncustom? No one knows for sure. In fact, there may have been two or \neven three martyrs named Valentine who died in different parts of the \nempire at about the same time. We know little or nothing about any of \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the Roman Valentine as an example. A city gate on the Flaminian \nWay and a chapel near it were named for him. Several ancient \nChristian writers mention his name. There is no doubt he lived and \nwas tortured before being beaten with clubs and beheaded. And yet we \nhave no sure account of why.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome say this Valentine was a young man with a tender heart who aided \nChristians who were undergoing martyrdom. He was not even a Christian \nat the time. Arrested for his activities, he converted to faith while \nin prison and would not renounce it. Knowing he was going to die, he \nwrote letters to his friends saying \"Remember your Valentine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother legend says that the Roman Valentine was a priest who defied \nthe Emperor Claudius's temporary order and secretly married couples \nso the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. Claudius desperately \nneeded more soldiers and did not appreciate this interference.\u0014\n\u0014\nA third legend says the Roman Valentine was a priest who refused to \nsacrifice to pagan gods. Imprisoned for this, he gave testimony in \nprison and through his prayers the jailer's daughter was healed. On \nthe day of his execution he left her a note signed \"Your Valentine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the Middle ages it was popularly believed birds paired in \nmid-February. This also reaffirmed the association of romantic love \nwith Valentine's name. Whatever the truth behind the legends, St. \nValentine's day has become a day we connect with romance and \nfriendship.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"History of Valentine's Day, the.\" History Channel. \n(www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/history.html).\u0014\nHutchinson, Ruth and Adams, Ruth.

    "words": "March 2, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nSuburbs Veneer Cracks: Mother Is Held in Deaths\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ERICA GOODE\u0014\n\u0014\nTAMPA  The Tampa Palms neighborhood here is the kind of place people \nmove to get away from crime. \u0014\n\u0014\nStucco homes with neatly trimmed lawns and spacious lanais nestle \ninside gated villages with names like Lancaster and Oxford Place. \nReal estate agents point out the proximity of topnotch schools, the \n18-hole golf course and other upscale amenities that cater to a \nperpetually-on-vacation-like lifestyle. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut in recent weeks, the residents have become all too aware of how \ndeceptive surface appearances can be. On Jan. 28, the police arrived \nat a two-story house on a quiet cul-de-sac in Tampa Palms to find \nJulie Schenecker unconscious on the patio, blood on her white \nbathrobe. Inside were the bodies of her two children, Calyx, 16, and \nBeau, 13. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Schenecker, 50, the wife of a high-level military intelligence \nofficer, has been charged with the murders. When questioned, police \nsaid, she admitted to shooting her children and complained that they \nwere disrespectful and mouthy and that she was going to deal with \nit. \u0014\n\u0014\nTo the police, the physical evidence suggested a chilling sequence of \nevents. Ms. Schenecker appeared to have shot Beau with a .38-caliber \nhandgun the previous afternoon while driving him to soccer practice, \none bullet piercing the windshield and two striking his body. She \nthen drove home and parked the van in the garage, where his body was \nfound slumped inside the front passenger seat, the seat belt still \nbuckled. Calyx Schenecker was on the computer in an upstairs bedroom \nwhen she was killed. Two bullets hit her, one in the back of the head \nand one in the face. The bodies of both children were covered with \nblankets. \u0014\n\u0014\nInside the house, the police said they discovered handwritten notes \nin which Ms. Schenecker, who has pleaded not guilty to the crimes, \nwrote about killing her children and then killing herself  the three \ndays that she had to wait to receive the gun after buying it, she \nsaid in one note, had delayed the massacre. But she did not turn \nthe gun on herself, and it was unclear why she was unconscious when \nfound. \u0014\n\u0014\nSince the killings, neighbors, teachers and others who knew the \nfamily have struggled to reconcile the outward trappings of a \npicture-perfect suburban life  the car pool, the soccer games and \ntrack meets, the Christmas card photos of a beaming couple with their \ntwo handsome, popular, high-achieving children, the family weekends \nspent boating or skiing  with an act so dark that, as one neighbor, \nMatthew Patchan, put it, theres no words to describe it. It was \nstunning, unthinkable.\u0014\n\u0014\nGary Bingham, who coached Calyx in track and field at King High \nSchool  the fastest freshman I ever coached, he said  knew Ms. \nSchenecker as an attentive mother who picked her daughter up from \npractice, attended team suppers and once surprised him with a \nbirthday cake. He barely recognized the woman shown wild-eyed and \nshaking uncontrollably in a video taken as she was led from the \nhouse. \u0014\n\u0014\nIm just looking at this person saying, Who is that?  he said. In \nthe time he worked with Calyx, he said, the girl never once said \nanything negative to me. Now he is kept awake at night by visions of \nthe shootings. You got to get that stuff out of your mind, he said. \u0014\n\u0014\nDaisy Questell, who taught Beau at Liberty Middle School, searches \nher memory for something she might have missed. But she comes up only \nwith the easygoing boy who teased her about the no-chewing-gum rule, \nnever missed an assignment or got a bad grade and never gave any \nindication of a problem at home. I never heard anything about it, \nand you know how kids are, they say anything, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet such extreme violence rarely comes out of the blue, and since the \nkillings, fragments of information have surfaced that hint that the \nfamilys veneer may have covered a more turbulent reality. Ms. \nSchenecker was involved in a traffic accident in November, her \nMercedes rear-ending a trailer being towed by another car. Florida \nHighway Patrol troopers noted that she showed signs of drug \nimpairment, including dilated pupils and mush-mouthed speech. \nBut she was discharged from the hospital before blood could be drawn, \naccording to the troopers report. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo days later, police detectives were sent to the Schenecker house \nafter Calyx told a counselor that her mother had slapped her in the \nface. Ms. Schenecker did not dispute that she had hit her daughter, \nbut she said that Calyx had called her disgusting and told her, \nYoure not my parent. The detectives concluded that there is no \nevidence of a criminal offense in this case. \u0014\n\u0014\nOthers also noticed small things that at the time seemed \ninsignificant, but now make them wonder. Mr. Bingham, the track and \nfield coach, recalled that sometime in the fall, Calyxs father told \nhim that arrangements would have to be made to pick her up after \npractice because his wife was undergoing rehab. Mr. Bingham did not \ninquire about the treatment. It wasnt my job to ask, as a coach, \nhe said. \u0014\n\u0014\nLisa Pilch, who played Division 1 volleyball with Julie Schenecker at \nthe University of Northern Iowa and kept in touch over the years, \nnoticed at a reunion in 2009 that something seemed different about \nher college friend. I just thought that she was a little subdued, \nMs. Pilch said. I thought her eyes looked a little bit either \ndistant or vacant. \u0014\n\u0014\nForensic researchers who have studied mothers convicted of killing \ntheir children said that such women often leave a trail of clues \nbehind them. In almost every case theres obvious signs, said \nCheryl L. Meyer, a professor at Wright State University whose \nresearch team examined 219 cases of maternal filicide and conducted \nlengthy interviews with 40 of the mothers. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs disturbing as such crimes are, they represent a robust portion of \nchild homicides in the United States. Dr. Meyer found more than 100 \ncases a year of children killed by their mothers in the 1990s, a \nfigure she says is probably an underestimate. Other experts, basing \ntheir numbers on data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, believe \nthat the number may exceed 200 a year, though precise figures are \nelusive because the deaths are often misclassified. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany mothers kill their children through some form of neglect or \nrepeated abuse. But in a quarter of the cases Dr. Meyer studied, the \nmothers purposefully murdered their children. In a notorious 2001 \ncase, Andrea Yates drowned her five children in a bathtub. In 1995, \nDebora Green, a doctor in Kansas, set fire to her house, killing her \n6-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son. When a third child escaped \nonto the roof, Dr. Green told her to jump but made no effort to catch \nher. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe victims in most maternal filicides are infants or younger \nchildren. But mothers who kill purposefully sometimes kill older \nchildren, including teenagers, Dr. Meyer said. Delving into the lives \nof such women, researchers often find histories of mental illness, \nbroken relationships, social isolation or other stresses that may \nhave helped push them into violence. Many are devoted mothers, who \nplan to kill themselves and become convinced that their children are \nbetter off dead than left in the care of others. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeoffrey R. McKee, a forensic psychologist in South Carolina and the \nauthor of Why Mothers Kill, said that in a severely depressed \nstate, it was possible that a mother could misread the normal \nparent-child battles of adolescence. The children can be pretty much \nas they always are, but if Ma has changed, then banter on the part of \nher children can be interpreted as mouthing off, said Dr. McKee, who \nhas conducted forensic evaluations in high-profile cases like that of \nSusan Smith, who was convicted in 1995 of killing her two children.\u0014",

    "words": "March 11, 1829 \u0014\n\u0014\nMaster Mendelssohn Revived Master Bach\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJohann Sebastian Bach believed in the resurrection. The \"crucifixus\" \nof his Mass in B minor ended with low register voices to suggest \nChrist going down into the grave and the next chorus breaks forth in \njoy to express resurrection. Bach's music went through a resurrection \nof its own. Virtually forgotten at his death, the bulk of his work \nlay neglected for almost a century. Fish vendors in the market \nwrapped their ware in Bach manuscripts.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's life was defined by poverty. But in music he poured out \nwealth. Every form he touched, he improved. He perfected the \n\"well-tempered\" scale which by dividing every octave into twelve \nequal distances allowed any key on the organ to start a scale. His \nkeyboard technique used all five fingers where three had been the \nnorm. The Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained \nmusicians such as Beethoven. Beethoven remarked: \"He should not be \ncalled Bach (brook) but Meer (sea).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery note Bach wrote was dedicated to Christ. Throughout his \nmanuscripts appear cryptic abbreviations such as \"I. N. J.\" standing \nfor In Nomine Jesu; that is, \"In the Name of Jesus.\" According to \nhim, music's aim and purpose is to glorify God and provide recreation \nfor the mind. \"Where this is not observed there will be no real music \nbut only devilish hubbub.\" He poured emotion into his music which \nbecame the mother of Romanticism. His portrayals of Christ's passion \nmade frequent use of dissonance. Combining expressive melodies with a \nrhythmic bass line, he conveyed, according to William H. Scheide, \n\"the union of the divine and human in the person of Christ.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat such a man's work fell into neglect was regrettable. Those near \nhim simply did not recognize his genius. Shortly after Bach died one \nBurgomaster remarked unfeelingly, \"The school needed a cantor and not \na Kapellmeister.\" For fifty years no Bach piece was published \nseparately on its own merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nBach's revival was largely owing to another Christian composer. Felix \nMendelssohn was in awe of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. He arranged to \nhave Bach's St. Matthew Passion played on this day March 11, 1829, \nalmost exactly a century from the date of its first, long-forgotten \nperformance. Mendelssohn himself conducted. \"Never,\" wrote one \nparticipant, \"have I known any performance so consecrated by one \nunited sympathy.\" More than 1,000 people were unable to get tickets. \nTwo further concerts had to be scheduled at once. So great was the \nsensation that composer Hector Berlioz marveled, \"There is but one \ngod--Bach and Mendelssohn, his prophet.\" Today many consider Bach the \ngreatest composer who ever lived. Mendelssohn's oratorios Elijah and \nPaul are his own monuments to faith. Mendelssohn died at thirty six, \nworn out with overwork.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Bach, Johann Sebastian.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian \nChurch. Edited by F. L.

The Roman Catholics\u0014\n         (the masses, at any rate) have practically wor-\u0014\n         shiped her, and often Mary stands in the place\u0014\n         of Christ with those~who pray to her and ask her\u0014\n         intercession. As a reaction against this almost\u0014\n         idolatrous attitude towards Mary and the paint-\u0014\n         ings and statues of her, most Protestants neglect\u0014\n         her entirely. \u0014\n\u0014\n             In my book, The Mother of Jesus:\u0014\n         Her Problems and Her Glory, the effort is made\u0014\n         to do justice to her and to try to understand her\u0014\n         attitude toward the great part that she had to\u0014\n         play in the coming of the Messiah. Luke gives\u0014\n         us the annunciation by the angel Gabriel and\u0014\n         how she gave herself to the will of God (Lk.\u0014\n         1:26ff). \u0014\n\u0014\n            The supernatural aspect of the Virgin\u0014\n         Birth of Jesus is told by Luke, the Greek physi-\u0014\n         cian, from Mary's standpoint and by Matthew\u0014\n         from Joseph's point of view (Mat. 1:16, 18-25).\u0014\n         Mary sought sympathy with Elizabeth and found\u0014\n         it, and gave expression to her own ecstasy in the\u0014\n         wonderful Magnificat (Lk. 1:39-56). The con-\u0014\n         duct of Joseph was noble and Mary went with\u0014\n         Joseph to Bethlehem after their marriage be-\u0014\n         cause of the decree of Augustus in the first of\u0014\n         the fourteen-year cycles of the census now known\u0014\n         from the papyri to have lasted several centuries\u0014\n         (Lk. 2:1-7). \u0014\n\u0014\n           Mary was probably of the family\u0014\n         of David as well as Joseph. Mary met with\u0014\n         dignity the emergencies and the honor that came\u0014\n         from the shepherds (Lk. 2:8-20), Simeon and\u0014\n         Anna at the presentation in the temple (1k. 2:\u0014\n         22-38), the visit of the Magi on the return to\u0014\n         Bethlehem (Mat. 2:1-12), the flight to Egypt to\u0014\n         escape~ the anger of Herod (Mat. 2:13-18), the\u0014\n         return to Nazareth and the long years of wait-\u0014\n         ing (Mat. 2:19-23; Lk. 2:39-40). The Boy Jesus\u0014\n         astonished Mary in spite of all the messages of\u0014\n         the angels and her own long broodings (Lk. 2:19,\u0014\n         33, 48-50). But Mary took pride in the power\u0014\n         of God in her wondrous Son (John 2:1-12). \u0014\n\u0014\n           The day came when Mary felt that Jesus was over-\u0014\n         strained and she wanted to take Him home for\u0014\n         a rest. Jesus went on His way to the Cross and\u0014\n         Mary could only watch Him and follow Him till\u0014\n         she stood by the Cross with a sword through her\u0014\n         heart, as Simeon had said would be the case.\u0014\n         But Jesus spoke tenderly to His mother as He\u0014\n         died and commended her to the care of the Be-\u0014\n         loved Disciple who took her from the Cross to his\u0014\n         home. But Mary had the vindication in the\u0014\n         Resurrection of Jesus, and she met in the upper\u0014\n         room with the disciples when they waited for the\u0014\n         coming of the Ho~y Spirit. No woman ever had\u0014\n         such high and holy secrets in her heart and life.\u0014\n         She bore herself in a worthy way as the chief\u0014\n         mother of the human race.\u0014\n                                         .....George L.

She, with the other Mary,\u0014\n         watched the tomb on the Sabbath day (Mat. 27:\u0014\n         61), and late on the Sabbath visited it (Mat.\u0014\n         28:1), and after sunset went and bought spices\u0014\n         (Mk. 16:1), and early Sunday morning came and\u0014\n         saw the empty tomb and ran and told Peter her\u0014\n         fears of a grave robbery (John 20:1-2). \u0014\n\u0014\n             She came back to the tomb after Peter and John had\u0014\n         left, and was the first who saw the Risen Christ,\u0014\n         whom at first she did not recognize till He spoke\u0014\n         her name (John 20:11-18).

Mordecai Ham did just that. However, he was in a position \nto do so only after he had wrestled with his own preferences and \nyielded to God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn on this day, April 2, 1877, in Allen County, Kentucky, he \nresisted God's call to become an evangelist because he wanted to be a \nsalesman. His grandfather and father, both preachers, had lived in \npoverty and Ham did not want that. But eventually the Lord prevailed. \nSix months after Ham married Bessie Simmons, he quit his business to \nenter the ministry as a fundamentalist Baptist.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in his ministry, he claimed to have had an encounter with the \nHoly Spirit so intense that he pleaded for the Lord to back off or he \nfelt he would die. Thereafter, he evidenced spiritual power \nthroughout his life, continually confronting sin and sinners. In one \nnotable early instance, he confronted an infidel who was hiding in a \ncornfield to avoid the preacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are you going to do?\" asked this opponent of the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Ask God to kill you,\" replied Ham. The infidel protested. Ham said \nthat since the man claimed to believe there was no God, such a prayer \nshouldn't bother him in the least. Nonetheless the unbeliever begged \nHam not to pray for his death, so Ham agreed to pray for his \nsalvation instead, and the man was converted on the spot.\u0014\n\u0014\nHam would write that there are three reasons men run from Christ: \nlove of gain, love of sins that make them shun the light, and fear of \nwhat others will say. \"The best way on earth to study human nature is \nto hold up Christ to your crowd and note how He affects them. Each \nman or woman can be judged by his or her attitude toward Christ. If \ntheir deeds are evil, they will shun His light.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1905, four years after Ham entered the ministry, Bessie died \nsuddenly of cerebral meningitis. At first Ham thought he would remain \nsingle like the apostle Paul. However, a couple years later, he fell \nin love with a fourteen-year-old girl.

Ham considered Annie Laurie the greatest of \nGod's blessings to him.\u0014\n\u0014\nHam continued to win souls. In over thirty years of preaching, he won \nat least 300,000 converts (his estimate was close to 1,000,000). \nBilly Graham, perhaps the most notable of those converts, made his \ndeclaration of faith at a 1934 Ham meeting in Charlotte, North \nCarolina.\u0014\n\u0014\nHam was a fierce opponent of alcohol and many other social evils. He \nblasted whatever he considered to be wrong and his preaching helped \ncreate the climate for prohibition. Today, memory of him is largely \nswept under the carpet as an embarrassment because he was also \nvirulently anti-semetic and anti-catholic. The outspoken evangelist \nran a radio program for many years. He died in 1961.

Mary was present at the cross and at \nJesus burial (Matt. 27:56), and was one of the first to discover the \nstone had been rolled away (Matt. 28:1). Mary and the others hurried \nto tell Peter of the resurrection, but Peter had not believed them \n(Luke 24:1012; John 20:13).

    "title": "MARY MAGDALENE, A DEVOTED WOMAN",
    "words": "Mary Magdalene, A Devoted Woman\u0014\n\u0014\nMary lived in Magdala (now called El Mejdel, located south of the \nPlain of Gennesaret on the shores of the Sea of Galilee), an \nimportant agricultural, fishing, and trade center. Suffering from \ndemon possession, Mary met Jesus face to face, an encounter that \nchanged her life. Jesus cast from Mary the seven evil demonic spirits \nthat had ruled and ruined her life (see Mark 16:9). The gospel \nwriters distinguished demon possession from other diseases. The New \nTestament clearly describes symptoms of demon possessionfor example, \nspeechlessness (Matt. 9:33), violence (Matt. 8:28), blindness (Matt. \n12:22), convulsions (Mark 1:26), foaming at the mouth (Luke 9:39), \netc. Mary's demonic possession may have been physical, mental, or \nspiritual illness, or perhaps even immorality (though there is no \ntextual evidence for prostitution on her part).\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter her healing experience, Mary became a devoted follower of \nChrist. Unflappable in her faithfulness, she was counted among the \nsmall group of women who, at their own expense, served Jesus and His \ndisciples as they preached and ministered to the masses.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary became an important leader of the ministering women. Scripture \nmentions her fourteen times. She proved to be a passionate follower \nwho gave her time, energy, and wealth to the Lord's work. She \nfaithfully followed Jesus throughout His ministry. Even when nearly \neveryone fled with fear after Christ's arrest, Mary lingered lovingly \nall the way to the cross and witnessed His painful death. Mary \nremained faithful to Jesus after His burial, long after the others \nhad given up hope. Early one morning, after the Jewish Sabbath ended, \nshe crept through the predawn darkness to the tomb. In her arms she \ncarried the customary spices to prepare the Lord's body for burial.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord richly rewarded Mary for her faithfulness to Him. For when \nshe arrived at the tomb, the heavy stone slab that sealed the \nthree-foot square entrance had been removed. To her horror, Mary \ndiscovered the tomb empty, but her grief turned to joy when she came \nface to face with Jesus, the risen Lord. In His incredible grace, God \nchose a faithful woman, Mary of Magdala, to proclaim to the disciples \nand to the world the glorious life-changing news of the Resurrection \nof Jesus Christ. Imagine her excitement! \"I have seen the Lord!\" she \nshouted with unequaled enthusiasm to the small band of bewildered and \nunbelieving disciples (Mark 16:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Magdalene's devoted faithfulness to Jesus and her announcement \nof Christ's victory over death shouts to women everywhere how an \nencounter with Christ changes a life forever. Mary Magdalene \npersonifies the many women for whom Christ has demonstrated His depth \nof mercy and forgiveness.\u0014\nSee also Matt. 27:56, 61; 28:1; Mark 15:40, 47; 16:9; Luke 8:2; \n24:10; charts on Women and Jesus in His Last Days; Women and Jesus; \nnote on Commitment (Matt. 16)\u0014",

    "title": "MILTON'S TEN POUND EPIC",
    "words": "April 27, 1667 \u0014\n\u0014\nMilton's Ten Pound Epic\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThis date is preeminent in literature for one transaction. On this \nday, April 27, 1667, Milton sold the most magnificent epic in the \nEnglish language, conveying the rights for Paradise Lost to Samuel \nSimmons.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the author was well-known, the sale roused little notice and \nthe book went for a pittance, nor was there any urgency to get it \nthrough the press. Paradise Lost was not be published until August \n20th. Despite this inauspicious start, it would become ranked by many \nnext to the Bible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe blind poet's lofty narrative required twelve books to tell. He \ndealt with the highest dramatic events known to us: the rebellion of \nSatan and the fall of man, both of which he accepted as literal \nfacts. He shows Adam and Eve naive of evil and delighted with the \ngarden of Eden; their sin and consequent woe; and God's promise of \neventual restoration of all things through Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nMilton presented his epic in blank verse, knowing that rhymes would \nmake it trite and weary the ear in that vast span of words. The \nmajesty of iambic pentameter would best suit his conception. \nTheological truths which would not easily bear rhyme would work well \nwith an unobtrusive alliteration. For example, God says of Adam and \nEve:\u0014\n\u0014\n\". . .they themselves decreed\u0014\ntheir own revolt, not I. If I foreknew,\u0014\nForeknowledge had no influence on their fault.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is remarked that Milton achieved his finest effects depicting the \nrebel Satan. A Puritan, Milton participated in the revolt against \nCharles I. No doubt this helped him frame the sentiment he ascribed \nto Satan: \"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heav'n.\" Try as he \nwill to pervert God's purpose, however, Satan is ultimately thwarted; \nevil is transformed by God into the means for good.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who seeks to lessen thee,\u0014\nagainst his purpose serves\u0014\nTo manifest the more thy might: his evil\u0014\nThou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nTo write such lines, Milton must have meditated long on Joseph's \nwords to the very brothers who had sold him into slavery: \"You \nintended it for evil, but God meant it for good, for the saving of \nmany lives.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis work of unparalleled genius earned Milton  5 with promise of 5 \nmore at publication and 5 for each reprinting. According to the \nagreement entered that April day the number of copies to be printed \nwith each impression was limited. \"[The] impression shall be \naccounted to be ended when thirteen hundred books of the said whole \ncopy, or manuscript imprinted shall be sold or retailed off to \nparticular reading customers. . .\" Millions have sold since.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBagehot, Walter. \"John Milton.\" Literary Studies.

    "title": "MORAVIANS AT HERRNHUT",
    "words": "June 17, 1722 \u0014\n\u0014\nMoravians at Herrnhut\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe village of Herrnhut, \"The Lord's Watch,\" (in present day Germany) \ncame about because on this day June 17, 1722 a little band of \nreligious fugitives from Moravia (in the modern Czech Republic) asked \nCount Ludwig von Zinzendorf if they might settle on his land. The \nCount agreed. One Moravian leader was Christian David, a potter who \nburned with zeal for the things of the Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nZinzendorf, too, was a man of deep religious conviction and piety. At \nsix he had written love letters to Christ. Deeply influenced by \nFrancke and Spener's Pietism, the Count was only kept from becoming a \nminister by the raw exertion of family and state authority. \nNonetheless, he and his wife had dedicated their lives completely to \nChrist. Eventually he would be chosen bishop of the Moravians. \nZinzendorf was appalled at the divisions between churches and \nhungered to unite the different factions in a spiritual peace. He was \nthe first to speak of \"ecumenism.\" At Herrnhut he learned what the \nHoly Spirit could accomplish in breaking down denominational walls.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerrnhut had become a gathering place for many religious exiles. \nThese spoke different languages and had differing customs. Creeds \nvaried. Lutherans, Schwenkfelders, Separatists, Reformed and Brethren \nlived side by side. Squabbles developed. Zinzendorf found himself \nmoving from home to home speaking with families of their spiritual \nneed. The people began to study the Bible, hold all-night prayer \nvigils and confess their sins one to another. Zinzendorf established \n\"bands,\" groups of two, three or more who would encourage each other \nspiritually. Plans were drawn up to reorganize and unify the \ncommunity. A sense of expectancy grew.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn August 13, 1727, at a baptism and communion service, the Holy \nSpirit moved through the room. Differences dissolved. All embraced \none another in forgiveness and a spirit of love. Christ became \ncentral to their thinking. They established a twenty-four hour \naround-the-clock prayer vigil which lasted one hundred years. The \nfervent prayers resulted in the sending out of missionaries to many \nlands--the first Protestant missions outside Europe and North \nAmerica. Thus Herrnhut reached out and touched other lands. Moravians \ninfluenced John and Charles Wesley. Moravian missionary zeal prompted \nWilliam Carey's efforts to reach India for Christ. \"See what these \nMoravians have done,\" he said in his appeal to have missionaries \ncommissioned.\u0014\n\u0014\nHerrnhut was a busy and industrious place. Spinning, weaving, \ncarpentry, pottery, farming and missionary training went on \nunceasingly. Each evening Zinzendorf selected a scripture to be the \nwatchword for the next day. Often he wrote a hymn to accompany the \nword. Saturdays and Sundays were days of prayer and worship. Almost \nevery day, each band met to exhort, reprove and pray for one another. \nSingle women and single men lived in separate buildings. In a special \nhome, the children of missionaries were cared for. Truly Herrnhut \nbecame a remarkable experiment in Christian community as well as a \nmajor catalyst for Protestant missions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History Institute. \"The Homeless Piled in; Missionary \nPioneers Poured out.\" Glimpses # 127. \u0014\nLangton, Edward.

    "words": "Witness: Ohio Mom on Trial Said Baby 'Fit Right In' Microwave\u0014\nThursday , January 31, 2008    DAYTON, Ohio  \u0014\n\u0014\nA woman who shared a jail cell with a mother accused of killing her \nbaby by burning her in a microwave oven told a jury Thursday that the \nmom confessed to the crime, saying the month-old girl \"fit right in\" \nthe oven. \u0014\n\u0014\nLinda Williams testified that she developed a sexual relationship \nwith defendant China Arnold when the two were cellmates in the \nMontgomery County Jail in March and that Arnold confided in her about \nwhat happened to her baby.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said Arnold feared her boyfriend believed he wasn't the father of \nthe child and was going to leave her.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She said she put the baby into the microwave and started it and left \nthe house,\" Williams said.\u0014\nWilliams said she asked Arnold how she got the child into the oven.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"She said she fit right in,\" Williams said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSitting at the defense table, the 27-year-old Arnold showed little \nemotion as her trial got under way in the August 2005 death of Paris \nTalley at their Dayton home.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder cross examination by defense attorney Jon Paul Rion, Williams \nacknowledged that she met with police investigators after the \nconversation and initially said Arnold told her she didn't know how \nthe baby had died.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams, who has since been released from jail, said she didn't tell \ninvestigators about Arnold's confession earlier because she had \nfeelings for the mother.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The evidence is going to show that she did not purposely take the \nlife of her own baby,\" Rion said in his opening statement.\u0014\n\u0014\nRion said other people had access to the baby, Arnold was intoxicated \nto the point of blacking out when the child died and people \nquestioned about the case changed their stories. Rion also raised \nquestions about the reliability of the science when it comes to \ndetermining the effect of microwaves on humans.\u0014\n\u0014\nRussell Uptegrove, a forensic pathologist with the Montgomery County \ncoroner's office, said the thermal burns on the baby were different \nfrom those that would have been suffered in a fire, an electrical \nshock or by hot water, an iron or with chemicals. He said it took him \nawhile to consider that the burns may have come from a microwave oven.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was so heinous to think of that, that I couldn't convince myself \nit was a real possibility,\" Uptegrove said.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said DNA recovered from the ceiling of the oven matched that of \nthe baby.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the opening statement by Assistant Montgomery County \nProsecutor Daniel Brandt, a photo of the burned baby was flashed on a \nscreen for the 12-member jury to see. Arnold sat quietly, \noccasionally jotting notes on a yellow legal pad.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrandt said Arnold killed the child after arguing with her boyfriend \nover whether they had been faithful to each other.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the couple brought the baby to the hospital, Brandt said, Arnold \nexclaimed: \"'I killed my baby. I killed my baby.\"'\u0014\n\u0014\nBrandt said Arnold later told police it never would have happened had \nshe not gotten so drunk. He said Arnold, who has been in jail since \nshe was charged in November 2006, told Williams she had killed the \nbaby in the microwave and other inmates that she hadn't meant to do \nit.\u0014",

    "words": "Mary Ann Cotton\u0014\n\u0014\nThrice married 40-year-old former nurse who is regarded as Britains \ngreatest mass murderer.\u0014\nMary Cotton went to West Auckland in County Durham in 1871 with her \nbigamous husband, Frederick, his two stepsons and her own 6-month-old \nbaby. Within two months Frederick died at the age of 39 of gastric \nfever, and a short while later one of Marys lovers, Joseph Natrass, \nmoved in as a lodger.\u0014\nMeanwhile Mary had become pregnant by a local excise officer called \nQuick-Manning. Between 10 March and 1 April 1872 there were three \nmore deaths in Marys house - Natrass , her own baby and her late \nhusbands elder boy, aged 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn 12 July the other cotton stepson died, and a suspicious neighbour \nwent to the police.\u0014\nThe doctor, who had seen the child the previous day, refused to give \na death certificate. A postmortem was carried out, and analysis of \nthe stomach contents proved positive for arsenic. Exhumations of two \nof the other deaths in the Cotton home also showed that arsenic was \nresponsible.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Cotton was charged with murder of her stepson and taken to \nDurham Prison, where her child by Quick-Manning was born. She pleaded \nnot guilty at her trial at Durham Assizes in March 1873. The defence \nline was that the dead boy had been poisoned accidentally by arsenic \ncontained in green floral wallpaper used in his home. But Marys \npurchase of soft soap and arsenic (ostensibly for cleaning bedsteads \nand destroying bedbugs) proved ominous. She was found guilty, and \nsentenced to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe home secretary refused to \\commute the sentence, despite a \nmounting wave of sympathy. Marys baby was taken from her five days \nbefore she was hanged in Durham prison on 24 March 1873. The hangman \ndid his work badly, and it was three minutes before the body stopped \nconvulsing at the rope's end.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Ann Cotton, whose life consisted of a trail of deaths - \ntwenty-one persons close to her died within twenty years - was \nsuspected of 14 or 15 murders. Her motive was either to gain \n\\insurance money or to pave way for a new marriage.\u0014",

    "title": "MARYBETH TINNING, CHILD KILLER",
    "words": "One of the most extraordinary cases of child murder in 20th century \nAmerica took place in Schenectady, N.Y. But unlike the Smith and \nYates cases in which the victims were killed during one tragic \nincident, these events took place over a period of nearly fourteen \nyears. On February 5, 1986, Marybeth Tinning, 43, a local housewife \nand former school bus operator, was arrested and charged with the \nmurder of her 4-month-old daughter, Tami Lynne. As crime stories go, \nMrs. Tinning's tale would have barely made the 6 o'clock news. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Marybeth Tinning was a familiar sight in Schenectady's trauma \ncenters. She usually came running into one of the city's emergency \nrooms, confused and hysterical, typically with one of her babies \ncradled in her arms, either dead or near dead. The medical staff knew \nMarybeth well. Some hated her. Others felt great sorrow and pity for \nher. That's because from January 3, 1972, the day her daughter \nJennifer died, until December 20, 1985, when Tami Lynne was found \ndead in her home, all nine of Marybeth Tinning's children died \nsuddenly and usually without any rational explanation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd no one knew why.\u0014\n\u0014\nA mysterious set of coincidences surrounded the deaths of Marybeth's \nnine healthy children over a period of 14 years. It wasn't that no \none had noticed that all of her children had died. Everyone noticed. \nBut few people, very few, knew all the details of all the deaths. The \nDepartment of Social Services, the Medical Examiner's Office, several \npolice departments, friends, neighbors, family and even the local \nfuneral home had, at one time or another, registered their shock and \ndisbelief at the odd calamity that had befallen the Tinning family. \nIt is true not everyone thought it was a tragedy. Some saw the deaths \nas questionable and even made official reports of their suspicions. \nBut in each and every case, no decisive action was taken against \neither Joe or Marybeth. There was simply no conclusive evidence that \nanything was amiss.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn one of the most bizarre and perplexing murder cases in the history \nof American criminal justice, Marybeth Tinning, now sixty-four, \nappeared before a New York parole board last week. After a \ncontentious trial in 1987, in which Tinning was convicted of the \nmurder of her baby daughter, Tami Lynne, age four months, the former \nschool bus driver was sentenced to twenty years to life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the police investigation that led to that trial, Tinning also \nadmitted to the murder of a son, Nathan, in 1975. But there was so \nmuch more. Police were convinced that Tinning murdered all eight of \nher children over a period of fourteen years. She was later indicted \nin the killing of two of those children, but charges were later \ndismissed for lack of evidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough she was never convicted in any of the other deaths, and it \nseems likely she never will be convicted, suspicions persist that \nMarybeth Tinning is one of America's most unusual female serial \nkillers.\u0014",

    "title": "MODERN-DAY CHILD SACRIFICE",
    "words": "Ethiopia's River of Death\u0014\nA handful of tribal Christians are fighting child sacrifice.\u0014\nMatthew D. LaPlante | posted 8/17/2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe healthy infant boy's top teeth came in before his bottom teeth. \nFor this, elders of the Kara tribe in Ethiopia's primitive Omo River \nregion determined that the child must die.\u0014\nThe child was mingi\"cursed\" according to superstition. With every \nbreath, the elders believed, the boy was beckoning an evil spirit \ninto their village. It was the sacrifice of one child for the good of \nthe entire tribe, a rite that elders had witnessed for untold \ngenerations.\u0014\n\u0014\nLess clear was what to do about the boy's dead twin. After some \ndebate and an examination of goat intestines, the elders decided the \ndead twin must have been mingi too. They dug up the corpse, bound it \nto the living boy, paddled a canoe into the center of the swiftly \nmoving Omo River, and threw them both into the cold, brown waters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was five years ago. Several years ago, regional officials had \nbegun taking actionthreatening prison for those complicit in mingi \nkillings. But at best, officials are equipped to step in only after a \nchild has been murdered. So, in the villages of southern Ethiopia, a \nregion the size of Texas with few roads or infrastructure, a few \nconcerned tribespeople started an orphanage for cursed children. Yet \nthe orphanage is mired in controversy, and meanwhile, few have \nchallenged the underlying fear of mingi.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one small band of Christians in one tribe, along with other \nsupportive Christians, has pledged to protect these cursed children \nuntil mingi is no more. They are determined to show tribal elders \nthat there is something \"stronger than mingi\"the power of Jesus \nChrist. Earlier this year, I traveled to the hard-to-reach Ethiopian \nriver valley to hear their story.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern-Day Child Sacrifice\u0014\n\u0014\nBona Shapo, a tribal elder, took me to where mingi children are being \nsacrificed. He steered his dugout canoe through the \ncrocodile-infested waters of the Omo River, guiding the craft beneath \na crumbling precipice near the stick-and-thatch village of Korcho. \nAcross the river, Colobus monkeys whooped and howled, stirring \nMarabou storks from their perches on a stand of acacia.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is where they do it,\" says Bona, who had stood on these muddy \nbanks the day the boys were thrown into the river.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been little modern research on mingi. Elders single out for \ndeath children who are born out of wedlock, have damaged genitals, or \nwhose top baby teeth emerge before the bottom ones. Kara elders \nbelieve keeping this traditional practice is crucial to tribal \nsurvival. Allowing a mingi child to live among their people, they \nfear, will cause the rains to cease and the sun to grow hotter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If they have mingi, there will be no water, no food, no cattle,\" \nBona says. \"But when they throw the baby away, everything is good \nagain. So yes, it is sad, but we are thinking about the village, the \nfamily, all the people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTribal parents tolerate the killing. After Erma Ayeli gave birth, \nelders took her newborn. She was not permitted to nurse him, hold \nhim, or see him. \"I think he must have been a beautiful boy,\" she \nsays. \"I wanted to keep him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHer chin sinks into the colorful beads draped around her neck. Erma \nstill grieves over her son's deathbut she does not question it. \n\"There was no other option,\" she says.\u0014\n\u0014\nSex outside of marriage is acceptable among the Kara. But if a woman \nbecomes pregnant before participating in a marriage ceremony, as Erma \ndid, her child is considered kumbasoa mingi curse that occurs when \nparents fail to perform the appropriate rites before conceiving.\u0014\nAs Erma speaks, her hands fall to her swollen stomach; she is \npregnant again.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was an accident,\" she cries. \"I don't want to lose this baby, \ntoo.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis time, at least, she has reason to hope that her child might be \nspared. Far from her village is an orphanage for mingi children. Erma \nhas pleaded with village leaders to let her child go there. Either \nway, she will not be allowed to see the baby. \"This time, I think, I \nmight have a girl,\" Erma says.\u0014\n\u0014\nFailed Deterrent\u0014\n\u0014\nThe criminal case of another young mother, Mashi Limo, shows how \ndifficult it is to stop mingi practices. The beads, animal skins, and \njewelry that Mashi once wore have been replaced by a tattered shirt \nand loose-fitting skirt. She is indistinguishable from the other \ninmates at the prison in Jinka, the regional capital.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet everyone in the ragtag penitentiary knows who she is. \"The mingi \nmother,\" says one guard. \"Yes, we all know what happened to her. It \nis very sad.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBack in her Kara village, it is well known that Mashi did not kill \nher cursed infant; she was far too weak after the birth to do so. \nOther women took the baby away.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut when the police arrived, Mashi took the blame. Within days, she \nhad been sentenced to three years in prison. She had no attorney; \nthere was no trial.\u0014\n\u0014\nMashi is conversant only in her native language. She has never been \nto school. When she is finally released, there will be one place to \ngoback to the village. And so, under the watchful eyes of several \nother Kara prisoners, Mashi stands by her story.\u0014\n\"What they say is false,\" she says of those in her tribe who have \nproclaimed her innocence. \"I did it all myself.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked if she deserves to be in prison, the teenager sinks her face \ninto her hands. \"I hate it here,\" she says. \"I wanted to keep my \nbaby. That was not allowed. This is our culture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe government succeeded in putting someone behind bars for a mingi \nmurder, but there has been little deterrent effect. Solomon Ayko, a \nlanky young Kara man who has witnessed several mingi killings, told \nme, referring to tribal elders, \"Before they did it in the open. Now \nit just happens in secret.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is extremely uncommon for police officers to make the arduous trip \nfrom Jinka to any of the far-flung Kara villages. Officers who make \nthe trip discover that villagers strongly support mingi killings.\u0014\n\u0014\nKorcho village elder Ari Lale described to me how some mingi \nkillings, in addition to drowning, are carried out. Some 15 years \nago, a cursed baby had been born. The elders asked Ari to take part \nin the child's execution. \"The baby was crying,\" Ari says, \"so we put \nsand in its mouth, and he was still trying to cry but couldn't \nanymore.\" Soon the child was dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nAri counts his participation in the boy's death as one of his \nproudest memories. \"All the families would thank me for throwing away \nthat baby,\" he says. He and others have found different ways to carry \nout the killings to avoid detection. He says, \"After the baby is \nborn, we keep it alone in the house, and we do not give it water or \nmilk.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWithout nourishment, the infants die quickly. There is little that \ncan be done to prove that a baby wasn't simply stillborn. Ari appears \nto be pleased with this solution. Yet he balances his pride with \nlament. \"They are human,\" he says. For all the praise he got for \ncarrying out the first killing, Ari says, he would have preferred to \nlet the child liveif only there had been another way.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2011 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "MARTIN MARTY SPEAKS ABOUT \"LOVE WINS\" & \"GOD WINS\"",
    "words": "Let's you and him fight! The old comic-book trope is good advice for \nbystanders as Mark Galli's God Wins counters Rob Bell and his book \nLove Wins. The two are respected evangelical leaders, an editor and a \npastor, who attract headlines and readerships as they debate Heaven, \nHell and the Good News. Their subject is a meaningful alternative \nto the otherwise preoccupying evangelicals' debates over \nhomosexuality and abortion. The Good News is a debate over whether \nLove Wins or God Wins, and those who hear the biblical word that \nGod is Love may have trouble telling the players without a program. \nBoth sides agree that this is all about the ultimate fate of human \nbeings, a classic concern of all who believe that there is an \nafterlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat follows is not a taunt but a challenge: let us have a Volume \nTwo, especially from Galli. He offers soft but evangelically-orthodox \nanswers to most questions which Bell posed last year in his book. But \nhe slights the biggest, hardest, most troubling questions about the \nlove and justice of God. He is anthropocentric, of course, but his \nanthro- who asks questions and ponders fate tends to be someone \nfamiliar with the biblical questions with which serious apologists \nfor centuries have dealt as they set out to justify the ways of God \nto man (and woman).\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch are perhaps the hardest questions which concern me and my \npersonal fate, or people who need to get motivated to evangelize \nothers, who worry about predestination and God's foreknowledge and \nthe hardness of heart which the Bible says God causes. Galli is \nhumble about what he knows and does not know, but always punts when \nit gets hard and interesting by saying that God is a loving judge who \nis smarter than we are and who told us enough to get us personally \nthrough our questioning. But here's the challenge: watch the evening \nnews, as we do, showing Somali children starving, parched, dropping \nin the desert, in the arms of a dying mother. By the thousands upon \nthousands. Or walk among the poor of India, by the millions. There is \nno chance. Repeat: no chance, that they or their parents can ever \nhear the Christian good news, to reject or accept it. Galli makes \nmuch of choice. Time is short: there is no way the best-intended \ngospellers can mobilize to reach them. No way. And staying home with \nbooks keeps gospel-recruiters from the desert sands or Indian \nvillages.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly a couple of dozen lines in Galli's book even bring up the \nquestion, which he then drops with some verbal sleight of hand. I'm \nalmost embarrassed bringing this up, so ancient and worn it has \nbecome, but it's here. About the fairness and justice of God, let \nus not too sweepingly dismiss such questions. We Christians, our \nclub, should ask them, since this is one of the ways we get a \ndeeper faith and think more deeply about God in our sanctuaries and \nlibraries. Meanwhile, hour by hour, millions by millions go to hell. \nGalli is sure about hell. Page 95: In the New Testament hell is \nmostly pictured as fire, darkness, destruction, exclusion from the \npresence of the Lord. The point is less to describe hell in detail \nthan to suggest it is a place of torment. In this case, for the \ninnocent. Still: those in hell experience torment for eternity, say \nmost evangelicals, and Galli does not dispute them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm a reporter, columnist, bystander, and don't claim to have \ncredible answers to the questions Bell and Galli pose and to which \nthey would respond. But we need a Volume Two from Galli on these \nreally tough questions. Otherwise, Bell Wins.\u0014",

On this day we honor the memories of \u0014\nthose Americans who have laid down their lives for this nation. In \u0014\nan 1884 Memorial Day speech, Oliver Wendell Holmes Ir., himself a \u0014\nCivil War veteran, described the day's purpose well: \"It is today \nthat \u0014\nwe are most in the presence of the dead ... It is on this day, when \u0014\nwe decorate their graves, they come back and live with us. And for \u0014\nan hour or two at regimental dinners held in their memories, the \u0014\nghosts sitting at the tables are more numerous than the living.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nOriginally called Decoration Day, Memorial Day began follow- \u0014\ning the Civil War. That conflict claimed more American lives than \u0014\nany other war in U.S. history. In 1868, John A. Logan, a retired \u0014\nUnion general, called for a nationwide day of remembrance to be \u0014\nheld on May 30 for the purpose of decorating the graves of com- \u0014\nrades who died in defense of their country. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe day of observance rapidly grew in popularity throughout \u0014\nthe Northern states. By 1890, it was recognized as a holiday in every \u0014\nstate that fought for the Union. Southern states initially refused to \u0014\nhonor their dead on the same day. Sadly, it took another bloody \u0014\nconflict, WWI, to mend that rift. The shared tragedy of losing hus- \u0014\nbands, fathers, and sons on foreign battlefields thousands of miles \u0014\naway brought Americans on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line \u0014\nback together. \u0014\n\u0014\nFrom battlefields to harbors, from country lanes to city streets, \u0014\nfrom the Revolution through the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, more \u0014\nthan 54,600 Virginians have laid down their lives in freedom's \u0014\nname. Most VIrginians are well aware of the painful cost of war. \u0014\nMany Americans will end this three-day weekend enjoying fam- \u0014\nily, fun, and cookouts. That is well and good. But remember this: \u0014\nDespite the ills and issues that seem to be tearing Americans apart, \u0014\nit remains true that far more people from far more places across \u0014\nthe globe still aspire to come to the United States than any other \u0014\nnation that has ever existed. The freedoms we enjoy are the envy \u0014\nof billions. And it is those very freedoms that were paid for with \nthe \u0014\nultimate sacrifice by the men and women we honor this Memorial \u0014\nDay. Enjoy the rest of this holiday weekend and all the weekends \u0014\nto come. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were purchased at a very dear cost.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichmond Times Dispatch editorial  5/29/18\u0014",

    "title": "MANY THOUSANDS GONE -- BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Not feeling a lot of his \"opinions\" and \"interpretations\". He's also \nvery deceptive, so as African people, it's a good idea to make sure \nyou learn info from African Scholars FIRST before reading material by \nWhites. They like to protect their White feelings and give things a \nlittle TWIST.\u0014\n\u0014\nbut you can get some good info, like which regions were known for \nthis and that, but he is very deceptive. Anthony Johnson was declared \na slave owner by the court, but in reality during this point in time, \nheld indentured servants; he was also an indentured servant at one \npoint. In 1641, things changed. Our people have to be VERY careful \nwith the information these people provide, especially books that \ncenter on \"protecting\" White people's feelings all the while trying \nto act as if they are presenting the truth. What many people don't \nknow is that these mixed children were (produced through rape, the \nway he frames this is disgusting), but these children were produced \nand reared to maintain the system. They were used to capture and sell \nnon-mixed Blacks. There are a lot of holes people are missing and \nit's because of books like this. So while its useful for some \ncontent, it's best for Black folks coming into the know to start off \nwith African scholars first and then they can move into these books \nthat have added material that you can glean from, but you'll be more \nprepared and will understand the tactics these people use to deceive \npeople so that folks come away with something different.\u0014\n\u0014\nRed flags like \"race is a social construct\" and that slavery was a \n\"negotiable\" system (I hate this term, I get what he's saying, but I \nhate the term because it's so detached and shifts responsibility a \nbit, and gives a rather crude and ignorant understanding of our \ncondition, but that's to be expected). Silly frames like this distort \nthe picture and some may come away with the wrong conclusion. The \nterm \"negotiable\" leads people to believe that even with all the \nrestrictions and no power, that slavery was open to modification on \nour ancestors' part; he considers revolts, resistance, running away \netc as \"modifiers\" , so sure you could assert your \"choice\" of \nasserting manhood/womanhood as an enslaved African, but death is \nlikely right around the corner. SMH This is a disgusting way to view \nthings, but I imagine it allows room for a certain narrative. On top \nof this, he uses terms like \"CONCEDE\", no these were not \n'CONCESSIONS', this was CONDITIONING...the responses became \nCONDITIONED RESPONSES. This moron needs to go study PSYCHOLOGICAL \nCONDITIONING. To try and break from this took a lot of courage. The \nterms he uses rubs me the wrong way. There was no even playing field! \n(which he admits). There was an imbalance of power, in which we had \nNONE, to assert ANYTHING, we would be KILLED, BEATEN and whatever \nother ungodly ish they chose to enforce upon us! it was absolute \ncontrol with nothing but harsh treatment or death right around the \ncorner for even challenging the system. I don't like the term \n\"negotiable\" like it was something voluntary and discussed, like it \nwas some sort of GIVE AND TAKE where there was COMMON GROUND, there \nwasn't! If there were challenges there were DIRE consequences, this \ntook great courage. I wonder if he'd frame the \"Jewish\" Holocaust in \nthe same manner...doubt it.\u0014\n\u0014\nWere there times when our people confronted the system/induced a \npower struggle/independence as a people? Yes, but this was no \nnegotiating/bargaining! It was RESISTANCE, even the SMALLEST form of \nresistance (overt or covert) is just that, resistance NOT \nNEGOTIATING. They knew the only way out of this was more than likely \nDEATH, so many of them even attempted SUICIDE rather than be \nenslaved. He states we had \"less of a choice\", no we had NO choice, \nas though our conditions rested in our hands without the threat of \nDEATH/TORTURE and the TORTURE of our families. Like it was something \nthat could just be done. Disgusting! He uses words like CONTEST, \nWTF!! This wasn't a game! This book is utterly disrespectful. He goes \non to say that not understanding HIS perspective hinges upon not \nunderstanding the \"limitations humanity placed upon both master and \nslave\" what kind of BS is this?? There was NO HUMANITY involved in \nthis at all. There was no HUMAN COLLECTIVE. In order for there to \nhave been limitations of humanity, you first have to see the other as \nHUMAN. We were seen as \"THINKING PROPERTY\". I am not into all this \n\"we are the world\" bs either! The deal with slavery was predicated \nupon us being seen as inferior, sun-human/non-human.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo I agree that slavery wasn't completely static because of these \ntypes of acts? YES Were there times where my ancestors challenged the \nsystem? Yes. Were these negotiations? HELL NO\u0014\n\u0014\nSlavery didn't make RACE or CLASS, these were elements already \npresent for thousands of years, what CHATTEL AMERICAN slavery/GLOBAL \nWHITE IMPERIALISM/SUPREMACY did was EXPLOIT these two phenomena and \ntether them together.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 13th amendment did not ABOLISH SLAVERY. It TRANSFERRED IT to the \nPENAL SYSTEM.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf I didn't have an interest in the regional work I wouldn't \nrecommend. He's very deceptive. PLEASE READ AFRICAN SCHOLARSHIP FIRST \nBEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. JOHN HENRIK CLARKE, WALTER RODNEY and \nCHANCELLOR WILLIAMS are good starting points! these were not SLAVES \nbeing captured, additionally, AFRICA didn't believe in SLAVERY. \nEuropeans like to EQUATE societal systems to make it seem as though \nall they were doing was CONTINUING what was present in AFRICA. THIIS \nIS A LIE.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nToday most Americans, black and white, identify slavery with cotton, \nthe deep South, and the African-American church. But at the beginning \nof the nineteenth century, after almost two hundred years of \nAfrican-American life in mainland North America, few slaves grew \ncotton, lived in the deep South, or embraced Christianity. Many \nThousands Gone traces the evolution of black society from the first \narrivals in the early seventeenth century through the Revolution. In \ntelling their story, Ira Berlin, a leading historian of southern and \nAfrican-American life, reintegrates slaves into the history of the \nAmerican working class and into the tapestry of our nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nLaboring as field hands on tobacco and rice plantations, as skilled \nartisans in port cities, or soldiers along the frontier, generation \nafter generation of African Americans struggled to create a world of \ntheir own in circumstances not of their own making. In a panoramic \nview that stretches from the North to the Chesapeake Bay and Carolina \nlowcountry to the Mississippi Valley, Many Thousands Gone reveals the \ndiverse forms that slavery and freedom assumed before cotton was \nking. We witness the transformation that occurred as the first \ngenerations of creole slaves--who worked alongside their owners, free \nblacks, and indentured whites--gave way to the plantation \ngenerations, whose back-breaking labor was the sole engine of their \nsociety and whose physical and linguistic isolation sustained African \ntraditions on American soil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the nature of the slaves' labor changed with place and time, so \ndid the relationship between slave and master, and between slave and \nsociety. In this fresh and vivid interpretation, Berlin demonstrates \nthat the meaning of slavery and of race itself was continually \nrenegotiated and redefined, as the nation lurched toward political \nand economic independence and grappled with the Enlightenment ideals \nthat had inspired its birth.\u0014\n--------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Thousands Gone traces the evolution of black society from the \nfirst arrivals in the early seventeenth century through the American \nRevolution. Laboring as field hands on tobacco and rice plantations, \nas skilled artisans in port cities, or as soldiers along the \nfrontier, generation after generation of black slaves struggled to \ncreate a world of their own in circumstances not of their own making. \nIn a panoramic view that stretches from the North to the Chesapeake \nBay and Carolina low country to the Mississippi Valley, Berlin \nreveals the diverse forms that slavery and freedom assumed before \ncotton wa king.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nIra Berlin in \"Many Thousands Gone\" has made a very important \ncontribution to the growing literature attempting to understand both \nthe big picture and the daily details of slavery. As his subtitle \nsuggests, his work focuses on the first two centuries of slavery in \nNorth America.\u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin's primary (and well-documented) thesis is that slave culture \nwas not one monolithic culture, but several different cultures \ndepending upon the era and the area of North American enslavement. \nAdditionally, Berlin highlights that slavery was racist and classist, \nan interpretation which does not minimize the evils of racism, but \nalso exposes the evils of classism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough in other works by the same author, readers find first-hand \naccounts of the horrors of slavery in the words of the enslaved, such \ndocumentation is less evident in this work. An increase in such \ndocumentation would have strengthened the already excellent \"Many \nThousand Gone.\" Still, the overall message and \"feel\" of \"Many \nThousands Gone\" does accurately and powerfully depict the agony and \ninhumanity of African American slavery.\u0014\n\u0014\nBerlin engages the important issue of the slave's choice of or \nrefusal to choose the master's religion. Including a small sampling \nof the slave narratives (the majority of which evidence acceptance of \nChristianity) and the myriad slave conversion accounts, would have \nprovided added depth to this fine book. Converting slaves, by their \nown accounts, did not see themselves as converting to their masters' \nreligion. Instead, they saw themselves rejecting their masters' \nhypocritical distortion of Christianity and receiving Christ and \nChristianity, cleansed of lies and replete with the message of \neternal freedom spirituality and internal freedom in Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the broad panorama of early enslavement, look no further than \n\"Many Thousands Gone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: \nEmbracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual \nDirection , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe myth of slavery derives from the powerful images of the \nminiseries Roots; the notion that black people were simply swept out \nof their African lives, degraded and sometimes killed on the harsh \nway to America and then put to work on a cotton plantation without \npower of any sort.\u0014\n\u0014\nIra Berlin, in this beautifully written and thoroughly researched \nhistory of the first two hundred years of American slavery, \"Many \nThousands Gone\", blows apart that myth. He says that slavery had \ngreat variety, based on geographic, economic and generational \nfactors. The first generation of slaves in America were creoles, born \nof white and African American parents. They frequently lived along \nthe sea and interacted with people of all walks of life, were traders \nand often spoke multiple languages. These slaves frequently stayed \nwith their families, knew and utilized the courts to petition for \nfreedom, they worked with their slave-owners to grow crops and to \nnegotiate payment for their eventual freedom. This changed with \nsubsequent generations who were plucked from central Africa and did \nnot have the same experience with the white world. While slaves in \nthese subsequent generations lost the power to negotiate the terms of \ntheir slavery with their slaveholders, they were able to grab \nautonomy in other ways. They grew and sold goods in cities, they \npurchased their freedom, though often at a high price. They escaped \nand formed maroon armed communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few other factors also played a significant role in determining the \nvirulence of slavery, specifically geography and economics. Some \ncrops like cotton and tobacco were well suited to the plantation \nsystems and in areas where those crops grew well, the slave system \nwas particularly harsh. History was another factor. In the form of \nthe American Revolution it disrupted the plantation system, because \nthe plantation owners, who were often patriots with strong beliefs in \nthe rights of man, also owned slaves and defended their right to do \nso. The loyalists took advantage of this dilemma and often had the \nplantation slaves fighting on the loyalist side in exchange for the \npromise of becoming free men. Sometimes they even delivered on that \npromise.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy only criticism is that I wanted more of a narrative that would \nbring together the various aspects of slavery. I was left with the \nfeeling that American slavery was really Mississippi slavery or South \nCarolina slavery or New York slavery. The legacy of slavery appears \nto be monolithic even if the experience of slavery was not.\u0014",

    "title": "MONASTICISM",
    "words": "Monasticism\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the conversion of Constantine, when martyrdom was no longer a \npossibility, many zealous Christians retreated to the desert to \nembrace the \"white martyrdom\" of the monastic life. As successors to \nthe martyrs, the monks registered a vigorous protest against the \nlaxity and lukewarmness of \"mainline\" Christianity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe father of monasticism was Anthony, an Egyptian hermit (about 250 \nA.D.) whose biography by Athanasius influenced many others to take up \nthe solitary life. The early monks lived alone and gave themselves to \na life of prayer, fasting, and solitude. Most of them were \nlaypersons, not priests; and their practice of strict discipline, \ncalled asceticism, was an important witness to the entire church.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Anthony the three most important leaders of the monastic \nmovement were Pachomius, Basil the Great, and Benedict of Nursia. \nPachomius believed that monks should live and work together in \ncommunity. While his ideas were rejected by those who preferred to \nretreat alone to the desert or remain perched high atop a stone \npillar, in time cenobitic (from the Greek koinos bios, \"life in \ncommon\") became the norm in both East and West.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the East the monks followed the rule of Basil, which stressed \nobedience, prayer, and a life of service. Benedict is known as the \n\"Patriarch of Western Monasticism.\" The rule of Benedict, drawn up \naround 480, became the normative guideline for monks throughout the \nMiddle Ages. It set forth the ideals of obedience, humility, daily \nprayer, and manual labor. The motto of the monastic life was ora et \nlabora, pray and work. Benedict avoided some of the extreme \nasceticism of the early hermits, believing that the monastery should \nmore resemble a family than a penitentiary. He also advised that \n\"great care and concern should be shown in receiving poor people and \npilgrims, because in them more particularly Christ is received.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThroughout the Middle Ages there were many forms of the monastic \nmovement. One of the most important of these was associated with the \ninfluential monastery of Cluny in eastern France. Founded in 909, \nthis monastery became the \"mother house\" of over one thousand \naffiliated communities. A series of strong abbots, including Odo and \nPeter the Venerable, called for a stricter observance of the monastic \nlife and imposed a uniform liturgy of prayer on the monks under their \ncontrol.\u0014\n\u0014\nBernard of Clairvaux (10901153) was perhaps the leading monastic \nfigure of the entire Middle Ages. Bernard founded a new order of \nmonks, the Cistercians, and called for a return to a literal \nobservance of Benedict's rule. Bernard was a great preacher whose \neighty-six sermons on the Song of Solomon presented a beautiful \npicture of the soul's longing for God. Some of Bernard's hymns, such \nas \"Jesus, The Very Thought of Thee,\" are still sung by Christians \ntoday. Bernard also wielded great power in the church politics of his \nday. He helped to place several popes in power and preached sermons \nurging knights to fight in the second crusade.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise of the mendicant (beggar) orders in the thirteenth century \nmarked a new stage in the spirituality of the Middle Ages. Whereas \ntraditional monks were expected to stay in one place and devote \nthemselves to manual labor and prayer, the mendicants, or friars \n(brothers) as they were also called, moved freely about in the world \nand depended on the charity of others for their survival.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Dominican order was founded by a Spaniard, Dominic de Guzman \n(11701221), whose mission focused on winning heretics and heathen to \nthe true faith through vigorous preaching and a life-style of poverty \nand simplicity. Because of their concern to insure ecclesiastical \northodoxy, the Dominicans were known as \"the Lord's dogs\" (the \nliteral meaning of their name in Latin, domini cani). The Dominicans \nproduced many great scholars, the most notable of whom was Thomas \nAquinas.\u0014\n\u0014\nA very different legacy was forged by Francis of Assisi, who founded \nthe Order of Friars Minor (lesser brothers) in 1209. The son of a \nwealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned a life of ease to identify \nhimself with the deprived. Unlike Dominic he was wary of too much \n\"book learning,\" which he felt would lead to pride. Above all else, \nFrancis's desire was to imitate his Lord, Jesus Christ. Near the end \nof his life, he was reported to have received the stigmata, bleeding \nwounds that resembled the nail and spear prints on Jesus' crucified \nbody. Although Francis's order was approved by the pope, his way of \nlife challenged the power and wealth of the church of his day. He was \na great promoter of peace and made a missionary journey to the East, \nwhere he appeared before a Muslim sultan and sought to convert him to \nChrist. Shortly after his death in 1226, there was a major split in \nthe Franciscan Order between the \"spirituals,\" who insisted on \nfollowing Francis's rule and example literally, and the more moderate \nmajority, who accepted joint ownership of property and a liberal \ninterpretation of the rule. In the sixteenth century the Protestant \nreformers rejected monasticism as a valid Christian life-style. More \nrecently, however, some Protestant groups, such as the Church of \nEngland, have permitted the emergence of monastic orders within their \nranks.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Dockery, D.

No money \ncan heal the wound we have suffered. I have told the accused that I \nwill not withdraw the case until all of them, including Dr. Saira, \nare put behind bars.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nThe accused and their supporters have not threatened or pressured the \nfamily to settle, he said, noting that a trial court is hearing the \ncase. \u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nA postmortem report stated the cause of death as multiple rib \nfractures, which led to haemopneumothorax, or air and blood in the \nchest cavity. The report revealed at least two liters of blood in \nSunil Saleems chest cavity, indicating how brutally he was beaten, \nhis brother said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nTeach These Christians a Lesson\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSunil Saleem on March 26 took his sister Kiran Kashif to the \nemergency labor ward of the Government Services Institute of Medical \nSciences (commonly known as Services Hospital), but Dr. Saira would \nnot tend to her as she was playing on her cell phone and sipping tea, \nAnil Saleem said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nDr. Saira told her to wait outside until she finished her tea, and \nafter waiting for some time while she was in severe pain, the \npregnant woman again went into the ward requesting immediate \nattention. As soon she approached Dr. Saira, the doctor started \ncursing her for not waiting and told a nurse to attend her, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nWhen his sister protested, Dr. Saira started slapping her, throwing \nher on the floor, asking her how dare a Chuhri [a derogatory term \nfor Christians] question her order, Anil Saleem said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nOn hearing the commotion, Anil Saleem, his brother and other \nrelatives entered the ward, but as soon as she saw them, Dr. Saira \nshouted to the other doctors and security guards to lock the wards \ndoors from the inside and teach these Christians a lesson, Anil \nSaleem said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nSome 15 to 20 paramedical staff and security guards and eight to 10 \nyoung doctors lunged at them with iron rods, chairs, leather belts \nand other items and began beating them, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nSunil, a police constable in the National Highway and Motorway \nPolice, tried his best to placate the assailants, but they continued \nto beat him mercilessly, kicking and punching him in the groin and \nchest until he fell unconscious, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nAnil Saleem and the three other men tried to defend themselves, but \nthey were greatly outnumbered and were saved only when police \narrived, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nAfter a delay in treatment, Sunil Saleem died for lack of timely \nemergency medical assistance, he said.\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the doctors fled after the incident, while those who were \npresent paid no attention to our cries to help our dying brother, \nAnil Saleem said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nSunil Saleem left behind his wife and four children  the eldest son \n10, and the youngest barely 3 months old.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nInvestigating officer Khurram Ali Shah was unavailable for comment.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nPolice declared Dr. Saira innocent on the basis of CCTV footage that \nshows she was not involved in the altercation between the family and \nmedical staff members, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nHow can they just absolve Dr. Saira, when it was she who had \ninstigated the attack in the first place? he said. The court has \ndirected the police to re-investigate the case, but they are delaying \npresenting the report on one pretext or the other.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nDespite police indifference, he still hopes the court will give \njustice to the family, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\nPakistan is ranked fifth on Christian support organization Open \nDoors 2018 Word Watch List of the countries where it is most \ndifficult to be a Christian.\u0014",

    "title": "MILLER WRONG ABOUT DATE FOR CHRIST'S RETURN",
    "words": "Miller Wrongly Set Date for Christ's Return\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen will Jesus return? Christ warned that no man knows that day and \nhour. This has not stopped rash theologians from announcing dates. \nAll have subsequently been disappointed by events. One of the most \nprominent prediction makers was Baptist preacher William Miller.\u0014\n\u0014\nMiller gained a large following, predicting that Christ would return \non this day, October 22, 1844. His theories were not far-fetched if \none accepted interpretations in vogue through much of church history. \nThe argument goes something like this: The prophet Daniel's eighth \nchapter speaks of 2,300 days. Many of the greatest scholars of the \nchurch (Augustine and Bede for example) took these days to stand for \nyears. 490 years (the seventy \"weeks\" mentioned in Daniel 9:24) were \n\"cut off\" from the 2,300 years, leaving 1810 years. It was assumed \nthat Christ died early in 31 ad. with 3-1/2 years of Daniel's 70th \nweek still to run. Adding those 3-1/2 years to 31 ad. brings us to \nlate 34 ad, at which time the 1810 remaining years supposedly began. \n1810 + 34 brings us to 1844. Technical considerations placed the date \nin October 1844.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder this interpretation, it seemed possible to match actual \nhistorical events with the sequence of events in Daniel chapter \neleven. Byzantium, the pope, Egypt, Turkey, France and other \ncountries, supposedly fulfilled various predictions derived from the \nBible. The whole argument was developed at length and convinced vast \nnumbers of people.\u0014\nAs many as 100,000 followers gathered at the predicted time in \nmakeshift temples and on hillsides to \"meet the bridegroom.\" Maxwell \nPierson Gaddis attended one of these rallies and reported the result. \nWhen midnight came and Christ had not returned, people grew restless. \nSome walked out. One person said allowance must be made for \ndifferences of latitude and longitude between Palestine and the US. \nAt about one o'clock one of the leaders rose and said \"I never did \nfix upon the precise time myself, and I always told my brethren they \nwould get into trouble if they did; but they would not listen to me, \nbut followed other leaders...I believe the most important thing after \nall is, to be ready...\" \u0014\n\u0014\nHumiliated by what has been called \"The Great Disappointment,\" some \nMillerites shucked their faith completely. Led by Miller, others \nformed the Adventists. The majority returned to more traditional \nchurches. \u0014\n\u0014\n>Resources\u0014\nGaddis, Maxwell Pierson. Foot-Prints of an Itinerant.

    "words": "Michelangelo Unveiled Unfinished Chapel Ceiling\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nAll of Rome waited in expectation. For months, Michelangelo \nBuonarroti had worked in secret. Curiosity was aflame. What had he \naccomplished? Had he succeeded in transferring his skill as a \nsculptor to work with fresco (paint in plaster)? \u0014\n\u0014\nPope Julius II, as impatient as ever, demanded that Michelangelo \nunveil the ceiling of the Sistine chapel although it was far from \ndone. High on the scaffolding, his face just inches from the ceiling, \npaint dripping into his eyes, Michelangelo had completed only the \ncentral vault.\u0014\n\u0014\nJulius prevailed. Down came the scaffold, erected with such labor. On \nthis day, November 1, 1509, the public surged into the chapel to see \nwhat Michelangelo had wrought.\u0014\n\u0014\nPainters could only gape in astonishment. Michelangelo, who had \nearlier revolutionized sculpture, now did the same with painting. His \nnine groups of stories from Genesis stole the breath of \ncontemporaries. He made his figures seem to be in perspective and \ndistributed them across the vault with an astonishing inner rhythm to \ntell the stories of creation, the fall of man, and sacred history. \n(Years later, he added the Last Judgment to the wall behind the \naltar.) His rivals immediately began to ape his techniques.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichelangelo infused much of his art with Christian feeling. An \nadmirer of the reformer Savonarola, his sonnets show that he \ngenuinely desired to know God and considered himself unworthy of him:\u0014\n\u0014\nO my dear God, matched with the much I owe\u0014\nAll that I am were no real recompense:\u0014\nPaying a debt is not munificence. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he had flaws of temper, Michelangelo's art and life reveal \nan individual concerned for God's glory. A contemporary wrote, \n\"Buonarroti, having lived for ninety years, there was never found \nthrough all that time anyone who could with right and justice impute \nto him a stain or any ugliness of manners.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he found dealing with Pope Julius a strain. Once when \nMichelangelo threatened to leave Rome, Julius, in a fury, said he \nwould have him flung from the scaffold. Michelangelo immediately took \nit down and refused to add the gold leaf and touch-ups that Julius \nwanted.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCross, F.

    "words": "Leading Metaphysical Poet Donne Became Dean\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n \u0014\nDeath be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and \ndreadful,\" wrote Donne in one of the many memorable lines he gave us. \n\"No man is an island, entire of itself,\" he also said. He wrote such \nthings in the days of his gray hair. In the recklessness of youth he \nhad lived and written in a different strain. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter frittering his small patrimony, gaining a reputation as a man \nabout town and a poet of naughty lines, he sailed as a bold gallant \nwith Lord Essex on the Cadiz expedition. The expedition did not go \nwell and John returned home no richer than when he left. Lacking \nmoney, he eloped with his employer's niece. Perhaps he hoped for an \nallowance. Instead, he was dismissed into poverty. All doors to \nadvancement closed before him. Forced onto the charity of friends and \nto whatever hackwork his pen could find, he summed up his sorry state \nof affairs in a famous epigram: \"John Donne--Anne Donne--Undone.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDonne contemplated suicide. But when King James I assumed the English \nthrone, Donne's hope returned. He sought preferment. The king \nagreed--and offered him a position in the church. Donne resisted. He \nhad been reared Catholic: his brother had even died as a consequence \nof persecution, and Donne was unsure of his own motives and \nconvictions. James awarded the position to another man.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter some years, Donne made a serious study of theology and accepted \nthe reformed doctrine. James employed him as a private chaplain. Two \nyears later, James elevated him. On this day, November 22, 1621, \nDonne became dean of St. Pauls. From this pulpit, his immense wit and \nintelligence touched the highest level of society. The church was \ncrowded to overflowing when he spoke. Of the depth of his spiritual \nconviction no one can doubt who has examined his religious poetry and \nthe moving \"Hymn to God the Father\" with its pun on his own name:\u0014\n\u0014\nI have a sin of fear, that when I've spun\u0014\nMy last thread, I shall perish on the shore;\u0014\nBut swear by Thyself that at my death Thy Son\u0014\nShall shine as He shines now and heretofore:\u0014\nAnd having done that, Thou hast done;\u0014\nI fear no more.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonne's deep love for Anne left him permanently saddened when she \ndied in her thirties. He was convinced that he caused her death by \ndragging her from a life of ease to poverty. Gloom entered his work \nand he became increasingly morbid. At the end he was so obsessed with \ndeath he even had his portrait painted in shroud. His lines against \ndeath have the ring of bravado.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf all men are diminished by the death of others, so were others \ndiminished by the death of Donne. It was he who wrote the eloquent \nline, \"...never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for \nthee.\" With lines like that to his credit, posterity declares him the \ngreatest of the metaphysical poets.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCollins, Rowland.

But years \nfrom now, when all is said and done, Lowry's most enduring legacy \nwill probably be the beautiful little song that he wrote 18 years ago \nas a meditation for a Christmas program at his church.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1984, the leaders at Lowry's Nashville congregation asked him if \nhe'd be willing to write a musical for Advent. He gladly agreed. \nInspiration came as Lowry focused his heart and mind on the wonder of \nChristmas.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I tried to picture Mary holding the baby Jesus on the first \nChristmas morning and wondered what she was thinking about that \nchild,\" he says. \"She knew he was specialthe Virgin Birth was her \nfirst cluebut could she ever imagine all the things that he would do \nwhile he was here?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSoon, Lowry came up with a series of questions that he would like to \nask Mary: \"Did she know he would walk on water? Raise the dead? Give \nsight to the blind?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLowry decided to use the questions as a monologue to be recited \nbetween the scenes of his musical. But the profundity of those \nquestions lingered in his mind long after the church musical was done.\u0014\n\u0014\nSix years later, harmonica virtuoso Buddy Greene supplied just the \nright music and \"Mary, Did You Know?\" was complete.\u0014\n\u0014\nSince then, Lowry and Greene's tune has become a modern classic. It \nhas been recorded by more than 30 different artists (besides Lowry), \nincluding Kenny Rogers, Kathleen Battle, and Reba McEntire.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I hear from a lot of people who have sung it in the church choir for \nChristmas and Easter programs,\" says Lowry. \"When I wrote it, I felt \nthere was something special there, but I never imagined how \nwide-reaching it would become.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nby Mark Lowry and Buddy Greene  1991 Word Music/Rufus Music/ascap. \nUsed by permission.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Today's Christian magazine (formerly Christian Reader).\u0014",

Good, meaningful and impactful \nrelationships end and we are mutually unpairing with love and respect \nfor each other. \u0014\n\u0014\nI dont regret one minute of the love we have shared. He was meant to \nbe in my life, and I was meant to be in his. We couldnt have sailed \n6,000+ nautical miles of open ocean and explored 11 countries without \neach other: he needed me, I needed him. Our hearts are sad but we \nwill heal, probably faster than we imagine. Life is not linear, and \nneither of us know what the future holds but you dont share 2 years \ntogether on a boat (which in boat life terms means weve been married \nfor 80 years) and just walk away. Perhaps in the future well run \ninto each other and reconnect over conch fritters. What weve been \nthrough together is ours and we will never downplay, regret or forget \nit. We also refuse to be sad about each others future happiness: it \nis, in fact, all that we can wish for in this life.\u0014\n\u0014\nI will be returning to Virginia looking for opportunities (in VA and \nbeyond) to work in the health, wellness, dance, nature, and writing. \nAny leads? Pass them my way! \u0014\n\u0014\nI intend on keeping sailing in my life because Ive fallen in love \nwith sailing for my own reasons, on my own terms. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am still working on and intend to finish my book, with a new \nunanticipated but destined ending. Its about giving up everything \nIve known and sailing around the world to find love and how that \ngave me everything I needed to find something else instead. How \nfinding myself was far better than finding a husband. How I dont \nneed to define myself by how Im loved, but by how I love.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am thankful for my for-now best friend, the only other person on \nthis planet who knows intimately what weve been through, \naccomplished and overcome together. Even though our story is \ndeveloping a little different than we anticipated, its still our \nstory and we can rest easy knowing life doesnt have to be \ncomplicated: your heart can hurt and still want happiness; a see you \nlater doesnt mean your paths wont cross again; and sometimes love \nshows up this way. For now, this is the right decision and we will \nmove forward understanding even more deeply that love for each other \ntakes ever-changing paths, even uncomfortable and sad ones.\u0014\n\u0014\n3/7/19\u0014",

The \nSouthern Baptist Convention was created so foreign missionaries could \nown slaves, and the founders of Southern Seminary were avid slave \nowners. Southern Baptists stood foursquare in defense of slavery and \nJim Crow segregation. Mohler calls this sin.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut theres a problem. The most prominent buildings on the seminarys \ncampus bear the names of the schools slave-owning founders. While he \ndecries the racial sins of men like James P. Boyce, John A.

    "words": "Sometime around the year 157, in the Roman province of Asia Minor \nknown as Phrygia, a professing Christian named Montanus began to \nprophesy ecstatically. Claiming the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, \nhe was soon joined by two prophetesses, Maximilla and Priscilla \n(Prisca). They paid special attention to the biblical teachings about \nthe Paraclete (The Holy Spirit). Montanism, which on the surface \nlooks like modern Pentecostalism, was widely rejected as heretical in \nthe early church. In his treatise On the Soul, Montanisms most \nfamous convert, Tertullian, illustrated the movements attraction.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot everyone was so enamored with the movement. In 192, Serapion, \nbishop of Antioch, declared that the working of the lying \norganization called the New Prophesy is held in abomination by the \nwhole brotherhood in the world. On the other hand, a few orthodox \nteachers, though they didnt join the movement, refused to condemn \nit. Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon, for example, was concerned that those \nattacking the Montanists would drive the authentic gift of prophecy \nfrom the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven the fourth-century heresy hunter Epiphanius could find no \nserious fault with the movement. Still, the way Montanists practiced \nthe faith made most Christians wary.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrench historian Pierre de Labriolle showed how Montanism in Asia \nMinor lasted well into the Middle Ages, though widespread enthusiasm \nfor the movement was over by the fourth century. Tertullian (d. 225), \nwho wrote seven books defending Montanus, was the movements last \nmajor figure.\u0014",

    "words": "Martin Niemller \u0014\nConfessing pastor and repentant nationalist\u0014\nJAMES STRASBURG       \u0014\n \u0014\nIn 1930s In 1930s Nazi Germany, Martin Niemller played a crucial \nrole in organizing the Confessing Church, an ecclesial movement that \nresisted Adolf Hitlers interference in German Protestant affairs. As \npunishment for his protest, Niemller was imprisoned in Nazi \nconcentration camps from 1938 to 1945. Due to his outspoken critique \nof Hitlers efforts to dominate the church, Niemller is remembered \nas one of the few German Protestants who openly defied the Nazis.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet behind Niemllers protest stands a much more complex story and \nprofound personal transformation. During elections in 1924 and 1933, \nNiemller had actually voted for the Nazi Party in the hopes that a \nstrong and powerful leader might unify the German nation and restore \nit to greatness following its crushing defeat in the First World War. \nWhile he protested Hitlers meddling in the church, he was still a \ncommitted nationalist, and he remained so even as he sat in a Nazi \nprison cell. Having commanded U-boats in Germanys imperial navy in \nthe First World War, he even offered his services to the Nazi \nmilitary in the Second World War.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnly in the years after 1945 did Niemller repent of such political \nand nationalistic support of the Nazis. In wrestling with his past, \nhe realized that his Christian faith had been taken captive by an \nardent nationalism and a fervent militarism. While he had protested \nthe Nazi intrusion into the church, he had failed to challenge the \nNazi state outside of this spiritual realm.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, Niemllers captivity as a Nazi prisoner fostered a slow \nyet powerful transformation within him. Following the Second World \nWar, he left behind his nationalism for a devoted ecumenism and \nforsook his militarism for a principled pacifism. Having confessed \nhis wartime guilt and repented of his complicity with the Nazis, \nNiemller dedicated his remaining years to the pursuit of justice and \nreconciliation through the power of the gospel.\u0014\nFor Kaiser and Empire\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in 1892, Niemller grew up in an era in which Germany was \nquickly rising in the world as a powerful international empire. As \nGermany strove for imperial glory, its Protestants readily supported \ntheir emperor, Wilhelm II, in his imperial mission. As a young man, \nNiemller regularly heard it proclaimed that God had providentially \nchosen the German nation to be a vessel of divine salvation in the \nworld. Readily adopting such ideas, Niemller affirmed that the \nGerman cause of throne and altar were one and the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeking to advance these twin causes, Niemller became a cadet in the \nquickly expanding Imperial German Navy at the age of 18. Four years \nlater in 1914, Wilhelm IIs plans for German greatness submerged \nEurope into chaotic conflict. As the Great War dragged on, Niemller \nworked his way up to the command of a U-boat submarine that would \nterrorize the open seas.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough the Great War inspired a new wave of theological reflection \nthroughout Europe, Niemllers nationalism remained unshaken. In \ncontrast, a young Swiss theologian named Karl Barth began to \nchallenge the reigning imperialist theology. Although Barth had \nstudied in the same nationalist environment as Niemller, the Swiss \npastor began to question his theology teachers as they declared their \nsupport for the Kaisers war effort. Claiming that they had idolized \nthe German nation, Barth ultimately rejected their theology.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch thinking, however, would not resonate with Niemller until much \nlater in his life. At the end of the Great War, Niemller instead \ninsisted that the German nation had been betrayed by socialists who \nhad overthrown the empire and established the secular and liberal \nWeimar Republic.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the chaotic postwar landscape, Niemller counted himself among the \nmany disillusioned conservative nationalist Protestants who openly \nopposed the Weimar Republic. To further advance the cause of the \nGerman nation and the church, he made his way from command of a \nU-boat to a preachers pulpit.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the new pastor watched Weimar Germany suffer from economic and \npolitical instability, he began to long for a strong political leader \nwho would promote national unity and restore German honor. In 1924 \nand 1933, Niemller cast his vote for the Nazis, believing that \nHitler might fulfill exactly those aims. As Hitler campaigned for \noffice, he emphasized the importance of Christianity in Germanys \nrenewal, a commitment which greatly appealed to Niemller.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeader of the Confessing Church\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after Hitlers electoral victory in 1933, Niemller watched \non without protest as Hitler established a dictatorship. His warm \nwelcome of Hitler only cooled once the Nazi leader began to interfere \nin the affairs of the Protestant church. A stalwart believer in \nLuthers two kingdoms doctrine, Niemller claimed that the church and \nthe state should both advance Germanys cause while not interfering \nin each others respective mission of proclaiming the gospel and \ncreating temporal order.\u0014\n\u0014\nHitler violated such a dualistic principle, however, as he intervened \nin Protestant church elections and campaigned for the German \nChristians. A resolutely pro-Nazi group, the German Christians \ndesired to completely Aryanize the German Protestant church. Their \nplatform called for purging Christianity of all Judaic elements, \nincluding removing the Old Testament from the Bible and recasting \nJesus as a blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile he had a low religious respect for the Jews as a people, \nNiemller condemned such teachings as heresy. When the Nazi \ngovernment announced the Aryan Paragraph, a law which forbade Jews \nfrom holding public office, the German Christians called for banning \nJewish converts from the pastorate as well. As the German Christians \nmade race the crucial component of Christian identity, Niemller \norganized the Pastors Emergency League, which rallied together \nroughly 6,000 pastors to oppose Nazi interference in the churchs \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1934, the League had organized a broader ecclesial movement known \nas the Confessing Church that further challenged the German \nChristians. Niemller and Barth joined forces with other League \npastors in authoring the Barmen Declaration, a theological treatise \nthat denounced Aryan ideology and proclaimed that Scripture and the \nReformation confessions alone could determine church practice and \nteaching.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet despite Niemllers pushback against Nazi interference in the \nchurch, he remained a fervent nationalist and defender of the Nazis \nforeign policy. On this point, Niemller differed radically from \nBarth and another Confessing Church leader, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who \ncalled on the Confessing Church to openly challenge Nazism outside of \nthe church as well. However, their pleas went unheeded. Along with \nNiemller, the Confessing Church as a whole granted Hitler free reign \nin the rest of German society.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Hitler sought to synchronize all aspects of German life under his \ndictatorial rule, Niemllers leadership in the Confessing Church was \na thorn in his side. With the Confessing Church proving difficult to \ncompletely silence, the Nazis began intimidating Niemller through \narrests, interrogations, and preaching bans. Hitler then moved to \nstifle all dissent in 1937, formally arresting Niemller for treason \nand imprisoning him for seven months while awaiting trial.\u0014\nWhen the court system acquitted Niemller of treason, an enraged \nHitler ordered his secret police to seize and imprison him in the \nSachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps. From 1938 to 1945, \nNiemller remained Hitlers personal prisoner alongside other enemies \nof the Nazi state. As he sat in solitary confinement, Niemller \nreported that he nourished his spirit through reading his treasured \nBible and ministering to his fellow prisoners. Nonetheless, \nNiemllers love of the German nation and militaristic spirit \nendured. When Germany began World War II, he petitioned to be \nreleased in order to serve in the German navy.\u0014\n\u0014\nPostwar Transformation\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter being liberated by the Allies in 1945, Niemller began to \nexperience his own road to Damascus moment when he returned to Dachau \nas a free man. He reflected that God began to challenge him to \naccount for the years of 1933 to 1945. In response, he could muster \nno alibi. As Niemller wrestled with his limited course of action in \nthose years, he wrote the following poem:\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out, because \nI was not a Communist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out, \nbecause I was not a Trade Unionist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out, because I was \nnot a Jew.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me.\u0014\n\u0014\nNiemller came to the painful realization that his love of nation had \noverpowered his love of God and neighbor. While he had defended the \nGerman church and nation, he had overlooked and failed to defend the \nleast of these. He confessed his lack of solidarity with the Jews \nand other Nazi enemiesthose he had deemed anti-Christian and \nanti-Germanhad only furthered Hitlers ruthless dictatorship.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch painful realizations proved fertile soil for new growth. \nNiemller now resolved to speak out for all those oppressed and \npersecuted in the world, regardless of their race, religion, or \npolitics. As Germany emerged from the rubble and ruin of total war, \nsuch a commitment made Niemller a crucial postwar church leader. \nSeeking to lead the church in repentance and renewal, he authored the \nStuttgart Declaration of Guilt, which confessed Germanys collective \nguilt in not opposing Hitler and the Nazi war effort. He then \nembarked upon a trip of reconciliation to the United States, modeling \nin the process the transnational ecumenism that he hoped would defeat \nGerman nationalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the threat of military conflict rose in the Cold War, he \npracticed a radical discipleship as one of the most outspoken \nsupporters of Christian pacifism. Forsaking his devotion to \nnationalism and militarism, Niemller beat swords into plowshares as \nhe committed his life to the pursuit of justice and reconciliation in \nChrist. As such, Niemllers heroism ultimately lay not so much in \nhis courageous but limited stand against Hitler as in his genuine \nwillingness to repent and make amends.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Strasburg is an assistant professor of history at Hillsdale \nCollege.\u0014",

Mother Teresa's \"dark night of \u0014\nthe soul\" lasted the rest of her life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I try to raise my thoughts to Heaven,\" she wrote, \"there is \nsuch \u0014\nconvicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp \nknives & \u0014\nhurt my very soul.

    "title": "MARY DYER HANGED FOR \"WRONG\" FAITH",
    "words": "Mary Dyer Hanged for \"Wrong\" Faith \u0014\n\u0014\nDid the Massachusetts Puritans rely too heavily on works and not \nenough on the grace of Christ? Some early settlers thought so. \nSalvation was by grace for those who were filled with the Spirit, \ntaught Anne Hutchinson, and Mary Dyer agreed. To the Puritans this \nseemed antinomian, that is, opposed to law.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Dyer was a \"very proper and fair woman\" according to Governor \nWinthrop. With her husband, William, she came to the New England \ncolony in 1635 and joined a Boston church. At first all went well. \nBut when Anne Hutchinson began to push her views, Mary agreed with \nthem. William also adopted the ideas and was disenfranchised in 1637. \nWhen Anne was expelled from the assembly in 1638, Mary Dyer was the \nonly person who would stand with her, accompanying her from the \nbuilding.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary had a stillborn child and the congregation cruelly suggested \nthis was the hand of God punishing her. They started a rumor that it \nwas a monster. The Dyers were expelled from the colony and helped \nfound Providence, Rhode Island.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary Dyer traveled to England in 1650. The views of George Fox, the \nQuaker, appealed to her and seemed the logical extension of what she \nalready believed. She became a Quaker. On her return to Rhode Island \nshe was arrested and jailed in Boston but released on her husband's \nentreaty. More and more she felt the need to spread the gospel as she \nsaw it.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe made missionary trips into New Haven and Boston. In 1659 she \nvisited Quaker friends who were jailed in Boston. Local authorities \nwarned her to get out of town and not return. Return she did, \nhowever, and was condemned to die in September 1659. She was given a \nreprieve, however, although two Quakers who had traveled with her \"to \nlook the bloody law in the face,\" were executed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce more Mary Dyer put her life on the line. For the fourth time she \ndefied the Massachusetts law. She was arrested and condemned to \ndeath, all pleas by family proving ineffectual. The authorities would \nnot agree to let her go unless she swore never to return. This she \nwould not do. \"...in obedience to the will of the Lord I came, and in \nHis will I abide faithful to the death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this date, June 1, 1660, Mary Dyer was hung. To them she was \nsimply a hard-headed heretic. Like many of the early Quakers she was \nwilling to pay the price for her faith. It seems that she even longed \nfor martyrdom.\u0014\n\u0014\nMary left behind seven children. Quakers eventually won civil rights \nin America. Christianity, more than any other single force, has \nextended the human rights, despite ugly chapters such as this. Mary \nDyer, with her gospel of grace was an important player in that battle.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.\"Dyer, Mary.\" Dictionary of American Biography.

    "title": "MIDRASH--JEWISH INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE",
    "words": "What is Jewish Midrash?\u0014\n\u0014\nMidrash is a Hebrew term for the body of homiletic stories told by \nJewish rabbinic sages to explain passages in the Tanakh. Midrash is a \nmethod of interpreting biblical stories that goes beyond simple \ndistillation of religious, legal, or moral teachings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Midrash was initially a philological method of interpreting the \nliteral meaning of biblical texts. In time it developed into a \nsophisticated interpretive system that reconciled apparent biblical \ncontradictions, established the scriptural basis of new laws, and \nenriched biblical content with new meaning. Midrashic creativity \nreached its peak in the schools of Rabbi Ishmael and Akiba, where two \ndifferent hermeneutic methods were applied. The first was primarily \nlogically oriented, making inferences based upon similarity of \ncontent and analogy. The second rested largely upon textual scrutiny, \nassuming that words and letters that seem superfluous teach something \nnot openly stated in the text.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEncyclopedia Britannica\u0014\n\u0014\nOrigins:\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the growing canonization of the contents of the Hebrew Bible, \nboth in terms of the books that it contained, and the version of the \ntext in them, and an acceptance that new texts could not be added, \nthere came a need to produce material that would clearly \ndifferentiate between that text, and rabbinic interpretation of it. \nBy collecting and compiling these thoughts they could be presented in \na manner which helped to refute claims that they were only human \ninterpretations. The argument being that by presenting the various \ncollections of different schools of thought each of which relied upon \nclose study of the text, the growing difference between early \nbiblical law, and its later rabbinic interpretation could be \nreconciled\u0014\n\u0014\nJacob Neusner distinguishes three midrash processes: \u0014\n\u0014\nparaphrase: recounting the content of the biblical text in different \nlanguage that may change the sense;\u0014\n\u0014\nprophecy: reading the text as an account of something happening or \nabout to happen in the interpreter's time;\u0014\n\u0014\nparable or allegory: indicating deeper meanings of the words of the \ntext as speaking of something other than the superficial meaning of \nthe words or of everyday reality, as when the love of man and woman \nin the Song of Songs is interpreted as referring to the love between \nGod and Israel or the Church as in Isaiah 5:1-6 and in the New \nTestament.\u0014\n\u0014\nNOTE:  The Mishnah is the oral law in Judaism, as opposed to the \nwritten Torah, or the Mosaic Law. The Mishnah was collected and \ncommitted to writing about AD 200 and forms part of the Talmud. A \nparticular teaching within the Mishnah is called a midrash.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was the Jewish Talmud?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Talmud is a Jewish literary collection of teachings, laws, and \ninterpretations based on the Old Testament Torah. It has two parts, \nthe Mishnah and the Gemara, a rabbinical commentary on the Mishnah, \nforming the second part of the Talmud. The Mishnah, written in \nHebrew, is the literary form of the Jewish oral tradition that many \nJews considered to be equal to the Old Testament Scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the Talmud?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Matt Slick\u0014\nThe Talmud is a Jewish literary collection of teachings, laws, and \ninterpretations based on the Old Testament Torah. It has two parts, \nthe Mishnah and that Gemara. The Mishnah, written in Hebrew, is the \nliterary form of the Jewish oral tradition that many Jews considered \nto be equal to the Old Testament Scripture. The Gemara, written in \nHebrew and Aramaic, is the analysis of the Mishnah. The topics \ncovered are multitudinous, and the work itself is immense. Writing \nthe Talmud took around 600 years, from the first century before \nChrist to about the fifth century after Christ. The main topics \ncovered are history, laws, sabbaths, marriage, divorce, sacrifices, \nculture, and rules for interpreting the Torah. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Mishnah is arranged as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\nZera'im (\"Seeds\") - blessings, tithes, temple offerings, agriculture\u0014\nMo'ed (\"Set Feasts\") - Sabbath laws and holiday observances\u0014\nNashim (\"Women\") - marriage and divorce\u0014\nNezikin (\"Damages\") - idolatry, matters of civil law, and the Pirke \nAvot\u0014\nKodashim (\"Holy Things\") - sacrificial system in the Temple, dietary \nlaws\u0014\nTohorot (\"Purities\") - ritual purity and impurity1\u0014\nThe Jews believed that the Torah, the first five books of the Bible \n(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), which is also \ncalled the Pentateuch, were authored by Moses. However, along with \nthe written Torah, the Jews also believe that Moses was also given \noral tradition. This Oral Tradition was passed down to Joshua and \nthen to the Prophets. It has thus been transmitted from person to \nperson over the centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are two Talmuds: the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian \nTalmud. The Jerusalem Talmud was compiled in Israel in the third \ncentury. The Babylonian Talmud was put together a couple of centuries \nlater. The Babylonian Talmud covers more topics, is more prevalent, \nand normally when the word \"Talmud\" is used, the Babylonian Talmud is \nassumed to be the one referenced. A monumental work of scholarship, \nthe Babylonian Talmud has become the heart and soul of the Jewish \npeople. Even the word scholarship is defined as ones knowledge of \nthe Talmud.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Talmud has played a huge influence on Jewish thought and culture. \nIts discussions, which often lasted many many years, consist of a \ndetailed analysis of biblical concepts aimed at answering various \nquestions dealing with the law of Moses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Talmuds discussions are recorded in a consistent format. A law \nfrom the Mishnah is cited, followed by rabbinic deliberations on its \nmeaning (i.e., the Gemara).\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Judaism expanded geographically and different schools of thought \nemerged, the Talmud became increasingly dominant in conservative \nJudaism but not in reformed Judaism.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuotes from the Talmud\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Food cooked entirely by Gentiles is forbidden; but if a third done \nby a Jew, it may be finished by a Gentile.

    "words": "Michael the Archangel\u0014\n\u0014\n Many Americans are caught up in a craze to know more about angels. \nBooks galore are available on the subject. Popular shows, such as the \nmany episodes of Touched by an Angel, or the Christmas movie A Season \nfor Miracles have introduced angels into their plots.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe angel craze is not all bad. No doubt we should learn something \nabout these majestic and powerful beings, for, as God's messengers, \nangels played important roles in both the Old and New Testaments. \nSeveral kinds are mentioned in the Bible, including cherubim and \nseraphim. However, because they are created beings, they are never to \nbe worshipped--and God's good angels will never accept such worship, \nalthough fallen angels will.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Middle Ages, Christians also were interested in angels. In \nfact, they set apart this day, September 29, as the feast day of \nMichael the archangel, a day the English call Michaelmas. Later, \nGabriel, the angel who announced the birth of Jesus to Mary, was \nadded to the feast, as was Raphael, an angel mentioned in the \napocryphal book of Tobit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is only one archangel mentioned in the commonly accepted books \nof the Bible and that is Michael. He is the powerful being who led \nGod's armies to throw Satan out of heaven. Whereas Satan (Lucifer) \ntried to seize God's place, Michael's name reflects his humility, for \nit means \"Who is like God?\" The term archangel implies that Michael \nis an angel over the other angels, just as an archbishop is a bishop \nover other bishops.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Daniel, Michael is also the special protector of the \nJews. He will stand up in their behalf in the last days.\u0014\nThe little book of Jude also tells us that Michael once had to \ndispute with Satan for Moses' body. Those who mock Satan should be \nwary, for we are warned that even Michael did not dare to do so, but \ninstead called upon the Lord to rebuke the fiend.\u0014\nFrom Paul we learn that the archangel will give the shout when Christ \nreturns at his second coming. At this shout the dead will rise.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Angel\" and \"Michael.\" Pictorial Bible Dictionary. Edited by Merrill \nC. Tenney.

    "words": "Hopewell mother sentenced to 20 years in neglect and starvation death \nof her disabled 13-year-old son \u0014\n\tBY MARK BOWES Richmond Times-Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nA Hopewell mother who starved to death her 13-year-old, severely \ndisabled son over a couple of weeks to the point he weighed only 24 \npounds was sentenced to serve 20 years in prison in a case where the \nboy was \"completely abandoned and neglected.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe physician who performed an autopsy on the boy, Jalen \nGoldsborough, concluded that \"this was someone who was basically \nskeletal,\" said Hopewell Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Matthew \nBingham.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmy FaJohn decided in December 2017 to begin limiting her son's food \nintake  he was bedridden and had to be fed with a feeding tube  but \n\"the actual starvation, which ultimately killed him, probably lasted \na couple of weeks,\" Bingham said, quoting Dr. Jeffery Gofton of the \nstate medical examiner's office who conducted an autopsy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy already was permanently disabled from horrendous physical \nabuse he suffered as an infant in 2004 at the hands of his father, \nCharles Bryon Goldsborough II, who pleaded guilty 14 years ago to \naggravated malicious wounding. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison \nwith 30 years suspended.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe abused his son so severely that a prosecutor said at the time that \nGoldsborough, then 27, \"for all intents and purposes ended the life \nof his son in all but physiology.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFaJohn was then left to care for boy on her own. She began a \nrelationship with another man, Anthony Saunders, and the couple began \nliving together and had two children of their own, now age 6 and 10.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday, after taking into account the appalling nature of \nJalen's death but also the circumstances that FaJohn faced in caring \nfor a child left acutely disabled by abuse, Hopewell Circuit Judge \nWilliam Edward Tomko III sentenced FaJohn, 38, to 40 years in prison \nwith 20 years suspended on her conviction of second-degree murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe punishment was at the high end of discretionary state sentencing \nguidelines crafted for FaJohn, which called for an active prison term \nof between 12 years and nine months and 21 years and four months. \nBingham asked the judge for an upward departure from the guidelines, \nwhile defense attorney Matthew Stewart sought a downward departure.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaunders, 35, FaJohn's boyfriend, who lived with her, Jalen and the \ntwo other children in the 4000 block of North Avenue, was sentenced \nto five years in prison with two suspended on his conviction of \nfelony child neglect. In pronouncing sentence, the judge addressed \nSaunders' role in the death, saying, \"you looked the other way.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSaunders told detectives after he was taken into custody that he was \na \"horrible person,\" and that he didn't do anything about Jalen's \ndeteriorating condition.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Gofton testified that Jalen's body was covered with \nbedsores, with some resulting in breaks in his skin. And those \ninjuries showed no signs of having been treated with ointments or \nbandages. He was severely malnourished with sunken eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It was almost as if he wasn't inspected, wasn't checked, wasn't \ncared for - he was just completely neglected and abandoned,\" the \nprosecutor said. \"He was essentially wrapped up in blankets and a \nsweatshirt, almost as if he was a mummy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Gofton testified that Jalen also suffered from acute pneumonia \nand had a lung infection that had gone untreated. He was bloated, his \nskin was pale and dry, and his lips were cracked. And his body organs \n\"were markedly below what you'd expect for a 13-year-old male in \nterms of size and weight,\" Bingham said.\u0014\n\u0014\nJalen's weight, measured after his death, was 24 pounds. \"The doctor \nsaid this wasn't something where he just passed away on the date he \nwas pronounced dead,\" Bingham said. \"It was something of an on-going \nprocess that probably lasted a couple of weeks.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHopewell Detective David Hirn testified that FaJohn told him in an \ninterview that she began to limit Jalen's food intake in December \n2017 and that ultimately resulted in his death by starvation.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"In a lot of ways this case was not satisfying, because we couldn't \nfigure out exactly why [she starved and neglected her son],\" Bingham \nsaid. \"She was adamant that she didn't want anything to happen to \nhim. Nonetheless, she decided ... to slow down his feeding.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthorities wondered whether FaJohn may have believed she was \ncommitting a mercy killing, because she knew her son was suffering \nfrom the earlier abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Bingham noted there was a history of neglect. Detective Benjamin \nRansom testified that he learned in interviews with the couple's \nother children that the family had left Jalen behind when they went \non vacation  apparently for a weekend  to Virginia Beach in 2017.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice were alerted to Jalen's death after they got a call from \nFaJohn's mother, who received a text message from her daughter on \nSept. 2, 2018, to go to her house. FaJohn's text message said that it \n\"was all her fault\" and that her mother should go straight to Jalen \nafter she arrived. She found the boy dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother called police, and a detective discovered a note that \nFaJohn wrote to her mother that read, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean for \nthis to happen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hate me, I know you will, [but] please don't take it out on [the two \nother] kids,\" FaJohn wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo other family members were at the home when officers arrived about \n9:30 that evening. Officers discovered that Jalen's feeding tube was \nnot connected to the medical device that fed him, stationed by his \nbed, and the machine had been turned off.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter her arrest, FaJohn told detectives that she was the only person \nwho routinely fed her son, and that she became depressed and would \nroutinely play video games for hours on end.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt FaJohn's trial in July, Stewart, her attorney, told the court that \nJalen required \"24/7\" care from FaJohn, and that she spend most of \nher days and nights at home, alone with Jalen and sometimes with the \nother children. She experienced \"enormous stress that goes along with \nthat sort of isolation and duty, and experienced depression and \nsuicidal thoughts,\" Stewart said.\u0014\n\u0014\nJalen's father, who remains incarcerated at the Lunenburg \nCorrectional Center, violently abused his then 17-day-old son on Dec. \n23, 2004, after he became frustrated by a lack of sleep. At the time, \nhe was living with FaJohn in Chesterfield County.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoldsborough told police he began shaking his son violently and, \nafter doing so, threw the child in the air a couple of times \"like a \npizza,'\" letting the boy hit the bed at least once. He also told \ninvestigators that he smacked his son at least once so hard with his \nopen hand that it made his hand hurt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe physical abuse rendered the child blind, and doctors determined \nthat his life span was reduced and that his brain and skull had \nstopped growing normally.\u0014\n\u0014\nGoldsborough could be released from prison, with good behavior, on \nMay 30, 2022, according to the Virginia Department of Corrections.\u0014",

    "title": "MACARTHUR'S FINAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS",
    "words": "MACARTHURS \nFINAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS\u0014\n\u0014\n\tGen. Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964) was one of most prominent United \nStates military figures of the first half of the twentieth century. \nIn World War I he served as chief of staff of the Forty-second \nInfantry (Rainbow) Division and later commanded one of its brigades. \nHe was twice wounded and received many decorations for bravery. After \nthe war as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, New York, he substantially reformed the academy's program \nand shaped the training received by a generation of the nation's \nmilitary officers. In 1932 he became chief of staff of the army at \nage fifty, the youngest man to have been appointed to this post. He \nofficially retired from the army in 1937 to become military adviser \nto the Philippines Commonwealth, then an American dependency. In July \n1941 President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) recalled him to \nactive service and placed him in command of United States forces in \nthe Philippines after the Japanese attack in December 1941. In March \n1942, on President Roosevelt's orders, he withdrew to Australia \nshortly before the Japanese completed their conquest of the islands. \nAs Supreme Commander Southwest Pacific Area, MacArthur organized the \ndefense of Australia, stopped the Japanese offensive in New Guinea, \nand began an island-hopping campaign that by 1945 liberated all that \nhad been lost to the Japanese. MacArthur was promoted to general of \nthe army, the highest rank in the United States military. After Japan \nsurrendered, MacArthur was made Supreme Allied Commander and presided \nover the American occupation of the country and its transition to \ndemocratic self-rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t-  When Communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, \nPresident Harry S. Truman (1884-1972) committed American forces to a \nUnited Nations-sanctioned intervention and placed MacArthur in \ncommand. North Korean forces overran most of South Korea, and \nAmerican forces, initially unprepared, were pushed into a small \npocket around Pusan at the southern end of the Korean Peninsula. \nMacArthur, in a bold move in September 1950, launched an amphibious \nassault at Inchon, a port 110 miles behind enemy lines. American \nunits knifing in from Inchon recaptured the South Korean capital of \nSeoul while American and South Korean forces broke out of the Pusan \npocket and raced northward destroying or capturing Communist forces \nthrown into disarray by the attack on their rear.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t-  By the end of 1950 not only had all of South Korea been freed, \nbut American and United Nations forces had captured the North Korean \ncapital and, moving north, were approaching the Chinese border. \nUnexpectedly, Chinese Communist forces crossed the border in massive \nformations and the American-led advance became a retreat. MacArthur \nwas able to stop the retreat along the thirty-eighth parallel, the \npreinvasion dividing line between North and South Korea, but there a \nstalemate ensued. At that point, President Truman and MacArthur fell \ninto public disagreement about the future course of the war, and the \npresident removed MacArthur from his command. MacArthur then retired.\u0014\n\u0014\n\t-  In recognition of his status as one of the nation's greatest \nliving military leaders, Congress asked MacArthur to address a joint \nsession on 19 April 1951. His speech, reproduced here, is best known \nfor its final lines in which he quoted an old army ballad: \"'Old \nsoldiers never die--they just fade away.' And like the old soldier of \nthat ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away--an \nold soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see \nthat duty. Good-bye.\"\u0014",

If we had a \nreferendum tomorrow and 100 percent of the voters decided to repeal \nthe law of gravity, it wouldn't change anything.  You still couldn't \njump off a building without being a smash hit.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Just as God has established physical laws that cannot be broken, so \ntoo He has set up moral standards.  And if we break them, we are \nultimately broken by them.\u0014",

When she quoted an outlandish amount for the \nrent, he was shocked.  But then he remembered an earlier comment she \nhad made, and he suspected that she thought he was a Jew.  So he \nbegan talking to her fluently in Swedish, and she cut the rent in \nhalf.  \"No thank you,\"  said Skoglund's father as he turned to \nleave.  \"Nothing you could say and no rent reduction you could offer \ncould make me live here now.\"\u0014",

    "words": "A number of years ago, a girls' boarding school in India had some \n1,500 students, most of them Hindus.  One day some of the Christian \nstudents came to a missionary lady and asked her the meaning of Luke \n12:49: \"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it \nwere already kindled!\"  She gave them a rather vague answer because \nshe was not sure herself, but they were determined to know.  They \nwanted that \"fire\" and began to pray for it.  The result of their \nprayers was a moving of the Holy Spirit that was very much like \nPentecost.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In the energy of the Spirit, they went to see another missionary \nwho was staying nearby.  They asked him if they could stay in his \ntown and pray for his work.  The missionary gave them permission to \nstay and pray in his barn.  Later as he sat down to eat dinner, an \nIndian pastor knocked on his door. It wasn't long before the pastor \nwas weeping and confessing sins the Holy Spirit had convicted him \nof.  Soon another Christian came, and then another, and another, all \nconfessing their sins and repenting.  What followed was an amazing \ntime of backsliders being renewed and unbelievers being converted out \nof paganism--all because a handful of children started praying!\u0014\n   [The Kneeling Christian.
