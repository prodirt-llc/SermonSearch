    "title": "NEW STUDIES ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY",
    "words": "\"Homosexuality linked to inner earWomens sexual orientation may be \nrelated to factors in womb\"By Charlene Laino   MSNBC  \u0014\nFor the first time, scientists have homed in on a physiological \ndifference between heterosexual and homosexual women: Echo-like \nsounds made by the inner ears are weaker in gay and bisexual than in \nstraight women, Texas researchers report. While the findings cannot \nbe used to predict a womans sexual preference, they nonetheless \nsupport the theory that sexual orientation may be related to early \nfactors in brain development, while one is still in the womb.  \n<Picture>  THE INNER EAR system in homosexual and bisexual women is \nmore like that of men, said Dennis McFadden, a neuroscientist at the \nUniversity of Texas in Austin.\u0014\n   While the exact reason why has yet to be determined, the \nfinding suggests that prenatal exposure to high male hormone levels \nmay have partially masculinized homosexual womens auditory systems \nas well as some unknown brain structures responsible for their sexual \norientation.\u0014\n   Whether homosexuality is a matter of nature or nurture has \nlong been the subject of debate. While some say its a matter of \nchoice and conditioning, others claim its determined by ones genes. \u0014\n   Some research in recent years has supported the nature \nhypothesis, at least in men: Dean Hamer of the National Cancer \nInstitute reported the finding of a so-called gay gene, for example, \nwhile others have found that at least two brain structures differ in \nheterosexual and homosexual men.\u0014\n   The new work, published in Tuesdays issue of the Proceedings \nof the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to give credence to \nthe nature hypothesis in women.\u0014\n   In particular, McFadden found that the strength of \nclick-evoked otoacoustic emissions  weak sounds produced by normal \ninner ears in response to a series of brief clicks  are stronger for \nheterosexual females than for homosexual or bisexual females. \nMoreover, the auditory emissions of homosexual women approach those \nof men, who also exhibit weaker echo-like sounds in their inner ears.\u0014\n   Researchers, including the NCIs Hamer, called the new \nresearch very interesting.\u0014\n   The report is an elegant study  support[ing] the theory that \ndifferences in the central nervous system exist between homosexual \nand heterosexual individuals and that the differences are possibly \nrelated to early factors in brain development, added Sandra Witelson \nof McMaster University in Ontario. \u0014\n   McFadden undertook the new work after studies of opposite-sex \ntwins showed that click-evoked emissions of females from opposite-sex \nfraternal twin pairs are more like those of males than other women. \nNoting that auditory emissions are generally weaker in men than in \nwomen, McFadden said that high levels of male hormones called \nandrogens might diminish their strength.\u0014\n   These twin females may have been exposed to high levels of \n[the male hormone] androgen by nature of sharing the in-utero \nenvironment with a male, McFadden said. \u0014\n   The finding led the Texas neuroscientist to hypothesize that \nthe inner ears of homosexuals might also be different.\u0014\n   To test the hypothesis, the researcher studied click-evoked \notoacoustic emissions in 200 men and women of all sexual \norientations. \u0014\n   The emissions of 61 homosexual and bisexual women were weaker \nthan those of 57 heterosexual women  or in the male direction, \nMcFadden found. \u0014\n   There were no differences in those between homosexual and \nbisexual women or between gay and heterosexual men. \u0014\n   Since people with strong click-evoked otoacoustic emissions \ngenerally are better at hearing weak sounds, McFadden now plans to \ndetermine if gay women have weaker hearing sensitivity than \nheterosexual women. \u0014\n   McFadden stressed that the findings cannot be used to predict \nhomosexuality. Its like height, he said. Men are generally taller \nthan women, but we cant use height to predict sex. \u0014\n   But the findings are noteworthy nonetheless, indicating that \nthe inner ear may be a valuable tool for studying events that occur \nduring brain development and sexual differentiation, he said.\u0014\n   The study was funded by the National Institute on Deafness and \nOther Communication Disorders.\u0014\n   \u0014",

    "words": "New Book Challenges Jesus Seminar Findings \u0014\n\u0014\n FORT WORTH, TX (BP) -- A seminary professor's new volume on the \ncomposition and the origins of New Testament documents challenges \nliberal theologians' theories of who wrote the books and when. \u0014\n\u0014\n Arguing for a \"corporate authorship,\" the use of common traditions \nand the presence of a common \"opposition mission,\" E. Earle Ellis, \nauthor of \"The Making of the New Testament Documents,\" concludes that \nthe New Testament was composed by four apostolic missions and, for \nthe most part, between AD 50 and 70. \u0014\n\u0014\n Ellis, research professor of theology emeritus and 'scholar in \nresidence' at\u0014\n Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, \nreaches historical conclusions in sharp contrast to those of the \n\"Jesus Seminar,\" which supposes that the gospels were written long \nafter AD 70 by unknown authors. \u0014\n\u0014\n Ellis' work is an important resource in answering the theories of \nthe Jesus Seminar and a similar group focusing on Paul, said \nSouthwestern professor John Newport.  \"This is a remarkable book that \nhas tremendous implications for biblical scholarship,\" Newport added. \u0014\n\u0014\n Ellis, whose 540-page book is the result of 25 years of study, said \nhis conclusions about dates and authorships derive from his analysis \nof specific units in the New Testament, such as confessions, \nexpositions, hymns and episodes of Jesus' sayings and work. These \n\"preformed pieces,\" as Ellis calls them, were used in church liturgy \nbefore they were incorporated into the New Testament books. \u0014\n\u0014\n \"The Making of the New Testament Documents,\" he said, attempts to \nidentify and to trace the origin and usage of these preformed pieces. \nEllis concludes that the New Testament is the product of four \ncooperating apostolic missions, whose leaders can be identified in \nGalatians 2. One mission was headed by James, the brother of Jesus, \nand located in Jerusalem. The apostle John's ministry was based in \nPalestine until the Jewish War and from that point on in Ephesus. \u0014\n\u0014\n Peter's mission began in Jerusalem, but Ellis believes that the \napostle transferred it to Caesarea following the events of Acts 12. \nPaul's ministry ranged across the breadth of the Mediterranean world, \nstarting in Antioch, but moving on to Ephesus and later to Rome and \nSpain. \u0014\n\u0014\n An example of the cooperation among these missions can be seen in \nthe hymn that is featured in Philippians 2, Ellis said. He believes \nthe Semitic idiom and style of the hymn indicate that it was composed \nin one of the Palestinian-based missions and was later used by Paul \nwhen he wrote his letter. \u0014\n\u0014\n This cooperation and the use of one apostle's teaching pieces by \nothers has\u0014\n implications for issues of authorship and for the dating of the New \nTestament, said Ellis. \u0014\n\u0014\n The author of each document worked with others, he said, such as a \nsecretary who wrote the letter and coworkers who wrote some of the \npieces that were employed in the composition. \u0014\n\u0014\n This \"corporate authorship\" of letters that went out under the \nauthor's 'imprimatur,' Ellis added, leads to the conclusion that one \ncannot determine the authorship of a gospel or an epistle by internal \nliterary criteria. \u0014\n\u0014\n \"If one recognizes that authorship was a corporate enterprise, \ninvolving a number of helpers, ... one cannot assume a different \nauthorship from differences of theme, style or vocabulary,\" he said. \u0014\n\u0014\n Each of the four missions produced a gospel, Ellis said, and shared \nthe preformed episodes with each other, and this held true also for \nthe epistles. \u0014\n\u0014\n An examination of such cooperation argues for dating the books of \nthe New\u0014\n Testament within the same general period, he added. \u0014\n\u0014\n With the exception of the Johannine Gospel and letters, said Ellis, \nthe works of the New Testament reflect a number of the same \ntheological and ethical issues and problems, and they face the same \n\"opposition mission,\" in this case, the gnosticizing Judaizers. These \nissues stand in contrast to those in the church at the end of the \nfirst century.  Ellis said that such characteristics have led him to \nconclude that the bulk of the New Testament, including Revelation, \nwas composed between AD 50 and 70. \u0014\n\u0014\n John's Gospel and letters, on the other hand, reflect a conflict \nwith Docetics, and Ellis places them between AD 75 and 100.\u0014",

The odd thing about many of these rescuers- -like the \ncurrently famous Oskar Schindler or Swedish diplomat Raoul \nWallenburg--is that they were frequently notorious rakes, thieves, \nand embezzlers--in other words, outright criminals. \u0014\n\u0014\nFogelman (Center for Social  Research/CUNY) tries in this ample study \nto understand the particular background and conditioning that \nproduces a ``rescuer'' as opposed to either a passive bystander or an \nactive accessory. And an extraordinary gallery of characters is \nbrought to life: Angel Sanz-Briz, the Spanish minister in Budapest \nwho issued thousands of phony Spanish passports to Hungarian Jews; \nMiep Gies, the rescuer--for a time--of Anne Frank; Stefaniz \nPodgorska, a teenage girl who smuggled food into the ghetto of \nPrzemysl and hid refugees from it; Alexander Roslan, who built a \nhiding cupboard in his apartment and when visited by suspicious \nGestapo agents wined and dined them until they were too drunk to \nremember why they had come; Louisa Steenstra, a former secretary at a \nJewish-owned furniture factory in Groningen who ventured into the \nlocal concentration camp to get a suitcase of clothes to a Jewish \nfriend. Perhaps one of the strangest stories is that of the Japanese \nconsul in Kovno, Lithuania, Sempo Sugihara, who ignored his \ndiplomatic instructions and issued illegal transit visas to Jews via \nJapan--visas that his own government kept refusing to validate. At \nthe end of each day, his hands would be so numb from writing these \nfake visas that his wife would have to massage  them back to life. It \nis estimated that he saved between 4,500 and 10,000 Jews. Perhaps \ninexplicable but uplifting stories of humanity. -- Copyright 1994, \nKirkus Associates, LP.\u0014",

This little man, who held the\u0014\nchair of medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, sat in\u0014\nhis study without typewriter or secretary and penned the great\u0014\nmasterpieces which made him perhaps the most broadly-read Christian\u0014\nwriter of our century. C. S. Lewis was an agnostic, but was\u0014\nSurprised By Joy--the title of a book in which he tells about \"The\u0014\nShape of My Early Life\" as Christ replaced the \"I\" in his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nC. S. Lewis describes the exchange between self-will and God's will\u0014\nin Beyond Personality (and his words are a challenge to you and to\u0014\nme): \"Christ says, 'Give me all. I don't want so much of your money\u0014\nand so much of your work--I want you. I have not come to torment\u0014\nyour natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I\u0014\ndon't want to cut off a branch here and there, I want to have the\u0014\nwhole tree down. I don't want to drill the tooth, or crown it, stop\u0014\nit, but to have it out. Hand over the whole natural self instead.\u0014\nIn fact I will give you myself, my own will shall become yours.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonald Deffner, Seasonal Illustrations, Resource, 1992, p. 162\u0014",

    "title": "NO REST FOR THE  WEARY",
    "words": "\u0014\nFew pioneers possessed strong enough resolve to keep the Sabbath on \nthe Overland Trail.\u0014\nBy Winton U. Solberg\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen William Clark of Freeport, Illinois, and his party participated \nin the westward movement that carried thousands of American to the \nPacific Coast during the mid-nineteenth century, they demonstrated \nremarkable fidelity to a Christian institution. Leaving Leavenworth \nin 1857, Clark and three others joined up with a firm that was to \nhaul freight to army posts in Utah. The four man contracted \"with the \nexpress understanding that we should not be asked to drive Sundays, \nunless for the want of grass or water.\" The men pledged to each other \nto stand by their bargain. \u0014\nShortly after setting out, on a Sunday when the bullwhackers were \nresting after a hard week's work, Chatham Rennick, the train boss, \ndirected the four to hitch up their cattle in order to drive the \nremainder of the day. The men refused. Rennick did not press the \npoint. When this experience was repeated on the next Sabbath, the man \ndeclared, \"drive Sunday we would not.\" \u0014\nAfter another such encounter, Rennick discharged the four and refused \nto let them take their guns. A tense confrontation with guns drawn \nfollowed. Clark and his companions feared for their lives. Rennick \nhad \"men enough to massacre us,\" Clark retaliated, \"but not enough  \nto make us drive a single rod.\" Rennick pleaded with the men, who \nremained adamant. Never again were they asked to drive on the Sabbath.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis encounter might have been exceptional, but it illustrates that \nSabbath observance was still important when Americans set out on the \nOverland Trail for the Pacific Coast. \"He who starts across the \ncontinent,\" wrote one overland diarist in 1852, \"is most sure to \nleave his religion on the east side of the Missouri river.\" This \nnotion entered the history books. But first-hand accounts of the \nwestward movement reveal a more complex reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeaving faith in the East\u0014\n\u0014\nCrossing the plains, the desert, and the mountains was a serious \nundertaking, and in 1849 and 1850 most emigrants traveled in \norganized wagon trains for mutual assistance and protection. Before \njumping off, some companies drafted a constitution stipulating that \nthe Sabbath was to be a day of rest except in cases of absolute \nnecessity. The reasons for Sabbath observance were practical as well \nas religious. \"Never travel on the Sabbath,\" advised Joseph E. Ware \nin The Emigrant's Guide to California (1849). \"Those who lay by on \nthe Sabbath, resting themselves and their teams,\" Ware added, \"would \nget to California 20 days sooner that those who traveled seven days a \nweek.\u0014\n\u0014\nSabbath observance was generally best during the early weeks on the \ntrail, but even people reared under religious influences often lost \ntheir moral bearings once they entered a land where neither law nor \ncommon practice restrained. The issue caused dissension and split \notherwise harmonious parties. In addition, the passion for speed fed \non itself, fracturing companies into even smaller units that treated \nall days alike. Necessity ruled with an iron hand. Trains depended on \ncampsites with water, grass, and wood. Each train competed with \nhundreds of others for these essentials.\u0014\n\u0014\nSixty-five diaries and reminiscences for the gold-rush years of 1849 \nand 1850 reveal diverse patterns of Sabbath observance on the \nOverland Trail. Eighteen diarists simply disregard the Lord's Day, \nwhile 23 described companies that traveled as readily on the Sabbath \nas on other days. George W.B. Evans, a devoted Presbyterian from \nDefiance, Ohio, characterized Sunday as \"the day of rest, set apart \nfor the good of mankind.\" Yet his company usually traveled on \nSundays. Members did celebrate the Fourth of July, which Evans called \nthe \"great National Sabbath.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles C. Gray of New York describes his company's Sabbath \nobservance with mocking irreverence. One Sunday the party stopped \n\"out of respect for the Sabbath (thereby meaning we had some clothes \nto wash and some wagon repairs to do).\" Charles R. Parke of Como, \nIlinois, crossed the plains with a party of nine men and three \nwagons. They drove on all or part of 13 Sundays, remaining in camp on \nfour. Parke's company marched on the Sabbath immediately before and \nafter the Fourth of July but remained in camp near South Pass on \"the \nNation's birthday.\" With plenty of milk and snow available, Parke \nmade ice cream on \"this Sacred day of the year.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSabbatarian minority\u0014\n\u0014\nA second pattern was that of travelers who desired to observe the \nSabbath but found impediments in their way. Some Sabbatarians went \nalong with a non-Sabbath-keeping majority out of expediency. James \nAbbey of New Albany, Indiana, was in a company that normally traveled \non Sunday. Yet his journal stresses the holiness of the Sabbath and \nits sweet memories of home and family. The Sabbath was \"the day our \nmothers charged us never to forget.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nSolomon Gorgas left Ohio with a band that frequently traveled on the \nSabbath. Gorgas denounced the practice as a desecration of the day, \nremembering the Sabbath as \"the blessed day of rest and quiet.\" But \non the trail there was no rest for man or beast: no preaching, no \npraying. \"All respect for the sabbath of the Lord is here forgotten.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSome companies set out intending to observe the holy day but found it \nhard to do so. Ansel J. McCall of Bath, New York, who joined the \nRobidoux company west of St. Josephs, proposed that the company rest \non the Sabbath except in case of necessity. His motion failed, and at \nSalt Lake the assembly fell apart. McCall's group remained in camp on \n11 of 17 Sabbaths on the trail. \u0014\n\u0014\nElisha D. Perkins, an Ohio journalist, left for California with the \nMarietta Gold Hunters. Members agreed to rest on the Sabbath, \"an \narrangement the policy of which is evident to those who know anything \nof frontier travelling, & very gratifying to those who have been \ntaught to reverence the day at home.\" The company planned its \nSaturday travel with a view to camping on the Sabbath for the rest \nthat the day afforded man and beast. In time, however, necessity \nobliged the ensemble to travel on the Sabbath. Members split into \nsmaller groups so as to travel faster. \u0014\n\u0014\nCatherine M. Haun of Clinton, Iowa, and her husband joined a caravan \nconsisting of 120 persons and 70 wagons bound for California. \"When \nthe camp ground was desirable enough to warrant it,\" Haun wrote, \"we \ndid not travel on the Sabbath.\" The men spent the day mending wagons \nand the like, the women cooked and washed clothes and \"all felt \nsomewhat rested on Monday morning.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDivided camps\u0014\n\u0014\nA third pattern of Sabbath observance was that of emigrant groups \nwith a strong commitment to the Fourth Commandment. These companies \ngenerally set out by observing the Sabbath according to a written \nrule or a tacit agreement but found it difficult to realize their \nideal. They divided over Sunday travel.\u0014\n\u0014\nElisha B. Lewis of Rock County, Wisconsin, went west with an outfit \nwhose written rules prohibited Sunday travel. When the company made \ngood distance all one week, Lewis thought it only reasonable that \ntheir teams and the men should rest on the holy day. But the majority \nruled, \"so there was no other way but to go in contradiction to the \nconstitution by which we professed to be governed and also to \ntransgress the laws of God which some of us still hold more sacred.\" \u0014\nCharles E. Pancoast, a Quaker druggist from St. Louis, went to \nCalifornia with a company of 200 that passed a resolution not to \ntravel on the Sunday when it could be avoided. They lay over every \nSabbath except two, when, because of necessity, they moved.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustus R. Burbank of Naples, Illinois, and his wife were staunch \nSabbatarians. Their group was organized \"expressly was a Sabbath \nobserving company & all joined as such with this understanding.\" \nSoon, however, some members favored moving on the Sabbath. \"There is \nbut few men that will keep the Sabbath, \" Burbank lamented, \"where \nthere is sacrifice to be made.\" Burbank's party, which split from the \nrest of the company over the issue of Sunday travel, achieved a \nnearly perfect record of Sabbath-keeping en route to Sacramento.\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Rutherford Dundass, a deeply religious Presbyterian, joined an \nOhio company whose members adopted a resolution to lie by on the \nSabbath. After two weeks on the plains, the 60 men divided into \nseveral companies of ten in order to travel faster. Dundass's group, \nwhich struck out alone, soon teamed up with other pioneers. Through \nit all, Dundass faithfully observed the Sabbath, although on three \noccasions necessity compelled short moves to provide for the oxen. \nDundass justified his observance on religious grounds. \"This is the \nholy Sabbath,\" he wrote, \"and in accordance with our custom we \nobserve the day.\" A week later he vowed, \"We wish to do as the \nIsraelites did in the wilderness of Sinai, to keep the Sabbath as a \nday of rest, holy unto the Lord.\" The Sabbath was a day of rest, a \ntime to read the Bible and engage in private religious exercises. \n\"Welcome, even here in the wilderness, welcome sweet day of rest that \nsaw the Lord arise!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIdeally, the Sabbath was a day of rest for both humans and animals. \nWhen Joseph Warren Wood of Walworth, Wisconsin, and his company of 60 \nmen rested one Sunday, a blast of the horn summoned members to hear a \nsermon by an old preacher. For some Argonauts a minister pro tem \nstood in the center of a corral, conducting a devotional service \nwhile everyone continued with his or her work. The rest day was not \ntypically one of leisure. Routine chores that were regarded as \nunchristian at home--making repairs, rearranging loads, cooking, and \nwashing clothes--had to be done.\u0014\n\u0014\nA new Sabbath view\u0014\n\u0014\nThese accounts of Sabbath observance on the Overland Trail illuminate \nimportant aspects of American religious development. The trek \nwestward was a mirror reflecting the character of the emigrants and \nthe quality of the society from which they came. Almost certainly men \nand women who participated in this movement viewed the Sabbath in a \nnew light when they reached the Pacific Coast.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the larger significance of the events described here is their \nbearing on Sabbath-observance in later American life. In all \nlikelihood, Americans who went overland to California in the years \ndescribed never again viewed the Sabbath as they had before leaving \nhome. Thus the experience of crossing the plains may be seen as a \npreview of the economic, social, demographic and secular forces that \nwould contribute to transforming the place of the \u0014\nSabbath in later American culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWinton U. Solberg is professor emeritus of history, University of \nIllinois, Urbana-Champaign.).\u0014",

    "title": "NOBODY LIKES A HYPOCRITE",
    "words": "Two-and-a-Half Cheers For Hypocrites\u0014\nMatthew 6:1-6, 16-21\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is difficult to find anyone who has a kind word to say about \nhypocrites.\u0014\nNobody likes a hypocrite; no one wants to be around one; the last \nthing one\u0014\nwould want to be called is a hypocrite. Hypocrites are, by definition,\u0014\ndeceptive, two-faced and treacherous. If discovered, hypocritical\u0014\npoliticians are defeated at the polls, hypocritical friends get \ndropped and\u0014\nhypocritical preachers lose the trusting ears of their congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt may well be that our age is particularly tough on hypocrisy. In \nsome\u0014\nways, it is our one remaining public sin. We can tolerate \nembezzlement,\u0014\ninfidelity, brawling and addiction in our public figures, but not \npretense\u0014\nand hypocrisy. Presidential press conferences are scrutinized not \nonly for\u0014\nmajor policy shifts but also for flickers of insincerity passing \nacross the\u0014\nPresident's face, for the subtle twitch of an eyelid that would \nreveal the\u0014\nhypocritical dissembling beneath the high-blown rhetoric of \nstatesmanship.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago, when a well-known television evangelist was caught\u0014\nflagrante delicto in a seedy, day-rate motel, it was not so much the \ndeed\u0014\nitself that brought him low but the fact that his moral posturing, his\u0014\nwrenching, tear-stained appeals for understanding and forgiveness, \ndid not\u0014\nring true in our ears. In short, he committed the unpardonable sin, \nthe sin\u0014\nagainst the human spirit, the sin of trying to pull an emotional fast \none --\u0014\nthe sin of hypocrisy. \"Father, do not forgive him, for he knows full \nwell\u0014\nwhat he's doing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPositioned on the scale of evildoing somewhere between tobacco company\u0014\nexecutives and junk bond traders, hypocrites are convenient villains \nfor our\u0014\ncultural rage. In a therapeutic climate, where people clamor to \nappear on\u0014\nOprah and Geraldo to do an emotional striptease, baring in the name of\u0014\ncandor the deepest secrets of their past in front of an audience of \nperfect\u0014\nstrangers, hypocrites seem, by contrast, emotionally stunted. They are\u0014\nguarded and deceptive; they put on false and pretty faces, hiding \ntheir true\u0014\nselves behind the cloak of pseudo-respectability.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, \"hypocrite\" was originally a theatrical term, describing \nactors, who\u0014\nconcealed their real countenances behind dramatic masks. The sin of\u0014\nhypocrisy, then, is wearing a mask, and in our time no transgression \nis more\u0014\ncontemptible. Hypocrites conceal sadness with a smile; they say they \nare\u0014\nhappy to see you when they would rather have root canal work than to \nbe in\u0014\nyour presence; they give money to charities they do not truly \nsupport; they\u0014\nmake speeches for causes they don't care about; and they laugh at \njokes they\u0014\ndon't find funny. In short, hypocrites wear masks, pretending to be \nwho they\u0014\nare not.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious hypocrites are, of course, the worst of the breed -- and \nthe most\u0014\ninviting targets. In The Devil's Dictionary, Ambrose Bierce joined a \nlong\u0014\nline of those who have skewered churchly hypocrisy when he defined a\u0014\nChristian as \"one who follows the teachings of Christ insofar as they \nare\u0014\nnot inconsistent with a life of sin\" and a member of the clergy as \none \"who\u0014\nundertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of \nbettering\u0014\nhis temporal ones.\"1\u0014\n\u0014\nThe specific problem with religious hypocrites is that they are not \nonly\u0014\n\"holier-than-thou\"; they are also \"holier-than-themselves.\" They feign\u0014\ndevotion, but it is mostly counterfeit. As virtually every Youth \nSunday\u0014\nsermon is quick to observe, hypocrites sit piously in pews (or stand \npiously\u0014\nin pulpits) on Sunday mornings praying the prayers and singing the \nhymns\u0014\nwhen, truth be known, they are really just as sinful as the secular \ntypes\u0014\nwho have partied like jackals on Saturday and whose Sabbath liturgy \nconsists\u0014\nof sleeping late and pondering what sort of toppings should go on the\u0014\nDomino's pizza they will order for the halftime of the football game. \nIn\u0014\nfact, people with a sharp eye for hypocrisy would consider those who \nstay at\u0014\nhome on Sunday as actually morally superior to the hypocrites who drag\u0014\nthemselves out of bed and show up for Sunday school. At least they \naren't\u0014\nwearing a pious mask and living a lie.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we want to be hard on hypocrites -- especially religious \nhypocrites -- we\u0014\nseem to have a natural ally in Jesus. Whenever he got a card-carrying\u0014\nhypocrite in his sights, he pulled the rhetorical trigger. With \nrollicking\u0014\nhumor, Jesus mocked hypocrites as the clowns of their own moral \nvaudeville\u0014\nshow. As Jesus described them, hypocrites want the trumpeter to play \n\"Hey\u0014\nLook Me Over\" when they pull out their offering envelopes; they \nconduct\u0014\nprayer meetings at busy intersections during rush hour; and on fast \ndays\u0014\nthey put on a melancholy public face that makes them look for all the \nworld\u0014\nlike they have the flu. In short, they parade their deeds with a \nflourish\u0014\nbefore the admiring eyes of others. That's what they want, and that's \nwhat\u0014\nthey get -- indeed, the problem is that the adoration of the crowd is \nall\u0014\nthey get. \"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus says, \"they have received their \nreward.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo Jesus does not tolerate hypocrites, and neither do we. So much for\u0014\nhypocrisy. Next topic ...\u0014\n\u0014\nBut before we assume that Jesus fully shares our views on hypocrites, \nwe\u0014\nshould look again, and more closely, at what he says. To be sure, the\u0014\nhypocrites that Jesus takes on are people who are somehow missing the \nboat\u0014\nin their religious life, in their almsgiving, prayer and fasting, but \nthat\u0014\nis not to say that there is nothing to them. Indeed, it must be \nacknowledged\u0014\nthat they are people who give their money to the poor, who pray and \nwho\u0014\nfast. When he takes off after hypocrites, Jesus is not talking about \npeople\u0014\nwho thumb their noses at the synagogue or the church, and he is not \ntalking\u0014\neven about those who show up for worship but sit passively on their \nhands.\u0014\nTo the contrary, Jesus is talking about people every faith community\u0014\ndesperately needs, people who actually put the faith into practice. \nThey are\u0014\npeople of charity, people of prayer, people of action. They are \nnumbered\u0014\namong those who fill out their pledge cards, volunteer to keep the \nnursery,\u0014\nserve on committees, spearhead the social action task force and show \nup for\u0014\nchurch retreats.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn sum, in order to qualify in Jesus' book as a hypocrite one has to \nbe what\u0014\nevery church wants and needs -- an active member, indeed an energetic\u0014\nleader. Hypocrites may have doubts and questions about what they \nteach in\u0014\nchurch school, but they teach. Hypocrites may demand brass plaques to \nmark\u0014\ntheir contributions, but they do give. Hypocrites may use flowery, \nsweetly\u0014\npious language when they pray for the sick and the lonely, but they \npray.\u0014\nHypocrites may let it loudly be known that they volunteer a day a \nweek to\u0014\nHabitat for Humanity, but they do build houses for the homeless.\u0014\nTwo-and-a-half cheers for hypocrites; not quite three cheers, but \napplause\u0014\nnonetheless.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, Jesus does not attack religious hypocrites because they are so\u0014\nruthlessly opposed to the gospel truth but rather because they have \njust\u0014\nbarely missed it. Jesus says harsh things about the hypocrites not \nbecause\u0014\nthey are so far away from the kingdom but because they are so very \nclose and\u0014\nyet cannot see the true destination. The praying, fasting, almsgiving\u0014\nhypocrites of Jesus' day were not headed in the wrong direction; they \nwere\u0014\non the right path, but they did not take their faith far enough. They \ngo\u0014\nonly part of the way; they are willing to settle for the minimum wage \nof\u0014\nhuman adulation when so very near -- just around the bend, in fact -- \nlies\u0014\nthe real treasure we all seek: the affirmation and intimacy of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nHypocrites are like some children who are behavior problems in school.\u0014\nHaving lost the hope of being loved and cared for at home, they become\u0014\nshow-offs in the classroom, creating spectacles of themselves for the\u0014\namusement of others. Having despaired of the parental blessing, they \nsettle\u0014\nfor the momentary reward of the schoolroom spotlight. It is not the \nkind of\u0014\nattention they really need, but it is the attention they are sure \nthey can\u0014\nget. Just so, hypocrites have lost sight of the blessing of the divine\u0014\nparent they have at home, lost sight of the God who sees in secret, \nwho\u0014\ncherishes in the divine heart, who graciously rewards beyond measure.\u0014\nTherefore, they are condemned to parade around in front of the only \naudience\u0014\nthey have left to impress -- other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' harsh reprimand of hypocrisy, then, is intended to reclaim, \nnot to\u0014\ndestroy. Indeed, Jesus' scolding words are but white caps on a sea of\u0014\nprovidence. Underneath the reproach is the promise that God desires \nto draw\u0014\nnear in mercy and redemption.\u0014\n\u0014\n ***** There is an old Hasidic tale about three pious Jews who \ndecided to\u0014\ntravel to a distant city to spend the high holy days with a famous \nrabbi.\u0014\nThey set out on their journey, without food or money, intending to \nwalk the\u0014\nentire way.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral days into the journey, weak from hunger and still a long way \nfrom\u0014\ntheir destination, they knew they had made a mistake and they must do\u0014\nsomething. They came up with a plan. They decided that one of them \nwould\u0014\ndisguise himself as a rabbi. That way, when they came to the next \nvillage,\u0014\nthe people would offer them food, honored to have a rabbi visit their \ntown.\u0014\nNone of the three, being pious, wished to be the deceitful one, so \nthey drew\u0014\nstraws, and the unlucky one who drew the short straw had to don the \nclothing\u0014\nof a rabbi. Another dressed as his assistant.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they drew near to the next village, they were greeted with \nexcited\u0014\ncries of joy, \"A rebbe is coming! A rebbe is coming!\" Escorted with \ngreat\u0014\nceremony to the local inn, the hungry threesome were treated to a \nsumptuous\u0014\nmeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the meal was done, however, the innkeeper approached the \"rabbi\" \nand\u0014\nspoke with great sorrow. \"Rebbe, you must pray for my son,\" he said. \n\"He is\u0014\ndying and the doctors have given up hope. But the Holy One, blessed \nbe his\u0014\nname, may respond to your prayers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe counterfeit rabbi looked desperately to his friends for help. They\u0014\nmotioned for him to go with the innkeeper to his son's bedside. They \nhad\u0014\nbegun this hypocritical ruse, and now there was no choice but to keep \non\u0014\nplaying the game. The mock rabbi accompanied the distraught father to \nhis\u0014\nson's sick bed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat night, the three travelers slept fitfully. They were eager to \nleave\u0014\ntown before their deception was discovered. In the morning, the \ninnkeeper,\u0014\nstill hoping for a miracle and grateful for the prayer of this \nvisiting\u0014\n\"rabbi,\" sent the party off with the loan of a carriage and a team of\u0014\nhorses.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey left the village and traveled to the great city where they spent\u0014\nmagnificent holy days under the spell of the famous rabbi. His \nteaching of\u0014\nthe Torah carried their spirits to the very vault of heaven. But too \nsoon,\u0014\nthe holy days were at an end, and the three companions had to go back \nhome\u0014\nthrough the same village to return the borrowed carriage and horses.\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrified, the mock rabbi resumed his disguise; his heart was in his \nthroat\u0014\nas they approached the village, especially when he saw the innkeeper \nrunning\u0014\ntoward them, waving his arms furiously. But to the pretender's \ndelight and\u0014\nsurprise, the innkeeper embraced him with joy, exclaiming, \"Thank you,\u0014\nrebbe. Only one hour after you left our village, my son arose from \nhis bed\u0014\nwell and strong. The doctors are amazed, but my son lives, and I am \ngrateful\u0014\nfor your faithful prayer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe two companions looked with astonishment at their phony \"rabbi\"\u0014\ncompanion. What had happened? Had his prayer healed the boy? Was he \ntruly a\u0014\nrabbi all along, without telling them? When they were alone, they \nturned on\u0014\nhim with their questions. \"What had he done at that boy's death bed?\" \nthey\u0014\ndemanded to know.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe replied that he had stood at the boy's side in silence and, then, \nbegan\u0014\nto lift his thoughts to heaven: \"Master of the universe, please; this \nfather\u0014\nand son should not be punished just because they think I'm a rabbi. \nWhat am\u0014\nI? I am nothing! A pretender! If this child dies, his father will \nthink a\u0014\nrabbi can do nothing. So, Master of the universe, not because of me, \nbut\u0014\nbecause of this father and his faith, can it hurt that his son would \nbe\u0014\nhealed?\"2\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hasadim tell this story because of its profound insight into all \nof us.\u0014\nWe are all pretenders, hypocrites. None of us is so worthy as to \nmerit God's\u0014\nfavor; our religion is a mask we hide behind. But God is gracious and\u0014\nredemptive in spite of our pretense.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps, then, Jesus reprimands the hypocrites because only a sharply\u0014\npointed rebuke can poke a hole in the hypocrite's facade, allowing \njust\u0014\nenough light of the gospel to stream through with the news that every \nhuman\u0014\nbeing longs to hear: that when the applause of the admiring crowd \ndies out\u0014\nand the theater stands dark and empty and the pretender in all of us \nremoves\u0014\nthe mask and stands there, like the false rabbi in the old tale, all \nalone,\u0014\nthere is still God -- the God who knows our conduct grades and is \nwell aware\u0014\nthat we have primped around the classroom showing off for others, the \nGod\u0014\nwho nevertheless sees in secret, the God who looks behind the mask to \nfind\u0014\nthe child yearning to come home, and the God who beckons us to come \njust as\u0014\nwe are.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlease call us at www.eSermons.com if you have any questions:\u0014\n1-800-350-8339.\u0014\n\u0014\n1.

    "words": "A Guide for Negotiating \nthe Worship Maze\u0014\n\u0014\nAs WORSHIP STYLES HAVE proliferated, so have the corresponding \ndescriptions. Birmingham pastor Paul Basden, in The Worship Maze: \nFinding a Style to Fit Your Church, attempts to group the various \napproaches into five   prominent styles. Below is an adaptation of \nBasden's descriptions, borrowed from descriptions of simultaneous \nworship sessions at a CBF General Assembly\u0014\n\u0014\nLiturgical\u0014\nPurpose: \"To lead the church to before the transcendent glory of God, \nthat is, to praise God's greatness and power.\"\u0014\nDescription: The oldest (}nd most formal style, the mood of worship \nis characterized by reverence. Common features: multiple readings of \nScripture, litanies (responsive readings), and hymns primarily \ndirected to God, the life of the church or the demands of \ndiscipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nTraditional\u0014\nPurpose: \"To lead the congregation to thank God for his goodness and \nto hear God speak through his Word.\"\u0014\nDescription: Characterized by an \"informal dignity,\" this style \ndeveloped when liturgical worship met the American frontier. With \nroots in revivalism, its music retains the warmth of gospel songs, \nalong with an occasional mixture of traditional hymns and \ncontemporary choruses.\u0014\n\u0014\nRevivalist\u0014\nPurpose: \"To reach the lost with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\"\u0014\nDescription: Although strictly speaking, the revivalist style grows \nout of the revival movement of the 19th century and is focused on the \n\"lost,\" its impact on traditional worship continues. Music is buoyant \nand testimonial, emphasizing the work of Christ and its transforming \neffect upon the believer. While gospel songs remain standard fare, \noften newer praise and worship choruses are used as well. Preaching \nis the main event, focusing on the cross of Christ and the call for \npersonal decisions to follow Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nPraise and Worship\u0014\n Purpose: \"To guide the congregation to offer a sacrifice of praise \nto the Lord in a spirit of joyful adoration.\"\u0014\n Description: Once associated more with \"Pentecostal worship,\" this \ninformal, contemporary style actively encourages \"outward celebration \nof the immediate presence of God.\" Music is most often praise \nchoruses, sometimes printed in a worship bulletin or shown on a \nprojection screen. Preaching tends to be topical, addressed primarily \ntoward practical application of the text to the everyday lives of \nChristians.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeeker\u0014\nPurpose: \"To present and explain the gospel in nonreligious terms and \nin nontraditional ways to unbelievers. \"\u0014\nDescription: Language, music, drama and preaching are carefully \ncrafted to communicate with those who innately seek a relationship \nwith God but would not be other- wise reached by traditional means. \nLittle or no congregational singing is involved so as not to ask too \nmuch of the uninitiated. Participants are permitted anonymity as they \n\"seek\" to experience the gospel without making an initial commitment \nto discipleship. A variation is the \"seeker-sensitive\" service, which \nhas much in common with praise and worship.\u0014",

Singer and songwriter Bob Dylan \nis professing Jesus Christ as\u0014\n                      Lord. He is doing it quietly through his new \nalbum, Slow Train Coming. Like\u0014\n                      most of what he does publicly, he is keeping \nthe message foremost, disdaining\u0014\n                      the subculture's cult of conquered heroes and \nforsaking the notoriety of the\u0014\n                      born-again \"club.\" He remains true to the \nprophetic posture that has earned\u0014\n                      him the respect and attention of his peers in \nthe popular music arena.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many of the songs he has written were made \npopular through the musical\u0014\n                      talents of others (for example, Stookey notes \nthe significance of Dylan's\u0014\n                      \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" but it was Stookey's own \ngroup, Peter, Paul, and Mary,\u0014\n                      that propelled that ballad into the ratings).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is the sage-like message of Dylan's lyrics, \nthe thoughtful, conscious, driven\u0014\n                      critiques of shallow dehumanizing vogues and \nbandwagon motifs to which\u0014\n                      victims and victimizers alike have responded. \nDylan's uncompromised\u0014\n                      sensitivity and courage leave him free to name \nthe self-debasing methods\u0014\n                      with which Americans have dulled their \ncollective consciences in pursuit of\u0014\n                      prosperity, power, and the materialistic \nversion of the \"American dream.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But before Slow Train Coming, no roots anchored \nhis apocalyptic appraisals of\u0014\n                      the answers. Dylan could clearly see the light \nand the human nakedness\u0014\n                      illuminated by that light, but he was either \nunable or unwilling to acknowledge\u0014\n                      its source. While he sang of the rampant \nfrivolity and foolishness of human\u0014\n                      endeavors, his songs still sought for meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Slow Train Coming that quest has been \nsatisfied. Rolling Stone magazine,\u0014\n                      not wanting to disown Dylan, labeled the album \n\"artistically ambiguous,\"\u0014\n                      apparently ignoring stanzas like \"There's a man \non a cross and he they\u0014\n                      crucified for you. / Believe in his power, \nthat's about all you've got to do.\"\u0014\n                      And, to make it personal, he sings, \"What \nyou've given me today is worth\u0014\n                      more than I can pay / And no matter what they \nsay, I believe in you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The album begins with the only alternatives \nopen to each of us, reciting a\u0014\n                      litany of personality types and professions set \nwith the refrain, \"Well, it may\u0014\n                      be the devil or it may be the Lord, but you're \ngonna have to serve somebody.\"\u0014\n                      In the album's love song he reiterates, \"Now \nthis spiritual warfare, flesh and\u0014\n                      blood breakin' down, / You either got faith or \nyou got unbelief and there ain't\u0014\n                      no neutral ground.\" Dylan takes clear cues from \nScripture about Satan's\u0014\n                      active involvement in our depravity: \"The enemy \nis subtle, how be it we're\u0014\n                      deceived / When the truth is in our hearts and \nwe still don't believe. / Shine\u0014\n                      your light, shine your light on me. / You know \nI just can't make it by myself,\u0014\n                      I'm a little too blind to see.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Throughout the record there runs a theme of \n\"Gonna change my way of\u0014\n                      thinkin', bring myself a different set of \nrules, / Gonna put my best foot forward\u0014\n                      and stop bein' influenced by fools.\" He \nidentifies the fools as \"my so-called\u0014\n                      friends\" who \"have fallen under a spell, / They \nlook me squarely in the eye and\u0014\n                      they say, well, all is well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The title song previews the coming judgment. \n\"Can't help but wonder what's\u0014\n                      happening to my companions, are they lost or \nare they found? / Are there\u0014\n                      earthly principles they are goin' to have to \nabandon?\" He then alludes to\u0014\n                      Revelation 9:6: \"Can they imagine the dark ages \nthat will fall from on high /\u0014\n                      When men will beg God to kill them and they \nwon't be able to die.\" Slow Train\u0014\n                      Coming is not only about the end times, nor \ndoes it only point to personal\u0014\n                      judgment; God's judgment and man's sin are \nkeyed to current conditions. \"All\u0014\n                      that foreign oil controlling American soil,\" \nand, \"Sheiks walkin' around like kings\u0014\n                       deciding America's future from Amsterdam and \nParis  people starvin' and\u0014\n                      thirstin', grain elevators are burstin'.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perhaps the most refreshing quality of this, \nDylan's first postconversion album,\u0014\n                      is that he has not bought into the Christian \nsubculture's status quo. His gift\u0014\n                      to us remains his once-removed prophetic \ninsight. He is able to see the sticky\u0014\n                      sweet personalization puffery of some segments \nof American Christianity:\u0014\n                      \"Spiritual advisers and gurus to guide your \nevery mood. / Instant inner peace\u0014\n                      in every step you take, got to be a prude / Do \nyou ever wonder just what\u0014\n                      God requires? / You think he's just an errand \nboy to satisfy your wandering\u0014\n                      desires\" is sung in the context of \"adulterers \nin churches, pornography in\u0014\n                      schools, / You got gangsters in power and \nlawbreakers makin' rules. / When\u0014\n                      you gonna wake up? When you gonna wake up'? / \nStrengthen the things that\u0014\n                      remain.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dylan has packed the album with a plethora of \nhuman foibles and fantasies, all\u0014\n                      cloaked in the latest societal garb (there is \nat least one with which each of us\u0014\n                      can identify) and exposed in the searing light \nof biblical metaphor. He at once\u0014\n                      shows us who we are and calls us to \"the man \nwho died a criminal's death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The voice and especially the music are in the \nbest Dylan style. But they are\u0014\n                      only the vehicles to carry a message that goes \nbeyond the searching of an\u0014\n                      earlier quest for the source of all answers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      This article originally appeared in the January \n4, 1980, issue of Christianity\u0014\n                      Today.

Many readers or \nmoviegoers will feel just\u0014\n                      as scandalized, or terrified, as they were 25 \nyears ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Exorcist-related news stories have furrowed the \nbrows of those\u0014\n                      religionists embarrassed by the supernatural. \nEx-priest Robert\u0014\n                      McClory, for example, told a fellow journalist \nat The Chicago\u0014\n                      Reader: \"At one time the church was fraught \nwith this kind of\u0014\n                      stuffthe burning of heretics, the belief in \npossession and evil\u0014\n                      spirits and witches flying through the air.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Our brows are not so furrowed. \"There are two \nequal and\u0014\n                      opposite errors into which our race can fall \nabout the devils.\u0014\n                      One is to disbelieve in their existence,\" C. S. \nLewis wrote in his\u0014\n                      preface to The Screwtape Letters. \"The other is \nto believe, and\u0014\n                      to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in \nthem. They\u0014\n                      themselves are equally pleased by both errors, \nand hail a\u0014\n                      materialist or a magician with the same \ndelight.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Whether Christians use the formal rites of \nRoman Catholicism\u0014\n                      or the vigorous prayers of charismatic and \nPentecostal\u0014\n                      believers, exorcism is God's good gift to the \nchurch. Through\u0014\n                      exorcism, God graciously delivers people from \ndemonic\u0014\n                      powers, which seek a person's total physical \nand spiritual\u0014\n                      destruction. We can mistakenly interpret \ndemonic possession\u0014\n                      strictly through materialist or therapeutic \ncategories, or we can\u0014\n                      call on the power of God and bring healing to a \nsuffering\u0014\n                      person.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We do not pretend to know the frequency of \ndemonic activity.\u0014\n                      We have no interest in seeking out spiritual \nwarfare. And we\u0014\n                      salute the wisdom of considering exorcism a \nlast resort rather\u0014\n                      than a default response.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So long as we live in this fallen world, we may \nbe sure that\u0014\n                      demons not only exist, but will make bullying \nand presumptuous\u0014\n                      challenges of God's authority. Still, \nChristians need fear no evil,\u0014\n                      so long as we lean on the strong arm of the \nLord and not our\u0014\n                      own emotional or spiritual strength. By his \ndeath on the Cross\u0014\n                      and by his glorious resurrection, Jesus crushed \nSatan's real\u0014\n                      but fleeting power.\u0014",

    "title": "NEW CLUE FOUND IN JIMMY HOFFA DISAPPEARANCE",
    "words": "Friday, Sept. 7, 2001 \u0014\n\u0014\n          New clue found in Jimmy Hoffa\u0014\n          disappearance \u0014\n\u0014\n          DNA tests have turned up a new clue in the disappearance of \nthe former Teamsters president Jimmy\u0014\n          Hoffa, who was last seen in 1975 and is believed to have \nbeen the victim of a mob hit, the FBI said Friday. \u0014\n\u0014\n          The Detroit News reported that FBI scientists had used new \nDNA technology to match a hair from Hoffa\u0014\n          with one found in a car driven by a one-time friend on the \nday the labor leader was last seen. An FBI official\u0014\n          in Washington told CNN that the report was accurate. \u0014\n\u0014\n          The FBI matched DNA from Hoffa's hair -- taken from a brush \n-- with a strand of hair found in a 1975\u0014\n          Mercury Marquis Brougham driven by longtime friend Charles \n\"Chuckie\" O'Brien on July 30, 1975. \u0014\n\u0014\n          John E. Bell, special agent in charge of the Detroit FBI \nbureau, said O'Brien, who has denied any role in\u0014\n          Hoffa's disappearance and has long maintained Hoffa was \nnever in the car, has been reinterviewed. Bell\u0014\n          was quoted as saying that DNA tests were done on all of the \nevidence, but wouldn't comment on the\u0014\n          results. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Bell said federal agents have met regularly in the past 11 \nmonths to discuss the case. Thomas V.\u0014\n          Fuentes, the chief of the FBI's organized crime section in \nWashington, was quoted saying that\u0014\n          \"prosecutorial decisions might be made within the next 24 \nto 30 months.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n          Federal officials said in a federal court affidavit filed \nin June that they might decide whether to prosecute\u0014\n          someone in connection with the case by December 2003. \u0014\n\u0014\n          The new evidence is significant because it apparently puts \nHoffa in a car that police had suspected -- but\u0014\n          couldn't prove -- was used in Hoffa's disappearance. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Hoffa was last seen at Machus Red Fox restaurant in \nsuburban Detroit. He was there ostensibly to meet\u0014\n          with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony \nGiacalone, who died earlier this year of kidney failure at\u0014\n          age 82, and Anthony Provenzano, chief of a Teamsters local \nin New Jersey who died several years ago\u0014\n          after being convicted in another murder case. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help \nsettle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Neither man showed up for the meeting, and both said a \nmeeting had not been scheduled. The FBI said at\u0014\n          the time that the disappearance could have been linked to \nHoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters\u0014\n          and its effect on the mob's control of the union's pension \nfunds. \u0014\n\u0014\n          O'Brien, who now lives in Memphis, Tennessee, was driving a \ncar that day that he said he borrowed from\u0014\n          Giacalone's son, Joe. \u0014\n\u0014\n          The elder Hoffa was 62 at the time of his disappearance and \nhad been released early from a prison by\u0014\n          President Richard Nixon on condition that he not seek high \nunion office. He had served time for mail fraud\u0014\n          at the Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, penitentiary where \nProvenzano also had been an inmate. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa, is the current president of \nthe Teamsters. The Hoffa family has long believed\u0014\n          O'Brien, who had a falling-out with Hoffa in later years \nthat was virtually unseen on the outside, was\u0014\n          somehow involved in the elder Hoffa's disappearance.\u0014",

Among their banners was one that\u0014\n          proclaimed: ``My grandfather was no criminal.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          Police with riot shields and armored cars blocked streets \nleading to the former Jewish quarter, where the\u0014\n          gallery showing the army exhibition is located - a block \nfrom Berlin's restored synagogue.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The prospect of a march through that area on the Sabbath \noutraged Jewish groups. The Simon\u0014\n          Wiesenthal Center, in a statement issued in Los Angeles, \ncalled it ``intolerable.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``Far-right extremists marching past monuments or in \ncenters of Jewish life is a provocation of outrageous\u0014\n          proportions,'' Germany's main Jewish leader, Paul Spiegel, \nwrote in the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.\u0014\n          The German government condemned the plan and urged that \nprotesters remain peaceful.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The march was organized by the National Democratic Party, \nwhich the government has asked the country's\u0014\n          highest court to ban for allegedly encouraging hate crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\n          City authorities insisted they couldn't ban the march \noutright. While demonstrations can be banned over\u0014\n          fears of potential violence, the National Democratic Party \nhas kept protests orderly, with skinheads\u0014\n          avoiding pro-Nazi epithets that are banned in Germany. \nSaturday's march ended without incident.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Mayor Klaus Wowereit pointedly visited the army exhibition \nduring the march, and organizers said several\u0014\n          thousand people followed suit.\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``It's outrageous for neo-Nazis to demonstrate here,'' \nWowereit said. But, he stressed, ``we must make our\u0014\n          point peacefully.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          ``They should have a look at the exhibit,'' said the \ngallery's director, Klaus Biesenbach. ``I don't think any of\u0014\n          them have been here. They don't even know what it's about.''\u0014\n\u0014\n          The exhibition shows how regular German troops, not just \nthe Nazi SS or special commandos, were\u0014\n          involved in wartime atrocities against Jews, other \ncivilians and prisoners of war. It reopened after a\u0014\n          two-year pause during which it is was extensively \noverhauled because historians complained the orginal\u0014\n          show was inaccurate and superficial.\u0014",

    "title": "NO EASY VICTORY",
    "words": "No Easy Victory\u0014\nA plea from a Christian husband and father who, day by day, resists \nhis homosexual desires.\u0014\nAnonymous | posted 03/08/2002, Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a business executive, congregation president, youth-group \nleader, athletic coach, happily married man for more than 25 years, \nand proud father of a couple of teenagers. Ohand I'm gay. My \nadmission requires some explanation, and perhaps some supporting \nevidence. You see, except for some experimentation during \nadolescence, I have not acted on my desires. From the outside I've \nusually looked and acted like a \"normal\" heterosexual male.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was raised Conservative Baptist (emphasis on conservative). From as \nearly as I can remember, I knew right from wrong, white from black, \ngood from evil, righteousness from sinfulness. There was no moral \ngray, no ambiguity. I felt irreparably condemned by what I knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen my wife and I were ready to choose our own theological home, we \nbecame part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The \nmessage of grace alone was, and still is, what attracted me to \nLutheranism. Unfortunately, we Lutherans are not all that good at \nliving in and sharing that grace, and sometimes I still feel \ncondemned by what should be good news.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the insidein my psyche, feelings, and attractionsI'm as certain \nof my gayness as I am of my sex. I first became aware of my sexual \norientation when I was about 9 or 10 years old, at church summer \ncamp. At that time, I had no idea what sex was, but I was nonetheless \naware of an overwhelming emotional attraction I had developed to \nanother boy of my age. It was an experience that would repeat itself \nover and over again. As I entered adolescence, it would take on a \nmore sexual nature.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time I was in high school, I had experienced a number of \nserious crushes on other young men. Most of these came to nothing but \nteenage friendships, but in a couple of instances, they did take on \nsome physical expression. The physiological and emotional drive to be \nintimate with another person of my own sex was almost overwhelming. \nSo was the guilt associated with my succumbing to this drive.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile my high school peers were bragging about their heterosexual \nexploits, I was trying desperately not to have the homosexual \nencounters that my nature inexorably seemed to draw me toward. For \nall of us, admittedly, adolescence carries some degree of alienation \n(from others and from self), but for me the sense of aloneness and \nself-loathing was almost more than I could bear. I developed a \nvariety of \"coping mechanisms\"alcohol, drug abuse, heavy smoking, \nand forced heterosexual encountersbut they proved ineffective in \ndistracting me from my urges. By the time I was a high school senior, \nI was frequently depressed and given to serious thoughts of suicide.\u0014\nA Strange Normality\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 19, in the summer between my first and second year of college, I \nbecame a Christian. Obviously, given my Christian family background, \nI had known about Christ and the offer of salvation for many years. \nNonetheless, I had never been able to make a meaningful connection \nbetween the conservative theology of my family and my inner turmoil. \nBut at 19, when I found myself in the throes of suicidal depression, \nChrist seemed to be my best choice of last resort.\u0014\n\u0014\nI thank God that much about my life changed as a result of that \nchoice. I recovered from my depression, got my drinking under \ncontrol, quit smoking (eventually), and straightened out my sexual \nlife enough to begin a healthy relationship with a wonderful woman. \nIn time this led to my marriage to a person who knows and has \nsupported me more than I could ever deserve. But, as great as all \nthis was, my sexual orientation did not change; I still was not then, \nnor am I now, \"normal.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd that's what I wish I could be: normal. I've tried to change, \ntried to become heterosexual, tried just about everything to do so! \nCounseling, therapy, prayer, healingyou name it. But for all my \ntrying, all I've managed to do is control the behavioral \nmanifestations of my sexual orientation. God has given me the power \nto live a fulfilling heterosexual life, together with the grace to \nlive with the fact that I'm still homosexual. It hasn't been an easy \nvictory. There are times when maintaining this dichotomous life is \nnearly overwhelming.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the years I've continued to struggle with emotional attractions \nand attachments to other men that have torn away at my insides and \neroded my confidence in myself and in God. I continue to struggle \nfrom time to time with thoughts that my wife and sons would be better \noff if they didn't have to deal with such a moody husband and \nfatherespecially his recurring bouts of almost suicidal depression.\u0014\nYes, mine is a victory in the sense that I have managed to maintain \nlife, love, and fidelity in my marriage, but it is a victory that has \nrequired almost daily battle, and one that comes at considerable \npsychological cost to me and to my family.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have no regrets about my commitment to begin and maintain my \nfaithfulness in heterosexual marriage. Nothing has taught me more, \nnothing has been a greater source of joy, than the relationships I \nhave with my wife and sons. But I am sometimes angry about the effort \nrequired, and I am frequently angry that I have had to do this on my \nown, without the support of friends or of a caring Christian \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Shroud of Silence\u0014\nChristian literature on homosexuality is full of polarizing rhetoric. \nOne side says that we should welcome our gay brothers and sisters \ninto Christian fellowship; that we should recognize this is how God \nmade them and therefore it must be how God intends for them to live. \nThe other side recites the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, uses \nwords like abomination, and gives us anecdotal evidence of people \nbeing changed. From the perspective of my experience, I cannot help \nbut conclude that both positions are nave.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy position on homosexualitywhile it may be realistic and grounded \nin true experienceseems to offend many and please almost no one. My \nfervent belief that God intends us to live in heterosexual and \nmonogamous fidelity offends the liberals who think I should accept \nand live out my supposedly God-given sexual nature. At the same time, \nmy experience that grace may abound but that it doesn't necessarily \n\"fix\" me or make it easy for me to live the \"straight\" life offends \nthe conservatives who preach and demand a clearer \"victory\" over my \nsinful nature. Rhetoric seldom provides us with an accurate \nrepresentation of reality. My story is a reality. I believe it is a \nreality shared by many more than just me, but disclosed by few.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy haven't I told my story to my church friends? Why is my identity \nanonymous? Because, despite all the claims by my heterosexual friends \nto \"love the sinner but hate the sin,\" I do not trust them. I do not \nbelieve that they could know this about me and still want me to be \ntheir congregational president, their youth-group leader, their sons' \ncoach. I wish I could believe it, but I don't. Perhaps I'm \nhypersensitive in not trusting, but I've overheard too many jokes, \nseen too many expressions of hate directed at homosexuals, to believe \nthat these same people could be my friends if they knew.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be honest, I myself sometimes have a hard time loving the sinner \nwhile hating the sin. Sometimes this takes the form of self-hate, but \nmore often I struggle with hating promiscuous heterosexual men, \nbecause they seem so self-justifying and because some peopleeven \nsome Christiansseem so accommodating of that sin while so condemning \nof mine. Just last week I was talking with a Christian friend about \nconcerns I had for members of our youth group. His response was \nsomething like, \"Well, you know, with all those hormones\" I don't \nget it. Do young male heterosexuals benefit from some sort of special \ndispensation? Why is their giving in to their urges so understandable \nwhile my giving in to mine would be such an abomination?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate on homosexuality is tearing at the fiber of almost every \nmainline Christian denomination, while also leaving many of us who \nactually are homosexual feeling misunderstood, marginalized, and \nignored by the \"dialogue.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI am not trying to argue in favor of my homosexuality, but to simply \nacknowledge the reality of my condition. I am broken, and I \nacknowledge my homosexuality as a manifestation of this brokenness. \nBut I do not believe I am any more broken than the person who sits in \nthe pew next to me. The greedy, the liars, the drunkards, and the \nsingle yet sexually active heterosexualsthey all share in equal \nportion with me in this brokenness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSin is sin, and grace is grace. We are all sinners and we allwhether \nheterosexual or homosexualare offered the same grace. Ours is no \neasy victory. It would be a whole lot easier if our churches would \ntry to understand, and accept, those like me who claim victory \nnonetheless.\u0014\nThe author lives in the western United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christianity Today magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christianity Today.\u0014\nMarch 11, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 3, Page 50\u0014",

    "title": "NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI",
    "words": "He was an Italian political theorist whose book \"The\u0014\n     Prince\"(1513) describes the achievement and\u0014\n     maintenance of power by a determined ruler\u0014\n     indifferent to moral considerations.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n  Niccolo Machiavelli was born on May 3, 1469, in Florence, Italy. He\u0014\n eventually became a man who lived his life for politics and \npatriotism.\u0014\n Right now, however, he is associated with corrupt, totalitarian \ngovernment.\u0014\n The reason for this is a small pamphlet he wrote called The Prince \nto gain\u0014\n influence\u0014\n with the ruling Medici family in Florence. The political genius of \nNiccolo\u0014\n Machiavelli was overshadowed by the reputation that was unfairly \ngiven to\u0014\n him because of a misunderstanding of his views on politics.\u0014\n\u0014\n Machiavelli's life was very interesting. He lived a nondescript \nchildhood in\u0014\n Florence, and his main political experience in his youth was watching\u0014\n Savanarola from afar. Soon after Savanarola was executed, Machiavelli\u0014\n entered the\u0014\n\u0014\n Florentine government as a secretary. His position quickly rose, \nhowever,\u0014\n and was soon engaging in diplomatic missions. He met many of the \nimportant\u0014\n politicians of the day, such as the Pope and the King of France, but \nnone\u0014\n had more impact on him than a prince of the Papal States, Cesare \nBorgia.\u0014\n\u0014\n Borgia was a cunning, cruel man, very much like the one portrayed in \nThe\u0014\n Prince. Machiavelli did not truly like Borgia's policies, but he \nthought\u0014\n that with a  ruler like Borgia the Florentines could unite Italy, \nwhich was Machiavelli's\u0014\n goal throughout his life. Unfortunately for Machiavelli, he was \ndismissed\u0014\n from office when the Medici came to rule Florence and the Republic \nwas\u0014\n overthrown.\u0014\n\u0014\n The lack of a job forced him to switch to writing about politics \ninstead of\u0014\n being active. His diplomatic missions were his last official \ngovernment\u0014\n positions.\u0014\n\u0014\n When Machiavelli lost his office, he desperately wanted to return to\u0014\n politics. He tried to gain the favor of the Medici by writing a book \nof what\u0014\n he thought were the Medici's goals and dedicating it to them. And so \nThe\u0014\n Prince was written for that purpose. Unfortunately, the Medici \ndidn't agree\u0014\n with what the book said, so he was out of a job. But when the public \nsaw the\u0014\n book, they were outraged. The people wondered how cruel a man could \nbe to\u0014\n think evil thoughts like the ones in The Prince, and this would come \nback to\u0014\n haunt him when he was alive and dead. However, if the people wanted \nto know\u0014\n what Machiavelli really stood for, they should have read his \n\"Discourses on\u0014\n Livy\", which explain his  full political philosophy. But not enough \npeople had and \u0014\n have, and so the legacy of The Prince continues to define \nMachiavelli to the general public.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n A few years later the Medici were kicked out of Florence. The \nrepublic was\u0014\n re-established, and Machiavelli ran to retake the office he had left \nso many\u0014\n years ago. But the reputation that The Prince had established made \npeople\u0014\n think his philosophy was like the Medici, so he was not elected. And \nhere\u0014\n the sharp downhill of his life began. His health began to fail him, \nand he\u0014\n died months later, in 1527.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Machiavelli had been unfairly attacked all of his life because of a \nbad\u0014\n reputation. But it only got worse after he died. He was continually \nblasted\u0014\n for his \"support\" of corrupt ruling. In fact, Machiavellian now means\u0014\n corrupt government. Only recently has his true personality come to \nlight.\u0014\n The world must change it's vision of the cold, uncaring Machiavelli \nto the\u0014\n correct view of a patriot and a political genius.\u0014\n ---------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\n Machiavelli, Niccol\u0014\n\u0014\n      Machiavelli, Niccol (1469-1527), Italian historian, statesman, \nand\u0014\n political philosopher, whose amoral, but influential writings on \nstatecraft\u0014\n have turned his name into a synonym for cunning and duplicity.  \n(THAT IS\u0014\n VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW. HE WAS CROOKED.)\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Born in Florence on May 3, 1469, Machiavelli entered government \nservice\u0014\n as a clerk and rose to prominence when the Florentine Republic was\u0014\n proclaimed in 1498. He was secretary of the ten-man council that \nconducted\u0014\n the diplomatic  negotiations and supervised the military operations \nof the republic, and his\u0014\n duties included missions to the French king 1504, 1510-11), the Holy \nSee\u0014\n (1506), and the German emperor (1507-8). In the course of his \ndiplomatic\u0014\n missions within Italy he became acquainted with many of the Italian \nrulers\u0014\n and was able to study their political tactics, particularly those of \nthe\u0014\n ecclesiastic and soldier Cesare Borgia, who was at that time engaged \nin\u0014\n enlarging his holdings in central Italy. From 1503 to 1506 \nMachiavelli\u0014\n reorganized the military defense of the republic of Florence. \nAlthough\u0014\n mercenary armies were common during this period, he preferred to \nrely on the\u0014\n conscription of native troops to ensure a permanent and patriotic \ndefense of\u0014\n the commonwealth. \u0014\n\u0014\n In 1512, when the Medici, a Florentine family, regained power in \nFlorence and the republic was   \u0014\n dissolved, he was deprived of office and briefly imprisoned for \nalleged conspiracy against them. After  \u0014\n his release he retired to his estate near Florence, where he wrote \nhis most  important works. Despite   his attempts to gain favor with \nthe Medici rulers, he was never restored to his prominent \ngovernment   \u0014\n position. When the  republic was temporarily reinstated in 1527, he \nwas suspected by many\u0014\n republicans of pro-Medici leanings. He died in Florence on June 21 \nof that  year.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      II. THE PRINCE\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Throughout his career Machiavelli sought to establish a state \ncapable\u0014\n of resisting foreign attack. His writings are concerned with the \nprinciples\u0014\n on which such a state is founded, and with the means by which they \ncan be\u0014\n implemented and maintained. In his most famous work, The Prince \n(1532;\u0014\n trans. 1640), he describes the method by which a prince can acquire \nand\u0014\n maintain political power. This study, which has often been regarded \nas a\u0014\n defense of the despotism and tyranny of such rulers as Cesare \nBorgia, is\u0014\n based on Machiavelli's belief that a ruler is not bound by \ntraditional\u0014\n ethical norms. In his view, a prince should be concerned only with \npower and\u0014\n be bound only by rules that would lead to success in political \nactions.\u0014\n Machiavelli believed that these rules could be discovered by \ndeduction from\u0014\n the political practices of the time, as\u0014\n well as from those of earlier periods.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      III. OTHER IMPORTANT WORKS\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Machiavelli's formulation of the historical principles inherent \nin\u0014\n Roman government may be found in his Discourse on the First Ten \nBooks of\u0014\n Titus Livius (1531; trans. 1636), a commentary on the History of \nRome by the\u0014\n Roman historian Livy. In this study Machiavelli departs from medieval\u0014\n theocratic concepts of history, ascribing historical events to the \ndemands\u0014\n of human nature and the effects of chance. Among his other works are\u0014\n Dell'arte della guerra (On the Art of War, 1521), which describes the\u0014\n advantages of conscripted over mercenary troops. The Istorie \nFiorentine\u0014\n (History of Florence, 1525) interprets the chronicles of the city, \nin terms\u0014\n of historical causality. Machiavelli was also the author of the \nbiography\u0014\n Vita di Castruccio Castracani (Life of Castruccio Castracani, 1520), \na\u0014\n number of poems, and several plays, of which the best known is \nMandragola\u0014\n (The Mandrake, 1524), a biting satire on the corruption of \ncontemporary\u0014\n Italian society. Many of his writings anticipated the growth in \nsucceeding\u0014\n periods of strong nationalistic states.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n      Machiavellianism, as a term, has been used to describe the \nprinciples\u0014\n of power politics, and the type of person who uses those principles \nin\u0014\n political or personal life is frequently described as a \nMachiavellian.\u0014",

Announced verdicts and settlements \nin U.S. sexual-abuse cases over the\u0014\n                      past two decades total about $400 million, and \nexperts estimate that an equal amount\u0014\n                      has been spent in secret payoffs. With victims \nstill emerging, the worst may be yet to\u0014\n                      come. \"Churches and schools will be closed and \nshuttered to pay verdicts,\" predicts\u0014\n                      Patrick Schiltz, dean of the University of St. \nThomas School of Law in Minneapolis,\u0014\n                      who formerly represented dioceses in \nsexual-abuse lawsuits. \"Without a doubt, some\u0014\n                      dioceses will go into bankruptcy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Each of the 195 Catholic dioceses in the United \nStates is an independent financial\u0014\n                      entity, with its own insurance and  property. \nThey vary widely in wealth. In 1997, the Dallas\u0014\n                      diocese had to take out loans, mortgage its \nchancery building, and sell off\u0014\n                      undeveloped land tocome up with $11 million, \nthe portion of a $31 million settlement\u0014\n                      not covered by insurance. \"We were  fortunate \nwe had assets we could utilize,\" says \u0014\n                      diocese Chancellor Mary Edlund.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Much of the liability insurance held by the \nvarious dioceses is now tapped out. Though\u0014\n                      a few U.S. plaintiffs' attorneys have tried to \nget at the vast assets held by the Vatican,\u0014\n                      they've failed. Mitchell Garabedian, the lawyer \nwho represents the 86 plaintiffs who\u0014\n                      recently settled with the archdiocese of Boston \nfor up to $30 million, says he may try\u0014\n                      to attach the church's assets in other cases. \n\"Collecting is a problem,\" says\u0014\n                      Garabedian. -Pamela Sherrid\u0014",

    "words": "New Christian Miraculously Saved from Death and Shame\u0014\n\u0014\n      Hawa Ahmed was a Muslim student in North Africa. One day,\u0014\n      she read a Christian tract in her dormitory and decided to\u0014\n      become a Christian. Her father was an Emir (Islamic ruler),\u0014\n      so she expected to lose her inheritance because of her\u0014\n      conversion. She was completely unprepared for what\u0014\n      happened. When she told her family she had become a\u0014\n      Christian and changed her name to Faith, her father\u0014\n      exploded in rage. \u0014\n\u0014\n      Her father and brothers stripped her naked and bound \u0014\n      her to a chair fixed to a metal plate with\u0014\n      which they wanted to electrocute her. Faith asked them to\u0014\n      at least lay a Bible in her lap. Her father responded, \"If\u0014\n      you want to die together with your false religion, so be\u0014\n      it.\" One of her brothers added, \"That will show that your\u0014\n      religion is powerless.\" Although they had bound her, she\u0014\n      was able to touch a corner of the Bible. She felt a strange\u0014\n      peace, as though someone were standing beside her. Her\u0014\n      father and brothers pushed the plug into the socket--and\u0014\n      nothing happened. They tried four times with various\u0014\n      cables, but it was as though the electricity refused to\u0014\n      flow. Finally her father, angry and frustrated, hit her and\u0014\n      screamed, \"You are no longer my daughter.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n      Then he threw her into the street, naked. She ran through\u0014\n      the streets, humiliated and in pain. People looked at her,\u0014\n      curious rather than shocked. Shaking and tearful, she ran\u0014\n      to a friend. Her friend let her in, clothed her, and gave\u0014\n      her shelter. The next day, her friend asked neighbors what\u0014\n      they had thought when they had seen Faith running naked\u0014\n      through the streets. \"What are you talking about?\" they\u0014\n      asked. \"The girl had a wonderful white dress on. We asked\u0014\n      ourselves why someone so beautifully clothed had to run\u0014\n      through the streets.\" God had hidden her nakedness from\u0014\n      their eyes, clothing her in a beautiful white dress. Today,\u0014\n      Faith is a full-time evangelist with Every Home for Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Citation:\u0014\n   Guido Kuwas, \"Global Revival News\" (12-17-01); submitted by\u0014\n   Owen Bourgaize, Guernsey, United Kingdom\u0014",

    "title": "NICE THINGS BAPTISTS SAID ABOUT HITLER",
    "words": "Nice Things Baptists Said about Hitler\u0014\n\u0014\n           BY Loyd Allen \u0014\n\u0014\n           I intended to write about Baptist response to Israel's May \n1948 declaration of\u0014\n           independence. But I found nothing in the Baptist news \njournals I perused.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           This put me to thinking about Baptists' seeming reluctance \nto speak out on larger\u0014\n           issues of the world's economic, social and political \nscene. I contend that Baptists'\u0014\n           reluctanceparticularly Baptists in America and most \nespecially white Baptists\u0014\n           from the American Southwas due in part to a frontier \npersonal piety, a mass\u0014\n           evangelism theology, and the remnants of a fabricated \ncultural superiority. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           I came to this conclusion while writing an article (see \nthe Sep. 1-8, 1982, issue of\u0014\n           Christian Century) on the Baptist World Alliance congress \nin Berlin in 1934. An\u0014\n           immense Nazi flag, hung where the congress met, was a \nvivid reminder of the\u0014\n           bloody purge executed only a few weeks before by \nanti-Semitic fascists.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           Most of the BWA delegates spoke out for soul liberty, the \nkinship of all humanity\u0014\n           and the separation of church and state, but too many \nBaptist leaders did not.\u0014\n           Indeed, a number of U.S. Baptists wrote sympathetically of \nHitler's Germany. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           John R. Sampey, president of the Southern Baptist seminary \nin Louisville, Ky.,\u0014\n           cautioned against hasty judgment of a leader (Hitler) who \nhad stopped German\u0014\n           women from smoking cigarettes and wearing red lipstick in \npublic. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           In 1934, the Watchman-Examiner carried a letter written by \nBoston pastor John\u0014\n           W. Bradbury. Of the congress, he wrote, \"It was a great \nrelief to be in a country\u0014\n           where salacious sex literature cannot be sold; where \nputrid motion pictures and\u0014\n           gangster films cannot be shown.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           This focus on personal piety resulted partially from a \nfrontier religious ethic. On\u0014\n           the American frontier, where Baptist strength in America \narose in the Second\u0014\n           Great Awakening, the most crucial ethical decisions were \npersonal: alcoholism,\u0014\n           spousal abuse and violence. Few complex social structures \nexisted on the\u0014\n           frontier to attract a sustained moral critique. Baptists \nequated eliminating the sins\u0014\n           of the flesh with Christian living. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           Mass evangelism at any price was a second factor in \nBaptist blindness to the\u0014\n           Nazi evil. Some Baptists believed that evangelism and the \nworld order were two\u0014\n           circles that never intersected. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           F.M. McConnell, a Baptist editor from Texas, complained \nthat the BWA congress\u0014\n           program gave \"too much attention ... to economic and \nsocial and political\u0014\n           matters.\" He believed it \"far more important that the \npeople ... should get our\u0014\n           reasons for world-wide evangelism, according to a 1934 \nBaptist Standard article. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           A delegate from Montgomery, Ala., wrote, \"Evangelical \nChristianity transcends all\u0014\n           political and social systems,\" according to an Alabama \nBaptist article that\u0014\n           appeared that same year. As long as governments, even \nfascist governments,\u0014\n           did not interfere with soul-saving, they could be \ntolerated. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           This segregation of religious and political realities \nallowed for violent, racist\u0014\n           nationalism. According to the BWA Official Congress \nReport, German Baptist\u0014\n           Paul Schmidt argued that stronger races forcefully \novercoming weaker ones is an\u0014\n           expression of natural law that Jesus would not have his \nfollowers alter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           This type of argument must have sounded familiar to the \nslavery-rooted Southern\u0014\n           Baptist denomination. On one page of the Alabama Baptist, \nthe 1934 editor\u0014\n           praised his home association for having \"the purest Nordic \nblood among a larger\u0014\n           proportion of its people than any other county in the \nstate.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           SBC president M.E. Dodd of Louisiana defended Hitlers \npersecution of the Jews.\u0014\n           He wrote that though Jews \"were not to be blamed for the \nintelligence and\u0014\n           strength, so characteristic of their race, which put them \nforward,\" they could be\u0014\n           blamed for using those characteristics to get influential \npositions \"for\u0014\n           self-aggrandizement to the injury of the German people.\" \nBesides, Dodd\u0014\n           continued, most of the 200,000 Jewish refugees who went to \nGermany from\u0014\n           Eastern Europe \"were communist agitators against the \ngovernment.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           Small wonder, I suppose, that the 1948 Jewish declaration \nof independence\u0014\n           drew little or no comment from Baptists. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n           Loyd Allen is professor of church history and spiritual \nformation at the James and\u0014\n           Carolyn McAfee School of Theology.\u0014",

    "title": "NOSY, NOISY PUBLIC PRAYER",
    "words": "Nosy, Noisy Public Prayer\u0014\nBy Steve McKinley, guest columnist, LEADERSHIP\u0014\nMay 16, 2002\u0014\n\u0014\nPrayer is vital to me and my church, an important part of my own \nlife. Nonetheless, as I worship here and there, I run into public \nprayers that rub me the wrong way. First of all, I'm irritated by \nannouncements disguised as prayers. I wonder if they're not, in fact, \naddressed to me more than they are to God. I've spent quite a few \nyears trying to figure out the best place for the announcements. I \nfavor the men's room, before worship begins.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut if we're going to have announcements, then let's just have \nannouncements, rather than disguising them as prayers. As prayers \nthey're almost funny.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"O Lord, we pray that you'll bless the congregational potluck tonight \nat 6pm in the Fellowship Hall, A-H bring salads, I-P bring desserts, \nR-Z bring bread and rolls, at which a free- will offering will be \nreceived to help support the youth group's summer mission trip to \nMuscatine next July 12-18.\"\u0014\nI'm all for congregational potlucks and youth mission trips, but I \nask you: does the Lord really need to hear all this?\u0014\n\u0014\nOr how about this: \"Lord, send your blessings on Waldo Smith in \nMemorial Hospital, Room 3711, Bed 2, as he faces hernia surgery on \nTuesday morning.\" I'm sure the Lord is plenty concerned about old \nWaldo, but I'm also sure that the Lord can track down Waldo by \nhimself, and is pretty well up on the hernia surgery. Besides, would \nit be a crime if the Lord were to cast a little healing power by \nmistake on whoever happens to be occupying Room 3711, Bed 1?\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, I'm disturbed by intercessions, and by what our intercessory \nprayers say about our theology and our world-view.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are prayers for this person diagnosed with cancer and that \nperson grieving a death in the family and a third person facing \nunemployment and a fourth person with a difficult pregnancy and so \non. Don't get me wrong. Such prayer is a fine and worthy undertaking \nof the church, one commanded by Scripture, even though it does now \nand then verge on my earlier diatribe about prayer as announcement.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut this strikes me. I almost never hear thanksgivings. I almost \nnever hear prayers naming the person who just got a promotion at \nwork, the student who was honored at school, the benefactor whose \ncontribution keeps the local Habitat for Humanity branch on its feet. \nThe only way to make it into intercessory prayer is to have a serious \nproblem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does that say about our theology? Our world view? I do \nunderstand God's preferential option for the poor, God's concern for \nthe weak and the lowly, the hurting and the hopeless. We should by \nall means be praying for them. But does God care nothing for those \nwho don't happen to be hurting at the moment? Does God turn his back \non those for whom things are going well?\u0014\n\u0014\nI tried an experiment in such a setting a while back. As that \ncongregation was lifting up its intercessions, I named a friend out \nloud. Only his name.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the service was over, people kept coming up to me. \"What's wrong \nwith your friend?\"\u0014\n\"Nothing, as far as I know.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sick?\"\u0014\n\"No.\"\u0014\n\"Family problems?\"\u0014\n\"No.\"\u0014\n\"Depressed?\"\u0014\n\"No.\"\u0014\n\"Death in the family?\"\u0014\n\"No.\"\u0014\n\"Then why are you praying for him?\"\u0014\nI rest my case.\u0014\n\u0014\nI think our prayer lives would be enriched if, along with our prayers \nfor the hurting, we were to lift our prayers for those who aren't \nhurting, if thanksgiving should be a part of our intercessions as \noften as petition is.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't worry. I'm not going to become a prayer vigilante, wandering \nfrom worshiping assembly to worshiping assembly critiquing the \nprayers being lifted. But I feel better having gotten this off my \nchest.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteve McKinley is senior pastor of House of Prayer Lutheran Church, \nRichfield, Minnesota.\u0014",

    "words": "\"All Baptists Are Not Jerry Vines Type Baptists\"\u0014\nby Walter B. Shurden\u0014\n\u0014\nI Believe . . . \u0014\n\u0014\nthat Baptists, like Catholics and Muslims, are certainly not all \nalike and that one of the major problems for religious people today \nis to distinguish themselves from some who bear the same religious \nlabels. All Catholics are not pedophiles. All Muslims are not \nterrorists. All Baptists are not Jerry Vines type Baptists.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Jerry Vines, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, \nFlorida, and a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention \n(SBC), called Muhammad, the founder of Islam, a \"demon-possessed \npedophile.\" Speaking at the SBC pastors conference prior to the \nannual meeting of the SBC, Vines said that religious pluralism caused \nmany of Americas contemporary woes. \u0014\n\u0014\nPluralists, he said, according to the Associated Baptist Press, \n\"would have us to believe that Islam is just as good as Christianity, \nbut I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that Islam is not as \ngood as Christianity.\" Contrasting Jesus of Nazareth with the founder \nof Islam, Vines said that Islam \"was founded by Muhammed, a \ndemon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives-- and his last one was a \n9-year-old girl.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe immediate past-president of the SBC, Dr. James Merritt, pastor of \nthe First Baptist Church in Snellville, Georgia, and the newly \nelected SBC president, Jack Graham of Dallas, Texas, defended Vines. \nJerry Falwell likewise supported Vines in a statement following the \nannual meeting of the SBC.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the Baptist Soapbox below you will find several responses by \nBaptist people who vigorously disagree with Dr. Vines. Why print this \nnow, when the event happened over a month ago? For two reasons. One, \nall readers of this emagazine are not Baptists, and while they may \nhave seen reference to Vines statement in the general media, they \nprobably have not seen some of the responses by Baptist people. Our \nnon-Baptist friends, especially, need to know that all Baptists are \nnot Jerry Vines type Baptists. Two, the Soapbox provides an \nopportunity to collect several of the responses to the Vines \nstatement in one place. \u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the responses below analyze Mr. Viness remarks in light of \nhow incongruous they are with the spirit of Christ, how they blunt \nthe mission of the church of Christ, how downright uncivil they are, \nand how egregiously ill-timed they are given the circumstances in our \nworld. I agree with all those assessments. However, I am also deeply \ntroubled that a leading Baptist pastor has such little understanding \nof and respect for the meaning of religious pluralism. I could \nunderstand such remarks about pluralism coming from some other \nreligious groups, but a BAPTIST pastor? The advocacy of religious \npluralism is the bread and butter of Baptist history in America. From \ntheir beginning in colonial America, Baptists of this country \nchampioned the idea of religious pluralism, the idea that all \nreligions have the right to exist, to believe as they wish, to spread \ntheir faith without hindrance, and to practice their faith without \nharassment. Baptists never meant by pluralism what Dr. Vines said \npluralism means today-- that one faith or even one Christian \ndenomination is as good as another. Baptists certainly thought they \nwere right in the religiously oppressed environment of the \nseventeenth century. That is why, as minorities, they fought for the \nright to express their own faith, and it is also why they defended \nthe rights of other religious groups without belittling others faith.\u0014\n============================================\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Baptist Soapbox: Invited guests speak up and out on things \nBaptist (therefore, the views expressed in this space are not \nnecessarily those of The Baptist Studies Bulletin, though sometimes \nthey are). \u0014\nThis months Soapbox articles consist of selected Baptist responses \nto former SBC president Jerry Viness statement regarding Islam in \norder to let the public know that all Baptists certainly do not agree \nwith Dr. Vines.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. William L. Coates, Jr.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Bill Coates, Jr. is pastor of the First Baptist Church in \nGainesville, Georgia. He issued the following response to Dr. Vines \nand titled it \"Another Voice in Baptist Life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMy life as a Baptist is a positive one. I am pastor of a congregation \nthat is loving, accepting, and desirous of presenting the gospel as \ngood news. Unfortunately, not all Baptists experience such a positive \nand loving environment. Because I belong to this wonderful, historic \ngroup of Baptists in the heart of our city, I am compelled to speak \nout following the highly publicized remarks made by former Southern \nBaptist Convention president Jerry Vines a few days ago. Vines \ndeclared that Muhammed, founder of Islam, \"was a demon-possessed \npedophile.\" It is extremely important to me, to many in my \ncongregation, and to many Baptists in general that everyone know that \nMr. Vines does not speak for all Baptists. Neither do other SBC \nleaders who defend his statement. I would like to believe that Vines \nand company speak, in fact, for a very small number of Baptists. Time \nand again many Baptist Christians have had to shamefully endure \nill-considered, even scandalous and outrageous, statements from \nnational SBC leaders. Some years ago, for instance, Bailey Smith \nproclaimed that \"God Almighty does not hear the prayers of a Jew.\" \n(Not withstanding that Jesus was Himself a Jew.) Recently, Jerry \nFalwell declared that we Americans deserved the attacks of September \neleventh and, in fact, brought them upon ourselves. A great many of \nus are wondering when will such pronouncements cease. How many more \ngrace-less and embarrassing words can we endure? Im sure that Mr. \nVines believed what he said, but such a sentiment should never have \nbeen given voice. There are nearly one billion followers of Muhammed \nin this world. Slanderous and derogatory words about their founder \n(even if one believes those words to be the truth) do not invite good \nrelations between Muslims and us. And without good relations between \nus, what are our chances even for discussing our beliefs with them? \nOnly in a climate of understanding and respect can healthy dialogue, \nmuch less evangelism, occur. Suppose a Muslim leader were to \npronounce Jesus Christ to have been an insane cannibal (a charge \nbelieved by some of the Roman population because of Christs command \nto receive his body and blood when he instituted Holy Communion). \nWould not every Christian be deeply offended? Would not all \nChristians develop a justifiable resentment toward Muslims? \u0014\n\u0014\nBut my disappointment and dismay arise as a result of even deeper \nquestions: Where is the spirit of Christ in such a charge as the one \nleveled by Vines? I can see how Christs great cause in the world is \nadvanced by exalting Christ and His teachings. I cannot for the life \nof me understand how Christs cause can be advanced by demeaning, \nbelittling, or vilifying the founder of another faith. The Bible says \nthat we are to \"speak the truth in love.\" Even what we believe to be \nthe truth is best left unspoken if it cannot be spoken with love and \ngrace. Perhaps Vines statement was his attempt at expressing the \ntruth, but where is the love? And where is the example of Christ \nHimself who said, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto \nyou?\" We surely do not want our Christ profaned. How then can we \ntolerate one of our \"spokesmen\" profaning Muhammed or anyone else?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then there is the principle of plain old human respect and \ncivility. Most atheists and agnostics I know would not treat the \ndeeply held beliefs of either Christians or Muslims with scorn and \ncontempt. They would refrain out of the sense of decency if not \nconviction. Should not Christian leaders live up to at least as high \na standard? Bashing anothers religion or values or beliefs is never \na method for converting another to our own. Instead, it angers and \nprovokes those outside our faith into a defensive position and \ngalvanizes them against us.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago when fundamentalist Muslims made outrageous statements \nand committed outrageous actions, Egyptian president Anwar Saddat, a \ndevout Muslim who worked for peace with Israel, said with sorrow and \nembarrassment: \"This is not Islam. This extremism is not Islam.\" \nToday, many Baptists, after Vines' remarks, are moved with \nembarrassment and profound sadness to say, \" This is not Christian. \nThis extremism is not Christian.\" Vines asserted correctly that our \nChristian faith is one of grace, not law. A religion of grace must \nspeak the language of grace, use gracious words. The New Testament \nsays that we are \"stewards of the manifold grace of God.\" Do Vines \nwords exemplify good stewardship of grace? I will gladly praise the \nlife, teachings, and person of Jesus Christ. I ardently believe \nChrist is the clear picture of who God is. But I can never be \ncomfortable with those who demean or decry another persons faith. Be \nassured that these words represent quite a large number of Baptist \nChristians.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. David Currie\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. David Currie, executive director, Texas Baptists Committed and \ntreasurer of the Interfaith Alliance, released the following \nstatement entitled \"Vines Remarks Absurd in Every Way.\"\u0014\nJerry Vines, pastor of First Baptist Church, Jacksonville, Florida, \nand past president of the Southern Baptist Convention should have \noffended all decent and intelligent persons with his absurd remarks \nduring the SBC pastor's conference.\u0014\n\u0014\nVines harshly criticized Islam: \"They would have us believe that \nIslam is just as good as Christianity. Christianity was founded by \nthe virgin-born Son of God, Jesus Christ. Islam was founded by \nMuhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives, the last one \nof which was a 9-year-old girl.\" Vines continued, \"And I will tell \nyou Allah is not Jehovah either. Jehovah's not going to turn you into \na terrorist that will try to bomb people and take the lives of \nthousands and thousands of people.\"\u0014\nAs I said, I believe Vines' remarks are absurd (Merriam-Webster: \nridiculously unreasonable, unsound, or incongruous) Let me tell you \nwhy.\u0014\n\u0014\n1.It is ABSURD to think attacking the founder of another religion is \nan effective witnessing tool. Again, no one is ever \"offended\" into \nthe Kingdom any more than the Crusades could bring persons into the \nKingdom via the sword. Baptists believe in \"free religion, i.e., soul \ncompetency.\" Persons must be free to accept or reject Christ. We are \nto preach the beauty of Christ's character, his life and death for \nall.\u0014\nPersonally, I agree with Vines that Islam is \"not just as good as \nChristianity.\" Christianity is the ultimate truth. Jesus is the \nSavior of the world. We share this in personal witnessing; we preach \nthe superiority of Christ in our churches. However, we do not have to \npreach the superiority of Christ by criticizing other religions.\u0014\n\u0014\nHave you ever heard Billy Graham attempt to share Christ using the \napproach of Vines? Do you think Billy Graham believes other faiths \nare equal to Christianity? No, but he does not criticize other \nfaiths. He preaches the Gospel and trusts the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n2.The remarks show an ABSURD understanding of biblical revelation and \nthe doctrine of sin as well as an ABSURD understanding of church \nhistory. The Bible is full of stories of followers of Jehovah who \ncommitted horrible crimes. David, a man after God's own heart \naccording to the Scriptures, not only committed adultery but also had \nthe woman's husband murdered. Did Jehovah lead David to do these \ndeeds? Of course not. Such actions arise out of one's delusional \nsinfulness. \u0014\n\u0014\nLikewise Church History is full of atrocious acts done by the Church \nand in the name of Christianity, including but not limited to the \nCrusades, the Inquisition, the killing of many Anabaptists over \nbeliever's baptism, and the Ku Klux Klan, which claimed to be a \nChristian movement. These acts also arose out of delusional \nsinfulness.\u0014\n\u0014\nA further absurdity is SBC leaders defending Vines. This is classic \nsinful behavior. King David, following his adultery attempted to \ncover it up. We have watched various political leaders choose this \npath over and over. Now, SBC leaders are following this same path \nwhen a simple apology would be the biblical response and might do \nwonderful things for the Kingdom of God. After David repented of his \nsins, there were good occurrences, including the birth of Solomon.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason David \"was a man after God's own heart\" was not his moral, \nperfect life, but his example of repentance when confronted with his \nsinfulness by the prophet Nathan. You and I are not witnesses to the \npower of Christ because we now lead lives of moral superiority, which \nnone of us do. We witness out of our joy of being sinful persons \nsaved by grace. It is ABSURD to share Christ from any position other \nthan that of a horrible sinner who has found salvation.\u0014\n\u0014\n3.Vines' remarks further show an ABSURD lack of appreciation for \nAmerica's greatest gift to the world: religious liberty. The future \nof our country lies in our ability to handle religious pluralism in a \nhealthy manner. Our founding fathers wisely established that we are \nfree to believe as our conscience dictates, without aid or \ninterference from the government. That must remain the official and \napplied position of our government. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is nothing that would help missions more than for all countries \nto value and practice religious liberty. Vines' remarks hurt this \nimportant goal we should all have: total religious liberty for all \npersons everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\n4.It is ABSURD to criticize another religion in a political climate \non the verge of explosion. In the Middle East, people are dying daily \ndue to religious fanatics. Americans are being urged to leave \nPakistan immediately. Many SBC missionaries are serving in Islamic \ncountries attempting to tell people about Christ. Vines' remarks \nfurther put all these persons in danger from religious extremists who \nwould use these remarks to perpetuate violence. Vines forgot an \nimportant principle, \"know the difference in making noise and getting \nsomething done.\" These remarks \"make noise\" but the only thing they \ncan accomplish is increased tensions between Christians and persons \nof other faiths. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am very active in interfaith work, and I serve on the national \nboard of the Interfaith Alliance with Muslims, Jews, Catholics, \nHindus and persons of other faiths. Every one of them will tell you \nthat I am very open and straightforward about my faith in Jesus and \nwill tell you that I believe everyone should come to a personal faith \nin Jesus Christ. Being involved in Interfaith work does not mean one \nbelieves all faiths are equal or that one denies the depth of one's \ncommitment to their personal faith. Being a Christian does not mean I \ndo not respect the faith of others nor does it mean I do not respect \nthem as individuals. Each of us, out of our deep faith commitments \nworks together for the good of our country: to help protect religious \nliberty and to make us a just and respectful society.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe as Christians have a wonderful story to share with the world. It \nis very important we share this life changing truth with an attitude \nof humility and love. May we all, including Dr. Vines, whom I am sure \nis a wonderful pastor, learn from this ABSURD action.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarie Knowles\u0014\n\u0014\nMarie Knowles, a Baptist layperson and professional counselor in \nMissouri, sent this email to Dr. Vines on 12 June 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Vines, \u0014\nHaving just read your statement in which you described Muhammad as a \n\"demon possessed pedophile,\" I would like to share with you my \nresponse. I have been a Southern Baptist since 1949 and have worked \nwith international students in various capacities much of my adult \nlife. While I teach and believe with all my being that Jesus Christ \nis the Way, the Truth, and the Life and that there is no other name \ngiven among us through which we may be saved, I am outraged that you \nwould use such careless, derisive language in your description of \nMuhammad. Surely you are aware that such words do absolutely nothing \nto further God's purposes in a world that so desperately needs to \nknow, love, and follow him. Surely you are aware that such words can \nand will do great harm by damaging relationships and trust among \nthose who seek to share our faith with people of the Muslim faith. \nSurely you do not believe that had you been born in the Middle East \nyou would not have become a follower of this one you so disparage. \nWhat incredible insensitivity and lack of respect you display with \nyour arrogant remarks! \u0014\nIn the College Sunday School Department in which I am presently \nworking, we recently utilized a videotape produced by the SBC to \neducate our students about the Muslim faith. It was our goal to \nfacilitate better understanding of this religion in order to enhance \nour students' interest in and ability to share their faith in Jesus \nChrist with the many students who attend the university and worship \nin the mosque in our city. It was and is our belief that being well \ninformed, finding areas of commonality with Muslims, showing respect \nfor their faith and personhood, and demonstrating the love that we \nare enjoined to share is a very effective manner for building the \nbridge across which Muslims may travel in order to first hear what we \nsay and ultimately to come to know our living Lord and to receive the \ntruth of the gospel. How I pray that none of these young, vibrant, \nenthusiastic Christian students choose to emulate the pomposity \ndemonstrated in your comments.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems that what you say carries great weight with many people who \nlisten to you, and it is my prayer that you may consider carefully \nwhat the Bible has to say about the accountability of those who \nteach. I am praying that you may find ways to convey the good news in \na manner more consistent with the teachings of Christ. I am praying \nthat you can show more respect for persons whose ways of seeking of \nGod differ so markedly from your own. I am praying that you will not \nbe defensive but will rather allow yourself to learn whatever God may \nbe trying to teach you through this experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have no illusions that my remarks alone will in any way affect your \nstance, your beliefs, nor what I view as a hostile expression of \nChristianity, but I am convinced that my writing of this will relieve \nthe blood pressure spike I experienced as soon as I read what you had \nsaid. However, I am comforted by the awareness that men and women \naround the world will continue to be drawn to the Christian faith \nthrough the message of love, which Jesus came to bring in spite of \nsuch harsh and ill-timed words and in spite of the sin and brokenness \nof all of us who carry his name.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf my own words to you convey a measure of hostility as well I regret \nthat I can find no better way to express my dismay and outrage. God \nhas always had a people, and one can only wonder to what extent he \nwill be able to continue to use Southern Baptists or anyone else who \npresents his message in such a manner as this! May he have mercy on \nus all. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Earl Martin\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Earl Martin of Dandridge, Tennessee, spent 35 years as a Baptist \nmissionary in Africa and Europe and is a former professor of missions \nand world religions at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in \nFt. Worth, Texas. He wrote the following reaction to Jerry Vines \ncomments on Islam.\u0014\nIf I were Vines, I'd be ashamed of exposing such abysmal ignorance of \nIslam. After he cited the multiple marriages and concubines of \nMuhammad someone should've ask him if he reads the wisdom of Solomon \nwith his multitude of wives (how old were they when they were \nbetrothed to him?) or the Psalms of David who was an adulterous \nmurderer?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf I were a missionary in a Muslim culture, I would totally \ndisassociate myself from this. The following is a true account that \nillustrates my stance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a missionary, I had an experience once in Tanga, Tanzania, while \ndoing my doctoral research on Islam. One day at a Muslim school I was \nconfronted by a group of Muslim elders who angrily showed me a \nSwahili tract by a Christian missionary. The title of the tract was \n\"Muhammad, a Great Sinner!\" They thrust it in my face. I paused to \nskim it while they waited with grim expressions on their faces. \u0014\nThe tract censured Muhammad as a deluded evil man. It stressed his \nsexual immorality by pointing to his many wives and concubines. At \nthe very end of the tract it invited the reader to believe in Jesus \nChrist who was sinless. I raised my eyes to look into their faces and \nI said in Swahili, \"Even though, as you know better than me, it is \ntrue that Muhammad had several wives. Nevertheless, it is so very \nwrong for a Christian to write in this way about your Prophet.\" With \nthese words I distanced myself from the vitriolic tract. \u0014\n\u0014\nI sensed the anger subside in the room. After explaining that I had \ncome to learn more about Islam they were open to my questions. Thus, \nwe were able to talk together in an amiable respectful manner. This \nled to opportunities for witness to Jesus Christ, the reason I spent \n35 years as a missionary in Africa and Europe. We go into the world \nto draw people with the love of Christ, not to publicly attack their \nreligions.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Alan Neely\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Alan Neely of Raleigh, N.C. is a former Southern Baptist \nConvention missionary, former professor at Southeastern Baptist \nTheological Seminary in Wake Forest, NC, and emeritus Henry Winters \nLuce Professor of Ecumenics and Mission at Princeton Theological \nSeminary. He issued the following statement regarding Vines comments.\u0014\n\u0014\nI thought Southern Baptists reached the low watermark with Bailey \nSmith's statement that \"God does not hear the prayer of a Jew\" in \n1981. I was wrong, Jerry Vines now has established the nadir with his \ncalculated attack on a religion he has never studied, on a people he \ndoes not know, manifesting an ignorance of history and culture that \nis abysmal, and with the bigotry repeatedly evidenced by the \nfundamentalist SBC leadership since they made their move in Houston \nin 1979.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy only hope is that others still a part of the SBC--pastors and \npeople--will repudiate this kind of hate language and cease \nsupporting a body that is locked in a tight embrace with the most \nextremist elements of the political right wing in this country. If \nthose Southern Baptists of good will remain silent now, they will \nreap what they sow.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Robert Parham\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 13 June 2002 issue of EthicsDaily.com, Robert Parham, \nexecutive director of The Baptist Center for Ethics, wrote the \nfollowing column titled \"Vines Hate Speech Tarnishes Golden Rule.\"\u0014\nSouthern Baptist fundamentalists continued their hateful attack on \nnon-Christian religions this week at their annual convention, meeting \nin St. Louis. \u0014\n\u0014\nFormer SBC president Jerry Vines told pastors \"Islam was founded by \nMuhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives, and his last \none was a 9-year-old girl.\" The pastors applauded, the Houston \nChronicle reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nVines, pastor of First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Fla., blamed \nreligious pluralism for America's problems and implied that Allah was \nthe source of terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames Merritt, current SBC president, and Jack Graham, \npresident-elect, refused to repudiate Vines' statements.\u0014\n\u0014\nMerritt agreed with Vines that Muhammad was a pedophile, while Graham \nsaid Vines' statement was accurate, according to the Chronicle.\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Merrell, spokesman for the SBC's Executive Committee, also \ndeclined to censure Vines' statements.\u0014\n\u0014\nHate speech has become a predictable event at the SBC's June \nmeetings. But Vines sermon remarks disclose a peculiar blindness to \nthe moorings of Christian faith, his pastoral leadership and the \nreality of global communications.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Vines seeks to discredit the Islamic faith, he opens the \nChristian faith to stinging criticism about its own flaws.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament's list of heroes and heroines of the faith include \nAbraham, the polygamist; Moses, the murderer; and Rahab, the \nprostitute. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt also includes David, the adulterer, who had his mistress' husband \nmurdered. The same David became angry but did nothing when his son, \nAmnon, raped his sister and David's daughter, Tamar. These and others \nhardly provide the kind of storyline to describe the perfect \ntraditional family. \u0014\nJust as we hope our own faith will not be disfigured by flawed \nbiblical characters, we should avoid besmirching flawed characters in \nother religious. It is simply a matter of practicing the golden rule: \n\"Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nYet in Vines' effort to play to his audience, he forgot about his own \npastoral leadership. According to the Times-Union, one of his deacons \nwas arrested and charged in April with molesting teenage boys. \u0014\nVines and the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville likely do not want \nto be discredited by the alleged criminal behavior of one of its \nleaders. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Vines showed a lack of understanding about the reality of \nglobal communications. His statements appeared today in newspapers \nacross the country. His comments will certainly spread around the \nworld with no constructive results in a global society set on edge.\u0014\n\u0014\nIbrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Washington-based Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations, warned that Vines' remarks could hurt \nAmericans abroad and harm missionaries.\u0014\nIf Vines is really \"a prince of preachers,\" as Merritt said, maybe we \nneed less royalty in the pulpit and more thoughtful servants of God. \u0014\n\u0014\n*Parhams statement was first published in ethicsdaily.com.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Daniel Vestal\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Daniel Vestal is the national coordinator of the Cooperative \nBaptist Fellowship in Atlanta, Georgia. He distributed the following \nopen statement to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the \nIslamic Circle of North America, the Islamic Society of North \nAmerica, The Muslim American Society and the Muslim Public Affairs \nCouncil.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Baptist Christian who formerly was affiliated with the Southern \nBaptist Convention, I wish to convey my deepest sorrow and regret \nover recent statements made by Southern Baptist leaders. This \nrhetoric is not in the spirit of Christ, and it negatively affects \nthe mission of the Church to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo malign or denigrate the historic or current leaders of Islam \ncontradicts our Christian commitment of love for all people. We \ndesire the highest good for all Muslims and grieve with you over the \npain such remarks have caused. Please be assured of our respect and \nour desire for true friendship as well as open, courteous, sincere \ndialogue.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Frank Wells\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Frank Wells of Alabama, a retired pastor and former missionary to \nIndonesia, sent the following email to Jerry Vines at First Baptist \nChurch, Jacksonville, Florida, on June 12, 2002.\u0014\nYour vitriolic remarks about Muhammed represent the Ku Klux Klan \nmentality of Christianity, certainly not the Spirit of the Lord Jesus \nChrist who taught us to love our enemies. Your intemperate, \ninflammatory expression of hatred and contempt for the founder of \nanother religion may say much more about you than about Muslims. In \nfact, in the volatile atmosphere that prevails in the world today, \nyou may have cost some missionaries their lives, not to mention the \nadditional justification you have given to radical Muslims for their \nhatred, violence and terror. I hope that weighs heavily on you in the \ndays ahead.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor your information, I spent ten years under appointment as a \nmissionary to Indonesia, seeking to win Muslims to Jesus Christ. Many \nof them were good, kind, caring neighbors. I have no question about \ntheir need for salvation in Jesus Christ, but if you and your ilk who \nlead the SBC represent the true product of conservative Christianity \nI have some serious questions about how much better off they are in a \nhate-filled perversion of Christianity than they are in a hate-filled \nperversion of Islam. \u0014\nYour comments demonstrate our failure in the war of ideas. Jesus \nnever implied that we would outargue our enemies but showed us by his \nexample how to love and serve. The word \"Allah\" is a perfectly good \nArabic word for God who is not captive to the language of men, but \nwas perfectly revealed in the Word that became flesh and dwelled \namong us. \u0014\n\u0014\nMay God bless you with an awareness of the love of Jesus Christ, and \nthe capacity to manifest that even to Muslims.\u0014",

    "words": "By 1796, Thomas Jefferson was convinced that President George \nWashington \u0014\nand the Federalist party were moving the United States in a steadily \nmore\u0014\nundemocratic direction. When Washington announced that he would not \nseek\u0014\nreelection that year, Jefferson's supporters convinced him to leave \nhis\u0014\ncrops and gardens in Virginia and run against the Federalist \ncandidate, his\u0014\nold friend John Adams. He lost by three electoral votes. But a fate \nworse\u0014\nthan defeat awaited Jefferson: Under the rules of the time, he became\u0014\nAdams's vice president--a recipe for frustration.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Adams was a moderate Federalist, he and Jefferson clashed on\u0014\nmultiple issues. Most importantly, the two men fundamentally \ndisagreed \u0014\nabout the meaning of the American Revolution. Jefferson believed the \nrevolution\u0014\nwas a total break from history--not just a break from British rule. He\u0014\nenvisioned the new nation as a society of enlightened individuals \ncapable \u0014\nof governing themselves. Adams believed the revolution was a \ntransition to a\u0014\nbetter form of government, and felt that Jefferson's idealistic \nnotions \u0014\nwere incompatible with reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen war between France and Britain appeared imminent, and both \ncountries\u0014\nbegan seizing American ships to use against each other, Jefferson \nwanted to\u0014\naid the French. He remained a passionate supporter of the French \nRevolution\u0014\n(even as more and more people were led to the guillotine). \nHard-liners like\u0014\nAlexander Hamilton wanted war against France. Adams chose neutrality, \nand\u0014\nfound himself caught in the thankless middle.\u0014\n\u0014\nJefferson again campaigned against Adams for president in 1800, and \nthis\u0014\ntime, he won a narrow victory. It may have been the first peaceful\u0014\ntransition of governmental power between opposing factions the world \nhad\u0014\never seen, but there was no lack of hostility.\u0014",

In\u0014\n        1998, the Iranian government declared it would not support the\u0014\n        fatwa, but said it could not rescind the edict since, under \nIslamic\u0014\n        law, that could be done only by the person who issued it. \nKhomeini\u0014\n        had died in 1989.\u0014\n\u0014\n        While state officials cannot issue fatwas, the deputy \ngovernor,\u0014\n        ``like all Muslims,'' considers the death sentence against \nDaniel\u0014\n        as ``a reality based on the teachings of the Quran,'' Zamfara \nstate\u0014\n        Information Commissioner Tukur Umar Dangaladima said Tuesday.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Islam's holy book ``states that whoever accuses or insults any\u0014\n        prophet of Allah ... should be killed,'' Dangaladima told The\u0014\n        Associated Press. ``If she (Daniel) is Muslim, she has no \noption\u0014\n        except to die. But if she is a non-Muslim, the only way out \nfor her\u0014\n        is to convert to Islam.''\u0014\n\u0014\n        Daniel, a Lagos-based fashion writer with ThisDay, reportedly\u0014\n        went into hiding after being interrogated by police last week \nin\u0014\n        connection with the article, which suggested Islam's founding\u0014\n        prophet Muhammed would have approved of Miss World and might \nhave\u0014\n        wanted to marry one of the contestants. Her religion is \nunknown.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The newspaper has issued repeated apologies for the article,\u0014\n        saying the offending portions were published by mistake after\u0014\n        earlier being deleted by a supervising editor.\u0014\n\u0014\n        ThisDay officials were not immediately available for comment\u0014\n        Tuesday. But one of the paper's columnists, Amanze Obi, \nsuggested\u0014\n        Daniel ``may have been a victim of excitement.''\u0014\n\u0014\n        ``I imagine that she may have written that line without \nknowing\u0014\n        it,'' Obi wrote in Tuesday's edition. ``The line was \ninnocuous.''\u0014\n\u0014\n        Dangaladima said other ThisDay employees had been spared from\u0014\n        the fatwa, which ``applies only to the offending pen.''\u0014\n\u0014\n        Zamfara was the first of 12 states to adopt Islamic law, or\u0014\n        Shariah, after Nigerian military rule gave way to elected\u0014\n        government in 1999. Religious clashes since then have killed\u0014\n        thousands across the country.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The latest rioting began last Wednesday when Muslims burned \ndown\u0014\n        a ThisDay office in the northern city of Kaduna. More than 200\u0014\n        people were killed in the city and rioting also briefly \nspread to\u0014\n        the capital, Abuja.\u0014\n\u0014\n        The violence caused Miss World organizers to abandon plans to\u0014\n        hold the pageant in Nigeria and evacuate more than 80 \nparticipants\u0014\n        to London, where the show will go ahead Dec. 7.\u0014\n\u0014\n        (gam-az)\u0014",

The pastor coaxed, offered wann milk, \netc. The kitty would not come down.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tree was not sturdy enough to climb, so the pastor decided that \nifhe tied a rope to his car and drove away so that the tree bent \ndown, he could then reach up and get the kitten. He did all this, \nchecking his progress in the car frequently, then figured if he went \njust a little bit further, the tree would be bent sufficiently for \nhim to reach the kitten. But as he moved a little further forward, \nthe rope broke. The tree went \"boing!\" and the kitten instantly \nsailed through the air- out of sight.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor felt terrible. He walked allover the neighborhood asking \npeople if they'd seen a little kitten. No. Nobody had seen a stray \nkitten. So he prayed, \"Lord, I just commit this kitten to your keep- \ning,\" and went on about his business.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later he was at the grocery store, and met one ofhis \nchurch members. He happened to look into her shopping cart and was \namazed to see cat food. Now this woman was a cat hater and ev- eryone \nknew it, so he asked her, \"Why are you buy- ing cat food when you \nhate cats so much?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe replied, \"You won't believe this,\" and told him how her little \ngirl had been begging her for a cat, but she kept refusing. Then a \nfew days before, the child had begged again, so the Mom finally told \nher little girl, \"Well if God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe told the pastor, \"I watched my child go out in the yard, get on \nher knees, and ask God for a cat. And really, Pastor, you won't \nbelieve this, but I saw it with my own eyes. A kitten suddenly came \nflying out of the blue sky, with its paws outspread, and landed right \nin front ofher.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNever underestimate the Power Of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom \"Sharing the Practice\"\u0014",

    "title": "NO HUMBUG -- A CHRISTMAS CAROL",
    "words": "No Humbug\u0014\n\"A Christmas Carol\" remains the quintessential holiday story, but\u0014\nwhy?\u0014\n\u0014\nby Elesha Coffman\u0014\n\u0014\n   Before \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" before \"It's a Wonderful\u0014\n   Life,\" even before \"The Nutcracker\" ballet, there was \"A\u0014\n   Christmas Carol.\" Charles Dickens published his \"Ghostly\u0014\n   little book\" in 1843, just in time for the holiday shopping\u0014\n   rush, and it became an instant runaway hit. The tale has never\u0014\n   lost its momentum. It has been filmed some 200 times, with\u0014\n   actors as varied as George C. Scott, Bill Murray, Patrick\u0014\n   Stewart, and Scrooge McDuck playing the leading role. Why is\u0014\n   this story so popular?\u0014\n\u0014\n   1. It resonates.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dickens was in some ways a literary pioneer, for instance\u0014\n   revealing the awesome commercial potential of the serialized\u0014\n   novel, but he did not invent the storytelling craft. \"A\u0014\n   Christmas Carol\" echoes medieval morality plays, in which\u0014\n   otherworldly beings attempt to influence a human protagonist\u0014\n   toward good or evil. Such plays often featured accounts of\u0014\n   unhappy death to scare the main character--and the audience--\u0014\n   straight.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Medieval Europeans--who lacked a strong sense of salvation by\u0014\n   grace--cared much about dying well. Dickens's readers thought\u0014\n   comparably less about the afterlife, but they, too, confronted\u0014\n   death--from untreatable disease, from childbirth, from\u0014\n   dangerous work and squalid living quarters--regularly. For\u0014\n   contemporary readers and viewers, it may be Scrooge's bald\u0014\n   materialism that provokes chills of identification. Whatever\u0014\n   the cultural climate, the \"Carol\" works.\u0014\n\u0014\n   2. It's Victorian.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Most of what we think of today as \"traditional Christmas\"\u0014\n   hails from the 19th century. Sure, some European cultures have\u0014\n   awaited Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas for centuries, but the\u0014\n   jolly old elf we all know and love was invented less than 200\u0014\n   years ago by poet Clement Clarke Moore and illustrator Thomas\u0014\n   Nast.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Moore's \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" first appeared in\u0014\n   1823, a year after Britain's first Christmas card was printed.\u0014\n   Nast refined his vision of Moore's white-bearded, red-suited,\u0014\n   jelly-bellied Santa toward the end of the century, eventually\u0014\n   producing the image everyone now recognizes. Victorians\u0014\n   bequeathed us Christmas shopping, too. \"A Christmas Carol\"\u0014\n   taps into nostalgia for this formative holiday era.\u0014\n\u0014\n   3. It's religious ...\u0014\n\u0014\n   The novel's most famous line is Tiny Tim's prayer, \"God bless\u0014\n   us every one.\" The novel centers on a Christian holiday and\u0014\n   the Christian virtue of charity. Church bells ring out at key\u0014\n   moments, and the crowds in the street dutifully heed their\u0014\n   call to worship. The novel even ends with a kind of\u0014\n   conversion, when Scrooge decides to start loving his neighbor\u0014\n   as himself. Who wouldn't applaud that?\u0014\n\u0014\n   4. ... but not too religious.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Dickens attended an Anglican church, but his beliefs were\u0014\n   Unitarian. His God blessed all, his Christ was a good man, his\u0014\n   religion countenanced no creeds, and his Bible yielded only\u0014\n   noble precepts for living. In his posthumously published The\u0014\n   Life of Our Lord, he put it this way: \"It is christianity to\u0014\n   do good always--even to those who do evil to us. It is\u0014\n   christianity to love our neighbor as ourself, and to do to all\u0014\n   men as we would have them Do to us. It is christianity to be\u0014\n   gentle, merciful, and forgiving, and to keep those qualities\u0014\n   quiet in our own hearts, and never make a boast of them, or of\u0014\n   our prayers or of our love of God, but always to shew that we\u0014\n   love him by humbly trying to do right in everything.\" Not\u0014\n   surprisingly, then, there is no Christ in \"A Christmas Carol,\"\u0014\n   which unfortunately renders the story highly suitable for\u0014\n   network television and school productions.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Perhaps, then, \"A Christmas Carol\" is not only still a hit,\u0014\n   but still a cautionary tale. Thanks to Dickens and a host of\u0014\n   other Victorians, Christmas consistently warms the heart.\u0014\n   Changing the heart, though, requires an entirely different\u0014\n   story.\u0014",

    "words": "NOMO POMO--A POSTMODERN RANT\u0014\n   Why we can and should talk about something else.\u0014\n   by Kevin A. Miller\u0014\n\u0014\n   I'm sitting here on a gray, snowy Saturday, looking out at\u0014\n   flurries and longing for that warm, sunny time before we'd\u0014\n   heard the word postmodern. It's hard to remember now, but a\u0014\n   decade ago, seminars were given on preaching, not on\u0014\n   \"Preaching in a Postmodern Age.\" Books were written on plain\u0014\n   ol' youth ministry, not \"Postmodern Youth Ministry.\" Of\u0014\n   course, we were all unenlightened, unwashed then, locked in a\u0014\n   dead, Newtonian modernism.\u0014\n\u0014\n   How quickly we've learned.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Even six years ago, Leadership could publish \"The Riddle of\u0014\n   Our Postmodern Culture,\" because the concept was largely\u0014\n   unfamiliar to ministers. Now we all toss off words like\u0014\n   \"deconstructionism\" and \"abductive.\" We've been blessed by\u0014\n   conferences that are cool and collective, and we expect our\u0014\n   websites to be flash-animated and our coffees dark-roasted.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Proponents of postmodern ministry (PPMs) have made important\u0014\n   points for the church: We live in a time of transition from\u0014\n   one worldview to another; Christianity must not be constricted\u0014\n   by the prevailing worldview; the Incarnation is a central\u0014\n   doctrine of Christianity that calls us to be incarnational in\u0014\n   our culture; we need greater mystery, beauty,  and experience\u0014\n   in our worship of God. I agree. In fact, I think I did\u0014\n   beforehand, but PPM writings have sharpened my convictions.\u0014\n\u0014\n   On other topics, I agree to a point. PPMs have called for\u0014\n   metaphor, narrative, and surprise in preaching; after all,\u0014\n   Jesus taught in parables. Good reminder. But the same\u0014\n   Testament that gives us the elliptical parables gives us the\u0014\n   straightforward exposition of Peter in Acts 2 and the dense\u0014\n   argumentation of Paul in Romans 9-11, not to mention the name-\u0014\n   by-name genealogies of Matthew and the linear history of Acts.\u0014\n   Let us recapture indirection but not canonize it.\u0014\n\u0014\n   PPMs want us to listen to the postmodernizing culture, to\u0014\n   enter relationship and accept our common brokenness. Who would\u0014\n   argue? But while we love the relativist, let us hate the\u0014\n   relativism. It puzzles me why postmodern theory has drawn such\u0014\n   praise from Christians, when its essence (beneath the turgid\u0014\n   prose) is that there is no objective truth. The \"rules\" of\u0014\n   science or morality, pomo scholars contend, are as arbitrary\u0014\n   as the rules of baseball. But as Dinesh D'Souza reminds us,\u0014\n   \"Postmodern theory suffers from the weakness that the\u0014\n   postmodernists themselves don't believe it.\" When they get\u0014\n   sick, they check into a modernist hospital, and when they fly,\u0014\n   they step onto a plane built by engineers whose work must not\u0014\n   be as random as the postmodernists claimed.\u0014\n\u0014\n   We're told that \"the world you and I were prepared to lead and\u0014\n   minister in is over.\" But modernism is proving to be a hardy\u0014\n   old guy who doesn't quite die, no matter how many obituaries\u0014\n   are written. Just as pre-modern witchcraft and superstition\u0014\n   flourished during and after the Enlightenment, so will\u0014\n   modernist approaches survive into a postmodern world. Indeed,\u0014\n   modernism will remain powerful (though interacting with\u0014\n   postmodern ideas), since we live in what Jeremy Rifkin dubbed\u0014\n   the Biotech Century. The postmodern movie-makers will be our\u0014\n   bards, but the modernist gene-splicers will be our wizards.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Until recently, PPMs have overlooked (or sometimes, delighted\u0014\n   in) the fact that, as J. I. Packer writes, postmodernism is\u0014\n   parasitical: it lives off the achievements and failures of\u0014\n   modernism but offers nothing positive of its own. Its only\u0014\n   construction is deconstruction. True, some edifices need to be\u0014\n   demolished, but architectural awards are not given to wrecking\u0014\n   crews.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Thankfully, Brian McLaren, an author of several books on\u0014\n   postmodern ministry, writes in his latest that he has \"a\u0014\n   desire to move beyond a critique of modern ministry (a hobby\u0014\n   that can be dangerously preoccupying).\" And he and others are\u0014\n   beginning to offer something creative and generative. Soon\u0014\n   we'll know what it's like, really like, to live and minister\u0014\n   in the pomo church. We will have enjoyed the candles and icons\u0014\n   and warehouses and begun to answer what you do with children,\u0014\n   how you deal with conflict and leadership failure, and how you\u0014\n   finance it all. The entire church will benefit from those\u0014\n   lessons.\u0014\n\u0014\n   I'm fully prepared to admit that when we boomers were young,\u0014\n   we faddishly embraced church-growth ratios and sociological\u0014\n   analysis; we praised these modern tools as the salvation of\u0014\n   the church. So it's poetic justice for us now to sit in the\u0014\n   back of the room, the balding and befuddled, as the next\u0014\n   generation praises the postmodern matrix as the salvation of\u0014\n   the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But we're both wrong. We've already got a salvation for the\u0014\n   church, and he will not share his glory with any current\u0014\n   cultural form, no matter how valuable or necessary it may be.\u0014\n   If the church uncritically embraced modern culture, the\u0014\n   solution is not to uncritically embrace postmodern culture.\u0014\n\u0014\n   So, PPMs, let's make a deal. I'll stop saying \"seeker\u0014\n   sensitive\" if you stop saying \"ancient/future.\" I'll accept\u0014\n   that you're trying to engage a culture you know and love, if\u0014\n   you'll accept that I'm trying to engage a culture I know and\u0014\n   love. You're not a heretic; I'm not a Luddite. I'll declare a\u0014\n   moratorium on modernism if you will declare nomo pomo. Let us\u0014\n   hasten the day that PPM McLaren longs for, when \"we can use\u0014\n   ministry and gospel and neighbors and grace and other words we\u0014\n   love, never needing to use the 'p-word' again.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Kevin A.

    "words": "To improve the effectiveness of American flamethrowers during World \nWar II, Harvard scientists focused on making the gasoline fueling the \nweapon burn longer. They succeeded by mixing naplithenic and palmitic \nacids into the gasoline, resulting in a sticky, flammable gel known \nas napalm. Although it is usually associated with the Vietnam War, \nnapalm was first deployed in 1943 during World War II. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhether used in flamethrowers or bombs, napalm proved to be an \neffective--and devastating--weapon. The flaming gel was nearly \nimpossible to remove from clothing, and soldiers coated with the \nsubstance suffered excruciating deaths. Those who did not burn to \ndeath often died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. By \nthe end of World War II, American forces had used 14,000 tons of \nnapalm, mostly in the Pacific Theater. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Korean War saw napalm usage expand to 32,357 tons. United Nations \nand US forces not only dropped napalm on enemy troops and structures, \nbut on cities such as the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. It was \nalso loaded into landmines, and used to illuminate nighttime battles, \nto clear territory of vegetation, and to implement a \"scorched earth\" \npolicy that would leave nothing behind for Communist forces during \nthe UN's desperate 1950 retreat. \u0014\n\u0014\nBy the time of the Vietnam War, napalm had become even deadlier--the \nnew version, napalm-B, combined polystyrene, benzene, and gasoline \ninto a mix that burned even hotter and longer than previous versions. \nSometimes, it was used in concert with Agent Orange to destroy the \njungle canopy, but its main purpose remained the destruction of the \nenemy. One of every 10 bombs dropped by US planes in the Southeast \nAsian Theater contained napalm, and those bombs occasionally hit \ncivilians or American troops. The resulting controversy spurred \nrenewed debate about the role of chemical weapons, but napalm remains \na part of the US arsenal to this day.\u0014",

The era of the Crusades produced such giants of \nhistory and myth as Richard the Lion-hearted and Saladin. Although \nthe Arabs ultimately proved victorious, the Crusades are cited as \nreasons for the humiliation that supposedly fuels Islamofascism and \nterror. President Bush's passing reference to a \"crusade\" - which he \nclearly used in a non-religious way, as in Dwight Eisenhower's \n\"crusade for Europe\" during World War II - earned him a rebuke for \nallegedly taunting the tender sen- sibilities not only of the type of \npeople who fly hijacked airliners into buildings but of Muslims who \nwant to live in peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Crusades apparently inflicted wounds that, in 2003, have not \nhealed. They help explain the hate manifested in radical Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo it is said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Arab-Islamic arc complains about the Crusades and other \nmanifestations of imperialism. The Islamic conquest of Spain and the \nadvance beyond the Pyrenees attract rather less attention - and scant \ncriticism from Arabs and the blame-America-first galleries.\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam created an empire. It relied on the scimitar. Even today the \nsword plays an important role in the region's political and religious \nimagery. Rhetoric promotes a culture of death.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1974 a gleeful oil minister described the embargo as \"our revenge \nfor Poitiers\" - known in the West as Tours, the 732 battle in which \nCharles Martel turned back the Muslim thrust into France. (When asked \nto identify Poitiers, the average American student likely would say \nhe is the wonderful actor who starred in \"Lilies of the Field\" and \n\"To Sir With Love.\")\u0014\n\u0014\nIslam's power enveloped the Balkans and swept central Europe. Polish \nand German forces broke the Ottoman siege of Vienna only in 1683. Is \nthe Balkan reputation for bloodletting and chaos a legacy of Islamic \nconquest?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pope and other Western leaders have apologized for the Crusades.\u0014\n\u0014\nApologies for the Muslim penetration of Europe have not been demanded \n- or offered.\u0014\n\u0014\nRichmond Times Dispatch editorial 5/2/03\u0014",

    "title": "NEVER TRUST A TIGER",
    "words": "Never Trust A Tiger\u0014\nThey are kept as pets by the thousands, but as a fresh rash of \nattacks shows, tigers cannot be tamed\u0014\nBy MICHAEL D. LEMONICK\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you live in the Drew Hamilton Houses in Harlem, you learn to mind \nyour own business. The run-down brick towers and surrounding streets \nare plagued with crime. Meddle in someone else's affairs and you \nnever know what might happen. So when Valerie Tompkins opened her \nwindows one day last summer and breathed in the foul stench of urine, \nshe was not inclined to investigate. She knew that her upstairs \nneighbor, Antoine Yates, 37, kept exotic pets, but why ask for \ntrouble? She just closed the window again. Darryl Carter, whose \ngirlfriend lives down the hall from Yates, knew about the pets too. \n\"He just loved animals,\" Carter told HOBBES'S last week. \"He had a \nbook full of pictures of the animals he owned. He had, like, \nalligators and snakes and pit bulls.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Carter and most of Yates' other neighbors did not know about \nMing. Even in a city in which residents pride themselves on taking \nthings in stride, a 425-lb. tiger in a fifth-floor apartment is a bit \nmuch. \"How the hell did he keep it around here so damn long?\" wonders \nTheodore Dixon, another neighbor. \"What if he'd opened the door and \nit ran out? There are kids in this building. It probably would have \nbit them.\" In the end, it was Yates who was bitten, and although he \nfirst claimed that he had been attacked by a pit bull, someone tipped \nthe police off to the real story. A cop eventually rappelled down the \noutside of the building, shot the tiger with a tranquilizer dart and \nended the crisis. \"This,\" police commissioner Ray Kelly told \nreporters, \"is an only-in-New-York story\u0014\n\u0014\nExcept that it isn't. This month brought three tiger attacks in less \nthan a week: on Yates; on Las Vegas showman Roy Horn, 59, who was \nmauled within an inch of his life before an audience of 1,500 at the \nMirage hotel; and on Sarah Roy, 21, a trainer at the Keepers of the \nWild animal sanctuary in Golden Valley, Ariz. While it might sound \nlike a bizarre coincidence, the fact is that tiger attacks are not \nall that rare in the U.S. Between 1998 and 2001, according to a study \nby Philip Nyhus of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., \nthere were no fewer than seven fatal tiger attacks and at least 20 \nmore that required emergency care. Since 1999, two children  a girl, \n10, and a boy, 3--have died in the jaws of pet tigers in Texas alone. \u0014\n\u0014\nThese numbers are not all that surprising, considering that there may \nbe as many as 10,000 tigers in private hands in the U.S., many of \nthem kept as pets. That is twice the estimated 5,000 or so left in \nthe wild. In addition, Americans keep many thousands of other big \ncats, primarily lions and cougars. People own big cats for all sorts \nof reasons. Machismo is one: a tiger makes the nastiest Doberman seem \nlike a yipping Chihuahua. Some people believe owning a tiger helps \npreserve an endangered species. And a tiger cub, at least, is \ndownright adorable  until it grows up. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is also ridiculously easy to get your hands on one. The Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \nSpecies make it illegal to import a wild tiger. But there is no need \nto import one, says Nicole Paquette, legal-affairs director for the \nAnimal Protection Institute in Sacramento, Calif.: \"Tigers reproduce \neasily, and there are plenty of backyard breeders producing cubs. \nThey're like puppy mills.\" Anyone who wants a tiger can go to an \nalternative-livestock auction. Or if that is too much trouble, they \ncan just surf the Web, where large-scale breeding operations and \nmom-and-pop outfits advertise cubs for as little as $300. \"A tiger,\" \nsays Paquette, \"can be significantly cheaper than a purebred dog.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd in lots of places, it is perfectly legal to own a tiger as a pet. \nIf you put it on display, you would need a permit from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture plus any that are required in that state. \nBut no federal law prevents you from having a pet tiger, and only 20 \nstates forbid big-cat ownership entirely (though many cities, \nincluding New York, do have local bans). A bill before the U.S. \nSenate would ban interstate and foreign commerce in big cats, except \nfor circuses, zoos and other facilities like wildlife sanctuaries. \nBut even that would not prohibit private ownership. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe danger to owners and their neighbors is one obvious drawback to \nkeeping a tiger at home. \"No matter how tame a tiger might seem, it \nisn't tame,\" says Richard Lattis, director of New York City's Bronx \nZoo. \"Dogs and cats have been bred for thousands of years to live \nwith humans. Tigers haven't. They're wild animals.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who perform with tigers constantly assert dominance over the \nanimals, and that can create a backlash. For that reason, says \nPaquette, it is surprising that Roy Horn and his partner, Siegfried \nFischbacher, have not been attacked before. \"A tiger, especially one \nunder stress, is a time bomb waiting to go off.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOdds are that a captive tiger is under stress much of the time. Even \ntop-notch zoos and shelters cannot give big cats the huge range they \nhave evolved, over millions of years, to need. Under such artificial \nconditions, one false move can provoke an attack. Sarah Roy, for \nexample, tried to pet Tigger, the Arizona tiger, when it approached \nher during a foray into the animal's cage. She is now recovering from \nleg wounds but plans to return to work. \u0014\n\u0014\nPrivate owners often put big cats in even more stressful \nenvironments. Backyards  let alone cages or apartments  are \nterribly claustrophobic for tigers. \"What do you do if it's sick?\" \nasks Lattis. \"What if you get tired of it? It's a selfish, \nself-centered way of treating animals.\" Along with other \nconservationists, he dismisses the notion that tiger owners are \nsomehow saving an endangered species. \"These animals are never going \nto be returned to the wild, and they couldn't survive there anyway. \nConservation isn't simply about having more tigers. It's about having \nmore tigers in their natural environment.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nPeople who own tigers feel differently. Yates said, \"He's like my \nbrother, my best friend, my only friend really.\" A professional \nhandler like Fischbacher presumably has a more realistic view of the \nbig cats. Still, he insisted on Good Morning America last week that \nthe tiger Montecore did not really mean to attack Horn, who suffered \na stroke after the incident and remains in critical condition. \nMontecore, insists his owner, thought Horn was in trouble and used a \nlittle excessive force in helping out a buddy. Even if that is true  \nand plenty of animal-behavior experts would dispute it  the fact \nremains that every tiger is a potential killer. As long as people \ninsist on owning them, both the big cats and those who profess to \nlove them will continue to pay a terrible price. \u0014\n\u0014\n With reporting by Simon Crittle/New York and David Schwartz/Phoenix\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the Oct. 20, 2003 issue of TIME magazine\u0014",

The first pope to take a new name was John II in 533. His \ngiven name was Mercury, the name of a pagan god and hardly suitable \nfor a pope, so he adopted the name of the martyred John I instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere wasn't another papal name change until John XII (originally \nOctavian) in 955. Name changes became common after that, but not \nevery pope took a new name. Several eleventh-century Johns kept the \nname John, for example.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's possible that some very early popes took different names. We \nknow almost nothing about many of the popes (then called bishops of \nRome) who served during the church's first centuries, so tidbits like \ngiven names could easily have been lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2001 by the author or Christianity Today International\u0014",

Because that is\u0014\n                        clearly not how reasonable people see this.\u0014\n                                Abortion-rights supporters have not \nkept pace with the\u0014\n                        technology. As sophisticated sonograms become \nmore widely\u0014\n                        used, as it is possible to see the face of a \nfetus clearly, it will\u0014\n                        become ever more important to be painfully \nhonest about what\u0014\n                        really happens here. Something dies when an \nabortion is\u0014\n                        performed. It is not yet a baby. It is not \nremotely anyone elses\u0014\n                        business. But something does die. In the \ntension between\u0014\n                        woman and fetus, the woman has the right to \nchoose. But she\u0014\n                        cannot really choose to ignore that there are \ntwo important\u0014\n                        parts to this equation. Biology tells her so. \u0014\n       \u0014\n                                    By contrast, abortion opponents \nhave never understood\u0014\n                        the psychology. They do not understand that \nthere are times\u0014\n                        when an embryo is an embedded blessing, and \ntimes when it is\u0014\n                        an incubus, a nightmare, a curse. They do not \nunderstand how\u0014\n                        deeply felt is the notion that the right to \nthe processes of your\u0014\n                        own body is the great inviolate right. How \ncan they? How can\u0014\n                        President Bush understand this issue when he \nstacks the seats\u0014\n                        with people who can never know what it feels \nlike to be\u0014\n                        pregnant? Say this for President Clinton: \nwhen he vetoed this\u0014\n                        same bill, it was with five women who had had \nlate abortions\u0014\n                        at his side, to testify to their feelings, \ntheir reasons and their\u0014\n                        pain. How many ordinary women has George W. \nBush ever\u0014\n                        heard discuss this matter? Why was his wife \nnot by his side\u0014\n                        when he signed this bill instead of Dennis \nHastert and Cardinal\u0014\n                        Egan?\u0014\n\u0014\n                                It is like so much else in public \npolicy: deciding what to\u0014\n                        provide for the poor without speaking to poor \npeople, deciding\u0014\n                        what to do for the citizens of other nations \nwithout having any\u0014\n                        idea what they want themselves.

People don't know \nmuch about him these days, but any time they want to look up the \nmeaning of a word, they are likely to turn to a dictionary that \nechoes his fame on its cover.\u0014\n\u0014\nNoah Webster was born in Connecticut in 1758. Americans would soon be \nbattling the British for independence. Webster became a staunch \npatriot. Not only did he join a regiment during the revolutionary \nwar, but after independence, he wrote extensively, calling for a \nnational constitution and urging its adoption once the committee in \nPhiladelphia had drafted it. It is impossible to say how many people \nWebster swayed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTruth to tell, it is hard to find an area of society to which Noah \nWebster did not contribute something. He trained as a lawyer, served \nas a school teacher, edited newspapers and magazines, studied \nepidemics, amassed statistics, kept records on the climate, assisted \nin founding Amherst College, prepared an American version of the \nBible, produced teaching materials used by millions of Americans, \nagitated for copyright laws and compiled the first American language \ndictionary. (G. & C. Merriam Co. bought the rights to the dictionary \nin 1843, which is why many dictionaries have Merriam-Webster in their \nname.)\u0014\nWebster was a strong supporter of George Washington. In fact, he was \nsuch a strong supporter of the first president, that he established \nthe first daily newspaper in New York City so that he could defend \nhis hero. The American Minerva was first published on this day, \nDecember 9, 1793.Webster was one of the first to make the daily \nnewspaper a political force in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis views on the importance of Christianity can be seen from this \nquote \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the \nreligion of Christ and His apostles, which enjoins humility, piety, \nand benevolence; which acknowledges in every person a brother, or a \nsister, and a citizen with equal rights. This is genuine \nChristianity, and to this we owe our free Constitutions of \nGovernment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWebster was converted in the Second Great Awakening. His need of \nChrist having come strong upon him, he was unable to study. \"I closed \nmy books, yielded to the influence which could not be resisted or \nmistaken and was led by a spontaneous impulse to repentance, prayer \nand entire submission of myself to my maker and redeemer.\" This was \nfollowed by a sense of peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough he had great influence as an editor, Webster is chiefly \nremembered for standardizing American spelling.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Nation.

The weather was favorable for \nsearching for the elusive \"Aucas\" (Woadani). The missionaries wanted \nto share the gospel with them. Months earlier, Nate had flown over \nthe last place they were known to have lived, but found no traces of \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nEd eagerly boarded the \"modern missionary mule\" as Nate liked to call \nhis little yellow missionary plane. The two lifted off into crystal \nclear air and began their hunt above the Ecuador jungle, searching \nfor signs of Auca houses among the trees, especially along rivers. \nSome of the villages which had been reported earlier had hugged \nstreams.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seemed as if the hunt that began on this day,September 19, 1955, \nwould prove futile like all others. Gas was running low and it was \nessential to turn back soon. But then Nate noticed a blemish, \"barely \ndiscernible in the jungle.\" He headed for it. It grew and they saw it \nwas a clearing with manioc plants growing. In the few minutes \nremaining to them, they spotted fifteen more clearings and a few \nhouses. Elated they headed home. They had found the Aucas.\u0014\n\u0014\nExcitement was intense because the men had long hoped to contact \nthese sturdy forest dwellers who fiercely resisted all efforts to \nsubdue them, killing many who ventured into their territory. Ten days \nlater, ferrying men and goods to another station in four flights, \nNate deliberately flew different routes each way, zigzagging to bring \nas much territory under his plane as possible. On the third flight he \nspotted Auca dwellings barely fifteen minutes by air from the Arunjo \nstation.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn October 1st, bad weather kept Ed from going back to Arunjo. Ed, \nNate and two other missionaries gathered at Shell Mera and talked \ninto the wee hours of the morning, huddled over maps and trying to \nestablish the best strategy for reaching the Auca. How could they \nshow them they came in peace and not in hostility?\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough they badly wanted prayer cover, the men decided to say as \nlittle as possible to the outside world. Government powers or secular \nforces might try to one-up them with armed expeditions. Nate and the \nother missionaries hoped to prevent that. They wanted no interference \nin winning Auca souls.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe outcome is well known. Nate Saint, Ed McCulley, Jim Elliot, Roger \nYouderan and Pete Fleming made contact with the Aucas. They dropped \ngifts to them from the air and landed on a beach where they spoke \nwith members of the tribe. On January 6, 1956 all five were massacred \nin an ambush. Later, through the efforts of the widows, the Aucas \ndiscovered the meaning of Christian love and forgiveness and were \nconverted to Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nElliot, Elisabeth.

    "words": "August 23, 1572 \u0014\nNot Peace but a Sword on St. Bartholomew's Day\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn France, following the Reformation, Calvinists known as Huguenots \nsprang up in large numbers. The Roman Catholic establishment \npersecuted them. Manipulated by French political leaders, the \nHuguenots rose to defend their rights. Their behavior and methods in \nturn outraged Catholics. War ravaged France. Although fewer in \nnumbers than their foes, the Huguenots fought so fiercely they \nmanaged to extract concessions which allowed them to build churches \nand manage affairs in cities where they had majorities. But the \nbloodshed imprinted lasting animosity between Protestants and the \nCatholic majority.\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of this smoldering hatred flared up one of the most regrettable \nevents of church history. On August 22, 1572 an attempt was made in \nParis to assassinate Huguenot leader and French patriot Coligny. \nWounded, he returned home to recover. Accounts disagree as to what \nhappened next and who was responsible. Late on this day, August 23, \n1572, armed men, led by the Guises, broke into Coligny's apartment, \novercame the fierce resistance of his guards and killed him. \nColigny's death was the signal for a general butchery of the \nHuguenots. This atrocity is known to history as the St. Bartholomew's \nDay Massacre because it lasted well into that saint's day.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatholics slaughtered Huguenots in cold blood into the morning of the \n24th in Paris and for days in outlying regions. As many as 70,000 \nperished. The rest fled to fortified cities and fought back. Their \nmovement became known as La Cause (The Cause) and pitted them against \nThe Holy League (La Sainte Ligue). Brutal fighting raged across the \nFrench kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles IX publicly claimed he had ordered the massacre. Certainly \nthe Paris constabulary were warned in advance to prepare for \ndisturbances. Many historians have seen the plot as the work of \nCatherine de Medici, who felt her power threatened. Possibly Charles, \nby taking credit, was trying to reap a political benefit from the \ngruesome event. If so, he won no plaudits outside Catholic regions. \nPope Gregory XIII struck a special medallion to commemorate the \n\"holy\" act but most other European reaction was horrified. Charles \nhimself suffered psychological agonies from the affair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not the end of the matter. When \nthe Protestant Henry of Navarre converted to Catholicism in order to \nbecome king, he granted his Huguenot compatriots a number of rights \nunder the Edict of Nantes. These rights were gradually eroded, more \nHuguenot revolts occurred and, finally, 400,000 fled the country into \nvoluntary exile under Louis XIV.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nEerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity.

Forty-two years later, in May \n2005, Dr.\u0014\nZinn addressed the graduates of Spelman. In his address he challenged\u0014\nthem to think differently than does our society about \"the good life.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Zinn told these graduates, \"I know you have practical things to\u0014\ndo, to get jobs and get married and have children. You may become\u0014\nprosperous and be considered a success in the way our society defines\u0014\nsuccess, by wealth and standing and prestige. But that is not enough \nfor\u0014\na good life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Remember Tolstoy's story, 'The Death of Ivan Illych,'\" he\u0014\ncontinued. \"A man on his deathbed reflects on his life, how he has \ndone\u0014\neverything right, obeyed the rules, become a judge, married, had\u0014\nchildren, and is looked upon as a success. \u0014\n\u0014\nYet, in his last hours, he wonders why he feels a failure. After \nbecoming a famous novelist,\u0014\nTolstoy himself had decided that this was not enough, that he must \nspeak\u0014\nout against the treatment of the Russian peasants, that he must write\u0014\nagainst war and militarism.\" -- The Rev.

    "title": "NOT EVERYONE SHOULD BE A TEACHER",
    "words": "Columbus, the pride of Genoa - no more \"discovered\" America than he \ninvented the Internet, according to James Louwen, author of the \nprize-winning Lies My Teacher Told Me - a blistering critique of the \nhigh-school history textbooks our children are poring over and maybe \neven digesting this new school year. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter painstakingly comparing high-school history textbooks with \noriginal letters, diaries and interview transcripts, Louwen asserts \nthat today's history textbooks serve up a Disneyfied view of the \npast. Slippery scoundrels become heroes in order to idealize and \ncustomize our patriotic sensibilities, and - in more ways than one - \nthe truth is whitewashed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetsy Ross? Hire that woman's publicist! Betsy Ross was nowhere near \nthe first flag. In fact, she did absolutely nothing to serve her \ncountry - and to be fair, few high-school textbooks even mention her \nname anymore, although elementary schools still honor her as First \nSeamstress.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry? Mr. Give-Me-Liberty-or-Give-Me-Death? Eight months \nafter declaring that historic pronouncement, Patrick Henry commanded \n\"diligent patrols\" to prevent slaves from joining British troops \nduring the Revolutionary War. They had been offered a sweet deal: \nfreedom in exchange for fighting against their owners, many of whom \nwere \"the Fathers of our country.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln? Lerone Bennett Jr., editor of Ebony and author of \nworks on black history such as Before the Mayflower, asserts in his \nlatest, critically acclaimed book on Abraham Lincoln (Forced Into \nGlory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream [Johnson Publishing Co., 2000)], \nthat Lincoln was in his private life a crude bigot who habitually \nused the N word and had an insatiable thirst for blackface-minstrel \nshows and degrading \"darky\" jokes. He further asserts that Lincoln's \nfondest dream was of a \"lily-white America without Native Americans, \nAfrican Americans and Martin Luther Kings.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nColumbus rates his own chapter in Louwen's book. Not only were over \n20 million people already here when Columbus \"discovered\" America, \nbut most people in 1492 already knew that - duh! - the earth was \nround. Even the dullest slacker watching a ship sail away from any \nEuropean port had figured it out years before. Washington Irving - \nthe Oliver Stone of his day - popularized the mythology around \nColumbus, from promoting him as the \"man of science who corrected our \nfaulty geography\" to hyperbolizing everything from Columbus' \nseafaring adventures to his death. \u0014\n\u0014\nLouwen's latest book, Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites \nGet Wrong, takes on the roadside markers, guided tours, and museums \nwhich teach average Americans their U.S. history. He highlights \"the \nbirthplace cabin of Abraham Lincoln\" in Kentucky, built 30 years \nafter Lincoln's death, as well as a monument in Idaho dedicated to \nvictims of a \"horrible Indian massacre\" - although the massacre never \noccurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo wonder James starts right off the bat saying, \"Not many of you \nshould become teachers\" (3:1)! If you think teaching American history \nis tough, try teaching Sunday school.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost pastors and Christian Education committees are, of course, \nthrilled to get their hands on any warm body who might volunteer to \nteach. Breathing? No criminal record? Great! Here's the middle school \nclass. Good luck! \u0014\n\u0014\nWe round up anyone remotely interested in teaching without much \nthought about qualifications. But James extols one timeless \nqualification which must not be overlooked: Teachers must watch what \nthey say. The ability to tame the tongue is James' primary \nrequirement. \u0014\n\u0014\nWords yield enormous power. James Louwen repeatedly illustrates how \nthe choice of a single word can have an overwhelming impact on \nhistory. Does a textbook call Native Americans \"savage\"? Are slaves \ndescribed as being \"simple-minded\"? Words go beyond political \ncorrectness. They impact historical correctness. They impact \ntheological correctness! \u0014\n\u0014\nWords can set a forest ablaze! (v. 5). James' letter notes that the \nuntamed tongue can spew fiery words, staining words, poisonous words, \ncursing words and sometimes even blessing words. \u0014\n\u0014\nSunday school teachers make mistakes. All of us do. We put the wise \nmen beside the shepherds, although it never happened that way \naccording to Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. We call Jonah's big fish \"a \nwhale.\" We continue the notions that:\u0014\n\u0014\n Eve ate an apple in the garden - maybe it was a pomegranate, \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n There were three Magi - maybe there were three gifts but not three \nMagi, \u0014\n\u0014\n There is only one creation story. Of course, there are two.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing a teacher is tough. Not only are there lessons to plan and \nsupplies to assemble, but the teacher must also speak. James tells us \nthat teachers are judged by higher standards because they must use \ntheir tongues - those unwieldy little agents of iniquity.\u0014\n\u0014\nFact is, we are all teachers. Parents are obviously a child's first \nteacher. Children teach adults every day.  \u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't need construction paper and a Bible under our arm to teach. \nWe teach others by the words we speak, which is what James is talking \nabout when - just preceding this lesson - he tells us \"faith by \nitself, if it has no works, is dead\" (2:17). Our language is part of \nthe \"works\" others notice.\u0014",

TheNFSSscreened more than15,000 young adults (ages 18 to \n39) nationwide to identify nearly 3,000 participants, including 175 \nrespondents whose mothers had a romantic same-sex relationship and 73 \nwhose fathers had. The results showed that young adults whose mothers \nor fathers had a same-sex relationship tended to fare worse than \ntheir peers in intact biological families. Those whose mothers had a \nsame-sex relationship were far more likely to report being sexually \nvictimized, to be on welfare or to be currently unemployed, and those \nwhose fathers had one were significantly more likely to have \ncontemplated suicide, to have a sexually transmitted infection or to \nhave been forced to have sex against their will.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today  6/15/12\u0014",

When he \nmet his wife Evelyn, she was but twelve, he was in his twenties. \nAlmost at once she fell in love and began to pray, \"Oh God, please \nhave him wait for me.\" Bob did wait for her. When she turned \nseventeen he asked for her hand. His father, Oscar Peterson, forbade \nmarriage until Evelyn was twenty-one. So R. G. eloped with her to \nTijuana. \u0014\n\u0014\nLife was tough for the young couple. Often they did without \nnecessities. For years they did not even have running water. The \ndeath of their first child forced them to realize they had neglected \nGod in their marriage. They committed themselves fully to the Lord \nand began to tithe. By 1920 R. G. opened his first garage. The year \nof the stock market crash he formed his Peoria earth-moving business. \nDespite the times, LeTourneau succeeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nR. G. became the greatest obstacle-mover in history, building huge \nearth-moving machines. During World War II he produced 70% of all the \narmy's earth-moving machinery. He spoke of God as the Chairman of his \nBoard. A lay pastor in the Christian and Missionary Alliance, R. G. \nshared his faith with millions during his life. Additionally he \nstarted two agricultural missions in Liberia and established the \nLeTourneau foundation to channel 90% of his personal salary to \nChristian endeavors, especially the training of Christian workers in \npractical skills (such as house-building) which are needed on mission \nfields. He also gave of his time to Christian business associations \nand Christian colleges.\u0014\n\u0014\nR. G. maintained a close partnership with Evelyn. She could move \nobstacles, too. Once, at Bob's request, she baked his favorite hot \nTamale pie--for eight thousand people! As active as he was in \nspiritual affairs, she was more so. She mothered the young men who \nworked for LeTourneau, even going so far as to rent a house that many \ncould live in so they would not become prey to the vices of Chicago. \nMany became Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn May 30, 1937 the Evelyn and R.G. LeTourneau were in a serious car \naccident. R. G. was on crutches when their twentieth wedding \nanniversary rolled around. Despite that, Evelyn coaxed him into the \ncar on this day, August 27, 1937. She had something she wanted him to \nlook at it with her. That day they drove to Winona Lake, Indiana, and \nshe bought Camp Bethel. Using help from students of Wheaton College, \nshe turned the camp into an evangelistic and recreational center. \nNumbers of people became Christians in its \"Victory Circle.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLeTourneau's life is testimony to the big things God can do through \nmen with big ideas. He learned to give unstintingly to God. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nCurrent Biography.\u0014\nKooiman, Helen. Silhouettes. Waco, Texas: Word, 1972.\u0014\nLeTourneau, R. G.

    "title": "NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE",
    "words": "How a brilliant starlet created a worldwide technology boom , and we \nthought she was just another pretty face\u0014\nBy Naomi Ragen\u0014\n\u0014\nIt all started with a skin flick\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1933, a beautiful, young Austrian woman took off her clothes for a \nmovie director. She ran through the woods naked. She swam in a lake \nnaked. Pushing well beyond the social ,norms of the period, the movie \nalso featured a simulated orgasm. To make the scene vivid, the \ndirector reportedly stabbed the actress with a sharp pin just off \nscreen.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most popular movie in 1933 was King Kong. But everyone in \nHollywood was talking about that scandalous movie with the gorgeous, \nyoung Austrian woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nLouis B. Mayer, of the giant studio MGM, said she was the most \nbeautiful woman in the world. The film was banned practically \neverywhere which of course made it even more popular and valuable. \nMussolini reportedly refused to sell his copy at any price.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe star of the film, called Ecstasy, was Hedwig Kiesler. She said \nthe secret of her beauty was to stand there and look stupid. In \nreality, Kiesler was anything but stupid. She was a genius. She'd \ngrown up as the only child of a prominent Jewish banker. She was a \nmath prodigy. She excelled at science. As she grew older, she became \nruthless, using all the power her body and mind gave her.\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween the sexual roles she played, her tremendous beauty, and the \npower of her intellect, Kiesler would confound the men in her life \nincluding her six husbands, two of the most ruthless dictators of the \n20th century, and one of the greatest movie producers in history.\u0014\nHer beauty made her rich for a time. She is said to have made  and \nspent  $30 million in her life. But her greatest accomplishment \nresulted from her intellect And her invention continues to shape the \nworld we live in today.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou see, this young Austrian starlet would take one of the most \nvaluable technologies ever developed right from under Hitler's nose. \nAfter fleeing to America, she not only became a major Hollywood star \nher name sits on one of the most important patents ever granted by \nthe U.S. Patent Office.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, when you use your cell phone or, over the next few years, as \nyou experience super-fast wireless Internet access (via something \ncalled long-term evolution or LTE technology), you'll be using an \nextension of the technology a 20- year-old actress first conceived \nwhile sitting at dinner with Hitler.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time she made Ecstasy, Kiesler was married to one of the \nrichest men in Austria. Friedrich Mandl was Austria's leading arms \nmaker. His firm would become a key supplier to the Nazis.\u0014\n\u0014\nMandl used his beautiful young wife as a showpiece at important \nbusiness dinners with representatives of the Austrian, Italian, and \nGerman fascist forces. One of Mandl's favorite topics at these \ngatherings  which included meals with Hitler and Mussolini  was the \ntechnology surrounding radio-controlled missiles and torpedoes. \nWireless weapons offered far greater ranges than the wire-controlled \nalternatives that prevailed at the time. Kiesler sat through these \ndinners looking stupid, while absorbing everything she heard\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Jew, Kiesler hated the Nazis. She abhorred her husband's \nbusiness ambitions. Mandl responded to his wilful wife by imprisoning \nher in his castle, Schloss Schwarzenau. In 1937, she managed to \nescape. She drugged her maid, snuck out of the castle wearing the \nmaid's clothes, and sold her jewelry to finance a trip to London.\u0014\n\u0014\n(She got out just in time. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria. The \nNazis seized Mandl's factory. He was half Jewish. Mandl fled to \nBrazil. Later, he became an advisor to Argentina's iconic populist \npresident, Juan Peron.)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn London, Kiesler arranged a meeting with Louis B. Mayer. She signed \na long-term contract with him, becoming one of MGM's biggest stars. \nShe appeared in more than 20 films. She was a co-star to Clark Gable, \nJudy Garland, and even Bob Hope. Each of her first seven MGM movies \nwas a blockbuster.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Kiesler cared far more about fighting the Nazis than about making \nmovies. At the height of her fame, in 1942, she developed a new kind \nof communications system, optimized for sending coded messages that \ncouldn't be jammed. She was building a system that would allow \ntorpedoes and guided bombs to always reach their targets. She was \nbuilding a system to kill Nazis.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the 1940s, both the Nazis and the Allied forces were using the \nkind of single- frequency radio-controlled technology Kiesler's \nex-husband had been peddling. The drawback of this technology was \nthat the enemy could find the appropriate frequency and jam or \nintercept the signal, thereby interfering with the missile's intended \npath.\u0014\n\u0014\nKiesler's key innovation was to change the channel. It was a way of \nencoding a message across a broad area of the wireless spectrum. If \none part of the spectrum was jammed, the message would still get \nthrough on one of the other frequencies being used. The problem was, \nshe could not figure out how to synchronize the frequency changes on \nboth the receiver and the transmitter. To solve the problem, she \nturned to perhaps the world's first techno-musician, George Anthiel.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnthiel was an acquaintance of Kiesler who achieved some notoriety \nfor creating intricate musical compositions. He synchronized his \nmelodies across twelve player pianos, producing stereophonic sounds \nno one had ever heard before. Kiesler incorporated Anthiel's \ntechnology for synchronizing his player pianos. Then, she was able to \nsynchronize the frequency changes between a weapon's receiver and its \ntransmitter.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn August 11, 1942, U.S. Patent No. 2,292,387 was granted to Antheil \nand Hedy Kiesler Markey, which was Kiesler's married name at the \ntime.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of you won't recognize the name Kiesler. And no one would \nremember the name Hedy Markey. But it's a fair bet than anyone \nreading this newsletter of a certain age will remember one of the \ngreat beauties of Hollywood's golden age  Hedy Lamarr. That's the \nname Louis B. Mayer gave to his prize actress. That's the name his \nmovie company made famous.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, almost no one knows Hedwig Kiesler  aka Hedy Lamarr  was \none of the great pioneers of wireless communications. Her technology \nwas developed by the U.S. Navy, which has used it ever since.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou're probably using Lamarr's technology, too. Her patent sits at \nthe foundation of spread spectrum technology, which you use every \nday when you log on to a wi-fi network or make calls with your \nBluetooth-enabled phone. It lies at the heart of the massive \ninvestments being made right now in so-called fourth-generation LTE \nwireless technology. This next generation of cell phones and cell \ntowers will provide tremendous increases to wireless network speed \nand quality, by spreading wireless signals across the entire \navailable spectrum. This kind of encoding is only possible using the \nkind of frequency switching that Hedwig Kiesler invented.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr\u0014",

Used by permission. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Mueller of Bristol: The vigor of our spiritual life will be in \nexact proportion to the place held by the Bible in our life and \nthoughts. I solemnly state this from the experience of fifty-four \nyears.... I have read the Bible through one hundred times, and always \nwith increasing delight. Each time it seems like a new book to me. \nGreat has been the blessing from consecutive, diligent, daily study. \nI look upon it as a lost day when I have not had a good time over the \nWord of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nD. L. Moody: I prayed for faith, and thought that some day faith \nwould come down and strike me like lightning. But faith did not seem \nto come. One day I read in the tenth chapter of Romans, Now faith \ncometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. I had closed my \nBible, and prayed for faith. I now opened my Bible, and began to \nstudy, and faith has been growing ever since. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln: I believe the Bible is the best gift God has ever \ngiven to man. All the good from the Savior of the world is \ncommunicated to us through this book. \u0014\n\u0014\nW. E. Gladstone: I have known ninety-five of the world's great men in \nmy time, and of these eighty-seven were followers of the Bible. The \nBible is stamped with a specialty of origin, and an immeasurable \ndistance separates it from all competitors. \u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Washington: It is impossible to rightly govern the world \nwithout God and the Bible. \u0014\n\u0014\nDaniel Webster: If there is anything in my thoughts or style to \ncommend, the credit is due to my parents for instilling in me an \nearly love of the Scriptures. If we abide by the principles taught in \nthe Bible, our country will go on prospering and to prosper; but if \nwe and our posterity neglect its instructions and authority, no man \ncan tell how sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm us and bury all our \nglory in profound obscurity. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Carlyle: The Bible is the truest utterance that ever came by \nalphabetic letters from the soul of man, through which, as through a \nwindow divinely opened, all men can look into the stillness of \neternity, and discern in glimpses their far-distant, long-forgotten \nhome. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Ruskin: Whatever merit there is in anything that I have written \nis simply due to the fact that when I was a child my mother daily \nread me a part of the Bible and daily made me learn a part of it by \nheart. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles A. Dana: The grand old Book still stands; and this old earth, \nthe more its leaves are turned and pondered, the more it will sustain \nand illustrate the pages of the Sacred Word. \u0014\n\u0014\nThomas Huxley: The Bible has been the Magna Charta of the poor and \noppressed. The human race is not in a position to dispense with it. \u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick Henry: The Bible is worth all other books which have ever \nbeen printed. \u0014\n\u0014\nU. S. Grant: The Bible is the anchor of our liberties. \u0014\n\u0014\nHorace Greeley: It is impossible to enslave mentally or socially a \nBible-reading people. The principles of the Bible are the groundwork \nof human freedom. \u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Jackson: That book, sir, is the rock on which our republic \nrests. \u0014\n\u0014\nRobert E. Lee: In all my perplexities and distresses, the Bible has \nnever failed to give me light and strength. \u0014\n\u0014\nLord Tennyson: Bible reading is an education in itself. \u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Quincy Adams: So great is my veneration for the Bible that the \nearlier my children begin to read it the more confident will be my \nhope that they will prove useful citizens of their country and \nrespectable members of society. I have for many years made it a \npractice to read through the Bible once every year. \u0014\n\u0014\nImmanuel Kant: The existence of the Bible, as a book for the people, \nis the greatest benefit which the human race has ever experienced. \nEvery attempt to belittle it is a crime against humanity. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Dickens: The New Testament is the very best book that ever \nwas or ever will be known in the world. \u0014\n\u0014\nSir William Herschel: All human discoveries seem to be made only for \nthe purpose of confirming more and more strongly the truths contained \nin the Sacred Scriptures. \u0014\n\u0014\nSir Isaac Newton: There are more sure marks of authenticity in the \nBible than in any profane history. \u0014\n\u0014\nGoethe: Let mental culture go on advancing, let the natural sciences \nprogress in ever greater extent and depth, and the human mind widen \nitself as much as it desires; beyond the elevation and moral culture \nof Christianity, as it shines forth in the gospels, it will not go.\u0014",

    "title": "NEW POPE? I'VE GIVEN UP HOPE",
    "words": "New Pope? Ive Given Up Hope\u0014\n\u0014\nBy GARRY WILLS\u0014\nPublished: February 12, 2013  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nTHERE is a poignant air, almost wistful, to electing a pope in the \nmodern world. In a time of discredited monarchies, can this monarchy \nsurvive and be relevant? There is nostalgia for the assurances of the \npast, quaint in their charm, but trepidation over their \nsurvivability. In monarchies, change is supposed to come from the \ntop, if it is to come at all. So people who want to alter things in \nCatholic life are told to wait for a new pope. Only he has the \nauthority to make the changeless church change, but it is his \nauthority that stands in the way of change. \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the pope is no longer a worldly monarch. For centuries he \nwas such a ruler, with all the resources of a medieval or Renaissance \nprince  realms, armies, prisons, spies, torturers. But in the 19th \ncentury, when his worldly territories were wrested away by Italy, \nPope Pius IX lunged toward a compensatory moral monarchy. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1870, he elicited  from a Vatican council he called and \ncontrolled  the first formal declaration that a pope is infallible. \nFrom that point on, even when he was not making technically \ninfallible statements, the pope was thought to be dealing in eternal \ntruths. A gift for eternal truths is as dangerous as the gift of \nMidass touch. The pope cannot undo the eternal truths he has \nproclaimed. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Pope Paul VIs commission of learned and loyal Catholics, lay \nand clerical, reconsidered the natural law teaching against birth \ncontrol, and concluded that it could not, using natural reason, find \nany grounds for it, Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, the secretary of the \nHoly Office, told Paul that people had for years, on papal warrant, \nbelieved that using a contraceptive was a mortal sin, for which they \nwould go to hell if they died unrepentant. On the other hand, those \nwho followed church teaching were obliged to have many children \nunless they abstained from sex. How could Paul VI say that Pius XI, \nin his 1930 encyclical Casti Connubii, had misled the people in such \na serious way? If he admitted it, what would happen to his own \nauthority as moral arbiter in matters of heaven and hell? So Paul VI \ndoubled down, adding another encyclical in 1968, Humanae Vitae, to \nthe unrenounceable eternal truths that pile up around a moral \nmonarch. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn our day, most Catholics in America have reached the same \nconclusion that Paul VIs commission did. But successive popes have \nstuck by Pius and Paul and have appointed bishops who demonstrate \nloyalty on this matter. That is why some American bishops in the \nrecent presidential election said that President Obama was destroying \nreligious liberty if his health plan insured funds for \ncontraception. Nonetheless, more Catholics voted for Mr. Obama than \ndidnt. In a normal government, this disconnect between rulers and \nruled would be negotiated. But eternal truths are nonnegotiable. \u0014\n\u0014\nWistful Catholics hope that on this and other matters of disagreement \nbetween the church as People of God and the ruling powers in the \nchurch, a new pope can remedy that discord. But a new pope will be \nelected by cardinals who were elevated to office by the very popes \nwho reaffirmed eternal truths like the teaching on contraception. \nThey were appointed for their loyalty, as were the American bishops \nwho stubbornly upheld the contraception nonsense in our elections. \u0014\n\u0014\nWill the new conclave vote for a man who goes against the teachings \nof his predecessors? Even if they do, can the man chosen buck the \nstructure through which he rose without kicking the structure down? \nThese considerations have given the election of new popes the air of \nwatching Charlie Brown keep trying to kick the football, hoping that \nLucy will cooperate. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs this election approaches, some hope that the shortage of priests, \nand their damaged reputation and morale, can be remedied by adding \nmarried priests, or women priests, or gay priests. But that misses \nthe point. Whatever their sexual status, they will still be priests. \nThey will not be chosen by their congregations (as was the practice \nin the early church). They will be appointed from above, by bishops \napproved for their loyalty to Rome, which will police their doctrinal \nviews as it has with priests heretofore. The power structure will not \nbe changed by giving it new faces. Monarchies die hard. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1859, John Henry Newman published an article that led to his \ndenunciation in Rome as the most dangerous man in England. It was \ncalled On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine and it \nshowed that in history the laity had been more true to the Gospel \nthan the hierarchy. That was an unacceptable position to Rome. It \nstill is. Pope Benedict XVI, when he was still Cardinal Joseph \nRatzinger, was asked if it did not disturb him that Catholics \ndisagreed with the rulings of Rome. He said no  that dogma is not \nformed by majority rule. But that is precisely how it was formed in \nthe great councils like that at Nicaea, where bishops voted to \ndeclare dogmas on the Trinity and the Incarnation. There was no pope \ninvolved in those councils. Yet they defined the most important \ntruths of the faith. \u0014\n\u0014\nJesus, we are reminded, said to Peter, You are Peter, and upon this \nrock I will build my church. But Peter was addressed as a faithful \ndisciple, not as a priest or a pope. There were no priests in Peters \ntime, and no popes. Paul never called himself or any of his \nco-workers priests. He did not offer sacrifice. Those ideas came in \nlater, through weird arguments contained in the anonymous Epistle to \nthe Hebrews. The claim of priests and popes to be the sole conduits \nof grace is a remnant of the era of papal monarchy. We are watching \nthat era fade. But some refuse to recognize its senescence. Such \npeople will run peppily up, like Charlie Brown, to the coming of a \nnew pope. But Lucy, as usual, still holds the football. \u0014\n\u0014\nGarry Wills is the author, most recently, of Why Priests? A Failed \nTradition.\u0014",

First, we are a camel; then a lion; \nfinally, a child. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, a camel: We begin life by kneeling down, loaded and laden with \nthe tradition of our parents, teachers, ancestors, friends. When we \nare fully loaded for our journey, we are led out into the desert and \nthere discover that we are alone, that this is our journey, not our \nparents' journey. At this realization we are transformed into the \nsecond stage, a lion. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lion in the desert has one primary task: slay the dragon. In the \ndesert lives a great dragon named Thou shalt. Upon every scale of the \ndragon is written a law, some of which are four thousand years old, \nsome two thousand years old, and some two days old. It is the \nexternal world that tells you what to do, who you are and what you \nmust not do. The lion of your soul must slay that ancient dragon. If \nwe persist in this quest to become ourselves, then we become \ntransformed into the child. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe last stage of the spiritual quest is the child. We are \ntransformed into the divine spontaneity and the freedom of a child \nwho has God's word engraved in his heart. In this stage we do not \nhave the derivative, defensive laws which we had as camels imprinted \non our souls, but a new law, a law of the Spirit that brings us to \njoy and fullness and ecstasy. \u0014\n\u0014\n--Nietzsche, \u0014\nThus Spoke Zarathustra \u0014\n(New York: Russell & Russell, 1964), 25-27.\u0014",

A servant morality \nadopts values and follows a morality which is imposed upon us by \nothers. It negates the self. A master morality, on the other hand, \nsees the self as the creator of both values and morality. It, \ntherefore, affirms the self. Nietzsche saw religion as the great \nespouser of servant morality because it portrayed values and morals \nas absolutes given by God. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe contended that to be fully human is to realize that morality is \nsomething we create. Values are not hung \"out there\" like stars in \nthe sky. We are the ones who do the valuing. The clues to ethical \nbehavior come from within ourselves and are not prescribed for us by \nsome external authority. Values are neither objective nor carved in \nstone despite the claims of the church. Instead, they come from an \ninternal gyroscope that guides the course of our lives.\u0014",

Botha, because it had included a \ncommitment to renounce violence as a political weapon. This was \nunacceptable, not because Mandela wanted to continue leading a \nviolent uprising, but because while the ANC was still banned, there \nseemed to be little reasonable course of action for anti-apartheid \nactivists. \"What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of \nthe people [ANC] remains banned?\" Mandela asked \"Only free men can \nnegotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.\" This demonstrated \nMandela's willingness to be negotiated with, and when the reform \nminded Frederik Willem de Klerk agreed to let all other ANC prisoners \nfree apart from Mandela, things were clearly moving in a different \ndirection. Mandela and De Klerk met, and it was eventually agreed \nthat all formerly banned organisations would be legalised. The \ngovernment published the first photograph of Mandela in decades, \nshowing him and de Klerk meeting and discussing the future of \nMandela's release.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen finally he was able to leave prison, Mandela knew that this was \nnot merely a physical exit. Again making a commitment to a fair \nrestoration of democracy, instead of an indignant rebellion, he said \nof his departure: \"As I walked out the door toward the gate that \nwould lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and \nhatred behind, I'd still be in prison.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWORLD, December 7. 2013\u0014",

Bales excerpted from To The \nCross and Beyond: Cycle A Gospel Sermons for Lent and Easter  (A \nfanciful sermon but interesting to consider. It does not address \nsalvation under the Old Covenant, which is what Nicodemus lived \nunder.   FRS)\u0014\n\u0014\nSermon Note: This story sermon is best read with a \"special\" voice \nreserved for the scripture included in the story. Read the scripture \nwith a lower and slower voice so that the congregation realizes that \nall the rest is the story is \"commentary\" on the scripture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the last farmer from the most distant field arrived home to his \nfamily and the temple police were tromping their patrols around \nJerusalem's walls and the remaining member of the Sanhedrin set aside \nthe last legal brief and blew out the seven candles at the entrance \nof the Sanhedrin's chambers, Nicodemus left his quarters. He looked \nquickly left, then right, and walked out into the night. The first \nblast of wind hit him around a corner like icicles flying sideways. \nHe jerked his cloak tight.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo anyone passing, this old man, robed with dignity, could be a \nphysician out tending the ill or a scribe returning from a late \nsession of teaching a convert's family. The night can disguise \nidentity and motive. It can even obscure a man's hesitant gait.\u0014\n\u0014\nNicodemus was one of 6,000 Pharisees, the separated ones, the \nreligious elite. He was one of seventy who constituted the Sanhedrin \nthat, with the consent of the Romans, shared in the rule of their \ncountry. He was a renowned teacher, deferred to for decisions \nrequiring extra wisdom or breadth of experience, and he was master of \na great fortune; yet, he walked the street, covering his face in his \nrobe, which served for more than merely struggling against the cold.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe knew where Jesus was staying. As he neared Jesus' house, his chest \nseemed like a cave full of crazed bats. What's so disturbing about \nthis young man? Is it because, unlike the scribes, Jesus doesn't lay \ndown his main proposition, as a general sends his infantry into the \nfield, and then Jesus doesn't surround that proposition with quotes \nfrom the esteemed rabbis, as a general rings his troops with wings of \ncavalry?\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo men approached at a distance. Nicodemus dashed into an alley and \nwalked faster. The wind curled under his cloak and he clung more \ntightly. Is it because of Jesus' freedom with the law, challenging \nall, yet not like one of those men-haters who claim a prophetic \ncalling in order to shout cruel things to others? Or is it his eyes \n-- looking at evil and making it wither, looking at obedience and \ninspiring greater devotion? Or is it the eyes of those Jesus cured, \neyes that moments before revealed long vacant halls of rejection and \nsuffering, now lit like two lamps burning in the holy temple?\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch thoughts kept Nicodemus awake and tossing every night for a \nweek. He heard the young rabbi teach and saw him heal people. And old \nNicodemus had ducked behind a pillar when the Galilean chased \nmoney-changers from the temple, splattering their bowls of coins and \nsending merchants scampering down the temple steps, chasing their \nanimals.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/Nicodemus: A Young Old Man\u0014",

The pastor coaxed, offered warm milk, etc. \u0014\nThe kitty would not come down. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe tree was not sturdy enough to climb, so \u0014\nthe pastor decided that ifhe tied a rope to his car and \u0014\ndrove away so that the tree bent down, he could then \u0014\nreach up and get the kitten. He did all this, checking \u0014\nhis progress in the car frequently, then figured ifhe \u0014\nwent just a little bit further, the tree would be bent \u0014\nsufficiently for him to reach the kitten. But as he moved\u0014\n a little further forward, the rope broke. The tree went \u0014\n\"boing!\" and the kitten instantly sailed through the \u0014\nair - out of sight. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe pastor felt terrible. He walked all over \u0014\nthe neighborhood asking people if they'd seen a little \u0014\nkitten. No. Nobody had seen a stray kitten. So he \u0014\nprayed, \"Lord, Ijust commit this kitten to your keep- \u0014\ning,\" and went on about his business. \u0014\n\u0014\nA few days later he was at the grocery store, \u0014\nand met one of his church members. He happened to \u0014\nlook into her shopping cart and was amazed to see \u0014\ncat food. Now this woman was a cat hater and ev- \u0014\neryone knew it, so he asked her, \"Why are you buy- \u0014\ning cat food when you hate cats so much?\" \u0014\nShe replied, \"You won't believe this.\" and told \u0014\nhim how her little girl had been begging her for a cat, \u0014\nbut she kept refusing.

And really, Pastor, you won't believe this. but I \u0014\nsaw it with my own eyes. A kitten suddenly came \u0014\nflying out of the blue sky, with its paws outspread. \u0014\nand landed right in front of her.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nNever underestimate the Power Of God.\u0014",

    "words": "Please allow me to offer some trends from anecdotal information, \nchurch consultations, and objective research. As a caveat, some of \nthe data based research comes from an excellent study, The National \nCongregations Study by Duke University. This study, fortunately, is \nlongitudinal, so it is able to look at changes over many years. But \nthe study is also dated, with the latest data reported in 2007.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom these multiple sources, I have assembled nine changes that have \ncome at a rapid pace in many churches. Please note my perspective. I \nam offering these from the perspective of a researcher; I am not \nmaking qualitative assessments. Also, with every trend there will be \nthousands of churches that are exceptions to the norm. But these are \nthe changes in the majority of churches in North America.\u0014\n\u0014\nChoirs are disappearing. From 1998 to 2007, the percentage of \nchurches with choirs decreased from 54% to 44%. If that pace holds to \nthis year, the percentage of churches with choirs is only 37%.\u0014\n\u0014\nDress is more casual. In many churches, a man wearing a tie in a \nworship service is now among the few rather than the majority. While \nthe degree of casual dress is contextual, the trend is crossing all \ngeographic and demographic lines.\u0014\n\u0014\nScreens are pervasive. Some of you remember the days when putting a \nprojection screen in a worship center was considered a sacrilege. Now \nmost churches have screens. And if they have hymnals, the hymnals are \nlargely ignored and the congregants follow along on the screens.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreaching is longer. I will soon be in the process of gathering this \ndata to make certain the objective research confirms the anecdotal \ninformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nMulti is normative. Most congregants twenty years ago attended a \nSunday morning worship service where no other Sunday morning \nalternatives were available. Today, most congregants attend a service \nthat is part of numerous alternatives: multi-services; \nmulti-campuses; multi-sites; and multi-venues.\u0014\n\u0014\nAttendees are more diverse. The Duke study noted the trend of the \ndecrease in the number of all-white congregations.\u0014\n\u0014\nConflict is not increasing. In a recent post, I noted the decreasing \nfrequency of worship wars. The Duke study noted that overall church \nconflict has not increased over a 20-year period.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore worship attendees are attending larger churches. Churches with \nan attendance of 400 and up now account for 90% of all worship \nattendees. Inversely, those churches with an attendance of under 400 \nonly account for 10% of worship attendees.\u0014\n\u0014\nSunday evening services are disappearing. This issue has stirred \nquite a bit of discussion the past few years. I plan to expand upon \nit in my post this coming Saturday. Stay tuned.\u0014\n\u0014\n....Tom Rainer,, 5/7/14\u0014",

They were there in droves to \nprotest a government regulation that keeps the 19-screen cineplex \nclosed each week from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jerusalem, wake up!\" the protesters chanted as security guards \nblocked them from entering the lobby. \"Nonreligious people are equal \ntoo!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe demonstration was the latest skirmish in Jerusalem's long-running \n\"Sabbath wars,\" which for decades have pitted the city's secular \nJewish population against its ultra-Orthodox community over whether \nshops, theaters and other public spaces can remain open on the Jewish \nday of rest.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I don't tell people when to go to the synagogue, and they shouldn't \ntell me when to go to the cinema,\" said Laura Wharton, a city \ncouncilwoman whose left-leaning Meretz party led the protest outside \nthe cineplex, which was built on city land and is barred from opening \non the Sabbath by a provision written by an ultra-Orthodox city \nlawmaker. \"You have a small, vocal minority telling the rest of the \ncity what they should do.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTired of having to drive an hour to Tel Aviv to dance at a nightclub \non a Friday night or sit at a cafe on a Saturday morning, secular \nactivists are fighting for more nonreligious Sabbath activities in \nJerusalem. They have rallied behind the opening of a small but \ngrowing number of cafes and bars and have held booming block parties \nin the streets, at times provoking counter-protests.\u0014\n\u0014\nMostly Jewish West Jerusalem essentially shuts down every Friday \nafternoon, in keeping with Orthodox strictures that prohibit \nobservant Jews from working on the Sabbath. Stores are closed, bus \nservice is suspended and cars are banned from the streets in and \naround many neighborhoods. Some ultra-Orthodox, who tend to vote as a \nbloc in city elections and are heavily represented on the city \ncouncil, have thrown stones at drivers who challenge the status quo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When I see a Jewish person in a car on the Sabbath, it hurts me,\" \nsaid Daniel Katzenstein, an ultra-Orthodox father of nine who moved \nto Jerusalem from Brooklyn. \"Any threat to my lifestyle I am going to \nprotest.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, crowds of ultra-Orthodox men have burned down bus \nshelters featuring images of scantily clad women, and have sought to \nstop construction of a mixed-gender swimming pool. When the owners of \nCafe Bezalel, famous for its mimosas, decided to open for Saturday \nbrunch this year, diners were confronted by ultra-Orthodox protesters \nchanting, \"Shabbat\"  \"Sabbath.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's a lack of tolerance here, the feeling like you're not \nwelcome,\" said Elisheva Mazya, who runs a nonprofit called New Spirit \nthat works to keep young people living in Jerusalem by helping them \nfind jobs and obtain mortgages. Her group has tried to block \nultra-Orthodox families from moving to certain neighborhoods so the \nstreets there can remain open on the Sabbath.\u0014",

    "words": "No, Christians Should Not Believe in 'Left Behind's' Rapture \nTheology, Says Prominent Christian Philosopher\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Morgan Lee , Christian Post  \u0014\n\u0014\nJuly 30, 2014\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral months before \"Left Behind\" opens in theaters, a prominent \nChristian philosopher is reminding the American church that the \nmovie's claims about the rapture are false.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This doctrine is not really found in the book of Revelation. If you \nread the book of Revelation, you won't find any mention of the \nrapture there,\" said William Craig, a Research Professor of \nPhilosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Professor of Philosophy \nat Houston Baptist University.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, Craig says, the idea of the rapture comes from a \n\"misinterpretation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians where Paul is describing \nthe coming of the Lord and resurrection of the dead, which will occur \nat His coming.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you compare what Paul says there to what Jesus says about the End \nTimes, Paul uses the same vocabulary, the same phraseology. I think \nit's very plausible that Paul is talking about the same event that \nJesus predicted, namely the visible coming of the Son of Man at the \nend of human history to usher in his kingdom,\" said Craig. \"But \nproponents of the rapture view, say that Paul is not at all talking \nabout the second coming of the Christ there. What he's really talking \nabout is this invisible preliminary secret return of Christ to snatch \nbelievers out of the world before the great tribulation occurs. I \nthink there's no textual warrant for that at all.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Craig, the rapture became a popular theory about the End \nTimes due to the influence of the Scofield Reference Bible, which was \npublished in the early 20th century and promulgated John Darby's \nmid-18th century's views on the rapture. Later, Christian \ninstitutions, among them Dallas Theological Seminary, and churches \nbegan teaching the validity of the rapture.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A good many Bible-believing Christians absorbed this view as their \nmother's milk as it were and have never thought to question its \nBiblical credentials,\" said Craig.\u0014\n\u0014\nCraig affirmed that it was completely possible for Christians to \nwatch the upcoming \"Left Behind\" movie or read the series, but they \nshould resist taking its claims seriously.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It could be maybe good fiction. It would be say like reading science \nfiction or fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. Just so long as \nyou're not deceived into thinking that represents biblical \neschatology,\" said Craig.\u0014\n\u0014\nCraig, who leads Reasonable Faith, an apologetics organization that \nequips Christians with the resources to speak about their faith in an \n\"intelligent, articulate, and uncompromising yet gracious\" manner, \ncalled upon Biblical scholars, pastors and other church leaders who \nalso refute the rapture to speak out about their position.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is astonishing, if I'm correct about this, American evangelism is \nvery widely misled, that it has departed from the historic Christian \nposition about the second coming of Christ. That's really rather \nsobering, because if we're wrong about this, what other things might \nwe have misinterpreted?\" he said.\u0014",

    "words": "Noisy Worship \u0014\nSeptember 24, 2014, The American Interest\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is ample Biblical warrant for noisy worship. And indeed, \nnoisemaking is a feature of many different religious traditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter some posts dealing with very gloomy matters, I feel that \nsomething more cheerful is in order (if only to cheer myself upthese \ndays I shy away from opening the newspaper in the morningan \nexperience probably shared by some of my readers). As often happens \nto me, a minor news item sent me off musing about broader matters.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn September 15, 2014, Religion News Service carried a story about \nthe following incident: The Reverend Johnnie Clark is pastor of \nRehobeth United Assemblies, a Pentecostal church in Columbia, South \nCarolina. He was sentenced in municipal court to one day in jail for \nthe misdemeanor of public nuisance, in this instance consisting of \nrepeated violations of city noise limits. [I don't know anything \nabout municipal statutes in South Carolina. But I had to think about \na local law in Massachusetts I encountered when my family and I used \nto spend summers in the Berkshires. The town we stayed in had a \nweekly newspaper that, among other things, reported on cases tried in \nmunicipal court. One misdemeanor that came up regularly was for an \noffence called making unnecessary noise. I loved that concept, and \nsince then have regretted not living where such a law is enforced!] \nThe Columbia church of the story has been in this location for \ntwenty-five years without any problems, but noise emanating from its \nworship services has been bothering owners of newly built houses on \nthe same street (could it be a case of gentrification?). The story \nspecifies the offending noise as singing and shouting, dancing and \ndrumming , as is characteristic of Pentecostal worship. When \ncomplaints started to come in, Pastor Clark asked in an interview \nHow can you declare a church to be a public nuisance? After he \nignored numerous citations, the heavy hand of the City of Columbia \nfinally descended on him. I will stipulate that during his day behind \nbars he was treated with the courtesy customarily accorded a man of \nthe cloth in this very religious part of the country; I have not \nfollowed up the story, thus do not know whether in the meantime the \npastor and his congregation have been limiting themselves to decibel \nlevels deemed acceptable in polite society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is ample Biblical warrant for noisy worship. Perhaps King David \nwas the prototypical Pentecostal when he sang and danced before the \nArk of the Lord as it was brought to Jerusalem, along with his men, \nmaking merry with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and \ncastanets and cymbals and with the sound of the horn (2 Samuel 6). \nPerhaps Michal, the daughter of Saul, who rebuked David for this \nunseemly behavior, was the prototypical guardian of properly polite \netiquette. The mention of joyful noise is repeated in several \nPsalms, for example in Psalm 100: Make a joyful noise to the Lord, \nall the lands! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence \nwith singing. One version of this call to merry worship, in the \nwonderful cadences of Elizabethan English, has a favored place in the \norder of worship of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Members of \nmore sedate Christian communions, such as Anglicans or Lutherans (let \nalone Presbyterians), are inclined to think that Pentecostals, their \narms raised and their vocal chords in full throttle, are following \nthe Davidic example too literally. Which reminds me of the only \nPentecostal joke I know (perhaps the only one there is): What do you \nsay in a meeting of Pentecostals if you want to know how many of them \nwant coffee during the break?  Those who want coffee during the \nbreak, please lower your hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nNoisy worship is not limited to Pentecostals. Revival services in \nAmerican Protestantism have been quite noisy (even in the absence of \nspeaking in tongues), and have been the soil from which sprang the \npowerful tradition of Gospel music. The development of \nAfrican-American Protestantism cannot be understood apart from this \ntradition, brought to its fullness in the full-throated singing of \nblack choirs. When it comes to liturgical paroxysms, no other \nProtestants can best the Shakers, who came to America from England in \nthe eighteenth century. The name derives from their practice of \nsacred dancing, with wild physical gyrations, men and women moving in \nseparate circles. One of their favorite songs went Shake, shake \nDaniel  shake the devil out of me. The Shakers were an offshoot of \nQuakerism (one of their early nicknames was Shaky Quakers, to \ndistinguish them from less shaky ones). Perhaps the Shakers were \nreacting against the distinctive Quaker practice of waiting worship \n everybody sits waiting in silence (if shaking at all, inwardly \nrather than bodily), until someone in the congregation feels called \nto speak. This (I have witnessed it) can be a dreary business, and \nafter a long spell of it one may well be called to get up and shake \nout the devil with Daniel!\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/Noisy Worship\u0014",

Richie \ncalled the players' actions \"unacceptable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Brittney and Glory's conduct is detrimental to the best interests of \nthe WNBA and violates applicable law,\" Richie said in a statement. \n\"We also understand that people make mistakes, and that education and \ntraining are as important as imposing discipline.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe punishment comes at a time when sports leagues around the country \nare reviewing domestic violence policies following high-profile cases \ninvolving the NFL. Richie said she consulted with NBA Commissioner \nAdam Silver and a variety of experts.\u0014\n\u0014\nGriner plays for the defending champion Phoenix Mercury and Johnson \nfor the Tulsa Shock. The players got married last week in Phoenix, \nand their teams are about to open camp on Monday. The league season \nbegins June 5.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have already learned a tremendous amount from this experience and \nam committed to improving myself and my marriage going forward,\" \nGriner said in a statement. \"I want to thank everyone for their \nsupport over these last few weeks. I realize I let down a lot of \npeople who have been champions for me and I will support my teammates \nand our organization every day until I am back on the court. I am \nthankful for the opportunity to make positive changes and become a \nrole model for others to do the same. \"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe WNBA said the two All-Stars must undergo individual counseling. \nIf either fails to comply with that condition or those by the court, \nthe league says it can revisit the case.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It is our strong belief that violence has absolutely no place in \nsociety, in sports or in this league,\" Richie said. \"As president, it \nis my responsibility to protect the league and uphold its values.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe players were arrested April 22 on suspicion of assault after they \nfought in a home they recently bought. Griner pled guilty to \nmisdemeanor disorderly conduct and entered a diversion program. The \nassault charge was dismissed. She must attend 26 weeks of domestic \nviolence counseling. All charges will be dismissed if she completes \ncounseling. Johnson's case was transferred to county court and is \nstill pending.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe league spent the last few weeks investigating. The WNBA said \nJohnson pushed Griner in the shoulder and she responded by pushing \nher in the back of the neck. The confrontation escalated to include \nwrestling, punches, and the throwing and swinging of objects. The \n6-foot-8 Griner received a bite wound on her finger and scratches on \nher wrist; the 6-4 Johnson received a scratch above her lip and was \ndiagnosed with a concussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Mercury open their season on June 5 against San Antonio. If \nGriner doesn't appeal, she will be eligible to return against \nMinnesota on June 27.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We do not condone violence of any kind and we understand the need \nfor discipline in serious matters,\" said Jim Pitman, the Mercury \ngeneral manager and executive vice president. \"Brittney is committed \nto growing from this experience, and we will make every effort to \nsupport her in that endeavor.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPhoenix will play Johnson's Shock on July 2.

The result has been to consign \nNagasaki to the edge of oblivion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Americans believe their governments official narrative: that \nthe two bombs, dropped in close succession, led to Japans surrender. \nBut it is now well known that the surrender was prompted at least as \nmuch by the Soviet Unions decision to join the Allies in the war \nagainst Japan. Just 11 hours before the Nagasaki bombing, 1.5 million \nSoviet troops crossed into the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, in \nnorthern China, and attacked the depleted Japanese Army there on \nthree fronts.\u0014\nSumiteru Taniguchi, 16, was delivering mail on his bicycle in the \nnorthwestern corner of the city when the force of the explosion \nhurled him into the air. Even from a mile away, the searing heat \ninstantly disintegrated his cotton shirt and burned the skin off his \nentire back and one arm. Three months later, he was finally taken to \na naval hospital 22 miles north of the city, where he lay on his \nstomach for more than three years, begging the nurses to let him die. \nLater, after he had learned to sit, stand and ultimately walk again, \nMr. Taniguchi seethed in anger at what he believed was the \nunnecessary nuclear devastation of his city and its people.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past 70 years, Mr. Taniguchi and tens of thousands of other \nhibakusha have navigated punishing injuries, late-onset \nradiation-related illnesses, and haunting fears that they would pass \non genetic disorders to their children and grandchildren. Many never \nspeak about their atomic bomb experiences, even within their \nfamilies. In a remarkable act of resilience, however, Mr. Taniguchi \nand a small number of hibakusha made the very personal choice, some \nas early as the mid-1950s, to speak publicly about their survival.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey do not tell their stories to promote Japans victimization, or \nto minimize the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the suffering and deaths \nof Asian civilians and Allied military personnel at the hands of \nbrutal Japanese soldiers.

    "words": "Henrico judge denies bond for woman in fatal abuse case\u0014\n\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 12:06 pm  Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nBy TED STRONG Richmond Times-Dispatch \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the weeks before his death, 3-year-old Zyon Thompson endured a \nrange of brutal punishments before being left lying in his own filth, \na Henrico County detective told a judge Thursday morning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe toddler died of dehydration, after yet another round of \npunishments  including being waterboarded and forced to eat \nspoonfuls of crab seasoning  was followed by fits of vomiting and \ndiarrhea, said Henrico police investigator R.L. Egan.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had basically head-to-toe injuries and bruises, she told the \njudge.\u0014\n\u0014\nThompsons mother had left him in the care of friend Alexis Raiford \nand her husband, Clarence Raiford Jr. The boy had been staying with \nthe couple at their home in the 4800 block of Oakleys Lane in eastern \nHenrico for weeks before his death, according to officials.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Raifords, along with a third adult who was living in the house, \nWilliam Corey Moore, have been charged with one count each of felony \nmurder, conspiracy to commit child felony abuse with serious injury, \nchild endangerment, conspiracy to commit child endangerment and four \ncounts each of felony child abuse with serious injury.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Raifords also have each been charged with a count of malicious \ninjury by caustic substance in connection with apparent chemical \nburns on the childs buttocks, according to officials.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlexis Raiford has maintained that burns on the boys buttocks were \ncaused when he sat in bleach he had poured into the bathtub while \nunattended. Other witnesses told Egan that the burns came from Tilex \nsprayed onto the boy, often by Alexis, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Thursday morning, Henrico Circuit Court Chief Judge Gary A. Hicks \nheard Alexis Raifords request that she be granted bond. He denied \nthe request.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefense attorney Kevin Purnell emphasized that Alexis Raiford spent \nmuch of her time away from the home with Zyons mother, Shaina \nWilson. He suggested that the abuse was principally the work of the \nhomes other adults, who explained away signs of abuse that Alexis \nRaiford noticed.\u0014\n\u0014\nArguing against the motion for bond, prosecutors relied heavily on \nEgan, who summarized what she had learned from a number of sources, \nprincipally witness interviews.\u0014\n\u0014\nEgan described learning through interviews that the 3-year-old had \nbeen subjected to a range of punishments for toilet accidents or \ntaking food, including beatings that left widespread bruising. But, \nEgan said, in the days leading to the childs death, the adults \ndecided they needed to find alternative forms of punishments that \nwouldnt leave any marks.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch punishments included being forced to sit with his legs spread \nand having adults push on his back or pull on his arms to cause pain, \nthe detective said. The boy also was forced to hang from a door frame \nand a cabinet door, with his feet off the ground, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence Raiford performed much of the corporal punishment, but \nsometimes the others would help, including in cases when his drug \nhabit caused him to nod off, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometime on the afternoon or evening of April 22, Zyon had a \ntoileting accident, Egan said. Alexis Raiford told her husband about \nit when he got home, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nZyon was made to stand in the running shower with his face turned \ntoward the shower head, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWitnesses would describe him as sounding like he was choking on the \nwater, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he was forced to lie on his back in the bathtub with the water \njust below his nose and mouth, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he was forced to sit on the toilet, with a shirt over his head, \nas water was poured over him, a technique sometimes referred to as \nwaterboarding, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then he was forced to eat spoonfuls of crab seasoning, Egan said.\u0014\n\u0014\nZyon began vomiting and developed diarrhea, she said. He was left on \na towel in a hallway because he could not control his bowel \nmovements, she said. When Alexis Raiford objected to the odor, the \ndetective said, Zyon was moved to the laundry room floor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe next morning, April 23, witnesses told Egan, Zyon was breathing \ndifferently and had a seizure, she said. The adults tried \nmedicating him, but no one took him to the hospital until after he \nwas discovered unresponsive on the morning of April 24.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he arrived at the hospital, Zyon was unconscious and not \nbreathing, according to an affidavit filed by another Henrico \ndetective requesting a search warrant. A social worker told Henrico \npolice that a CT scan indicated injury to one-half of Zyons brain, \naccording to the same affidavit.\u0014\n\u0014\nZyon was put on life support, Egan said, and died early on the \nmorning of April 26. The medical examiner determined dehydration was \nthe cause of his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nVarious family members at first told officials that Zyon had gotten \ninto the refrigerator and eaten seasoned crab, or crab seasoning, \nEgan said. Alexis Raiford told a Henrico police sergeant that Zyon \nhad jumped off a bunk bed and hit his head on a piece of furniture, \naccording to the affidavit.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen police searched the home, they seized a clear plastic baggie \ncontaining orange food seasoning, a number of bloody diapers and \nother items, according to search warrant inventory filed with the \nclerk of court.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was waterboarded, judge, said LaToya H. Croxton, assistant \ncommonwealths attorney. He was made to run around a table on his \ntippy-toes for hours, made to stand in a corner on his tippy-toes for \nhours  he was stretched.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe three defendants are set to have separate trials. The first is \nscheduled to begin in late January, and the last is expected to end \nin early March.\u0014\n\u0014\ntstrong@timesdispatch.com\u0014",

    "title": "NORTHERN DANCER, THE SUPER STUD FOR ALL TIMES",
    "words": "All hail American Pharoah after his latest conquest, unanimous Horse \nof the Year honors! And in so doing it might be time to pay homage \nonce again to one of his ancestors, even one five generations back. \nAny racing fan worth his salt remembers the name Northern Dancer. It \nalways jumps off the page at me whenever the old boy is remembered \neven if it's (in parentheses) as a grandsire or great-grandsire or \ngreat-great-grandsire or great-great-great-grandsire. Time spent \nwith the Dancer, many moons ago, ranks right up there with time \nspent with Secretariat during his road to the Triple Crown.\u0014\n\u0014\nNorthern Dancer's progeny long ago became stars in their own \ngalaxies, as Frank Mitchell, the bloodlines expert, has repeatedly \npointed out on this website. He cited the dominating sire of the end \nof the last century, Storm Cat, the blocky, dark bay son of Storm \nBird (by Northern Dancer) and a half dozen of Storm Cat's sons and \ndaughters who produced prominent winners in 2015.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Ray Paulick wrote recently about rising stallion stud fees to \nwhere $100,000 is no longer an exclusive category. Back in the day, \nNorthern Dancer opened the door to that trend, too. Against all odds, \nhe set the bar in breeding like no other Thoroughbred before or since.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a bright spring day nearly 30 years ago, it was April of 1986, I \ntook a CBS News television crew and commentator Heywood Hale Broun \ndown to Windfields Farm in Maryland to look in on the old boy, who, \nas he approached the ripe old age of 25, commanded as high as a \n$1,000,000 stud fee for one assignation  no live foal guaranteed. \nThe farm manager told us the million-dollar fee came about when a \nsyndicate put the service up for bid and that the winner's hands \nwere clammy and he broke out in a lathervirtuallythe tension of the \nmoment was so intense.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we entered the stallion barn, there was Northern Dancer, his head \nperked, wondering who these outliers were. He was barely over 15 \nhands but very muscular across the chest. When he saw the camera he \nbegan to act like a kid in a candy store even though the calendar \nsaid he was no kid anymore. His groom, Ron Paris, described him as, \na lot more hypera lot more high strung than a lot of the horses. \nWhen Woodie Broun asked him to describe the old warrior in human \nterms, he offered, kind of like (the centenarian actor) George \nBurns, yeah?\u0014\n\u0014\nJust then a van with a mare aboard could be seen and heard out the \nside door headed for the mating barn. Northern Dancer's head jumped \nup and he whinnied loudly. His date for the day had arrived. Unlike \ntoday's stallions who are much more active, he covered only about 40 \nmares a year, and his percentage of foals produced compared to those \nwho won stake races, is the highest on record. Even more impressive, \nhis total stud fees soared well beyond $100,000,000, immeasurable in \ntoday's dollars.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe pretty much changed the mind's eye of what a thoroughbred should \nbe. That was Joe Hickey who, back then, was Windfields' pointman for \nNorthern Dancer. A short, stocky, very strong type. I know European \nhorsemen, when they first saw him, couldn't believe this was Northern \nDancer as opposed to Secretariat who was cast in a heroic mold.\u0014\n\u0014\nA big fan of Northern Dancer was Seth Hancock, master of Claiborne \nFarm in Paris, Ky., who syndicated Secretariat. Woodie Broun asked \nhim about the million-dollar stud fee. Your mare is serviced and \nbeyond that there is no guarantee. All Northern Dancer has to do, \nmore or less, is show up. His seasons are much like fine wine or rare \njewels or coins. It's amazing the way his popularity has held up over \nthe years. He died a few years later in 1990, but his memory lingers \non.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was Canadian-bred by the the industrialist E.P. Taylor. Offered \nfor sale for $25,000 at his yearling sale, there were no takers so \nTaylor took him back. According to Woodie, he was so rough and \nunruly that his owner considered the horse's castration. Two years \nlater, in 1964, he just missed winning the Triple Crown when he \nfinished third in the Belmont. Lifetime he won 14 of 18 races, never \nfinishing out of the money.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his signature triumph was in the Derby. Joe Hickey was still in \nawe, he was in against a towering giant name Hill Rise, the \nfavorite with Bill Shoemaker aboard. and it looked going in that he \nwould have to take two steps for every one that Hill Rise took. But \nNorthern Dancer gutted it out and held on to win at the wire in \nrecord time proving that, as Hickey remembered, a good horse can \nhold his own in any company.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Sparkman, a broodmare barn foreman at Windfields during the \nDancer's formative years, described him as, the biggest little horse \nI ever met, both in body and in personality. Writing in the Daily \nRacing Form, Sparkman said that from the outset, he was, the master \nof all he surveyed and you had best never forget it. Always bright, \nfriendly and engaged, he nevertheless made it clear that he consented \nto follow your lead only because it was in his interest.\u0014\n\u0014\nThirty years ago, when Northern Dancer was nearing the end of his \ncareer as a stallion, we had the rare pleasure of looking out onto a \nfield in Maryland where mares and their babies, all of them sons and \ndaughters of Northern Dancer, were gambolling to their hearts' \ndelight.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few weeks later, as we readied our story for broadcast there was an \nupset in the Kentucky Derby. On Sunday Morning the next day, \nCharles Kuralt paused in his introduction, looked into the camera, \nand said this, You might have predicted that some day a grandson of \nNorthern Dancer would also win the Derby. And yesterday one did, \nFerdinand, a longshot at seventeen to one, but one with great blood \ncoursing in his veins. Heywood Hale Broun's story is entitled Super \nStud.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmen to that.\u0014\n\u0014\nE.S Bud Lamoreaux III is a creator and former executive producer of \nCBS News Sunday Morning with Charles Kuralt. He won four Eclipse \nAwards for national television excellence.\u0014",

(Reuters)\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Andrew Roth March 3, 2016  Washington post\u0014\n\u0014\nMOSCOW  A nanny accused of decapitating a 4-year-old girl in her \ncare and brandishing the severed head at a Moscow metro station has \nsaid that she was avenging the deaths of Muslims in Russias campaign \nin Syria.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a video that appeared on YouTube and quickly circulated through \nsocial media Thursday, Gulchekhra Bobokulova, a 38-year-old native of \nthe mostly Muslim nation of Uzbekistan, told an unidentified \ninterviewer she had taken revenge against those who themselves \nspilled blood, specifically citing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u0014\n\u0014\nPutin spilled blood. The planes were bombing, she said in the \nvideo, wearing the same blue pinafore and striped tracksuit she had \non during a court hearing Wednesday. Why are Muslims being killed? \nThey also want to live.\u0014\n\u0014\n[Russian airstrikes test limits of Syrian cease-fire]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe source of the video was not clear, and its authenticity could not \nbe confirmed, although the location matched the setting of a short \ninterview with Bobokulova published Wednesday by the pro-Kremlin \ntabloid LifeNews.\u0014\n\u0014\nRussian newspapers and other media outlets have offered several \npossible motives for the grisly crime after Bobokulova, dressed \nentirely in black, roamed near a bustling metro station for at least \n20 minutes Monday holding the bloodied head by the hair as horrified \npolice officers and commuters looked on.\u0014\n\u0014\nProsecutors believe she had killed the child and set fire to the \napartment of the parents before police stopped her at the metro \nstation for a passport check. She then produced the head from a bag \nshe was carrying and, according to some media reports, threatened to \ndetonate an explosive device. Police apparently backed off because of \nthe threat but later said she was not carrying any explosives.\u0014\n\u0014\nState television channels did not immediately cover the incident in \ntheir nationally broadcast news programs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the news media that \nreports of the crime were too horrendous to show on television, \nothers suspect that the Kremlin was seeking to prevent a backlash \nagainst Muslims  more than 2 million live in Moscow  or questions \nabout whether the military intervention in Syria has made Russia a \ngreater target for terrorism.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAsked about Bobokulovas comments about Putin in the video interview, \nPeskov said Thursday that any words said by such an insane woman \nshould be treated accordingly.\u0014\n\u0014\n[Russia no stranger to terror fears]\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier, he rejected speculation that the crime was motivated by \nethnic hatred, saying: Moscow is a huge metropolis. It is \nmultinational and multi-faith, and the crime should not be linked \nwith the nationality issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe incident spurred outrage among some nationalist leaders who for \nyears have demanded stricter control of migrant workers in Russia. \nBut it also found traction in the far more mainstream Communist \nParty, which shortly after the incident published an illustration \nfeaturing a woman in full Islamic covering carrying a bloody head. \nThe post demanded a visa regime for the majority-Muslim former Soviet \nrepublics of Central Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\nA makeshift memorial of flowers, teddy bears and chocolates appeared \nat the entrance to the subway station where Bobokulova was arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mass-circulation Moskovsky Komsomolets daily cited Uzbek police \nas saying that the woman has been suffering from schizophrenia for \nmore than a decade. In the video interview posted by LifeNews, \nBobokulova said she had recently broken up with her partner of 12 \nyears in Uzbekistan after he began living with another woman.\u0014\n\u0014\nBobokulova pleaded guilty at a hearing on Wednesday and, smiling, \nwaved to reporters in the courtroom. News reports said she told \njournalists on the way into the courtroom that Allah had ordered \nher to kill the child.\u0014",

    "words": "Naughty Or Nice? Derby \nWinners Temperaments Run The Gamut\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                by \nNatalie Voss | 05.06.2016 | \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's well known that Kentucky Derby winners come in a variety of \nsizes, running styles, and pedigrees, but they also exhibit a wide \nrange of personality types. Derby-winning Thoroughbreds, like their \nowners, have had unique temperaments resembling everything from \noversized puppies to fire-breathing dragons. Whether some of them \nhave won because of their unique dispositions or in spite of them is \nhard to say.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are a few of the more colorful four-legged characters in the \nrace's history: \u0014\n\u0014\n\tSir Barton, the 1919 Derby winner who was retroactively recognized \nas the first American Triple Crown winner, was not known for being an \nespecially jovial sort. J.K. M. Ross, son of Sir Barton owner J.K.L. \nRoss described the horse as an irascible, exasperating creature, \nwriting in Boots and Saddle: Sir Barton took no personal interest \nwhatsoever in his own kind and he completely ignored and apparently \ndespised all human beingswith the possible exception of his groom \nToots Thompson. Toots worshipped his charge and I don't think he \nwould've changed jobs with anyone. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAristides, 1875 Kentucky Derby winner was also a prickly sort, with \none death and several maimings attributed to him, although Derby \nhistorian Jim Bolus believes those accounts may have been \nexaggerated. It does seem as though the horse had a reputation for \nfailing (or refusing) to achieve a clean break in the walk-up starts \nof that era, being disqualified from racing because of this on at \nleast one occasion.\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhirlaway, 1941 Triple Crown winner, was branded as either quirky \nor stupid, depending upon the generosity of the observer. Ben Jones \ncalled the son of Blenheim II (who had some quirks of his own) the \ndumbest horse I ever trained. Whirlaway tended to spook, shy, rear, \nand jump at most everything, was a challenge to saddle, often missed \nthe break, and liked to blow turns in his races. Despite being \nunimpressed with the colt's brain, Jones made an effort to bend the \ntwig of Whirlaway's mind, as he described it to the Thoroughbred \nRecord, learning what set the horse off and modifying the behavior as \nmuch as he could without applying too much stress. Jones put blinkers \non the horse, then modified them, leaving Whirlaway's left eye with a \nwider range of vision than his right, reasoning the horse would be \nless boggled by activity on the outside rail. Jones also commissioned \njockey Eddie Arcaro to work the horse in the mornings. Jones would \nposition himself just off the inside rail on his pony, and instructed \nArcaro to steer the galloping Whirlaway between the pony and the \nrail. Jones' tricks worked to refocus Whirlaway, and though the horse \nnever totally lost his old habits, they didn't keep him from success. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tHill Gail, winner of the 1952 Run for the Roses was also a son of \nBlenheim II, and inherited his own set of unusual antics. Ben Jones \ntrained the colt, who had a tendency to defect in the middle of \nraces, flying to the outside rail and heading for the stable area. \nKnown to act up in the paddock, Hill Gail prompted Jones to punch the \nhorse in the nose on the first Saturday in May, effectively stunning \nhim long enough to complete the saddling process. Jockey Eddie Arcaro \nreported that Hill Gail got his wits about him on the Churchill \nbackstretch, however, and started to drift right after the first \nturn. Arcaro popped Hill Gail right-handed with his whip and the \nsurprised horse shot to a six-length lead, never looking back. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tBy contrast, Secretariat, 1973 Triple Crown winner, was known for \nbeing a total ham, frequently interrupting grazing time to pose for \nvisitors' cameras at Claiborne Farm and accept hugs from his most \nardent admirers. He was known to carry branches in his mouth, giving \nthem to visitors at his Claiborne paddock, and enjoyed gathering a \nmouthful of dry grass to puff into onlookers' faces. But Secretariat \nwasn't a pushover  those who knew him agreed that he was an alpha \nhorse whose excellent relationship with groom Eddie Sweat was based \nupon Sweat's understanding of the colt's own high opinion of himself. \u0014\n\u0014\n\tAmerican Pharoah, last year's Triple Crown winner, had a well-known \ndislike for loud noises and large crowds, sporting pom-pom-like ear \nplugs during his sweep of the races. Trainer Bob Baffert said the \ncommotion of the Derby walkover got the favored colt overexcited, \ncasting doubt about his mental fortitude among some handicappers. \nWhen Pharoah greeted his public in more intimate gatherings outside \nhis barn though, he often seemed as gentle as a school pony, \naccepting pats and posing for photographs with even the youngest \nfans. He made appearances on morning talk shows the day after the \nBelmont Stakes, standing patiently while television crews, with all \ntheir odd-looking equipment, interviewed Baffert. America's horse,' \nas owner Ahmed Zayat liked to call Pharoah, had the personality to \nmatch.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaulick Report\u0014",

    "words": "Nat Turners Skull \nand My Students Purse of Skin\u0014\n                                            By DAINA RAMEY BERRYOCT. \n18, 2016    New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nThis month, Richard Hatcher, a former mayor of Gary, Ind., delivered \nwhat researchers suspect is the skull of Nat Turner, the rebel slave, \nto Turners descendants. The skull had been kept as a relic, sold and \nprobably handed down through generations, for nearly 185 years. If \nDNA tests confirm that the skull is genuine, then Turners family \nwill have the opportunity to lay their famous relative to rest.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany were shocked when National Geographic reported the existence of \nthe skull, the same day that The Birth of a Nation, a new movie \nabout Nat Turner, was released. But the traffic and trade in human \nremains  from the fingers, toes and sexual organs of executed \nenslaved people, to the hair and nails of the victims of the \nHolocaust  are part of our history. Some Americans were not \nsurprised at all by the news; they might even have some family \nheirlooms of their own hidden in their homes, waiting to be shared \nwith their children.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurner was hanged in southeast Virginia on Nov. 11, 1831, for leading \na rebellion of slaves that left some 55 white people dead. Those who \ncame to witness his death then decapitated and skinned him. They \nbragged about it for decades. One participant, William Mallory, also \nknown as Buck, gloated so much about having skinned Turner that it \nwas listed in his own obituary.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurners skull was not the only one in circulation. \nNineteenth-century newspapers occasionally advertised that a \ndecapitated head had been discovered. Sometimes they were found on \ntrains, left on the side of the road, or impaled on stakes following \nexecutions. Public hangings  of people of all races  were a routine \npart of early American life. Vigilantes often took trophies, proof, \nin their mind, that justice had been served. They made purses of \nskin and took the grease from the flesh, and used it as oil. These \nsouvenirs were then passed down through generations.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree years ago, during a lecture in my introduction to \nAfrican-American history course, I talked about my own research into \nTurners skull. I had been tracing its post-mortem journey while \nfinishing a book about the value of enslaved people in life and after \ndeath. One student, who always sat up front but rarely spoke, raised \nhis hand and said he could confirm my research from personal \nexperience.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe came from a family of medical doctors four generations deep, and \nhis father had a purse made of human flesh. This purse, he explained, \nwas unique in that it was divided into sections of different colored \nskin, one of which came from a black person. The class was silent.\u0014\nThe purse had been passed down through the male heirs in his family, \nand soon it would be his. He was hesitant to speak about it, but \nsomething moved him to share. That night he went home and asked his \nfather if he could bring it to class. His dad said no. Could he take \na picture? Again, no. That was the end of the conversation.\u0014\n\\\u0014\nThe souvenirs that werent handed down within families were often \nsold. There was an active market in skulls at the time of Turners \ndeath. The field of scientific racism was on the rise, and doctors \nand anthropologists studied the size and shape of craniums to try to \nbuttress theories about racial superiority. Samuel Morton, a \ncraniologist, had the largest collection in the world, with more than \n130 agents making purchases for him on just about every continent. By \nthe late 19th century, he owned more than a thousand human skulls. \nMany of them can now be found in the Samuel George Morton collection \nat the University of Pennsylvania Museum.\u0014\n\u0014\nLocal physicians took possession of Turners skull after his \nexecution, and it was most likely studied at medical schools in \nVirginia, and as far north as Ohio and perhaps Indiana.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2002, Mr. Hatcher, the former mayor, who had been attempting to \nfound a civil rights museum, received the skull from activists who \nhad gotten it from a family of physicians who had owned it for three \ngenerations. Filmmakers who had made a documentary about Nat Turner \nlater connected him to Shanna Batten Aguirre and Shelly Lucas Wood, \nTurners descendants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe will never know all of the deceased who experienced such \npost-mortem consumption, as I call it. But the phenomenon continues \ntoday, even in the form of images of black death that do not involve \ndismemberment. What else to call the photo of Trayvon Martins body \nthat George Zimmerman retweeted after shooting him? Twitter took it \ndown, knowing it was an act of utter disrespect, but not before it \nhad been shared many times.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch consumption is part of American history. If I can teach a class \nand have one student with a relic in his familys possession, I know \nthere are others. Will you not come forward and admit to collecting \nghostly relics of the past? I recognize that, at one point, these \ntrophies served as evidence that justice had been served, but now \nits time to bring justice to those who were desecrated. Returning \nthese body parts to descendants, or at least granting them a \nrespectful burial, will help our nation heal from the sin of slavery \nand its ugly afterlife.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDaina Ramey Berry, an associate professor of history and African \ndiaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin, is the author \nof the forthcoming The Price for Their Pound of Flesh: The Value of \nthe Enslaved from Womb to Grave in the Building of a Nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nJason\u0014\n\u0014\nI just feel the need to interject that virtually every Cathedral in \nEurope has on display the venerated organs, hands, fingers and yes, \nskulls of saints. There is an undeniable connection between we the \nliving and the remains of the dead. The point isn't that these relics \nshould be heirlooms or treated haphazardly... merely that they are \npowerful on some visceral level that perhaps we don't fully \ncomprehend. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe question for me isn't the existance of morbid human curio... it's \nwho gets to decide where it is displayed, when it's displayed, and \nwhy it's displayed. I, for one, would have no problem if Nat Turner's \nskull were put on display in a civil rights museum, as a testament to \nthe brutality of the institution.\u0014\n\u0014\njcs\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the remains are identifiable as would be Nat Turner's skull, the \nfamily should have total control of what happens to it. If they want \nit to be buried, that is what should happen. If they want it to be \nput in a civil rights museum to demonstrate fully the horror that has \nbeen inflicted on their relative and so many more human beings that \nwould be their choice. I cannot imagine keeping a relic made out of a \nhuman being beyond the old practice of cutting a lock of hair. I \npersonally don't care what happens to my body after I am gone...put \nit out for the buzzards or compost it, that's fine with me. However, \nthese relics are not the result of natural death but of a horror \ninflicted on others. They are not scientific objects but human \nremains and should not be an object of curiosity. I feel the same \nabout the bizarre worship of relics of saints in many religions. It \nshows how primitive religion is and how it defies any common sense in \nthe face of science.\u0014",

    "title": "NO ROOM IN THE INN (KATYLUMA)",
    "words": "I have a friend who may have thrown some new light on this matter. \nHe is Kenneth E. Bailey, a \u0014\nMiddle Eastern expert who resides at the Ecumencal Center for \nBiblical Studies in Tantur, only a few \u0014\nmiles outside modern-day Bethlehem. In an article published in The \nPresbyterian Outlook (Jan. 4-11, 1988, pp. 8-9), Bailey reinterprets \nthe narrative of Jesus' birth from the perspective of one who has \nspent most of his life in the Middle East.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe notes that in Luke 2:7, which says there was \"no room in the inn,\" \nthe Greek word for \"inn\" is \u0014\nactually kataucma, which means \"guest room\" and does not imply a \nhostelry. Later, in the story of the \u0014\nGood Samaritan, the Samaritan takes the wounded man to a pandokheion, \nwhich does mean \"inn\" or \u0014\n\"hostelry.\" If Luke had meant to say \"inn\" in the birth narrative, he \nwould have used pandokheion, not \u0014\nkatyluma. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhat we Westerners need to understand, said Bailey, is the \narrangement of a typical Middle East- \u0014\nern house. In such a house, the living room often doubles as a guest \nroom; if there are overnight vis- \u0014\nitors, they sleep in this room. Adjacent to this room, but at a \nslightly lower level - as in a split- \u0014\nlevel house - is a rough, outer room into which the family's animals \nare usually brought at night, \u0014\nespecially during colder weather. In the morning they are led away \nand the room is swept. Another \u0014\nfeature of the Middle Eastern home is that the manger for the animals \nis built into the floor of the \u0014\nupper level, or living-room level, so that the animals can reach it \nbut cannot walk in it. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Middle Easterner reading the Gospel story, said Bailey, would \nimmediately recognize its events \u0014\nthis way. Mary and Joseph came to Bethlehem, where they were among \nnumerous relatives. We \u0014\nare told that Mary had justvisited her cousin Elizabeth, the mother \nof John the Baptist; and Joseph, \u0014\nwho was \"of the house and lineage of David,\" would have had many \nkinsfolk in the region. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would have been unthinkable for them to stay in a public inn. \nInstead, they sought out the home \u0014\nof relatives. But there were other relatives there as well, so that \nthere was no room in the guest room \u0014\nikaialuma) and they had to sleep in the lower, outer room, the one \ninto which animals were often \u0014\nbrought at night. When Jesus was born, he was wrapped in swaddling \nclothes (a Middle Eastern \u0014\ntradition) and laid in the manger, where all the folks in the living \nroom could admire him too. \u0014\n\u0014\nThus Jesus was not born into the cold, forbidding atmosphere usually \ndepicted by our Western \u0014\nunderstanding of the text, but among extended family members gathered \nin Bethlehem for the \u0014\nsame reason Joseph was there. The Savior of the world was born in the \nmidst of a loving, doting \u0014\nfamily, among aunts and uncles and cousins known to His parents and \nloved by them. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, Jesus Himself came home at Christmas. He was born in \na real home, in the \u0014\nbosom of a large family. This was real incarnation, to be born as \nother Middle Eastern children were \u0014\nborn, and are often born to this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Killinger, from sermon \"Home for Christmas\" \u0014\nSee Bailey's  \"Jesus Through MIddle Eastern Eyes\"\u0014",

    "title": "NOTHING EVER DIES: VIETNAM AND THE MEMORY OF WAR",
    "words": "Nothing Ever Dies, Vietnam and the Memory of War offers many riches. \nWith great erudition and impeccable scholarship, Viet Thanh Nguyen \nshows us how the traumatic repercussions of war defy simplification, \nand how facile it is to misremember the dead. Focusing on the \nAmerican war in Vietnam, and referencing other conflicts (Korea, \nCambodia, the Philippines), the author challenges us to extend our \nunderstanding and compassion to participants and victims on both \nsides of the battlefield. By remembering others, we expand and enrich \nour own stance.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrowing up in post-war Europe, I absorbed a good dose of aversion to \nthe Germans and the Russians. Years later, while Europe was uniting \nand setting out to reconcile old enemies, I was relieved not to have \nto blame and point the finger any longer. After moving to Canada, I \nsuccumbed to the American version of the war in Vietnam by watching \nthe movies (Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, etc.) and reading the \nliterary war accounts (Tim OBriens The Things They Carried, Michael \nHerrs Dispatches, and others). I admired their artistry but seldom \nquestioned the American one-sidedness.\u0014\n\u0014\nReading Nothing Ever Dies, meant revisiting the shameful conflict \nwithin an expanded Vietnamese-American context to great personal \nenrichment. Particularly superb are the chapters showing how the \nindustries of memory (books, TV, movies) constrain our ethical \nvision by practicing political partisanship and exclusion. Viet Thanh \nNguyens analytical depth and boundless intellect are here on full \ndisplay. A biography of 22 pages of Works Cited attests to his \ncuriosity and rigour. The book is compelling not least because the \nauthor weaves the painful, valiant, and ultimately fortunate \ntrajectory of his family (from a hardscrabble village in northern \nVietnam, via refugee camps, to prosperous California) into the \nbroader framework of his inquiry.\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing Ever Dies challenges us to cultivate a more compassionate \nsensibility and to recognize that each one of us is capable of being \nhuman and also inhuman. An engaging and empowering read.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nAmazing book that should be read by all Americans - and others. The \nbook makes the point that there must be an end to glorifying the \nmilitary. Excessive patriotism and nationalism as we have seen in the \nUS are vices and not virtues. Millions of dead and maimed in Vietnam, \nhalf of them civilians, for no reason at all. When will we ever learn \n?\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------\u0014\nWars are fought twice over -- once on the battlefield and once in our \nmemory -- and that is the subject of Viet Thanh Nguyen's profound and \nchallenging but hugely readable new book.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the end, Nothing Ever Dies is a powerful meditation. It is a book \nto be read in small sips and not big gulps. It is worthwhile alone \nfor revealing the intellectual roots of Nguyen's The Sympathizer, but \neven more so for confirming in compelling and passionate terms how we \nchoose to remember and how we choose to forget, most notably that \nAmerica is indeed fighting a forever War.\u0014",

    "words": "Paul Fleming, co-founder of New Tribes Mission, was as upbeat as \nusual when he left his California office on November 21, 1950, to \nboard the mission's new plane. With other missionaries, he planned to \nconduct rallies across America. Just hours earlier, it had seemed \nthat the rallies would have to be canceled, for heavy fog prevented \ndeparture from California.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe plane itself was an answer to prayer. Earlier that year, New \nTribes had lost the \"Tribesman,\" a C-47 (cargo version of a DC-3) \nwhen it went down in Venezuela. But generous donations had poured in, \nallowing the mission to buy and refurbish the Tribesman II.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the Tribesman II took off that day, Lance Latham, the other \nco-founder of New Tribes Mission, committed the plane, its crew and \nits passengers to the Lord. The pilots did not know that they would \nbe flying into a storm. Weather information was not as good in 1950 \nas it is today. Soon the Tribesman II was in thick clouds and its \nelectrical system failed. At least, that is the best guess of what \nhappened. A park ranger who heard the plane at 5:50 p.m. stepped \noutside and said it was circling without lights under the heavy \nclouds.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Tribesman II climbed back up through the clouds to 12,000 feet. \nThe passengers inside probably had no warning. Hidden in the clouds \nwas Mount Moran, a 12,605 foot peak of the Grand Tetons. An explosion \nripped the evening air and a tower of flame, visible from the ground, \nclimbed high into the sky. New Tribes had lost its founder, twenty \nmission workers or their families--and its second plane.\u0014\n\u0014\nPark rangers of the Grand Teton National park organized a rescue \nparty. Early this morning, November 22, 1950, four experienced \nmountain climbers raced toward the crash site. But, with another \nstorm lashing the mountain, they were forced back before nightfall.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul Petzoldt, the park's climbing guide, knew the mountain better \nthan anyone else. He volunteered to lead another party the following \nday, Thanksgiving. Again, the rescuers were forced back, this time \njust 300 yards below the wreckage. On November 24th, Petzoldt's team \nfinally reached the wreckage. The fuselage was split open, the seats \nstripped out. The left wing was missing.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul Fleming had cared for one thing above all during his adult life: \nwinning the lost to Christ. Now, even in his death, his concern was \nrewarded. Years before, Paul Fleming had met Paul Petzoldt and asked \nhim to train a group of New Tribes missionaries in mountain climbing \ntechniques. Paul had not been ready to follow Christ then, but when \nPetzoldt came off the mountain on November 25th, after discovering \nthe wreckage, he surrendered his life to Christ.\u0014",

    "title": "NUMERICAL SYMBOLISM",
    "words": "Numbers \u0014\n\u0014\nNumbers, symbols used to designate quantity. The Egyptians and the \nSumerians had advanced number systems and mathematics by the \nbeginning of the third millennium b.c. The Egyptian system was \ndecimal. The Sumerian system was a combination of a decimal and a \nduodecimal (12) or sexagesimal (60) system. Remnants of the \nduodecimal and sexagesimal systems are evident in our time system (24 \nhours, 60 minutes, and 60 seconds), degrees of a circle (360), and \nour units of dozen (12) and gross (144). The same system originally \nlay behind our calendar with 12 months, each with basically 30 days, \nfor a 360-day year. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Hebrews used the decimal system but did not develop their own \nsymbols until the postexilic period (539 b.c. on). In all pre-exilic \ninscriptions, numbers are either represented by Egyptian symbols or \nare written out. The Arad inscriptions regularly used Egyptian \nsymbols for numbers. The Samaria ostraca (fragments of pottery) more \nfrequently had the number written out. Letters of the Hebrew alphabet \nwere first used for numbers on coins in the Maccabean period (168-40 \nb.c.).\u0014\n\u0014\nSymbolism and Significance: Some numbers in biblical usage had \nsymbolic meaning. Seven probably represented completeness and \nperfection, as seen in the seven days of creation and the \ncorresponding seven-day week, climaxing with the Sabbath (Gen. \n1:1-2:4). Even the land was to have a Sabbath, lying fallow in the \nseventh year (Lev. 25:2-7). In Pharaoh's dream, there were seven good \nyears followed by seven years of famine (Gen. 41:1-36). Jacob worked \nseven years for Rachel; then, when he was given Leah instead, he \nworked an additional seven (Gen. 29:15-30). The finest quality silver \nwas described as having been refined seven times (Ps. 12:6).\u0014\n\u0014\nA similar use of the number seven can be seen in the nt. There are \nseven churches mentioned in Revelation 2-3 and seven deacons in Acts \n6:1-6. To Peter's question concerning forgiveness, Jesus responds \nthat we are to forgive not seven times, but seventy times seven \n(Matt. 18:21-22).\u0014\n\u0014\nMultiples of seven were also important. After forty-nine years came a \nJubilee year, when all Jewish bond-servants were released and land \nthat had been sold reverted to its former owner (Lev. 25:8-55). The \not speaks of seventy elders (Exod. 24:1, 9). Also, Jesus sent out the \nseventy (Luke 10:1-17). Seventy years was to be the length of the \nExile (Jer. 25:12; 29:10; Dan. 9:2). A period of seventy weeks of \nyears was to culminate in the coming of the messianic kingdom (Dan. \n9:24).\u0014\n\u0014\nThree also indicated completeness. The created order has three parts: \nheaven, earth, and underworld. The godhead is composed of three \nbeings: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Three major feasts appear in \nthe religious calendar (Exod. 23:14-19). Also prayer was urged three \ntimes daily (Dan. 6:10; Ps. 55:17). The sanctuary was divided into \nthree parts: vestibule, nave, and inner sanctuary (1 Kings 6:2-22). \nThree-year-old animals were prized for special sacrifices (1 Sam. \n1:24; Gen. 15:9). Jesus said the Son of man would be in the grave for \nthree days and three nights (Matt. 12:40).\u0014\n\u0014\nFour was also a significant number. There were four cardinal \ndirections, four corners of the earth (Isa. 11:12), and the four \nwinds (Jer. 49:36). Four rivers flowed out of Eden to water the world \n(Gen. 2:10-14). Surrounding God were four living creatures (Ezek. \n1:10; Rev. 4:6-7).\u0014\n\u0014\nForty, a frequently occurring multiple of four, represented a large \nnumber or a long period of time. Forty days and nights of rain (Gen. \n7:12) flooded the earth. Likewise, Jesus was tempted in the \nwilderness for forty days (Mark 1:12). Forty years represented \napproximately two generations. During the forty years of Israel's \nwilderness wandering, all the adults who had rebelled against God \ndied (cf. Num. 14:20-23). At age forty, a person reached maturity \n(Exod. 2:11; Acts 7:23). No more than forty lashes could be imposed \non an offender (Deut. 25:3).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Talmud, Midrashim, and the Cabala, a system of numerology \ncalled gematria developed. Gematria attempted to discover hidden \nmeaning for words based on the numerical values of the letters. The \nHebrew letters of the name Eliezer, Abraham's servant, have a \nnumerical value of 318. Gen. 14:14 says that Abraham took 318 trained \nmen to pursue the kings from the east. The Midrash notes that Abraham \nhad but one helper, Eliezer, since Eliezer has the numerical value of \n318. In a similar pattern, the number 666 in Revelation is often \ntaken as a gematria for the emperor Nero.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot all number usage in the Bible was symbolic. The pattern x, x+1 \nappears frequently as a device of emphasis in parallelism. A good \nexample may be seen in Prov. 30:18-19 with three and four:'\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Achtemeier, P. J., Harper & Row and Society of Biblical Literature. \n(1985). In Harper's Bible dictionary (1st ed., pp. 711712). San \nFrancisco: Harper & Row.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------\u0014\n\u0014\nSymbolic Use of Numbers. In Scripture, seven symbolizes completeness \nor perfection. On the seventh day God rests from his labors and \ncreation is finished (Gn 2:2). Pharaoh in his dream sees seven cattle \ncoming from the Nile (Gn 41:2). Samson's sacred Nazirite locks are \nbraided in seven plaits (Jgs 16:13). Seven devils left Mary of \nMagdala, signifying the totality of her previous possession by Satan \n(Lk 8:2); \"seven other devils\" will enter the purified but vacant \nlife of a man (Mt 12:45). However, on the positive side, there are \nthe seven spirits of God (Rv 3:1). In the seventh year the Hebrew \nslave is to be freed (Ex 21:2), having completed his time of \ncaptivity and service. Every seventh year is a sabbatical year (Lv \n25:4). Seven times seven reiterates the sense of completeness. In the \nyear of Jubilee (the 50th year), all land is freed and returns to the \noriginal owners (Lv 25:10). Pentecost, the Feast of Weeks, is \nseven-times-seven days after Passover. \"Seventy,\" which is literally \n\"sevens\" in Hebrew, strengthens the concept of perfection. There are \n70 elders (Ex 24:1) in Israel, and the Lord sends 70 disciples on a \nmission (Lk 10:1). Israel was exiled to Babylon for 70 years (Jer \n25:12) to complete its punishment. \"Seventy times seven\" (Mt 18:22) \nreiterates this still further. The Lord was not giving Peter a \nmathematical number of times that he should forgive Andrew, but \ninsisting on limitless forgiveness for a brother's sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Three\" may well share in this meaning of completion or perfection, \nalthough not so forcibly (2 Kgs 13:18). Many things happen \"on the \nthird day\" (Hos 6:2). Jonah spent three days in the stomach of the \nfish (Mt 12:40), and the Lord rose again on the third day (1 Cor \n15:4). David is offered a choice of divine punishmentsthree years; \nthree months; three days (2 Sm 24:13). For the Christian, \"three\" \ntakes on a far deeper significance as the number of the Persons of \nthe Trinity. The three Persons are clearly expressed for instance, in \nthe Great Commission (Mt 28:19) and in the Pauline \"grace\" (2 Cor \n13:1). Many echoes of this threefold expression are in the NT, and \nmany anticipations of it in the OT, of which the thrice-repeated \n\"Holy\" in Isaiah 6:3 is the most famous.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome scholars see four as another symbol of completeness (four winds \nof heaven, Dn 7:2; four horsemen, Rv 6:17; four living creatures \naround the throne of God, Rv 4:6). Five is certainly used in an \nindefinite sense as a small number (Is 19:18; 30:17). Nor do eight or \nnine seem to have any special significance, although, like other \nnumbers, they may be used in a factual sense to describe any of God's \nactivities (nine plagues on Egypt, Ex 710). \"Ten\" does have \nsignificance because of the Ten Commandments (Ex 20:117), but not \nany special symbolism earlier in the Bible. If anything, \"ten\" is \nelsewhere used in a vague way. Laban changes Jacob's wages 10 times \n(Gn 31:7); Daniel and his friends are 10 times better than all other \nstudents (Dn 1:20); 10 times over, the Jewish settlers will be warned \nof impending enemy attacks (Neh 4:12).\u0014\n\u0014\nEleven appears to have no special biblical significance, but 12 \ncertainly has. The clearest proof of this is the existence of the 12 \ntribes in Israel. In Revelation 7:48, where it is mathematically \nimportant that the number of tribes be limited to 12, the tribe of \nDan is altogether omitted on account of Dan's sin of idolatry (Jgs \n18:1420). Some have compared the number 12 with the 12 months of the \nyear, as symbolizing completion, but, if so, the Bible gives no hint \nof it. Ishmael's descendants were also divided into 12 clans (Gn \n17:20), so that the number 12 was apparently significant outside \nIsrael as well. In the NT Christ chose 12 apostles (Mt 10:14). The \nlink with the number of tribes is made specific when Christ tells the \napostles that they will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes (Mt \n19:28). However, it is interesting that, after the election and \nappointment of Matthias (Acts 1:26), the Christian church apparently \nmade no subsequent efforts to maintain the number of apostles. Like \n\"seven times seven,\" \"twelve times twelve\" increases the force of the \nnumber. When this is further multiplied by a thousand, the figure \nbecomes the 144,000 redeemed (Rv 7:4), who were sealed \"out of all \nthe tribes of Israel.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThousand and ten thousand are sometimes used symbolically to denote \nvague but large numbers. So \"ten thousand times ten thousand\" and \n\"thousands of thousands\" (Rv 5:11) are attempts to express the \ninexpressible. Typical of the Bible, these vast numbers, which can be \nused to teach the joy and wonder of heaven, can also be used to show \nthe awfulness of the wrath of God. Those armies that carry out the \npunishment of God on sinful mankind are \"twice ten thousand times ten \nthousand\" (Rv 9:16).\u0014\n\u0014\nExact Statistics. As distinct from the metaphorical use of numbers to \ndenote completion, immensity, and the like, numbers in Hebrew were \noften used to give exact tallies or measurements. Such usage is only \nknown to us from clay tablets and ostraca (broken pieces of potsherd \nengraved in ink, used as rough notebooks). However, ascertaining \nexactly what the text was in its earliest form and what that text \nmeans is difficult.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn example is the number of the sons of Jeconiah among the \ninhabitants of Beth-shemesh. They were struck down by the Lord \nbecause of their failure to rejoice with the others when God's ark \nreturned to Israel from the Philistine country (1 Sm 6:19). The Greek \ntext reads \"seventy\"; the later Hebrew manuscripts add \"fifty \nthousand.\" But, as Beth-shemesh itself was only a small frontier \ntown, and the \"sons of Jeconiah\" was presumably only one clan among \nseveral, the smaller number is obviously the original, and the large \naddition due to some later manuscript confusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nA good rule in trying to decide whether a number is statistical or \nimpressionistic is whether or not it is a small number, and whether \nor not it is an unusual number for which there is no obvious \ntheological explanation. When the men of Ai killed some 36 Israelites \nat the first assault on the city (Jos 7:5), the smallness of the \nnumber is evidence that this is a vividly remembered factual detail. \nSimilarly, in the case of the number of Abraham's 318 retainers (Gn \n14:14) or the catch of 153 fish after the resurrection (Jn 21:11), \nthe numbers, though large, are not round numbers but unusual \ncombinations, and are obviously meant in a literal or statistical \nsense. Irrelevant details like this have a habit of remaining in the \nmemory, and are the best guarantee of the trustworthiness of the \nnarrative.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Elwell, W. A., & Beitzel, B. J.

    "title": "NAZIS WERE GIVEN \"SAFE HAVEN\" IN U.S., REPORT SAYS",
    "words": "Nazis Were Given Safe Haven in U.S., Report Says\u0014\n\u0014\nBy ERIC LICHTBLAU  November 13, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nWASHINGTON  A secret history of the United States governments \nNazi-hunting operation concludes that American intelligence officials \ncreated a safe haven in the United States for Nazis and their \ncollaborators after World War II, and it details decades of clashes, \noften hidden, with other nations over war criminals here and abroad. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe 600-page report, which the Justice Department has tried to keep \nsecret for four years, provides new evidence about more than two \ndozen of the most notorious Nazi cases of the last three decades. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt describes the governments posthumous pursuit of Dr. Josef \nMengele, the so-called Angel of Death at Auschwitz, part of whose \nscalp was kept in a Justice Department officials drawer; the \nvigilante killing of a former Waffen SS soldier in New Jersey; and \nthe governments mistaken identification of the Treblinka \nconcentration camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report catalogs both the successes and failures of the band of \nlawyers, historians and investigators at the Justice Departments \nOffice of Special Investigations, which was created in 1979 to deport \nNazis. \u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the reports most damning disclosures come in assessing the \nCentral Intelligence Agencys involvement with Nazi migrs. Scholars \nand previous government reports had acknowledged the C.I.A.s use of \nNazis for postwar intelligence purposes. But this report goes further \nin documenting the level of American complicity and deception in such \noperations. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department report, describing what it calls the \ngovernments collaboration with persecutors, says that O.S.I \ninvestigators learned that some of the Nazis were indeed knowingly \ngranted entry to the United States, even though government officials \nwere aware of their pasts. America, which prided itself on being a \nsafe haven for the persecuted, became  in some small measure  a \nsafe haven for persecutors as well, it said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report also documents divisions within the government over the \neffort and the legal pitfalls in relying on testimony from Holocaust \nsurvivors that was decades old. The report also concluded that the \nnumber of Nazis who made it into the United States was almost \ncertainly much smaller than 10,000, the figure widely cited by \ngovernment officials. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department has resisted making the report public since \n2006. Under the threat of a lawsuit, it turned over a heavily \nredacted version last month to a private research group, the National \nSecurity Archive, but even then many of the most legally and \ndiplomatically sensitive portions were omitted. A complete version \nwas obtained by The New York Times. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department said the report, the product of six years of \nwork, was never formally completed and did not represent its official \nfindings. It cited numerous factual errors and omissions, but \ndeclined to say what they were. \u0014\n\u0014\nMore than 300 Nazi persecutors have been deported, stripped of \ncitizenship or blocked from entering the United States since the \ncreation of the O.S.I., which was merged with another unit this year. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn chronicling the cases of Nazis who were aided by American \nintelligence officials, the report cites help that C.I.A. officials \nprovided in 1954 to Otto Von Bolschwing, an associate of Adolf \nEichmann who had helped develop the initial plans to purge Germany \nof the Jews and who later worked for the C.I.A. in the United \nStates. In a chain of memos, C.I.A. officials debated what to do if \nVon Bolschwing were confronted about his past  whether to deny any \nNazi affiliation or explain it away on the basis of extenuating \ncircumstances, the report said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department, after learning of Von Bolschwings Nazi ties, \nsought to deport him in 1981. He died that year at age 72. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report also examines the case of Arthur L. Rudolph, a Nazi \nscientist who ran the Mittelwerk munitions factory. He was brought to \nthe United States in 1945 for his rocket-making expertise under \nOperation Paperclip, an American program that recruited scientists \nwho had worked in Nazi Germany. (Rudolph has been honored by NASA and \nis credited as the father of the Saturn V rocket.) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe report cites a 1949 memo from the Justice Departments No. 2 \nofficial urging immigration officers to let Rudolph back in the \ncountry after a stay in Mexico, saying that a failure to do so would \nbe to the detriment of the national interest. \u0014\n\u0014\nJustice Department investigators later found evidence that Rudolph \nwas much more actively involved in exploiting slave laborers at \nMittelwerk than he or American intelligence officials had \nacknowledged, the report says. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome intelligence officials objected when the Justice Department \nsought to deport him in 1983, but the O.S.I. considered the \ndeportation of someone of Rudolphs prominence as an affirmation of \nthe depth of the governments commitment to the Nazi prosecution \nprogram, according to internal memos. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department itself sometimes concealed what American \nofficials knew about Nazis in this country, the report found. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1980, prosecutors filed a motion that misstated the facts in \nasserting that checks of C.I.A. and F.B.I. records revealed no \ninformation on the Nazi past of Tscherim Soobzokov, a former Waffen \nSS soldier. In fact, the report said, the Justice Department knew \nthat Soobzokov had advised the C.I.A. of his SS connection after he \narrived in the United States. \u0014\n\u0014\n(After the case was dismissed, radical Jewish groups urged violence \nagainst Mr. Soobzokov, and he was killed in 1985 by a bomb at his \nhome in Paterson, N.J. ) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe secrecy surrounding the Justice Departments handling of the \nreport could pose a political dilemma for President Obama because of \nhis pledge to run the most transparent administration in history. Mr. \nObama chose the Justice Department to coordinate the opening of \ngovernment records. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nazi-hunting report was the brainchild of Mark Richard, a senior \nJustice Department lawyer. In 1999, he persuaded Attorney General \nJanet Reno to begin a detailed look at what he saw as a critical \npiece of history, and he assigned a career prosecutor, Judith Feigin, \nto the job. After Mr. Richard edited the final version in 2006, he \nurged senior officials to make it public but was rebuffed, colleagues \nsaid. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Mr. Richard became ill with cancer, he told a gathering of \nfriends and family that the reports publication was one of three \nthings he hoped to see before he died, the colleagues said. He died \nin June 2009, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke at his \nfuneral. \u0014\n\u0014\nI spoke to him the week before he died, and he was still trying to \nget it released, Ms. Feigin said. It broke his heart. \u0014\nAfter Mr. Richards death, David Sobel, a Washington lawyer, and the \nNational Security Archive sued for the reports release under the \nFreedom of Information Act. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Justice Department initially fought the lawsuit, but finally gave \nMr. Sobel a partial copy  with more than 1,000 passages and \nreferences deleted based on exemptions for privacy and internal \ndeliberations. \u0014\n\u0014\nLaura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department \nis committed to transparency, and that redactions are made by \nexperienced lawyers. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe full report disclosed that the Justice Department found a \nsmoking gun in 1997 establishing with definitive proof that \nSwitzerland had bought gold from the Nazis that had been taken from \nJewish victims of the Holocaust. But these references are deleted, as \nare disputes between the Justice and State Departments over \nSwitzerlands culpability in the months leading up to a major report \non the issue. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother section describes as a hideous failure a series of meetings \nin 2000 that United States officials held with Latvian officials to \npressure them to pursue suspected Nazis. That passage is also \ndeleted. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo too are references to macabre but little-known bits of history, \nincluding how a director of the O.S.I. kept a piece of scalp that was \nthought to belong to Dr. Mengele in his desk in hopes that it would \nhelp establish whether he was dead. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe chapter on Dr. Mengele, one of the most notorious Nazis to escape \nprosecution, details the O.S.I.s elaborate efforts in the mid-1980s \nto determine whether he had fled to the United States and might still \nbe alive. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt describes how investigators used letters and diaries apparently \nwritten by Dr. Mengele in the 1970s, along with German dental records \nand Munich phone books, to follow his trail. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the development of DNA tests, the piece of scalp, which had \nbeen turned over by the Brazilian authorities, proved to be a \ncritical piece of evidence in establishing that Dr. Mengele had fled \nto Brazil and had died there in about 1979 without ever entering the \nUnited States, the report said. The edited report deletes references \nto Dr. Mengeles scalp on privacy grounds. \u0014\n\u0014\nEven documents that have long been available to the public are \nomitted, including court decisions, Congressional testimony and \nfront-page newspaper articles from the 1970s. \u0014\n\u0014\nA chapter on the O.S.I.s most publicized failure  the case against \nJohn Demjanjuk, a retired American autoworker who was mistakenly \nidentified as Treblinkas Ivan the Terrible  deletes dozens of \ndetails, including part of a 1993 ruling by the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that raised ethics accusations \nagainst Justice Department officials. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat section also omits a passage disclosing that Latvian migrs \nsympathetic to Mr. Demjanjuk secretly arranged for the O.S.I.s trash \nto be delivered to them each day from 1985 to 1987. The migrs \nrifled through the garbage to find classified documents that could \nhelp Mr. Demjanjuk, who is currently standing trial in Munich on \nseparate war crimes charges. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Feigin said she was baffled by the Justice Departments attempt \nto keep a central part of its history secret for so long. Its an \namazing story, she said, that needs to be told.\u0014",

    "words": "NEVER AGAIN: HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is where your mother would have been forced to stand when she \nfirst passed through the camp gates. Its called the Wailing Wall.\u0014\n\u0014\nRupert is on staff at what was once Mauthausen Concentration Camp. \nThe granite walls, the imposing guard towers, the barracks, the gas \nchamber, and the ovens now stand as a memorial dedicated to those who \nsuffered and died in that ghastly place.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe site provides a personal guide for family members. Our guide \nRupert did more than walk my wife Joy and me through the physical \nplant of Mauthausen. He led us, as best he could, through my mothers \nexperience there.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon reflection I believe that she endured not only brutal treatment, \nhunger, and desperate fear. The camps diabolical processes were \ndedicated to stripping her life of meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe psychologist Emily Esfahani Smith argues that a sense of \nbelonging is crucial to having meaning in life. To having the why \nof our existence. If we are stripped of our sense of belonging, we \nwill eventually tumble into an existential crisis. A crisis of \nmeaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Viktor Frankl \nhave argued, humans cannot go on long without a sense of lifes \nmeaning. The ultimate aim of all the Nazi camps was death. So it \nmakes monstrous sense that the Nazis would have stripped away their \nvictims ability to belong.\u0014\n\u0014\nBelonging involves mutual recognition. Paradoxically, being one of \nmany also means that each of us is different. You recognize me as me. \nFor you, I am not interchangeable. I am irreplaceable. And I \nrecognize you in the same way. Each of us finds our identity as human \nbeings by recognizing and respecting each others difference.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nazis sought to make life unbearable for concentration camp \nvictims by making them utterly interchangeable.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrudy (my mothers German name was Edeltraud) arrived in the nearby \nvillage of Mauthausen by train.\u0014\n\u0014\n1944 had edged into 1945. Trudy would soon turn sixteen. Previously, \nthe camp had been reserved for adult men. As the tide of war turned \nagainst the Nazis, the camps mission was expanded to include women \nand children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the station, SS guards hustled the prisoners from their cars and \nmarched them through the village streets. As the shocked and weary \nprisoners shuffled and stumbled along, the villagers went about their \nordinary rounds as if these strangers were invisible.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was no jeering or staring. There were no furtive, compassionate \nglances. The prisoners were invisible. Too normal and mundane a sight \nto give notice.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy contrast, the residents warmly greeted the guards. Shopkeepers and \nHausfraus and bankers would smile and wave at them. Call them \ngenially by name. Swap jokes. Hans, remember dinner at 8:00! My \ndaughter cant wait to see you!\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Austrian street would have resembled the hometown streets of \nLinzabout 12 miles awaythat my mother had strolled just days \nbefore. Bakeries. Cafes. A post office. A park. As she walked to \nschool, people would have called out to her by name. Slipped her a \nwarm torte or flashed her a friendly smile. They recognized her. She \nbelonged to that place. To those people.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut as soon as the prisoners arrived in the village of Mauthausen, an \nexistential stripping had begun. Stripped of belonging to an address, \nto a neighborhood, to a family, to a circle of friends, to a \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter a steep mile and half march, the prisoners came to the camp. \nAfter passing through the massive gates, the prisoners marched \nimmediately to the right along the wall. They halted at the Wailing \nWall, a section of wall across from a nondescript administrative \nbuilding.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere, the stripping continued.\u0014\n\u0014\nGuards ordered everyone to remove their clothes, to toss all their \nbelongings in a pile by the building, and then to face the wall. \nPrisoners stood naked, humiliated, terrified at attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong with their clothing and their jewelry, they had been stripped \nof their individual identity. With clothing we express ourselves. We \ndifferentiate ourselves from and identify ourselves to each other. \nThat is how we connect. How we belong.\u0014\n\u0014\nNext, their heads and bodies were roughly shaved. Each was a assigned \nan ill-fitting striped uniform and a bracelet with a number.\u0014\nNo hair style to distinguish them from anyone else. A number \nreplacing their name. All vestiges of individual humanity had been \nsystematically stripped from each prisoner. They were \ninterchangeable. They could not belong because they could not be \nrecognized as unique, irreplaceable human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nStripped of meaning, they would gradually, meekly slide into death. \nAt least, that was the plan.\u0014\n\u0014\nLest we think that Mauthausen and the other 1200 camps are merely a \nlesson about a terrible but now bygone era, consider what the late \ntherapist and concentration camp survivor Victor Frankl identifies as \nthe symptoms of a crisis of meaning:\u0014\n\u0014\n Aggression\u0014\n Addiction\u0014\n Depression\u0014\n\u0014\nBy these measures, as writers like David Brooks have noted, the \nUnited States is in the throes of a crisis of meaning.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have an aggression epidemic. Mass shootings are so frequent that \nthey no longer shock us. We have been at war for nearly two decades. \nWhite supremacy is on the rise as are hate crimes agains LGBTQ \npeople, Muslims, and people of color.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is an opioid crisis. Around 130 people die from opioid \noverdoses a day. But other drugs take a toll as well. Between 1999 \nand 2017 more than 700,000 people have died by drug overdose.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe US suicide rate rose 24% between 1999 and 2014. While there are \nmany factors involved in this statistic, despair and depression \nsurely play a significant part.\u0014\n\u0014\nSurvivors of the camps have a crucial lesson for us. Viktor Frankl \nobserved that those who loved othersthose who sacrificed for the \nsake of otherswere more likely to find meaning in even the wretched \nconditions of the camp. Moved by their love for others, they found \nthe strength to endure at least one more day. One more hour.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe honor those who died and those who survived the Holocaust with the \nrefrain Never again! And I hear that refrain as a commitment to \nlive out the lesson that they have taught us. For you see, love helps \nus not only survive. It is the only power great enough to resist and \nfinally conquer those persistent forces that would erect death camps \nyet again.\u0014\n\u0014\nJake Owensby is the fourth Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western \nLouisiana.\u0014",

    "words": "Never again? Remembering Auschwitz amid enduring anti-Semitism and \nincreasing acts of hatred\u0014\nBill Leonard  |  January 29, 2020\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his memoir, Night, the late Romanian Jewish writer and Boston \nUniversity professor Eli Wiesel recalled his 1944 arrival at \nBirkenau, reception center for Auschwitz:\u0014\n\u0014\nNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has \nturned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven \ntimes sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget \nthe little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into \nwreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget \nthose flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget \nthe nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the \ndesire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my \nGod and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget \nthese things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself. \nNever.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuschwitz didnt just steal Eli Wiesels God, soul and dreams; it \nmurdered them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Russian \nsoldiers occurred on Holocaust Remembrance Day, January 27, 2020. The \nday before, the Washington Post published reporter Gillian Brockells \naccount of the exploits of Witold Pilecki, a Polish resistance \nfighter who voluntarily went to Auschwitz to start a resistance. His \nsecret reports to Allies were the first to describe the cruelties of \nwhat became the largest of the Nazi death camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrockell writes of Pileckis 1941 arrival at the camp:\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing could have prepared him for the brutality he found. As he \nleaped out of a train car with hundreds of other men, he was beaten \nwith clubs. Ten men were randomly pulled from the group and shot. \nAnother man was asked his profession; when he said he was a doctor, \nhe was beaten to death. Anyone who was educated or Jewish was beaten. \nThose remaining were robbed of their valuables, stripped, shaved, \nassigned a number and prison stripes, and then marched out to stand \nin the first of many roll calls.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet none of you imagine that he will ever leave this place alive, \nan SS guard declared. The rations have been calculated so that you \nwill only survive six weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe gas chambers were not operative at that time, but the ovens were \nalready at work. Brockell notes, The only way out of Auschwitz, \nanother guard said, was through the chimney. Over a year later, \nPilecki miraculously escaped, continuing his anti-Nazi resistance in \nPoland only to be executed by the post-war Soviet-controlled Polish \ngovernment in 1947.\u0014\n\u0014\nFew prisoners escaped Auschwitz. Some 1.1 to 1.9 million human beings \ndied there, 90 percent of whom were Jews. Others included some 19,000 \nRoma (Gypsy) people, disabled and LGBT persons, and resistance \nfighters. The last generation of Auschwitz survivors is passing off \nthe scene, even as Holocaust deniers promulgate their lies, not \nonly throughout Europe, but also in the land of the free and the home \nof alternative facts. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum asserts \nthat such denial is an anti-Semitic claim that the Holocaust was \ninvented or exaggerated by Jews as part of a plot to advance Jewish \ninterests. It is often closely linked to white supremacist and other \nracist theories (that are often accompanied by biblical citations and \nallusions).\u0014",

    "title": "NEGATIVITY IN THE EARLY CHURCH",
    "words": "The Didache\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Didache was one of several Syrian church discipline manuals that \ncame to define church order in\u0014\nthe Near East. This 2nd-century document dealt with the proper \nconduct expected of and expected\u0014\ntoward itinerant ministers who apparently had begun to abuse \nChristian hospitality.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is remarkable in many ways, among which is its introduction of a \nnegative Golden Rule: All which you\u0014\nmay wish will not happen to you, you also do not do to another \n(1:2). This recasting of Jesus words\u0014\nfrom the positive to the negative serves as a synecdoche for the \nwhole book; the Didache introduced\u0014\ninto early church literature the infamous lists of donts that \nwould come to characterize much of the\u0014\nChristianity that would follow. As a result, Christian freedom was \nsharply curtailed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1 Corinthians 8 Paul leaves the eating of food offered to idols up \nto the individual Christians\u0014\nconscience, cautioning each Christian to consider those weaker in the \nfaith when deciding how to\u0014\nexercise Christian freedom. But in the Didache, individual conscience \nhas been superseded by\u0014\necclesiastical rule:  keep strictly away from what is offered to \nidols, for that implies worshipping dead\u0014\ngods (6:3). What was once a caution is now a rule.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus said to baptize. But the Didache specified how to baptize. The \nDidache also required fasting of\u0014\nChristians, on Wednesdays and Fridays. Jesus told His disciples that \nthey should not vainly repeat ritual\u0014\nprayers the way the pagans did, but the Didache ordered Christians to \nrepeat the Lords Prayer\u0014\nverbatim, three times a day. About 96 A.D., Clement of Rome gently \ncorrected a schismatic group of\u0014\nyoung upstarts in the letter we call 1 Clement, but only a few \ndecades later (if that) the Didache was\u0014\nfiercely advocating the practice of shunning those with divergent \nviews.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, the spirit of the Didache must have been stifling for the \naverage churchgoer.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne exception to this trend is that prophets were not restricted when \nspeaking or acting under the\u0014\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit. Going overboard in one of its lone \nconcessions, the Didache identifies\u0014\nprophets as the churchs high priests (13:3). The implications of \nthis statement are enormous.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the New Testament and especially in Hebrews, no one in the church \nis called a high priest except\u0014\nChrist Himself. But this casual appellation by the Didache \neffectively ends the priesthood of all believers,\u0014\nfor now another high priest is instituted on earththe prophet. \nAppropriately, church people are\u0014\ninstructed to give these prophets their first fruits of money and \nclothes. The Didache further restricts\u0014\nthese offices to males (15:1), despite the fact that, early in the \n2nd century, the governor of Bithynia,\u0014\nPliny the Younger, had found it necessary to torture two female \nministers (ministrae) in order to gain\u0014\nmore information from them about the activities of Christians \n(Letters of Pliny X.96).\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch History Magazine\u0014",

    "words": "Nazi War Criminal Josef Mengele\u0014\nBy \u0014\nChristopher Minster  Updated May 30, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nJosef Mengele (1911-1979) was a German doctor and Nazi War Criminal \nwho escaped justice after World War Two. During the Second World War, \nMengele worked at the infamous Auschwitz death camp, where he \nconducted twisted experiments on the Jewish inmates before sending \nthem to their deaths. Nicknamed the Angel of Death, Mengele escaped \nto South America after the war. In spite of a massive manhunt led by \nhis victims, Mengele eluded capture and drowned on a Brazilian beach \nin 1979.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the War\u0014\n\u0014\nJosef was born in 1911 into a wealthy family: his father was an \nindustrialist whose companies sold farm equipment. A bright young \nman, Josef earned a doctorate in Anthropology from the University of \nMunich in 1935 at the age of 24. He continued his studies and earned \na medical doctorate at Frankfurt University. He did some work in the \nburgeoning field of genetics, an interest he would maintain \nthroughout his life. He joined the Nazi party in 1937 and was awarded \nan officers commission in the Waffen Schutzstaffel (SS).\u0014\nService in World War II\u0014\n\u0014\nMengele was sent to the eastern front to fight the Soviets as an army \nofficer. He saw action and was recognized for service and bravery \nwith the Iron Cross. He was wounded and declared unfit for active \nduty in 1942, so he was sent back to Germany, now promoted to \ncaptain. In 1943, after some time in Berlin's bureaucracy, he was \nassigned to the Auschwitz death camp as a medical officer.\u0014\n\u0014\nMengele at Auschwitz\u0014\n\u0014\nAt Auschwitz, Mengele had a lot of freedom. Because the Jewish \ninmates were sent there to die, he rarely treated any of their \nmedical conditions. Instead, he began a series of ghoulish \nexperiments, using the inmates as human guinea pigs. He favored \nanomalies as his test subjects: dwarfs, pregnant women and anyone \nwith a birth defect of any sort caught Mengele's attention. He \npreferred sets of twins, however, and \"rescued\" them for his \nexperiments. He injected dye into inmates' eyes to see if he could \nchange their color. Sometimes, one twin would be infected with a \ndisease such as typhus: the twins were then monitored so that the \nprogression of the disease in the infected one could be observed. \nThere are many more examples of Mengele's experiments, most of which \nare too gruesome to list. He kept meticulous notes and samples.\u0014\n\u0014\nFlight After the War\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Germany lost the war, Mengele disguised himself as a regular \nGerman military officer and was able to escape. Although he was \ndetained by Allied forces, no one identified him as a wanted war \ncriminal, even though by then the Allies were looking for him. Under \nthe false name of Fritz Hollmann, Mengele spent three years in hiding \non a farm near Munich. By then, he was one of the most wanted Nazi \nwar criminals. In 1948 he made contact with Argentine agents: they \ngave him a new identity, Helmut Gregor, and his landing papers for \nArgentina were swiftly approved. In 1949 he left Germany forever and \nmade his way to Italy, his father's money smoothing his way. He \nboarded a ship in May of 1949 and after a short trip, he arrived in \nNazi-friendly Argentina.\u0014\n\u0014\nMengele in Argentina\u0014\n\u0014\nMengele soon acclimated to life in Argentina. Like many former Nazis, \nhe was employed at Orbis, a factory owned by a German-Argentine \nbusinessman. He continued doctoring on the side as well. His first \nwife had divorced him, so he remarried, this time to his brother's \nwidow Martha. Aided in part by his rich father, who was investing \nmoney in the Argentine industry, Mengele moved in high circles. He \neven met with President Juan Domingo Pern (who knew exactly who \n\"Helmut Gregor\" was). As a representative for his father's company, \nhe traveled around South America, sometimes under his own name.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack Into Hiding\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was aware that he was still a wanted man: with the possible \nexception of Adolf Eichmann, he was the most sought-after Nazi war \ncriminal still at large. But the manhunt for him seemed an \nabstraction, far away in Europe and Israel: Argentina had sheltered \nhim for a decade and he was comfortable there. But in the late 1950's \nand early 1960's, several events happened which rattled Mengele's \nconfidence. Pern was thrown out in 1955, and the military government \nthat replaced him turned over power to civilian authorities in 1959: \nMengele felt they would not be sympathetic. His father died and with \nhim much of Mengele's status and clout in his new homeland. He caught \nwind that a formal extradition request was being written up in \nGermany for his forced return. Worst of all, in May of 1960, Eichmann \nwas snatched off a street in Buenos Aires and brought to Israel by a \nteam of Mossad agents (who had been actively looking for Mengele as \nwell). Mengele knew he had to go back underground.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeath and Legacy of Josef Mengele\u0014\n\u0014\nMengele fled to Paraguay and then Brazil. He lived out the rest of \nhis life in hiding, under a series of aliases, constantly looking \nover his shoulder for the team of Israeli agents he was sure were \nlooking for him. He kept in contact with his former Nazi friends, who \nhelped him out by sending him money and keeping him apprised of the \ndetails of the search for him. During his time on the run, he \npreferred to live in rural areas, working on farms and ranches, \nkeeping as low a profile as possible. Although the Israelis never \nfound him, his son Rolf tracked him down in Brazil in 1977. He found \nan old man, poor and broken, but unrepentant of his crimes. The elder \nMengele glossed over his ghastly experiments and instead told his son \nabout all of the sets of twins he had \"saved\" from certain death.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, a legend had grown around the twisted Nazi who had avoided \ncapture for so long. Famous Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal and \nTuviah Friedman had him at the top of their lists and never let the \npublic forget his crimes. According to the legends, Mengele lived in \na jungle laboratory, surrounded by former Nazis and bodyguards, \ncontinuing his plan to refine the master race. The legends could not \nhave been further from the truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJosef Mengele died in 1979 while swimming on a beach in Brazil. He \nwas buried under a false name and his remains were undisturbed until \n1985 when a forensic team determined that the remains were those of \nMengele. Later, DNA tests would confirm the forensic team's finding.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Angel of Death\" -- as he was known to his victims at Auschwitz \n-- eluded capture for over 30 years through a combination of powerful \nfriends, family money and keeping a low profile. He was, by far, the \nmost sought-after Nazi to escape justice after World War Two. He will \nforever be remembered for two things: first, for his twisted \nexperiments on defenseless prisoners, and second, for being \"the one \nthat got away\" to the Nazi hunters who looked for him for decades. \nThat he died poor and alone was of little consolation to his \nsurviving victims, who would have preferred to see him tried and \nhanged.\u0014\n\u0014\nSources\u0014\n\u0014\nBascomb, Neil. \"Hunting Eichmann: How a Band of Survivors and a Young \nSpy Agency Chased Down the World's Most Notorious Nazi.\" Paperback, \nReprint edition, Mariner Books, April 20, 2010.\u0014\nGoni, Uki. \"The Real Odessa: How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals \nto Argentina.\" Paperback, Reprint edition, Granta UK, January 1, 2003.\u0014\nInterview with Rolf Mengele.

He agreed and several months \nlater came back with his findings. Indeed it was a blue blood family \nexcept for one great-grandfather who had been hanged for horse \nstealing. The lady said, Oh, my goodness! This just wont do. In my \nfamily? The ladies in the Womans Club would never let me forget it. \nI need you to change that in some way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe researcher said, Lady, Im sorry, but my work stands on its own \nmerits. Frankly, this happens quite often. I am very thorough in my \nresearch, and I am a man of integrity. The work I do is honest. I \ncannot do what youre asking. She said, Oh, you just dont \nunderstand. I cant have this. Ill give you $5,000 to change this \ninformation.  He said, with some hesitancy, Im sorry, mam. Id \nlike to have the money, but I couldnt live with my conscience and do \nthat.  She insisted all the more vigorously and finally said, All \nright, Ive give you $20,000 to do something with this--something. \nHe thought: $20,000? and said, Well, I cant promise anything, but \nIll try. He set a time to return.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he came back, the lady was very anxious to see what he had done \nto help salvage her family name. This is what he wrote: Grandfather \nBill was in the horse business.

Hidden beneath \nher robe was the future of Christian theology. For she bore with her \na letter to the church in Rome that would spell out, like no other \ndocument ever written, the implications and significance of the \ngospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul had turned to her out of need. While in Corinth he had written a \nletter to the distant Roman church. He could not slip the letter into \nan envelope, lick a couple stamps and drop it into a mailbox; there \nwas no postal service. Instead, he must find someone to carry the \nletter. As F. W. Boreham points out, Paul could write the letter but \nat that time could not carry it. Phoebe could not have written the \nletter, but she could carry it. As Christians we need one another.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat do we know about Phoebe? Not much. Paul mentions her in just one \nplace (Romans 16:1, 2): \"I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a \ndeaconess of the church at Cenchrea [the port of Corinth], that you \nmay receive her in the Lord as befits the saints, and help her in \nwhatever she may require from you, for she has been a helper of many \nand of myself as well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThis day, January 27th, is remembered in honor of Phoebe and two \nother early Christian women, Dorcas and Lydia. All three shared one \npre-eminent quality: they helped others.\u0014\n\u0014\nDorcas was known for her assistance to the poor. So highly regarded \nwas she, that when she died, the saints of Joppa appealed to Peter. \nHe prayed over her and God raised her from the dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nLydia was a seller of purple cloth. After Paul shared the gospel with \nher, Lydia and her entire household were baptized--his first convert \nin Europe. She insisted Luke and Paul stay at her house. Her \nprosperous home became the original church at Philippi.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs these three individuals of the New Testament show, middle class \nwomen were already beginning to play an important role in the \nChristian world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBoreham, F.

    "title": "NAMING MY ANCESTORS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE",
    "words": "Naming my African American ancestors to keep them alive\u0014\nTheir presence brings strength to those still fighting and grieving.\u0014\nby Yolanda Pierce   Christian Century\u0014\nFebruary 2, 2021\u0014\n\u0014\nI include among my ancestors all peoples of African descent \nthroughout the diaspora, everyone caught in the tangled web of \ntransatlantic slavery and its afterlives. (IMAGE  RyanJLane / E+ / \nGetty)\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Gadsden, Alabama, in June 1963, civil rights activist Mary \nHamilton stood silently in a courtroom, having been arrested for a \nnonviolent protest. She refused to answer the prosecutors questions \nuntil he called her Miss Hamilton. She was jailed and held in \ncontempt of court. Eventually her case landed before the Supreme \nCourt, which, in Hamilton v. Alabama, rendered a final decision that \nno court could address Black witnesses differently than it addressed \nWhite ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow and why you call someones name has always mattered deeply to \nBlack people. Growing up, I dared not call any adults I knew by their \nfirst names alone. Before the weighty first names of the older Black \nwomen from my church and neighborhoodSadie, Earnestine, Mildred, \nFrances, Vivian, Beulah, Johnnie Mae, Hattie, Virginia, and \nEttaalways came an honorific or a title. For people at church, we \nused Sister, Brother, Deacon, Elder, Mother, or Pastor. At home, we \nused Auntie, Uncle, Mr., or Mrs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese titles were rooted not in formality but in intimacy. They were \nnot about artifice but about respect, which we were taught was the \nbasis of the relationship between children and adults. They were also \nabout granting dignity in a country that historically afforded very \nlittle to African Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago, I began to incorporate the practice of calling my \nancestors names in my devotional life and also in my work as a \nscholar. I explicitly call the names of the dead, at least the names \nI know and to whom I am tied by flesh and blood. I also call on the \nancestors from whom I am many generations removed and to whom I may \nnot be biologically related. Like many African Americans, I can only \ntrace my family lineage to a certain point, and I have more questions \nthan answers about my actual family tree. So I include among my \nancestors all peoples of African descent throughout the diaspora, \neveryone caught in the tangled web of transatlantic slavery and its \nafterlives.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Christians are deeply afraid of other cultures and religious \ntraditions in which worship of the ancestors is routine. Anti-Black \nsentiment, even within some African American Christian spaces, makes \nmany deeply suspicious of African practices that invoke the presence \nof ancestors. But as a Black woman whose family history has been \ndisrupted by the institution of slavery, I find that naming, \nremembering, and calling upon the ancestors is a profound actnot of \nworship but of veneration. It cultivates in me a deep respect for my \nforebears and awe at their wisdom and strength.\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling upon the ancestors is about memory: remembering how I am \nconnected to a web of humanity that does not end when our bodies have \nreturned to dust. I want to excavate these ancestral memories, to \nlisten as voices speak to my heart across time and distance, to pay \nattention to the stories of people whose voices were silenced when \nthey were alive. I feel the presence of these ancestors encouraging \nme to speak truth in places and spaces they were never allowed to \nenter.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy ancestors include those exiled by slavery, war, and genocide, \nforever seeking but never finding a place that feels like home. My \nancestors include those who worshiped the sun, the moon, or the earth \nitself, pouring out libations in praise and awe of creations beauty. \nMy ancestors include those whose bodies now rest on the bottom of the \nAtlantic Ocean, not having survived the perilous journey to the New \nWorld. My ancestors include those who fought their chains and those \nwho stoically endured theirs. Some of them arrived in 1619, when some \n20 or more Africans arrived at Point Comfort, Virginiabrought to \nthis land as human beings only to die as chattel slaves. Whoever they \nwere, I am linked to them. I want to remember them, and I want to \nhonor them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI often begin my classes on African American religious history with a \nlist of namesbut not of the great people of the Christian tradition \nor the churches and institutions that have contributed to this legacy \nof faith. I begin, rather, with a list of the names of the cargo \nships used to transport enslaved African people from the shores of \none continent to the other. I read the names of these ships, \nsometimes with the names of the ship captains and in concert with the \nentity that sponsored each voyage.\u0014\n\u0014\nI do this so my students will know that many of those who were \nenslaved first encountered the symbol of the cross when they saw it \nflying on the flag of the ship that carried them to enslavement. My \nstudents need to know that there was a Portuguese slavers ship named \nBom Jesus do Triunfo and a Spanish slavers named Jesus y Espiritu \nSantoamong many othersthat sailed with the explicit purpose of \nenslaving other human beings.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese are the names that history records and remembers: captains, \nslave owners, financial companies, churches, and denominations that \nearned their wealth by trafficking African bodies. There are no \nrecords of the names of those whose bones now litter the ocean, some \nchoosing to jump to their deaths in acts of defiance, others thrown \noverboard when ill or dead, treated like debris. To call on the names \nof my ancestors is to refuse to forget the horror they faced. To \nspeak their names is to keep them alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a graduate student, I read Thomas Jeffersons Notes on the State \nof Virginia for the first time. In the section in which Jefferson \ndelineates his perception of the differences between enslaved persons \nand White citizens, he writes that the griefs of members of the Negro \nrace are transient. Their afflictions, he claims, which render it \ndoubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, \nare less felt, and sooner forgotten with them.        \u0014\n\u0014\nI closed the book after reading those words. It was a cold and snowy \nwinter day, typical for Ithaca, New York, and I sat and stared out \nthe window of the library for a long time. I was not surprised by \nJeffersons racist words; I knew too much about the lives and history \nof the Founding Fathers of this nation to ever be shocked by their \nheinous acts and unmitigated support for the brutality of \nenslavement. But his words about grief and transience took me \nimmediately to a place of personal loss, a place from which Id long \ntried to escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am sitting at my grandmothers funeral, thinking about the phone \ncall that upended my world. The all-too-quick death. The train ride \nback to New York City. My entire world transformed overnight. I am \nunable to feel the grief of the moment, exhausted from the unending \ntasks that fall on my shoulders. There is no one else left; they are \nall gone. I am all she had left, the last of this family line. I \ncannot cry because I fear that if I were to begin, I would never stop.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so I sit in the front row of the church, a place I have known for \nyears, surrounded by people I have not seen since I finished high \nschool, and I am frozen in time. I am looking at the funeral program \nin my hand, reading an obituary I scarcely remember writing and \nstaring at a picture that I do not ever remember seeing. And while \nthe eulogist is preaching this final sermon, he calls my \ngrandmothers name. I look up because he has called her Virginia.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy grandmothers name is Vivian.\u0014\n\u0014\nI look swiftly to my right and to my left, a bit frantic. Did anyone \nelse hear him call my grandmother by the wrong name? I stare, once \nagain, at the program I have in my hand and the obituary I wrote \nmyself, to confirm that her name is printed correctly. Yes, her whole \nbeautiful name is there. I shake my head, determined to clear a mind \nthat I know is clouded with grief. Maybe I heard him wrong. There is \nno way that he said the wrong name. There is no way that you get \nsomething like that wrong at this time and in this place.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then the minister repeats himself. Four times he calls what he \nbelieves is the right name, and four times he fails. Four times he \ncalls the name of some strong southern womanVirginiawho is surely \nsomeone elses beloved grandmother. But it is not the name of the one \nI know and love.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the funeral, I attempt, through heaving sobs, to explain to \nanyone who will listen that the preacher never said the right name. \nOnly then do I truly begin to grieve the death of the woman who \nraised me and loved me. Kindhearted people attempt to explain to me \nthat the preacher simply made a mistake, that he certainly meant no \npersonal disrespect to me or my grandmother. I am left unable to \nexplain in rational terms why this second blow, calling my \ngrandmother by the wrong name, wounds me as deeply as the news of her \ndeath.        \u0014\n\u0014\nRemembering my grandmothers funeral in that library in Ithaca, New \nYork, I sat with the absurdity of Jeffersons idea that grief for \nBlack people is transient. And I thought of how too many pastors, \nparticularly African American pastors, face the reality of \nfuneralizing the very young: those who died violently, those whose \nlives were cut short by the ravages of disease, those who died at the \nhands of those sworn to protect them. How do you comfort a grieving \nBlack mother whose only son has been killed by the police? What words \ndo you offer a community when the scourge of gun violence kills \nelementary school children walking home in the middle of the \nafternoon? What can you say to Black parents whose greatest fear is \nthat their child will not live long enough to graduate from high \nschool?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI wondered if we should bring back the tradition of the mourning \nwomen of Jeremiah 9:17: call for the mourning women, that they may \ncome; And send for skillful wailing women, that they may come. In \nthe biblical context, women worked as professional mourners, \nparticularly for the wealthy. And throughout world history, in almost \nevery religion and culture, women have served as transmitters of \nlament.\u0014\n\u0014\nBlack women, in particular, have a reservoir of pain and tears from \nwhich to draw. In our capacity as mourning women, we have \ngenerations of trauma from which to pull. Our laments are both \ncorporate and personal, but there is often no safe space in which to \nshare our pain. The larger world believes that Black women are so \naccustomed to tragedyimpervious even to physical painthat our \npersonal losses barely register with other people.\u0014\n\u0014\nI  have been grieving my whole life. I keep wondering when the pain \nof so much loss will stop. I keep asking myself when my decades of \ngrief will finally come to an end. When will the hole and empty space \nin my heart ever be filled? The clichs of my faith provide little \ncomfort. God did not need another flower in the garden. God did not \nneed another angel in heaven. No good came out of my loss, and it was \nfar more than I could bear.        \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so I sit with the stark reality that you cannot escape grief. \nGrief will come for you and change your entire world. Grief will \nchange your name, change your address, and change your sense of who \nyou are. No accomplishment, no title, no honorific, no degree will \nalter the reality of my identity as a motherless child.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a ritual in some churches that commemorate Holy Saturday, \nusually a late evening service. The parishioners arrive quietly, and \nthe person leading the service blows out any candles that may be lit \nand turns off all the lights in the building. The congregation sits \ntogether for several hours, waiting, in silence but with great \nexpectation, for the coming dawn. Sometimes there is an empty coffin \npresent at the altar.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis coffin is the tomb of parents mourning the deaths of their \nmurdered children, with no hope that justice will prevail. It is the \ntomb of families at the borders who must choose between uncertain \nlife or inevitable death. It is the tomb of those holding a vigil at \na loved ones bed in hospice. It is the tomb of a mother who must \nchoose between feeding her babies or paying the rent. It is the tomb \nof barren wombs, lack of love and healthy touch, and few choices for \nthe future. This coffin is the place where hope unborn has \ndied.        \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a powerful worship experience to simply sit with death and all \nof its various representations: doubt, fear, loneliness, disbelief, \nand weariness. You know that the dawn will come, that the lights will \nbe turned back on and the candles relit. Sitting in that silence \nprepares your heart for a resurrection and a rebirth. Even if that \nhope feels long delayed.\u0014\n\u0014\nYolanda Pierce\u0014\nYolanda Pierce is associate professor of African American religion \nand literature at Princeton Theological Seminary.

    "title": "NO MERE PRISONER SWAP",
    "words": "The Story of Barabbas Is No Mere Prisoner Swap\u0014\nMuch more was at stake than a criminals fate or a crowds preference.\u0014\nANDREW WILSON   MARCH 16, 2021  CHRISTIANITY TODAY\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the great marvels of Scripture is the way minor characters \nembody an entire narrative. The Bible is full of obscure individuals \nabout whom we know little besides their names. Yet many of them, \ninstead of shuffling on and off the stage to advance the story (like \nthey would in Homer or Shakespeare), become living examples of the \nstory itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most dramatic examples, for my money, occur in the crucifixion \nstory. Think, for instance, of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross, as \nChrist told his disciples they would (Mark 15:21). Or the criminal \ncrucified next to Jesus who receives forgiveness at the last minute, \nbecoming the archetypal deathbed conversion (Luke 23:3943). Or the \nRoman centurion who supervises the execution and then exclaims, on \nbehalf of billions of Gentiles in the centuries to come, Surely this \nman was the Son of God! (Mark 15:39).\u0014\n\u0014\nBut my favorite example is Barabbas. At one level, his is a simple \nstory of exchange. Barabbas is due to die for his sins, and he \ndeserves to. Yet without doing anything to merit mercy, he discovers \nthat Jesus is going to die instead. Having awoken on Friday morning \nexpecting nothing but a slow, horrible death, by evening he is home \nwith his family to celebrate the Sabbath. We are clearly intended to \nsee ourselves in this man: destined for death but finding freedom and \nlife through the death of another.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we reflect for a moment, it becomes clear this is not merely an \nexchange, but a substitution. Jesus doesnt just die instead of \nBarabbas; he dies in his place as his substitute, his representative. \nWe know this becauseand this is often missedBarabbas and Jesus \nstand accused of the same crime: sedition, insurrection, treason. \nBarabbas is a revolutionary who has directly challenged Roman rule \n(Luke 23:1819). And from a Roman point of view, Jesus claim to be \nking of the Jews poses a threat to Caesar. Few examples of \nsubstitutionary atonement in Scripture are clearer than Jesus, the \ninnocent man, taking the penalty so that none remains for the guilty \nBarabbas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is also an Exodus dimension here. The Gospels point out that \nfreeing prisoners is a Passover custom. In other words, it happens in \nhonor of the night when Pharaohs firstborn son died so that Gods \nfirstborn son (Israel) could be released. But the Gospels raise a \nsubtle question: Which of these two accused men is really Gods \nfirstborn son? The one whose name, Bar-abbas, means son of the \nfather? Or the one claiming to be the Son of God? And is Gods Son \nplaying the part of Israel, escaping to freedomor that of the \nPassover lamb, shedding his blood to liberate others?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother layer to the story is the question of how Israel should \nrespond to Roman rule. Barabbas represents the way of war, strength, \nand violent insurrection. Jesus represents the way of peace, \ninnocence, and sacrifice. When Pilate asks the crowd for their \npreference, this is the point at issue. And Jerusalem chooses the way \nof violenceNo, not him! Give us Barabbas! (John 18:40)as Jesus \ntearfully predicted it would (Luke 19:4144). But the Prince of Peace \nwill enjoy vindicationnot least through the mouths of Roman \nsoldiers, the men of violence par excellence (Matt. 27:54; Luke \n23:47).\u0014\n\u0014\nFor a final lens on the Barabbas story, consider the Day of \nAtonement. On this crucial day in the Jewish year, the high priest \nwould cast lots over two goats. One became the sacrificial goat, \nwhose blood was spilled. The other became the scapegoat, who was \nreleased from the camp into the wilderness. The parallels with the \nBarabbas story are fascinatingone dies while the other is \nreleasednot least because it was the chief priests who wanted \nBarabbas released and Jesus killed (Mark 15:11). When, like a priest \nscrutinizing a sacrificial animal, Pilate explains that he has \nexamined Jesus and found him faultless (Luke 23:14), the Levitical \nechoes grow louder still.\u0014\n\u0014\nBarabbas was a revolutionary and a murderer. He has no right to be \nremembered at all, let alone held up as an example of divine grace. \nBut that is the whole point. Neither do I, and Christ died for me \nanyway. And through his substitution, I become a Bar-abbas myself: a \nson of the Father.\u0014\n\u0014\nAndrew Wilson is teaching pastor at Kings Church London\u0014",

    "title": "NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST -- MOVIE \"NOMADLAND\"",
    "words": "Nomadland\u0014\nby Michael Parnell | Apr 30, 2021 \u0014\n\u0014\nFrances McDormand in Nomadland\u0014\n\u0014\nAn ominous statement about the town of Empire, Nevada, opens the \nfilm, Nomadland.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt says the town lived because of the U.S. gypsum plant. The plant \nclosed and, within a couple of years, the towns ZIP code was \ndiscontinued.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe then meet Fern (Frances McDormand). She is at her storage unit, \npicking out things to take. Loading them into an old Ford van, she \nleaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is Christmas. As she drives, Fern sings a Christmas carol.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe arrives at an RV site and tells the clerk she is there for \nAmazon. Then, we see her working in the warehouse.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe meets people there, especially Linda May (real name). Linda \nbecomes Ferns friend and mentor in this new life of being a nomad. \nFern joins a culture of people who have no fixed address.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe bristles at the description of being homeless, telling someone \nshe is not homeless, just houseless. The road is her home.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the story progresses, we see Fern arrive at the Rubber Tramp \nRendezvous (RTR). This is a real life gathering of nomads hosted by \nBob Wells (also his real name).\u0014\n\u0014\nBob puts on this gathering to help those who are living this life \nfind ways to make it from day to day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Fern gains confidence being at RTR, she starts to express herself \nto those there. Relationships are forged. Community is found.\u0014\n\u0014\nFern is a keep-to-herself person, but she finds this community as \nsomething needed in her life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the friends she finds is Swankie (Charlene Swankie). When a \ntire goes down on Ferns van, she turns to Swankie for help. As time \npasses, Swankie tells Fern that she was diagnosed with brain cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe thought of spending any more days in the hospital was one she \ncould not stand. Therefore, she is going to spend her days seeing the \nbeauty around her. In time, Swankie leaves Fern to drive to Alaska \nfor one last journey.\u0014\n\u0014\nBob tells Fern his reason for doing what he does. Speaking about the \ndeath of his eldest son, Bob says he didnt know why he was allowed \nto remain. He decided his reason for being was tied to helping others \nwho are nomads.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a philosophy, better still, a spirituality, to Bob. He \nspeaks of the people he has met on the road  how he never gives a \nfinal good-bye to anyone but tells them that he will see them down \nthe road.\u0014\n\u0014\nFern discusses the death of her husband, how she tried to stay in \nEmpire after his death and the death of the town. But she had to \nleave.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe speaks of her continuing to live in Empire after her husbands \ndeath. Staying there allowed him to continue to exist.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer father told her that what is remembered lives. She realized she \nmight have spent too much time remembering.\u0014\n\u0014\nNomadland won best picture at this years Oscars. It has won \nseveral other awards as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nWritten and directed by Chloe Zhao, a Chinese filmmaker, it is as \nAmerican a story as one can find  a mirror opposite of the American \nDream.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is an American Dream unlike what we have been told is the correct \nversion. For the characters in the film, the dream of America is the \nroad to another place to visit and explore.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I watched this movie and thought about it, I could not help but \nthink of all these people out on the road. People that live day to \nday, many living with pain and carrying deep scars that life imposed \nupon them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI wondered, Where is the church?\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the church continues to lose its credibility, it is a story like \nthis one that should be calling to us.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do we find ways to minister to people who are on the road \ncontinuously but still need love and help when facing the stings and \narrows of outrageous fortune?\u0014\n\u0014\nWill we, the church, cling to our past ways of being? Or will we move \nout into the highways and hedges of our land to meet people where \nthey are? Can we find ways to let the love of Jesus come through us \nto those that wander?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor not all that wander are lost. They are just looking for their \nplace.\u0014",

    "title": "NOTES ON THE COVENANTS--OLD AND NEW",
    "words": "Every single king in Israel (the northern tribes) followed the \npattern of the first king, Jeroboam son of Nebat, and worshiped \nidols. The kings of Judah (the southern tribes) had a more mixed \nrecord, for some were faithful to the Lord, though even the best of \nthem failed to do all the Lord commanded.\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob never possessed the land, (Gen. 12) Abraham \nfound it agonizingly difficult to have even one child! (Gen. 12)\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Genesis ends, Israel was in the wrong land (Egypt), there were \nonly about 70 Israelites (when God promised they would be as many as \nthe stars of the sky), and there was certainly not universal blessing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord entered into a covenant with Israel, choosing them as his \nspecial people (cf. Exodus 1924), . becoming his special possession \nand a kingdom of priests if they followed the Lords instructions \n(Exod 19:56).  If Israel obeyed the covenant stipulations, they \nwould be blessed; but if they transgressed what the Lord commanded, \nthey would experience the curses of the covenant (Leviticus 26, \nDeuteronomy 2628). Ultimately, the old covenant was a failure. The \nsacrifices didnt cleanse the conscience of sin and provide free \naccess to God, nor did the old covenant inscribe the law on the \nheart. Instead of moving forward, Israel slipped backward. We read in \nNumbers how the people failed to follow the Lords instructions. They \nwere in that sense like Adam in paradise. Instead of trusting and \nobeying the Lord, they turned toward idols so that the Lord unleashed \ntheir enemies upon them. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the end of the day both Israel and Judah gave themselves over to \nsin, and thus both kingdoms experienced the curses of the covenant. \nThe kingdom was not realized through the old covenant since both \nIsrael and Judah did not and could not keep the prescriptions of the \ncovenant. There will be a new covenant (Jer 31:3134; Ezek 36:2627). \nThe Lord will pour out his Spirit on his people, and a new age of \nsalvation will arise. The new covenant (Jer. 31:31) is better than \nthe old.\u0014\n\u0014\nSolomon recapitulated the story we have seen over and over again. He \nfollowed the pattern of Adam in the garden, Israel in Canaan, and \nSaul as king. He ceased to trust in the Lord and turned to idols.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael was exiled to Assyria in 722 BC and Judah was exile to Babylon \nin 586 BC.\u0014\nIsrael returned from exile in 536 BC, and yet the promises of a new \ncovenant, a new creation, and the coming kingdom were not realized.\u0014",

    "title": "NERO UNLEASHED FIRST REIGN OF TERROR",
    "words": "Nero Unleashed First Wave of Terror\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\nMay 3, 2010\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first state-sponsored terror against Christians in the Roman \nEmpire came at the order of one of the most debased of all emperors: \nNero. Tacitus, the Roman historian, in Book XV of his Annals, gives a \nlengthy account of Nero's debaucheries and cruelties. These led the \nRomans to distrust him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo despised was Nero that when Rome caught fire, on this day, July \n19, 64, popular opinion attributed the catastrophe to him. Many \ncitizens perished in the flames. The fire was aggravated by rowdies \nwho threw firebrands into untouched houses, claiming they had been \nordered to do so. In the public mind, those orders came from Nero. A \nrumor spread that Nero had appeared on a stage during the catastrophe \nand sung a song \"comparing present misfortunes with the calamities of \nantiquity,\" especially Troy.\u0014\n\u0014\nNero tried to counter this downturn in his \"public approval ratings\" \nby throwing open his own resources to the homeless. He sponsored a \nnumber of religious activities designed to show himself innocent. \nNothing worked. And so he determined to find scapegoats. He fastened \nupon the Christians as most suitable for his diabolical purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few who admitted their faith were tortured until they revealed the \nnames of others. Beginning a few weeks after the fire, the city was \nthe scene of every imaginable torment. And not Rome only, for \npersecution spread throughout the empire. But in the capital Nero \nheld nightly spectacles in which every torture was applied to the \nsuffering saints.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome were burned alive. Others were sewn into the skins of wild \nanimals and given to dogs to tear. Still others were crucified. \nMartyrs were exhibited in the circus with Nero presiding, dressed as \na charioteer. The wicked emperor threw open his own gardens to more \nsuch spectacles. So many Christians died so brutally that public \nsympathy swung in their favor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people realized that Christians were being put to death not for \nstarting the fire but to cover Nero's crimes and to sate his appetite \nfor cruelty. Compassion for the meek followers of Jesus, whose \nblameless conduct was apparent to many, led to a new wave of \nconversions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who almost certainly perished in Nero's fury in Rome was \nthe apostle Peter. Paul is thought to have been executed a few years \nlater. Others who were martyred elsewhere in the empire were the \nBishop of Damascus and a man mentioned in scripture: Joseph called \nBarsabas. Paul's fellow minister, Trophimus, is also said to have \nperished in this outpouring of hostility as did many others whose \nnames we do not know. Christ had taught that as men persecuted him so \nthey would persecute his followers. A servant is not above his master.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Will. Caesar and Christ.

(Photo: Mitch Randall)\u0014\n\u0014\nI am a citizen of the Muscogee Creek Nation whose ancestors lived \npeacefully on the lands of present-day Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee \nfor centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile most everyone knows me as Mitch Randall, my other name was \ngiven to me by a Comanche Chief: NUMUKUTSU, which translates into \nBuffalo.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am the descendent of warriors, hunters and dancers. My ancestors \nwalked the Trail of Tears and were forced to live on reservation \nlands within the Indian Territory of present-day Oklahoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy Indigenous family settled in Broken Arrow, living on the brown \nside of the tracks. I am a son of the Deer Clan, gifted with the \nstrength and swiftness of those who came before me. My skin is brown, \nand my heart is red.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is because of who I am  not what I have done  that I share this \nstory.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the turn of the 20th century, Muscogee Creek children Eloise \nChilders and her sister, Ruby, were taken from their homes. The \nlittle girls were born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in what was \npreviously identified as Indian Territory.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls were relocated to the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, \nover 130 miles northwest of their family and friends back in Broken \nArrow near the Oklahoma-Kansas border. Chilocco was modelled on \nRichard Henry Pratts school in Carlisle.\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon arriving at Chilocco, the girls were told to strip down for a \nthorough scrubbing. After the bath, they were taken into a room where \ntheir long black hair was cut. It was then styled to reflect a more \ncivilized and Christian style, which meant white.\u0014\n\u0014\nNative Americans view their hair as sacred. So, when the girls left \nthe room after their cut and style, they looked more like the \nstrangers who bathed them than their own parents back home in Broken \nArrow.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the bath and haircuts, the girls were not given back their \nIndigenous clothing of smooth leather and soft ribbons and feathers. \nIn their place, a scratchy wool military-like uniform covered every \ninch of their small frames.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sisters fell asleep that night in a dark dormitory with other \nIndigenous children from different tribes that spoke unfamiliar \nlanguages. As they closed their eyes to discover their dreams, tears \nstreamed down their cheeks, afraid of their new surroundings and \nmissing home.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls woke the next morning to the busy sounds of children \npreparing for breakfast and what many were calling school. After \nthe girls walked to the dining hall to have their breakfast, they \nwere marched to school rooms where a stern white-faced woman greeted \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls sheepishly smiled and said, Hensci, the traditional \ngreeting in Muscogee Creek. The stern-faced woman responded, Good \nmorning, and then uttered a lot of other words they did not \nunderstand.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn older student who spoke Muscogee Creek later informed the girls, \nThey do not like us using our language. They want us to use their \nlanguage. They say it is better than ours. If we do not learn to use \nit, we get whipped.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey had been told that coming to Chilocco and learning the ways of \nthe white man would be good. Their parents told them to study hard so \nthey could have a better life.  No one mentioned the possibility of \nwhippings for speaking their Native tongue.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the next several years, the girls learned the ways of white \nculture, adopting their hairstyles, wearing their clothes and \nspeaking their language.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery now and again, they would sneak down to the pond away from the \ncampus to speak Muscogee Creek and recall stories of home. There were \nonly a few times they were caught, which, just as the other student \npromised, ended in whippings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe campus of Chilocco Indian Agricultural School in northern \nOklahoma. (Photo: Mitch Randall)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most grievous moments came on Sunday mornings when the girls were \nmarched to a small chapel where a man in a black robe met them. He \nspoke about a man called Jesus who wanted them to be good Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom what the girls could figure out, being a good Christian meant \nobeying their teachers, learning their lessons and following the ways \nof the white man.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, when the stories of Jesus were told, Eloise and Ruby thought \nthat Jesus sounded more like their ancestors than the white man \ntelling the story. The girls assumed this was another white riddle \nthey needed to figure out.\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch attendance was recorded, so their teachers knew when they \nskipped. One Sunday they went to the pond, and they were welcomed \nback to the dorms by the stern-faced woman holding a whip. They knew \nwhat would come next.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls finally aged out of Chilocco after several years, returning \nto Broken Arrow much different than when they left. They returned \nknowing the white mans ways, but never fully understanding them.\u0014\n\u0014\nEloise and Ruby grew up to have children of their own, but both swore \nan oath never to send their children to Chilocco.\u0014\n\u0014\nPratts doctrine of killing the Indian to save the man was faulty \nfrom the start and unsuccessful in the end.  No strategy  even one \nrooted in the violent discipline of children  could ever truly kill \nthe person inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nEloise ended up marrying a Muscogee Creek man by the name of Mitchell \nwho possessed a vivid imagination and humorous personality. He was a \ngreat baseball player, playing in the Indian leagues all around \nEastern Oklahoma.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple had a daughter named Okema who stayed with them throughout \nher childhood, never having to suffer the fate of missing family and \nbeing forced to conform.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe married a white man by the name of Lester and had a son named \nRodney. He married Jennifer and they had two boys, Mitch and Tyler.\u0014\n\u0014\nI share this story  of my great-grandmother Eloise  to personalize \nthe tragic history that began with Columbus arrival in 1492.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Pratt Doctrine encapsulates so much of the erroneous thinking \nthat informed European actions toward Indigenous peoples of North \nAmerica that began 529 years ago this month.\u0014\n\u0014\nEditors note: This article is the second in a three-part series.\u0014",

Cartledge | Mar 30, 2022  GOOD NEWS MEDIA\u0014\n\u0014\nArchaeologists working at Mount Ebal, a part of ancient Israel that \nis near Nablus in what is now the occupied West Bank, are touting a \nnew discovery that  if authenticated  could bring real excitement \nto the study of ancient paleography and perhaps even Israels history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether their considerable claims hold up is yet to be seen.\u0014\n\u0014\nMount Ebal, which sits adjacent to Mount Gerizim, appears in \nDeuteronomy 11 and 27 as a place where Moses reportedly instructed \nthe Israelites to gather and recite a string of curses against \nthemselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter sharply reminding the people that obedience would lead to \nblessing and disobedience would lead to cursing, the account has \nMoses telling the people to set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and \nset the curse on Mount Ebal (Deut. 11:29-30).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Israelites were to build an altar and set up stones on Mount \nEbal, then cover the stones with plaster and write the law on them \n(Deut. 27:1-3). After dividing the tribes between the two mountains, \nthey were to read out a series of 12 curses for specific acts of \ndisobedience, and all the people were to shout Amen! (Deut. \n27:11-26).\u0014\n\u0014\nAdam Zertal excavated the top of Mount Ebal from 1982 to 1986, \nuncovering a large rectangular stone structure built over an older \nand smaller circular structure. Zertal identified the structure as an \naltar, dating the initial structures to about 1250 BCE, as the Late \nBronze II period was giving way to Iron Age I, generally dated to \nabout 1,200-1,000 BCE.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe cultic site remained active for about a century, but it was \ndecommissioned and ritually covered with a large mound of stones \naround 1140 BCE, about the same time another cultic site at Shiloh \nappears to have been constructed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome archaeologists interpret the site differently, regarding it as a \nwatchtower, a farm structure, or perhaps a cultic site but not \nclearly an altar.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore conservative scholars favor the belief that it is not only an \naltar, but the one reportedly built by Joshua in obedience to Moses \ninstructions (Josh. 8:30-35).\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, what of the big discovery? Zertal thoroughly excavated the site, \nbut left behind three piles of dirt and debris, known as dumps. \nArchaeologists associated with the Associates for Biblical Research \nhave been digging through the dumps and sifting the material.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile doing so, they found a small strip of lead, less than one inch \nby two inches, that had been inscribed on one side and then folded \ninto a roughly one-inch square.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the tablets age and brittle nature, they could not unfold \nit without damage, so they partnered with scientists in the Czech \nRepublic to produce thousands of computed tomography images in an \nattempt to identify inscribed letters on the inside.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese were painstakingly transcribed, and two consulting epigraphers \n(specialists in ancient scripts) identified the text as a \nproto-alphabetic script of 40 characters that they interpret as a \nrepetitive curse:\u0014\n\u0014\nCursed, cursed, cursed, cursed by the God YHW.\u0014\nYou will die cursed.\u0014\nCursed you will die.\u0014\nCursed by YHW  cursed, cursed, cursed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe researchers interpret the text as a legal document pronouncing a \ncurse, and they argue that it supports the identity of the oldest \nparts of the structure as Joshuas altar and even the covenant \nceremony itself.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the moment, we have only a press release and an announcement made \nby Scott Stripling, Director of Excavations for the Associates for \nBiblical Research to go on. The findings have yet to be published and \npeer reviewed, though publication is promised for later in the year.\u0014\n\u0014\nStripling claims that the tablet dates to the Late Bronze II, which \nwould push the date of the oldest proto-alphabetic inscription \nbearing the name YHW (an abbreviated form of Yahweh) back 200 years \nor more.\u0014\n\u0014\nPreviously, the oldest example of proto-Hebrew inscriptions \ncontaining the name YHWH were from the eight century BCE, on the \nMoabite Stone and on pottery inscriptions from Kuntillet Ajrud.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe name YHW is known from two Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions \ndating as far back as the 13th and 14th century, when it is \nassociated with a nomadic people group called the Shashu, who lived \nin the Transjordan, in the region of Edom and Moab.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe relationship between the Shasu and the early Israelites is \nunclear.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are good reasons to approach the interpretation of the find \nwith some skepticism. The small tablet, known as a defixio, was not \nfound in situ, but recovered from a dump of mixed materials. It could \nhave been ceremonially buried there long after the original structure \nwas built.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilar curse tablets made of lead are fairly common, but typically \nfrom the much later Roman and Medieval periods.\u0014\n\u0014\nStripling also announced his claims without showing any of the \nevidence other than a picture of the folded tablet and a drawing \n(that appears all too perfect) of the letters he claims spell YHW.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne should be aware that the Associates for Biblical Research \norganization has an unabashed bias, identifying itself on its website \nas A Christian Apologetics Ministry Dedicated to Demonstrating the \nHistorical Reliability of the Bible through Archaeological and \nBiblical Research.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is very much part of their agenda, then, to look for evidence \npointing to an early date for the Exodus as well as an early date for \nliteracy, and to interpret things in that direction. In a video press \nconference on the website, Stripling argues that the tablet is \nevidence that the Israelites were not only present at Mount Ebal \nduring the Late Bronze Age, but that writing was common and literacy \nwidespread.\u0014\n\u0014\nCritical scholars contend that writing remained in a very primitive \nstage until centuries later, and that most of the Hebrew Bible, \nincluding writings attributed to Moses, were actually written as late \nas the Persian period.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tablet in question, assuming the transcription basted on CT scans \nis accurate, is written with very early proto-alphabetic letters \ncharacteristic of the Late Bronze and early Iron I period.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt seems unlikely that a much later writer would have used that \nscript unless it was remembered and used for ceremonial curses.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, both the letters and the words (if interpreted correctly) were \nshared by several ancient Semitic languages: nothing about it is \nunique to Hebrew.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the reading and the dating of the tablet is accepted as authentic, \nit would be quite interesting, and I would be happy for it, but it \nstill would not support the many claims Stripling made.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly letter forms showed considerable variability as the alphabet \nemerged, and when they are allowed to see the evidence, other \nepigraphers may disagree with the initial researchers identification \nof the letters.\u0014\n\u0014\nEpigraphy is a tricky business, especially when trying to interpret \nan inscription hidden inside a folded lead strip.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat one sees as a yod, another may interpret as a kaf, for example.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if the interpretation is correct, the existence of a very simple \nstatement in which 30 of the 40 letters are used to spell cursed 10 \ntimes leaves only 10 additional letters.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat does not prove that literacy was common or that the scribe who \nwrote it could have written the entire Hebrew Bible, as Stripling \nclaimed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBased on the epigraphers presentation of the three letters for YHW, \nthey are reading the inscription from left to right, opposite of the \nway Hebrew is normally written. This would not be unusual for early \nperiods, before scribes settled on a right to left direction.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt does open the possibility, though, of a different interpretation \nif the letters were read from right to left, or in conjunction with \nother letters nearby.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this point, images of the inscription remain privy to the initial \nresearchers, so its current analysis comes only from scholars who \nwant to prove that Hebrew writing dates to an early period, and that \nthe tablet is evidence that Joshua and the Israelites were on Mount \nEbal in the Late Bronze Age.\u0014\n\u0014\nStripling has promised the publication of an article before the end \nof the year, and I am looking forward to seeing imagery of the script \nitself, and to seeing how other experts in the field interpret the \ntext.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristopher Rollston, perhaps the most noted epigrapher of our day, \nhas expressed skepticism that the initial translation will stand.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinding an inscribed curse tablet on a mountain traditionally \nassociated with cursing should not come as a surprise. Finding one \ndating to that early period, however, could have real significance \nfor our understanding of early Israelite history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell see.\u0014\n\u0014\nTony Cartledge headshot\u0014\nTony W.

    "title": "NESTORIUS, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE",
    "words": "NESTORIUS, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE\u0014\n \u0014\nIn 428 the see of Constantinople became empty through the death of \nits bishop. Church and secular powers were unable to agree on a \nsuccessor. They appealed to Emperor Theodosius II to make the \ndecision and he chose Nestorius, a monk well-known for his preaching. \nNestorius was consecrated bishop of Constantinople on this day 10 \nApril 428. A contentious figure, he held the position only a few \nyears. Declared a heretic, he was deposed, and ultimately banished to \nthe Egyptian desert.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe visible reason for his downfall was that Nestorius was reluctant \nto accept the popular designation of Mary as Mother of God. He \npointed out that the apostles and early church fathers never employed \nthe term. Jesus had a human nature, Nestorius said, as well as his \nGod nature. Jesuss physical body carried out his human behaviors and \nactions, and suffered those things that humans suffer, including \ndeath. To say Mary was Mother of God was to say God had once been a \nfew hours oldwhereas God exists from eternity past and cannot die. \nGod is not a baby two or three months old, he argued.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo protect Christs divinity, Nestorius argued that the Godhead must \nhave joined with the human body rather as if a man entered a tent or \nput on clothes. Nestorius remained fully convinced that Jesus Christ \nhas two natures, the human and the divine (as all orthodox Christians \nbelieve), but he spoke of the Son of Mary and the Son of God in a \nmanner that led some critics to think he was speaking of two sons, \ntwo persons. And his insistence on the importance of the manhood of \nChrist led others to suspect him of Arianism. Arians taught that \nChrist was a created being, not truly divine.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpponents had some justification for suspicion. Arians had controlled \nthe see of Constantinople for more than forty years during the fourth \ncentury. Aggravating the situation was Nestoriuss abrasive \npersonality and his failure to give a thoughtful explanation of his \nposition to Rome when the pope asked. Alexandrias patriarch, Cyril, \nwas a despotic man who had ascended to his see amid bloodshed and \ncared little for fair play as long as his theology triumphed. Rome \nand Alexandria already resented the influence of the upstart see at \nConstantinople and worked in collusion to take Nestorius down. \u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius and Cyril employed terms differently; therefore each \nthought the other was making heretical statements when in actuality \ntheir positions were similar. Cyril issued twelve anathemas against \nNestorius. Nestorius anathemized him back. With no reconciliation in \nsight, Theodosius summoned a council to Ephesus to settle the matter \nand appointed John of Antioch to head it. Cyril arrived first and \ntook control. He and his allies deposed Nestorius before the latters \nSyrian supporters could reach the site. When John arrived, he held a \nrival council. \u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius always claimed Cyril misrepresented his statements or took \nthem out of context. In exile, he wrote a lengthy defense that was \nrediscovered in the nineteenth century. Theologians who have studied \nthis defense and Nestorius few surviving sermons say that his \nopinions dont seem to have been heretical. Nestorius himself \naccepted the conclusions of the Council of Chalcedon, held in 451, \nwhich, among other things, addressed concerns about Christs being, \u0014\n\u0014\nWe . . .  confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, at once \ncomplete in manhood, truly God and truly man, consisting of a \nreasonable soul and body; of one substance with the Father as regards \nhis Godhead, of one substance with us as regards his manhood ...\u0014\n\u0014\nThe squabble had long-lasting effects. Driven out, Nestoriuss \nfollowers formed their own widespread church. For close to a thousand \nyears this movement flourished in Persia, Arabia, India, Tibet, \nMalabar, Turkostan, Cyprus, and even for a time in China. Nestorians \nsurvive to this day, although they never recovered from the Mongol \ninvasions and from the spread of Islam.\u0014",

    "words": "NLEMVOS FAITH AND SKILL PRODUCED PRAISEWORTHY RESULTS IN THE CONGO\u0014\n\u0014\nMantantu Dundulu was a hero in everyday life and in the kingdom of \nChrist. Reared by an uncle, who was a tribal chief (the boys father \nwas not in the picture for reasons not entirely clear), he fiercely \nprotected his three sisters. In 1881, as a young man of about eleven, \nhe became the personal assistant of Baptist missionary William Holman \nBentley.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis position changed his life in ways he could hardly have \nanticipated. For starters, about a year after Mantantu entered \nBentleys employ, on this day, 30 April, 1882, he declared that he \nhad become a Christianpossibly the first Protestant convert to \nChristianity in the Congo. As his people still worshiped fetishes and \npracticed demonic rituals, he was largely cut off from them. Bentley \ngave him a new name, Nlemvo, meaning Obedient. His former names had \nmeant sorrow and stupid. When he was thirteen, he helped to \nrescue and carry a battered man who was to be burned to death for \nwitchcraft.\u0014\n\u0014\nBentley taught Nlemvo to read English. His progress was rapid and, \nbecause he was fluent in the Kikongo language, he became the \nmissionarys close aide in preparing a dictionary and in translating \nthe New Testament and portions of the old into that language. By \n1884, the dictionary was nearing completion and Bentley returned to \nBritain to see it through press, taking fourteen-year-old Nlemvo with \nhim to help with the finishing touches. Visiting European opened \nNlemvos eyes to feats of engineering and culture he had not guessed \npossible. He was also present at Bentleys marriage to Hendrina Margo \nKloekers that year. He could not understand why she wore a mosquito \nnet (veil) over her face, but Margo became a second mother to him. \u0014\n\u0014\nBentley remained in Britain until 1886, but Nlemvo returned home to \nset at rest his tribes fears that he had been sold into slavery. \nWhen his uncle died in 1887, Nlemvo rejected his peoples request \nthat he become their chief. The role would have required him to \nparticipate in pagan ceremonies. When some of the tribe hinted darkly \nthat he must be a witch who was trying to destroy them by rejecting \nthe old customs, he returned to Bentleys mission station. He was \nbaptized and married Kalombo, whom missionaries had rescued from \nslavery and whom he had led to Christ. They had children. After her \ndeath, he married again (his second wifes name is unknown) and had \nmore children. Meanwhile, with his own hands he helped build a \nChristian village and manage its finances and provide leadership.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the following years he explored the Congo with Bentley and \nother missionaries, often facing danger and hostility with them. \nEverywhere he went he helped make converts to Protestant \nChristianity. He visited Europe again in 1893 and translated The Peep \nof Day, religious instructions for children. In 1898, he visited \nagain to help Bentley put more books through press. Margo Bentley \nwrote,\u0014\nWhile we were home on furlough in 1898 my husband succeeded in \npassing through the press, the Congo Grammar, Appendix of the \nDictionary, and Congo Testament, every word of which had been \nsubjected to Nlemvos keen criticism, who had been his helper in the \nlanguage from the very first, and knew English well enough through \nhaving been to England three times and studied the language very \ncarefully.\u0014\n\u0014\nNlemvo founded a drum and fife band, learning to play the cornet. He \ncontinued to assist with translation even after he became blind. \nAlthough he learned to read braille, he also had others read aloud to \nhim. Increasingly he was viewed as an elder statesman and people \nsought him out to resolve disputes and render judgments. By his death \nin 1938, about 200,000 Congolese had converted to Protestant faith.\u0014",

    "title": "NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS, RECENT REPORTS",
    "words": "The History of Native American Boarding Schools Is Even More \nComplicated than a New Report Reveals\u0014\n\u0014\nBY OLIVIA B. WAXMAN  MAY 17, 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nLast week, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a more than \n100-page report on the federal Indigenous boarding schools designed \nto assimilate Native Americans in the late 19th and the early 20th \ncenturies. Between 1819 and 1969, the U.S. ran or supported 408 \nboarding schools, the department found. Students endured rampant \nphysical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and the report recorded more \nthan 500 deaths of Native childrena number set to increase as the \ndepartments investigation of this issue continues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis report, as I see it, is only a first step to acknowledge the \nexperiences of Federal Indian boarding school children, Bryan \nNewland, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, the studys author, \nwrote in a memo.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe effort to catalog these institutions came nearly a year after the \ndiscovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at the site of similar \nboarding schools in Canada raised awareness of this dark chapter in \nNorth American history.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe continue to see the evidence of this attempt to forcibly \nassimilate Indigenous people in the disparities that communities \nface, Deb Haaland, Interior Secretary and first Native American \ncabinet secretary, said in a statement. It is my priority to not \nonly give voice to the survivors and descendants of federal Indian \nboarding school policies, but also to address the lasting legacies of \nthese policies so Indigenous peoples can continue to grow and heal.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo get an American Indian historians reaction to the significance of \nthe Interior Departments research and to better understand the \nhistory of these boarding schools, TIME called Brenda Child, \nhistorian and author of Boarding School Seasons: American Indian \nFamilies, 1900-1940.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy were these boarding schools started?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe always have to remember that the goal of the schools was \nassimilation, but it was also about Native people. To me, the great \ngenocide of the boarding school era is the land loss and \ndispossession that accompanies the boarding school policy. People at \nthe time thought Native people could just abandon their homes and \nreservations and tribal ways and wouldnt need a homeland anymore.\u0014\nWhy was Carlisle Indian Industrial School significant?\u0014\n\u0014\nCarlisle was significant because it was the model for other \ngovernment boarding schools. It came early in the history, and a lot \nof the ideas for Indian education were tested out at Carlisle. For \nexample, at the time, people thought Indians had to go into manual \ntrades because they were good with their hands. They werent educated \nto be doctors or teachers or lawyers. And so Carlisle had this \nprogram where students would spend half the day in the classroom, and \nthen students would be trained in vocational work during half the \nday. And so other schools copied that.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also sounds like the schools were training people for certain \nkinds of low-paying jobs that serve white Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nYeah, it was a system that emphasized social class. Indian people \nwere Native, but lower-class [who white people thought] should learn \nsome good manual trades that benefited the white majority. The \nboarding schools were not really about benefiting Indians. They were \na form of segregated education in the history of the United States. \nAnd we know who benefits from segregation.\u0014\nHow did the U.S. government get away with these boarding schools?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think that the citizens of this country, and politicians in this \ncountry and reformers were deeply invested in dispossessing Indians, \nand thats why the boarding schools persisted and why they were \ntalked about by people at the time as being greatThis was going to \nbe the best thing! Indians are going to become citizens! Theyre \ngoing to get jobs! And the price theyre paying is being \ndispossessed of their land. But thats what it was all about. So I \nalways say you have to look beyond the rhetoric of the assimilation \nera. And if we look at the land policies and see what happened, we \nsee this era was an utter disaster for Native people that made them \npoorer than they ever were before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe report doesnt really periodize American Indian history very \nwell. We generally date the boarding school era from 1879 when \nCarlisle, the first of the off-reservation federal schools, was \nestablished. That was the dominant form of Indian education in the \nUnited States for 50 years, up until [Franklin D. Roosevelts \npresidency], when the Indian office and the policymakers at that time \nturned away from assimilation as the policy. They had also turned \naway from the boarding school concept.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe federal government shut many of them down in the 1930s, and the \nbig story of Indian education became public school education. But \nsome of [the boarding schools] continued, actually, at the demand of \nthe Indian families, who used them as a poverty relief program for \ntheir families to survive the Great Depression. So I think you have \nto look at this era as not just one policy that lasted for 150 years, \nthat is still with us today, but that there are different eras in the \nhistory of American Indian education. And so what Native people who \nattended a government school might have experienced in 1879, when \nthere were still Indian wars being fought in the United States, was \nquite different than what [an American Indian] student in the 1930s \nexperienced when people in government were saying, Well, Native \npeople shouldnt have to give up their languages or their cultures. \nThats a very different period. I dont think that students who \nattended boarding schools experienced the same thing decade after \ndecade.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhere does this report fit in the history of research on Indigenous \nboarding schools?\u0014\n\u0014\nI think that what people in the United States government or perhaps \nin the Department of Interior, certainly in the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, wanted to know is, are there things that we need to be \nconcerned about in the United States? Is there a hidden history that \nwere not aware of in regard to the government? What theyve done is \nto try to take a very comprehensive look at any institution that \ncould be called a boarding school, whether it was run by the federal \ngovernment or whether it was run by church organizations.\u0014\nDo you think that the report adds anything to the scholarship on this \ntopic thats important to note?\u0014\n\u0014\nI did find it interesting that the report includes Native Hawaiians. \nMany of us who have written about the history of Indian education \nhavent really included them in this history. There are a lot of \nsimilarities and parallels because maybe some of the same \nmissionaries or officials started out in Indian schools and then went \nto Hawaii. These ideas about assimilating, changing Indigenous people \nwere global. So I like that [the report] included Hawaii.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the problems that I see with the report is that it takes this \nsweeping view of schools. And most of us historians are specific \nabout the kinds of institutions we study. So what the report does is \nsweep together all kinds of institutionsCatholic schools, Episcopal \nschools, Presbyterian schoolsand I dont know if that sheds light on \nthe overall history. Maybe it provides a certain overview that there \nwere many, many institutions, but I think its better to separate the \nchurch schools and the federal schools, the schools that the United \nStates government funded, because they were different kinds of \ninstitutions with different purposes.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was the impact of the boarding schools on your family?\u0014\n\u0014\nMy great-grandfather went to Carlisle and my grandmother, his \ndaughter, went to the Flandreau school in South Dakota in the 1920s. \nThey were Ojibwe-speaking people who left our reservation at Red Lake \nin northern Minnesota, and [these boarding schools were] their first \nreal experience with the English language. The schools wanted kids to \nspeak English, have a basic grammar school education, but then to be \ntrained in some domestic or manual trades. My grandmother went out to \nwork as a domestic servant in the local white households in South \nDakota. My great-grandfather was one of those people who played \nfootball with [Olympian] Jim Thorpe and so we celebrate this athletic \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy grandmother was bilingual, unlike her husband that she married \nwhen she came back home to the reservation. She became the family \nadvocate because she could write letters. She could speak out on many \nissues when they were trying to get a home loan, all the ways that \nyou had to manage the bureaucracy of reservations. When she came back \nto Red Lake, my grandmother raised her children to speak the Ojibwe \nlanguage. My grandparents insisted on speaking their language and \ndidnt give up their culture in any way. But I think its a mixed \nbag. [The boarding schools were] an institution that was designed to \neliminate Native culture, Native languages, and weve paid a price \nfor that.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat should the U.S. government do now, to make up for federal Indian \nboarding schools?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe cant change the past. We cant change the experience of \nassimilation. But what we can do is restore land to Native people who \nwere dispossessed. And if you would ask Indians, they would tell you \nexactly what land they want restored.\u0014",

As a \ntwo-year-old, he won the Coventry Stakes and finished second in the \nMiddle Park Stakes, ending the year as the top-rated colt of his \ngeneration. In the following season, he became increasingly difficult \nto manage, and his temperament compromised his racing career. He was \nthe beaten favourite in the 2,000 Guineas and finished a close third \nin the Derby Stakes before winning the Champion Stakes. There was no \ndoubt of his quality as a runner of superior class and speed but his \nerratic personality always come into question, compromising many of \nhis races. As a breeding stallion he stood in England, Ireland, and \nthe United States and had great success in each location.\u0014\n\u0014\nBackground\u0014\n\u0014\nNasrullah was a big, handsome bay horse with a white star, bred in \nIreland by his owner the Aga Khan. He was sired by Nearco, an \nundefeated Italian racehorse that became one of the most important \nstallions of the 20th century. Apart from numerous major winners, he \nsired the influential stallions Nearctic and Royal Charger. His dam, \nMumtaz Begum, was a daughter of the outstanding racehorse and \nbroodmare Mumtaz Mahal[1] and became an influential broodmare in her \nown right: her other descendants have included Royal Charger, \nHabibti, Octagonal, Oh So Sharp, and Risen Star.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of Nasrullahs stakes winners in England was a horse named \nZucchero. Winner of the Coronation Cup, the Princess of Wales Stakes \nand the Blue Ribbon Trial Stakes, Zucchero was perhaps the one \noffspring of his sire who over typified his sires eccentricities \nmore than any other. Although very talented, Zucchero was also very \nstubborn and unruly. My father would tell me of watching this \nthoroughbred at Newmarket when at the start of the race and the field \nsped off, Zucchero refused to move, despite his jockeys frantic \nurging. Zucchero became another of my fathers favourite horses as in \nhis words; He was an absolute nut case. The jockey was a teenager \nby the name Lester Piggott.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1944, he was purchased by the bloodstock agent Bertie Kerr. Kerr \nkept him for three weeks before selling him for 19,000 guineas to \nJoseph McGrath, who subsequently stabled him at the Brownstown Stud \nin County Kildare. This deal was allegedly done over an afternoon cup \nof tea at Bewley's in Westmoreland Street.[9][10] Nasrullah was an \nimmediate success as a breeding stallion, and in his six seasons, his \nfee rose from 198 guineas to 500 guineas. He was champion sire in 1951\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1950, Nasrullah was sold for $370,000 to Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. He \nwas exported to stand at stud in the United States at Hancock's \nClaiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky. Nasrullah became one of the most \nimportant North American sires of the 20th century, leading the sire \nlist five times. \u0014\n\u0014\nNasrullah died on May 26, 1959. He is buried at Claiborne Farm.\u0014",

    "words": "No Rest for a Weary Clara Swain\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nTravel today can be fatiguing. When Clara Swain left the United \nStates in 1869, to become the world's first qualified woman medical \nmissionary, it was far more arduous than now. She wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The latter part of our voyage was very rough and I was too sick to \nwrite, and I had five sick ones to look after besides myself...I \ncannot bear to think of the sea, it treated me so badly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCircumstances did not brighten when she landed at Bombay, India. Her \nluggage was a week late. When she attempted to leave Bombay in a \nhorse-drawn conveyance known as a dak garis, the horses lay down and \nrefused to go, despite all coaxing. She slept in the dak garis, well \naware that the fires winking in the distance were to keep tigers away \nfrom villages. Thanks to delays, she arrived at her next stop, \nJubalpore, too late to catch the train to Cawnpore. She had to wait \nanother day. At Cawnpore, she was still one hundred and eighty miles \nfrom her destination, Bareilly.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith no knowledge of the local language, she was hard pressed to \nobtain food. In the end, she found it necessary to fast most of that \nday and night as she traveled in another dak garis. She arrived in \nBareilly at five in the morning, on this date January 20, 1870.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter so exhausting a journey, she might have been forgiven if she \nsought a day of rest before beginning medical work, especially since \nher luggage, with its precious cargo of medicines, would not arrive \nfor another month. However, rest was not to be her lot.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"My medical work really began the day of my arrival. When I came out \nof my room in the morning I found a company of native Christian women \nand girls eagerly awaiting the appearance of the \"Doctor Miss \nSahiba,\" and with the aid of a good missionary sister I was able to \nunderstand their words of welcome and find out what I could do to \nhelp them. As I had no medicines with me, I procured a few simple \nremedies for their ailments from Mrs. Thomas...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of the year she had treated 1,300 patients and trained \nseventeen medical students. Single-handed, she lectured on anatomy, \nphysiology, materia medica, and diseases of women and children. By \n1874, she had built the Women's Hospital and Medical School, the \nfirst in all of Asia.\u0014\n\u0014\nIts forty two acres was acquired miraculously from the Nawab of \nRampore. This zealous Muslim had sworn he would never allow a \nChristian missionary in his city. After deep prayer, Clara and \nanother missionary approached him about the land. He greeted her \nroyally, feasted her, and exclaimed, \"Take it, take it; I give it to \nyou with much pleasure for that purpose.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClara's work was essential, because male doctors were not allowed to \nattend women. Religious customs secluded high-caste females to \nZenanas. Medical care was usually provided by ignorant barber girls. \nClara used her skills as a doctor to gain an entrance for the good \nnews that Christ had come to free India's women of sin and raise \ntheir status.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Clara's health began to falter in the hot climate, she accepted \nan offer to become palace doctor to the Rajah of Rajputana and his \nRani. She attempted to teach the love of Christ to women so \nspiritually ignorant that they even worshiped her sewing machine! \nClara recounted these experiences in colorful letters home, published \nin 1909 under the title, A Glimpse of India. Her missionary \nadventures included a brush with death in a flood and a close call \nwhile riding an elephant in another of her arduous journeys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography\u0014\n\u0014\nBarclay, Wade Crawford.

    "title": "NEW KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL PASTORAL SEARCH",
    "words": "Q, SQ and MQ are the key to an effective search process\u0014\nBILL WILSON  |  MARCH 6, 2023\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the course of the last 14 years, the leadership of the Center \nfor Healthy Churches has assisted hundreds of congregations in their \nsearches for new ministerial leadership. While every one of these \nsearch processes is unique and has its own peculiarities, there are \nsome common denominators that help define what makes for a successful \nsearch.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough trial and error, and after decades of collective \ncongregational leadership experience, we have landed on several key \npredictors of success for a healthy transition process. Among them \nare:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tA spirit of humility from all participants\u0014\n\tA willingness to abandon pre-set agendas and biases for the \nleadership of the Spirit and genuine spiritual discernment\u0014\n\tAn honest and informed awareness of a congregations DNA and context\u0014\n\tA realistic approach to a congregational and next pastor profile\u0014\n\u0014\nIts that last task that often sidetracks a ministerial search. When \nit comes to evaluating candidates, many search committees focus their \nattention on a slick resume, work experience, a sermon or two, a \npredetermined age bracket, denominational loyalty, doctrinal purity, \ngender, appearance, cover letters, and educational background. While \nthese are contributors to getting acquainted with a candidate, they \ndo not reveal what is most important about the person being \nconsidered.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, we have begun introducing the concepts of Emotional \nIntelligence (EQ), Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) and Missional \nIntelligence (MQ) as key predictors of effectiveness and success.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of you will recognize the importance of EQ, as it has become a \nkey ingredient in nearly all hiring practices, regardless the \nvocation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe five key characteristics of Emotional Intelligence translate very \nwell to the ministerial world:\u0014\n\tSelf-awareness\u0014\n\tSelf-regulation\u0014\n\tEmpathy\u0014\n\tMotivation\u0014\n\tSocial skills\u0014\n\u0014\nEach of these are clearly attributes any effective minister needs to \nbe aware of and engaged in learning and refining. Being thoughtful \nabout the presence, or absence, of EQ in the life and work of a \nminister is a minimal requirement for search committees.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have added to the EQ traits two additional realms of \nintelligence we have found are key predictors for effectiveness in \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first we call Spiritual Intelligence or SQ. This is a persons \nability to embody the fruit of the Spirit delineated in Galatians \n5:22-23. These nine traits (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, \ngoodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control) are at the heart of \nwhat it means to live the life of a Christ-follower. \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the lessons most churches have learned is that without some \naspect of these traits residing in the heart of a minister, it will \nnot matter how stunning they are in the pulpit if they do not \nactively display evidence of these fruit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second intelligence we ask committees to consider is Missional \nIntelligence or MQ.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeading in a congregational setting in the 21st century demands a \ndeep desire to learn and adapt to a different culture than most of \nour churches have known across their history. While holding on to the \nunchangeable nature of the gospel, effective ministers must show an \nadaptive skill set that is open to innovation and creative disruption.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe MQ of a minister must be constantly learned and honed so he or \nshe can lead in turbulent times with a calm confidence in the power \nof the gospel to be relevant in any culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have found that creating a list of questions and desired outcomes \nthat relate to EQ, SQ and MQ is a necessary exercise for any search \ncommittee seeking any ministerial leader, regardless their title.\u0014\n\u0014\nDetermining if they are emotionally healthy, if they love and live \nfor God and if they understand present-day ministry are at the heart \nof a successful call.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition to focusing on these traits in the life of the minister, \nhealthy churches also ask similar questions of themselves. How does \nour church embody emotional, spiritual and missional intelligence? \nAre we willing to admit our shortcomings in living out the lifestyle, \nvalues and priorities Jesus and the early church so clearly believed \nin?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe often find churches have adopted a consumer culture in which they \nexpect their ministers to provide services that fit narrow \npre-conceived ideas and expectations. When music or language or new \ninsights or a new ministry focus challenges them, they react like \nconsumers, pushing back and withdrawing or undermining the \ncongregational leaders in the process.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsking your ministers to pay attention to EQ, SQ and MQ without your \ndoing so individually and as a church is a formula for conflict and \ndiscord.\u0014\n\u0014\nUndergirding the entire healthy search process, as noted earlier, is \na profound sense of humility. The calling of God to ministry and to a \nspecific ministry is a deeply spiritual and mysterious experience. \nWhen it is done well, it always should evoke awe and humility among \neveryone involved.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeing the church in the 21st century is challenging and will only \nbecome more so. It is only when laity and clergy alike embrace a \nstance of humility and seek to embody emotional, spiritual, and \nmissional intelligence that the church of Jesus Christ can fulfill \nits potential.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the right blend of these traits and qualities, we believe any \nchurch will be able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we \ncan ask or imagine.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBill Wilson serves as director of The Center for Healthy Churches in \nWinston-Salem\u0014",

It wasnt until after Genghis death \nthat people began to reproduce his likeness, though each culture \nportrayed the late ruler in a different way.

    "words": "Among the heretics banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony was \nRoger Williams, an unorthodox clergyman from the Old World. He was \nsummoned, tried, convicted and sent packing in 1635 for his \nopposition to theocracy and advocacy for the heresy of universal \nfreedom of conscience and religion new and dangerous opinions, \naccording to the Puritans. \u0014\n\u0014\nEqual freedom of conscience and religion for everyone? Williams, \naccording to the opinion of bible-minded Puritan clergy and \ntheologians throughout all of New England, was a madman, an emissary \nof the devil and they were glad to be rid of him. Or so they thought. \u0014\n\u0014\nDetermined more than ever to bring freedom to the New World, the \nconvicted and banished Roger Williams transformed himself into Roger \nWilliams, the founder of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church on \nthe soil of what would become the United States of America. \u0014\n\u0014\nA friend to the Native Narragansett people, Williams, in 1636, \nobtained land from the tribe on which he established his new colony  \ninitially known as Providence Plantations. The colony was founded \non universal freedom of conscience and religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nTwo years later, Williams gathered into a church several Baptists who \nhad migrated from theocratic colonies to Providence Plantations in \nsearch of freedom. That church still exists today and is known as the \nFirst Baptist Church of America. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn almost all the colonies, only properly-believing Christians had \nfull rights as citizens. Not so in Rhode Island. A patent from \nParliamentary England obtained in 1643 decreed that by the voluntary \nconsent of all, or the greater part of them, they shall find most \nsuitable to their Estate and Condition; and, for that End, to make \nand ordain such Civil Laws and Constitutions as desired. \u0014\n\u0014\nThree years later, Rhode Islanders did just that, to the horror of \nthe rest of New England, establishing a secular democracy.\u0014\n\u0014\nScandalous can not begin to describe the 1647 Acts and Orders of \nRhode Island that followed. Not only did Rhode Islands diverse \ncitizenry fail to crib their laws from the Old Testamentas did the \nrest of New England but they also ignored religion altogether. To \nPuritans, civil laws not based on the Bible were inconceivable; to \nRhode Islanders, a secular government was necessary to protect \nfreedom and rights for all. They were the first to take such a bold \nstep. \u0014\n\u0014\nThreatened by the arrival of actual freedom in the New World, the \ntheocratic colonies doubled their efforts to dissolve Rhode Island. \nThe following 15 years saw extraordinary unrest in England, including \na Civil War, the dissolution of the monarchy, the declaration of an \nEnglish Commonwealth and then the return of the monarchy. Against \nthis backdrop, leading biblical theocrats and opposing advocates for \nfreedom worked their connections in the Old World. \u0014\n\u0014\nProgressively, more seekers of true freedom deserted puritanical \ntheocracies and poured into Rhode Island. This led to Roger Williams \nand his fellow citizens securing a permanent charter from Englands \nKing Charles II in 1663 for their outlier colony, enshrining into law \ntheir new and dangerous opinions.  \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams himself abandoned Puritanism and the Baptist church he had \nhelped found (the first in America), opposing all sects and creeds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBruce T.

    "words": "Niemoller Imprisoned for Righteous Resistance\u0014\nDAN GRAVES, MSL |    APR 28, 2010\u0014\n \u0014\nThe results of some trials are foregone conclusions. In the case of \nMartin Niemller the words of Hitler ensured that any court \nappearance would be perfunctory. Niemller had delivered a \n\"rebellious\" sermon in 1937 and Hitler heard of it and of taped phone \nconversations in which Niemller repudiated the Nazi line. Bent on \nobtaining absolute control over the church, Hitler flew into a rage \nand bellowed that Niemller was to be placed in a concentration camp \nand kept there for life since he had proven himself \"incorrigible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that Niemller had helped organize a \"resistance\" to \nHitler's takeover of the Protestant churches, a group called the \nPastor's Emergency League. \"...we have called into being an \n'Emergency Alliance' of pastors who have given one another their word \nin a written declaration that they will be bound in their preaching \nby the Holy Scripture and the Reformation confessions alone...\" he \nwrote in an open letter September 1933. This group developed into the \nConfessing Church. Nonetheless, he apologized with deep regret in \nOctober 1945, after the war, for failing to speak out early and \nstrongly enough against Nazism:\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Nazis came for the communists,\u0014\nI remained silent;\u0014\nI was not a communist.\u0014\nWhen they locked up the social democrats,\u0014\nI remained silent;\u0014\nI was not a social democrat.\u0014\nWhen they came for the trade unionists,\u0014\nI did not speak out;\u0014\nI was not a trade unionist.\u0014\nWhen they came for the Jews,\u0014\nI did not speak out;\u0014\nI was not a Jew.\u0014\nWhen they came for me,\u0014\nthere was no one left to speak out.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there were plenty of \"German Christians\" who did not resist \nat all; who thought that Christ had come through Hitler and their \nfirst task was to be German, not Christian. Pastor Leutheuser \nverbalized their thoughts. Niemller, an ex-submarine captain, was \nappalled at this attitude. Christ was to be central in every \nChristian's heart. 7,000 Lutheran ministers agreed with him. \nNiemller, until his imprisonment, was their strategist. Karl Barth \njoined this Confessing Church in writing a rejection of the state's \nclaim to totalitarian power in religious and political matters. This \nbecame known as the Barmen Declaration.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Niemller was the symbol of Protestant resistance to Hitler, \nhe has been accused of anti-semitism because he preached that the \nJews will suffer until they embrace Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn prison, he wrote many letters. On February 8, 1938 the second day \nof his trial, he wrote to his wife Else, \"Give my greetings to the \ncongregation and tell them that I place my entire confidence in God's \nmercy, and that I am convinced that one day we will recognize in the \nlight the paths along which he leads us now in the darkness and that \nwe will praise his wisdom! God does not desire to give us earthly \nhopes, but he will certainly not abandon us. Jesus Christ remains the \nsame, that is certain; and God will grant us that \"we remain with \nhim!\" The trial ended on this day, March 2, 1938, and afterward he \nwas sentenced to seven months in prison. Hitler had him arrested \nagain almost as soon as he was released. This time his resistance \nplaced him in concentration camps at Sachsenhausen and Dachau until \nthe end of the war. Altogether he spent eight years in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Niemller visited the hotel where Albert Speer, a Hilter \nassociate, was held after the war, Speer expected to see a broken \nman. Instead, it was a healthy and youthful figure he saw who had \nemerged from the camps. Perhaps a clear conscience had helped keep \nhim so.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nNiemller, Martin. Exile in the Fatherland; letters from Moabit \nPrison. Editor Hubert G.

    "words": "A FEUD BETWEEN NESTORIUS AND CYRIL SPLIT THE CHURCH\u0014\n\u0014\nIN 428 the see of Constantinople became empty through the death of \nits bishop. Church and secular powers were unable to agree on a \nsuccessor. They appealed to Emperor Theodosius II to make the \ndecision and he chose Nestorius, a monk well-known for his preaching. \nNestorius was consecrated bishop of Constantinople on this day 10 \nApril 428. A contentious figure, he held the position only a few \nyears. Declared a heretic, he was deposed, and ultimately banished to \nthe Egyptian desert.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe visible reason for his downfall was that Nestorius was reluctant \nto accept the popular designation of Mary as Mother of God. He \npointed out that the apostles and early church fathers never employed \nthe term. Jesus had a human nature, Nestorius said, as well as his \nGod nature. Jesuss physical body carried out his human behaviors and \nactions, and suffered those things that humans suffer, including \ndeath. To say Mary was Mother of God was to say God had once been a \nfew hours oldwhereas God exists from eternity past and cannot die. \nGod is not a baby two or three months old, he argued.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo protect Christs divinity, Nestorius argued that the Godhead must \nhave joined with the human body rather as if a man entered a tent or \nput on clothes. Nestorius remained fully convinced that Jesus Christ \nhas two natures, the human and the divine (as all orthodox Christians \nbelieve), but he spoke of the Son of Mary and the Son of God in a \nmanner that led some critics to think he was speaking of two sons, \ntwo persons. And his insistence on the importance of the manhood of \nChrist led others to suspect him of Arianism. Arians taught that \nChrist was a created being, not truly divine.\u0014\n\u0014\nOpponents had some justification for suspicion. Arians had controlled \nthe see of Constantinople for more than forty years during the fourth \ncentury. Aggravating the situation was Nestoriuss abrasive \npersonality and his failure to give a thoughtful explanation of his \nposition to Rome when the pope asked. Alexandrias patriarch, Cyril, \nwas a despotic man who had ascended to his see amid bloodshed and \ncared little for fair play as long as his theology triumphed. Rome \nand Alexandria already resented the influence of the upstart see at \nConstantinople and worked in collusion to take Nestorius down. \u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius and Cyril employed terms differently; therefore each \nthought the other was making heretical statements when in actuality \ntheir positions were similar. Cyril issued twelve anathemas against \nNestorius. Nestorius anathemized him back. With no reconciliation in \nsight, Theodosius summoned a council to Ephesus to settle the matter \nand appointed John of Antioch to head it. Cyril arrived first and \ntook control. He and his allies deposed Nestorius before the latters \nSyrian supporters could reach the site. When John arrived, he held a \nrival council. \u0014\n\u0014\nNestorius always claimed Cyril misrepresented his statements or took \nthem out of context. In exile, he wrote a lengthy defense that was \nrediscovered in the nineteenth century. Theologians who have studied \nthis defense and Nestoriuss few surviving sermons say that his \nopinions dont seem to have been heretical. Nestorius himself \naccepted the conclusions of the Council of Chalcedon, held in 451, \nwhich, among other things, addressed concerns about Christs being,\u0014\n\u0014\nWe . . .  confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, at once \ncomplete in manhood, truly God and truly man, consisting of a \nreasonable soul and body; of one substance with the Father as regards \nhis Godhead, of one substance with us as regards his manhood ...\u0014\n\u0014\nThe squabble had long-lasting effects. Driven out, Nestoriuss \nfollowers formed their own widespread church. For close to a thousand \nyears this movement flourished in Persia, Arabia, India, Tibet, \nMalabar, Turkostan, Cyprus, and even for a time in China. Nestorians \nsurvive to this day, although they never recovered from the Mongol \ninvasions and from the spread of Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

The rest of the time, I'm...well, Christ, look at me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wasn't a pretty sight. Tousled and bloated, he was drunk much of \nthe time, playing the buffoon and getting into fights at bars and \nparties, making crude passes at women and cadging money and favors \nthat he rarely repaid. As Andrew Lycett recounts in Dylan Thomas \n(Overlook Press; 421 pages), he spawned bad debts, pilfered from and \nvandalized homes he stayed in, and insulted and embarrassed the \npeople who tried the most to help him. It wouldn't be long before he \ndied of alcohol poisoning in New York City in 1953, at the age of 39.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the works that make Thomas a major figure in 20th century \npoetry had been written by the time he was 26, including such poems \nas \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower,\" \"And \nDeath Shall Have No Dominion\" and \"When All My Five and Country \nSenses See.\" After that he survived largely by playing the role of \nthe errant romantic genius, though he did manage to produce Under \nMilk Wood, his enduringly popular play for voices, in his last years. \nAfter a teenage stint on a newspaper in his native Wales, the only \npaid work he found was giving talks on BBC radio, writing film \nscripts during World War II and going on his ruinous tours. But what \na performer he was. In person he could be hilariously entertaining, \nat least until he vomited or passed out. Onstage, no matter how much \nhe had had to drink, he unfailingly gave powerful readings in his \nsonorous, slightly hammy voice.\u0014\n\u0014\nCountless women were eager to bed him and, in the case of the older \nand wealthier ones, to support him--\"ardents,\" he called them. \nFriends, colleagues and hangers-on were willing to forgive him almost \nanything because of his gifts and because of an underlying innocent \nsweetness they saw in him. (Not everyone, though: the young Kenneth \nTynan described him as \"a surly little pug, but a master of pastiche \nand invective. Thinks himself the biggest and best phoney of all \ntime, and may be right.\")\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThese people today would be called enablers, and none was worse than \nhis tempestuous Irish wife Caitlin, who was as much a drunk and a \nbrawler as he was. In seaside towns in Wales and the bohemian \nprecincts of London, they made do in squalid lodgings, haphazardly \nraising three children, bickering violently and competing in \ninfidelity. Lycett suggests that the main cause of Thomas' \nself-destructiveness was his passionate, lethal co-dependency with \nCaitlin.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's a colorful and poignant tale, but in Lycett's hands it goes on \ntoo long. The book would benefit from fewer pub crawls and more \npointed analysis, especially of the poetry, on which Lycett is \nperfunctory. Thomas once said, \"I hold a beast, an angel and a madman \nin me.\" Lycett gives us plenty of the beast and the madman. The angel \nis scarcely glimpsed.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Time Inc. All rights reserved.\u0014",

    "title": "NERO--A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Review by Thomas R. Martin\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Roman emperor is more notorious than Nero. His crimes were many \nand shocking. Edward Champlin offers a refreshing, even startling, \nre-evaluation of Neros motivation. He asks the fundamental \nquestion: why is Nero so fascinating? His answerNero was always and \nonly an artistopens up new depths in our understanding of a complex \npersonality.\u0014\n\u0014\nA gallery of evil\u0014\n\u0014\nChamplin focuses on the episodes that have made Nero notorious: \nmurdering his mother after perhaps committing incest with her; \nkilling his beloved pregnant wife by kicking her abdomen in a fit of \nrage; donning a bridal veil to marry a freed slave and then later \ncastrating another freed slave to marry the mutilated boy as a \nreplacement wife; acting in the theater as an insane hero or a \npregnant woman in labor; reciting lyric poetry while fire consumed \nRome; immolating Christians like torches as the alleged arsonists; \nfixing international artistic competitions so he would win; and \nmuch more.\u0014\n\u0014\nChamplin argues that interpretations of Neros conduct are usually \ndistorted by what we, following our main ancient sources, think we \nknow but in fact do not: Our picture of Nero the egomaniac, the \nmonster, is so strong that we are in danger of falling into the same \ntrap as Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, that is, of fitting \npieces of evidence into our preconceived picture of the tyrant.\u0014\n\u0014\nChamplin believes that Nero was a bad man and a bad ruler, but he \ninsists that ancient authors have distorted Neros motivation by \nsimplifying his personality and suppressing the thematic consistency \nof his actions. His interpretation is that Nero was always \nconsciously playing a role in a formal sense, that he was always an \nactor employing myth to affect his audience. Since public spectacles \nconstituted a central act of empire in the Roman imperial system, \nNero in his obsession on the emperor as actor was complying with a \nfundamental structure of Roman society. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeeing Neros relentless assault on the boundary between art and \nlife as making him a serious person complicates our assessment of him \nas a ruler. For example, Neros response to the great fire in AD 64 \nChamplin characterizes as magnificent because the emperor responded \nwith decision and compassion by directing fire-fighting and relief \nefforts. This is surely an improvement on the popular assessment of \nNero as gleefully fiddling while the capital burned.\u0014\n\u0014\nDisputing the consensus\u0014\n\u0014\nCan we, however, go so far as to agree that, for a man who believed \nthat everyone was completely corrupt, [Nero] lived a life of \nremarkable restraint? It seems especially hard to reconcile this \njudgment with Champlins conclusion, which overturns the scholarly \nconsensus that It looks as if Nero was responsible for the Great \nFire after all, as his ancient critics maintained, and his motive can \nonly have been the one alleged, that he wanted to rebuild the city.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis book does not offer a survey of Neros life and reign; readers \nwill have to supply their own background information. It does offer \nour most insightful and provocative understanding yet of Nero the \nman. \u0014\n\u0014\nAbout the author: Edward Champlin is Professor of Classics and Cotsen \nProfessor of Humanities, Princeton University.\u0014",

It's about change.\u0014\nBy David Neff | posted 07/26/2004 8:30 a.m.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaylor University president Robert Sloan has been vilified by some \nmembers of his faculty and a few of the university's regents, and he \nhas had to face increasingly fierce organized opposition. But \naccording to two professors at Harvard's Kennedy School of \nGovernment, he shouldn't take it personally.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn their book, Leadership on the Line (Harvard Business School Press, \n2002), Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky focus on the dangers \nleaders face when they guide an organization through \"adaptive \nchange.\" Adaptive change is the kind of change that cannot be met \nmerely by the authorities within an organization or by people simply \ndoing what they already know how to doonly doing it more or better \nor faster or with greater resources. Many challenges in \norganizational life require more-better-faster technical adjustments. \nBut adaptive change requires a willingness to experiment and changes \nin values, attitudes, and behaviors.\u0014\n\u0014\nBaylor University's ambitious Baylor Vision 2012 program is precisely \nthat kind of change. Vision 2012 calls for Baylor to become a \"top \ntier\" institution. Anyone who reads the various documents posted at \nwww.baylor.edu/vision will see that they call for many fundamental \nchanges in the way the Baylor familyadministration, faculty, and \nstudentspursues the business of higher education.\u0014\n\u0014\nTop-tier research universities are unlike small liberal arts colleges \nin fundamental ways. And intentionally Christian faculty members are \ndifferent from those who do not try to integrate faith and learning \nor have no faith at all. Making the transitions to top-tier status \nand to a Christian approach to learning require fundamental \nattitudinal and value changes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHeifetz and Linsky want leaders to understand that it is dangerous to \nguide an institution through such fundamental and pervasive change. \nThis is so because, at the beginning, people can see far more clearly \nthe losses they are likely to sustain than the gains that the \ninstitution will make. People who resist such change are not \nnecessarily bad people. They prize the status quo for good reasons, \nwrite Heifetz and Linsky. It is not usually just a matter of personal \nor communal inertia. Managers and executives who recruited them \nimparted certain values and understandings, and they feel they are \ncompromising their loyalties if they participate in the change. \n\"People do not resist change, per se,\" these authors write. \"People \nresist loss.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHeifetz and Linsky warn leaders that those who resent loss will \nreadily confuse message and messenger, and they will transmute their \ndistress over the challenges of change into hostility for the leader \nwho confronts them with the issues of change.\u0014\n\u0014\nThus Heifetz and Linsky caution leaders not to let people make the \nleader the issue. Keep the focus on the adaptive challenges and the \nneed for change. If you don't, you could go down, they say, citing \nthe assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin as an \nextreme example.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsrael's right wing, they write, \"tried to debate the issue\" of \nexchanging land for peace, \"but they were losing the argument. So \nthey began to make Rabin himself the issue, rather than his \npolicies.\" Thus, they assert, even Rabin's murder was not personal, \nbut an extreme method of silencing the discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of Heifetz and Linsky's advice comes back to this point: Don't \nlet the opponents of change make you the issue. Unfortunately, in \nmedia reports, the opponents of change at Baylor have managed to make \nPresident Sloan the issue. However, experienced observers of \norganizational dynamics will recognize thatwhatever missteps Sloan's \nopponents may have seized onthe kerfuffle is really about some \nchanges in fundamental values.\u0014",

    "words": "The U.S. Army Transportation Service troop ship Dorchester was \ntorpedoed in the North Atlantic, 100 miles south of Greenland, on the \nnight of February 3, 1943. As a former luxury liner, the ship went \ndown quickly. Of the 900 passengers and crew, 597 were military \npersonnel, and four of those men were the ship's chaplainsMethodist \nsenior chaplain George Lansing Fox, rabbi Alexander Goode, Dutch \nReformed minister Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington, a Roman \nCatholic priest. Each chaplain distributed life vests as the ship \nwent down and then gave up their own when supply ran out. (There were \napproximately 200 survivors.) Former Washington Post correspondent \nKurzman (Fatal Voyage) follows the men from their enlistments to that \nfateful night, detailing their families and travails along the way. \nThe result is the fullest reckoning yet for the men who have become \nknown as \"The Four Immortal Chaplains,\" who have previously been \ncommemorated by the U.S. Postal Service, with a stamp issued in their \nhonor.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier \nInc.

They recounted how four chaplains, \nafter pressing their life jackets on terrified young men, went down \nwith the ship, praying. The chaplains have been commemorated over the \nyears in various media but never in so comprehensive a fashion as in \nKurzman's book. His research of primary documents associated with \neach chaplain's life and religious career, and interviews of people \nwho knew them, pays off in a narrative that not only recalls the \nmen's personalities but also the quality of their faith in God. It \nwas slightly different for each--an intellectual decision for \nProtestant minister Clark Poling; a starting point for an idealistic \ncommitment to brotherhood and democracy for the young rabbi Alexander \nGoode. From the chaplains' bonding in training camp to the voyage to \nGreenland, their duties and sacrifice are movingly commemorated in \nthis poignant account, which is bound to connect with spiritually \nminded readers.

    "words": "\"How did you figure a six-month-old Jewish infant must be killedwas \nit an enemy?\" Goldensohn asked Otto Ohlendorf at Nuremberg. \"In the \nchild,\" explained the SS lieutenant general, \"we see the grown-up.\" \nGoldensohn, an army psychiatrist, was assigned in 1946 to the \nNuremberg trials. In his evaluations of the German defendants, he \nquickly got over his shock at their casual acceptance of Nazi \ndoctrine and refusal to take personal responsibility for their acts. \nGoldensohn died in 1961, and recently his brother Eli collected the \nlong-stored transcripts edited by historian Gellately (The Gestapo \nand German Society). Goldensohn tried to coax childhood memories from \nthe men, seeking early motivations for later monstrousness, and found \nlittle to go on. Most were ordinary people who took unexpected \nopportunities in politically festering interwar Germany. Few \nexpressed even meager repentance, blaming betrayal of the Nazi ideal \nfor the thwarting of the Garden of Eden promised by Hitler, who \nremained for them a political and military genius. Goldensohn's \nconversations with these men are perturbing because most of the them \nseem like many of us except for the circumstances that lured them \ninto opportunistic deviance. Goldensohn may not have left a \nheadline-making legacy of belated revelations, but he has complicated \nfurther the tapestry of evil. 31 photos.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  Reed Business Information\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything about this book is utterly fascinating - it contains \nverbatim interviews with the Nazi leaders on trial for their lives at \nNuremberg, conducted by Leon Goldensohn, a military psychiatrist who \npassed away in 1961. Dr. Goldensohn's hand-written and typed \ninterview notes were kept in boxes in his family's home for over 40 \nyears. The interviews read like narratives - details of the prisoners \nthemselves, their surroundings, their motives, are described in ways \nthat read like a good story, although very chilling at times. Not \nsurprisingly, each man conveys an unwillingness to assume \nresponsibility for his part in the Holocaust. This is a must read for \nthose interested in Jewish history but also for anyone who is \nintrigued in the story behind the story - how a young Jewish doctor \nfrom Newark, New Jersey was able to sit in a prison cell with leaders \nof the Nazi party and get them to talk so openly about themselves.\u0014",

    "words": "Not a Synod but a Salon\u0014\nThe \"evangelical underground\" plotted England's and the world's \nsalvation at a London pub.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Aaron Belz\u0014\n\u0014\nAldersgate Street, London. This was where John Wesley, who had \nlaunched Britain's Evangelical Revival decades before, had found his \nheart \"strangely warmed\" in May 1738.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut it was not only Wesley's Methodists who spread that revival. On a \nfrozen Thursday evening in January 1783, in an upper room of the \nCastle-and-Falcon Pub on Aldersgate Street, John Newton met with \nfellow evangelical leaders Richard Cecil and Henry Foster, Anglican \nclergymen, and Eli Bates, an Anglican layman.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough there is no record of what transpired at that meeting, it is a \nsafe bet that the 57-year-old Newton had his pipe in hand and that he \nwas exuding characteristic warmth and enthusiasm. The four of them \nagreed to meet on a regular basis\"fortnightly\"the beginnings of the \nEclectic Society. As it expanded to include other attendees, Newton's \nmeeting would gain a reputation as one in which Christian leaders \nfrom different strains of evangelicalism could discuss important \nissues in a relaxed setting.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was an environment defined by Newton's signature conversation \nstyle, which William Jay remembers as \"most easy, and free, and \nvaried, and delightful, and edifying.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton himself called his meeting an \"association,\" representing a \nmuch-needed alternative to the churches' beloved \"assemblies, \nconsistories, synods, councils, benches, [and] boards,\" which he \ncordially disliked. He was, after all, in the habit of receiving \nscores of parishioners and friends at least twice a week in his home, \nin the intimacy of his back roomsometimes 40 in a single day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Castle-and-Falcon meetings marked more than a change in style, \nhowever. Over the next three decades, the Eclectic Society would \nbecome a center of English evangelicalism, a place for London clergy \nand country parsons alike to hang their hats, discuss whatever was on \ntheir minds, and dream about reaching the unsaved masses in Africa. \nIt would eventually birth the influential Church Missionary Society \nand the widely read Christian Observer magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaking it official\u0014\n\u0014\nEven after the first nine months, the meeting was still a nebulous \ngathering, which its founder referred to as \"the society that bears \nno name, and espouses no party.\" Nevertheless it doubled in size, \nadding clergy and laity of various stripes, including (despite the \nfact that Newton had at first distrusted the Moravians) the noted \nMoravian composer Christian Ignatius LaTrobe, then only 26 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1784 the group had adopted its name and grown to about 12 regular \nattendees. Rev. Cecil offered to host the meetings in a more \naccommodating venuethe vestry of his own church, St John's Chapel in \nBedford Row.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe initial rules of the society are recorded on the inside cover of \nNewton's journal for 1791. The meeting time was every other Monday \nafternoon at 4:30 P.M. Tea was served from a silver teapot, followed \nby three or so hours of discussion\"Bible on the table.\" Each \nparticipant contributed a shilling for food. Potential new members \nwere proposed by one member and admitted only by unanimous consent, \nthough the number of members could not exceed 13.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe meeting's agenda was driven by a single question, submitted by \none of the members at the end of the previous meeting. The members \nwould take turns answering, and Newton kept minutes in a small \njournal.\u0014\n\u0014\nQuestions deep and wide\u0014\n\u0014\nThe questions were appropriately eclectic. Sometimes they dealt with \na theological issue, such as \"How should we reconcile Paul and James \non justification?\" Sometimes a cultural question arose: \"What are the \nparticular dangers of youth in the present day?\" The inevitable \npresence of Newtonhymnist, pastor, and former slave tradergave the \nevenings a unique character in which anything might be discussed.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the early period of Eclectic Society meetings, most of the topics \nwere practical rather than theological. Several were family-oriented. \nIn response to the question for December 10, 1787, \"What is the \nnature and obligation of conjugal duties?\" the members recommended a \n\"softening\" of male headship. \"Authority as the remedy\" may prove to \nbe the \"disease\" itself; instead, it is best to \"leave some things to \nthe Woman.\" \"If we stretch our authority,\" Newton concluded, \"we lose \nit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn discussing \"Parents and Children,\" the topic for December 24, \n1787, the group began with a long list of duties of parents to their \nchildren, then turned to a shorter list of children's duties to their \nparents: \"reverence, obedience, gratitude.\" The key to effective \nchild-rearing, the gentlemen agreed, was \"the tone and spirit of the \nfamily.\" Parents' private habits, tones of voice, and even body \nlanguage must be the touchstones for effective child-rearing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Eclectics applied a similar ethic of gracious self-denial to \nministry, response to theological error, dealing with enemies, and \npreaching style. The common theme in all of these discussions was \nthat kindness always trumps sternness. Persuasion is preferable to \nbrowbeating.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to the January 22, 1798, question, \"What may be done \ntowards the interests of the children of a congregation?\" Newton \nsaid, a bit impatiently, \"What is agreeable to children is agreeable \nto children of six feet high.  Talk to children abstractedly, and it \nis all in vain. Go through the life of Christ, and all the historical \nparts of Scripture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn another occasion, Newton said, \"For an old Christian to say to a \nyoung one, 'Stand in my evidence,' is like a man who has with \ndifficulty climbed by a ladder of scaffolding to the top of a house, \nand cries to one at the bottom, 'This is the place for a \nprospectcome up at a step.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton's approach, which would become the approach of the whole \nEclectic assembly, was to discern each person's needs and respond \naccordingly. Sacrifice should be on the part of the pastor, of the \nhusband, the parent.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn eventful era\u0014\n\u0014\nThe founding years of the Eclectic Society were years of major \npolitical change, not only in England, but throughout Europe. In \nParis, on January 20, 1783four days after that first meeting at \nCastle-and-FalconEngland signed away one of its best colonial assets \nto the likes of John Adams and Ben Franklin.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was also a time of religious change. A grassroots evangelical \nmovement had been growing steadily in the Church of England since at \nleast the 1760s (p. 30). Just two months before the Eclectics' first \nmeeting, evangelical leader Charles Simeon was installed at Holy \nTrinity Church, Cambridge (p. 50). In London, evangelical lecturers \nand chaplains were becoming so popular that people brimmed out into \nthe sidewalks and streets.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Eclectic Society's chief importance was that it focused an ethos. \nIn place of the old-fashioned ecclesiastical bureaucracy, here was a \n\"back-room\" meeting, an almost revolutionary event in which the Bible \nlay open on the table and each man had his say.\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of a synod, Newton hosted a salonthe kind of intellectual \nclub that had been so effective in focusing philosophical ideas in \nFrance during the previous hundred years.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch meetings had formed the molecular substructure of the \nEnlightenment; and, with the subsequent rise of other informal \ngatherings, such as William Wilberforce's \"Clapham Sect,\" they would \nserve the evangelical cause in a similar way.\u0014\n\u0014\nMissionaries, magazines, and more\u0014\n\u0014\nThe practical effect of the Eclectic Society was first felt inof all \nplacesAustralia. In addition to Newton himself, young zealots like \nChristian LaTrobe and John Venn had given the assembly a distinct air \nof missions-mindedness.\u0014\n\u0014\nNewton had been instrumental in the appointment of Richard Johnson to \nestablish a church in New South Wales, and in 1786 the Society \nconsidered the question: \"What is the best method for planting and \npropagating the Gospel in Botany Bay?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Society discussed missions again in 1789, when the question was, \n\"What is the best way of propagating the Gospel in the East Indies?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne evening in 1792, discussion turned to the slave tradea practice \nthat Newton by then opposed as steadfastly as did his close friend \nWilliam Wilberforce.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis stirred the group to an ongoing discussion of Africa, which led \nto the founding of Venn's Church Missionary Society for Africa and \nthe East (CMS) in 1799. The CMS held its inaugural meeting at the \nCastle-and-Falcon, as had the London Missionary Society, founded in \n1795. Wilberforce himself was asked to be the president of the CMS, \nthough he refused, accepting instead vice-presidency.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlso in 1799, a young clergyman who had been recently recruited to \nthe Eclectic Society, Josiah Pratt, proposed the following question: \n\"How far may a periodical Publication be made subservient to the \ninterest of Religion?\" In 1801 Pratt founded the Christian Observer, \nwhich throughout the nineteenth century served as a valuable organ \nfor evangelical ideas.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boom years for the Eclectic Society were really 1799 and 1800. \nAccording to Pratt's register, 24 different members were active at \nsome point during that span.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he entered his late 70s, however, Newton's health fell into \ndecline, and after he died in 1807, his society also fell on hard \ntimes. Although there were still 16 members in 1814, Pratt resigned \nin that year because the \"discussions were not made latterly with the \nsame fulness [sic] as before.\" And the society disbanded.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the legacy of Newton, Wilberforce, Cecil, Pratt, Johnson, \nand others lives on, but not due solely to their accomplishments. \nThese were friends, sitting at table, a pipe handy, significant \nquestions to pursue, and a familiar manner of expression. Their lives \nwere knit together not in public but in Newton's back room and in the \npub on Aldersgate Street.\u0014\n\u0014\nAaron Belz is a freelance writer and a doctoral student at Saint \nLouis University, Saint Louis, Missouri.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History & Biography magazine.

    "words": "March 2, 1938  Niemoller Imprisoned for Righteous Resistance.\u0014\n\u0014\nby the Staff or associates of Christian History Institute.\u0014\n Copyright. All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe results of some trials are foregone conclusions. In the case of \nMartin Niemller the words of Hitler ensured that any court \nappearance would be perfunctory. Niemller had delivered a \n\"rebellious\" sermon in 1937 and Hitler heard of it and of taped phone \nconversations in which Niemller repudiated the Nazi line. Bent on \nobtaining absolute control over the church, Hitler flew into a rage \nand bellowed that Niemller was to be placed in a concentration camp \nand kept there for life since he had proven himself \"incorrigible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is true that Niemller had helped organize a \"resistance\" to \nHitler's takeover of the Protestant churches, a group called the \nPastor's Emergency League. \"...we have called into being an \n'Emergency Alliance' of pastors who have given one another their word \nin a written declaration that they will be bound in their preaching \nby the Holy Scripture and the Reformation confessions alone...\" he \nwrote in an open letter September 1933. This group developed into the \nConfessing Church. Nonetheless, he apologized with deep regret in \nOctober 1945, after the war, for failing to speak out early and \nstrongly enough against Nazism.\u0014\n\u0014\nOften he would say, \"First they came for the socialists and I did not \nspeak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade \nunionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. \nThen they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not \na Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for \nme.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there were plenty of \"German Christians\" who did not resist \nat all; who thought that Christ had come through Hitler and their \nfirst task was to be German, not Christian. Pastor Leutheuser \nverbalized their thoughts. Niemller, an ex-submarine captain, was \nappalled at this attitude. Christ was to be central in every \nChristian's heart. 7,000 Lutheran ministers agreed with him. \nNiemller, until his imprisonment, was their strategist. Karl Barth \njoined this Confessing Church in writing a rejection of the state's \nclaim to totalitarian power in religious and political matters. This \nbecame known as the Barmen Declaration.\u0014\n\u0014\nNiemller was the symbol of Protestant resistance to Hitler. After a \ntrial in a special court, which ended on this day, March 2, 1938, he \nwas sentenced to seven months in prison. Hitler had him arrested \nagain almost as soon as he was released. This time his resistance \nplaced him in concentration camps at Sachsenhausen and Dachau until \nthe end of the war.

It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over \nthe top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has \nno time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning \nand just inside the door of the Target \u0014\n\u0014\nWe waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up \ntheir hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in \nthe sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of \nthe world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came \npouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were \nall caught in \"Mom let's run through the rain,\" she said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What?\" Mom asked. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Lets run through the rain!\" She repeated. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"No, honey.

I swear you couldn't hear \nanything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in \nthe next few minutes. \u0014\n\u0014\nMom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now \nsome would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might \neven ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a \nyoung child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so \nthat it will bloom into faith. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If GOD \nlet's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing,\" Mom said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThen off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as \nthey darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held \ntheir shopping bags over their heads just in case.

    "title": "NIXON AND KISSINGER - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "NIXON AND KISSINGER\u0014\nby Robert Dallek\u0014\n\u0014\nThe author of acclaimed and best-selling biographies of Franklin \nRoosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Ronald Reagan, \nhistorian Robert Dallek is a uniquely qualified expert on the uses \nand abuses of American presidential power. In Nixon and Kissinger, \nhis marvelously written new dual biography of the infamous president \nand his most influential adviser, Dallek once more offers a riveting \nand illuminating account that examines the ways ambition, passion, \nand insecurity drove two of the 20th century's most fascinating, \ncontroversial, and misunderstood men.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the heart of the book is the brooding, confrontational Richard \nNixon, a self-made son of the American West who would be widely \ndenounced as Tricky Dick for his notorious political tactics. \nNixon's story, Dallek writes, is in significant part the story of an \nintrospective man whose inner demons both lifted him up and brought \nhim down.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd then there is the brilliant, calculating Henry Kissinger, whose \nfamily fled Nazi Germany and settled in America, and whose own \nself-made rise to power as both national security adviser and \nsecretary of state would make him, in Dallek's words, a kind of \nco-president, a man whose impact on world history still inspires \nfierce debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nTogether, these figures ruled throughout some of the most tumultuous \nand decisive events of the past century: the end of the Vietnam War, \nthe U.S.'s historic opening with China and dtente with the Soviet \nUnion, the Middle East's Yom Kippur War, the Chilean military coup \nand death of President Salvatore Allende, the growing India-Pakistan \ncrisis, and, of course, the Watergate scandal that ended Nixon's \npresidency.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a striking irony, Dallek notes, that while Nixon and \nKissinger ran a government that was unequaled in its secrecy, the \navailability of so much newly declassified information makes their \nWhite House more transparent than any before or since. Drawing on \nhis vast research among this mountainous material, including millions \nof pages of national security files, 2,800 hours out of 3,700 hours \nof Nixon tapes, and 20,000 pages of Kissinger telephone transcripts, \nDallek illuminates the shadowy labyrinths of the Nixon \nadministration, revealing the bitter internal conflicts and \nrivalries, including Nixon and Kissinger's struggles with each other, \nthat resulted in some of the administration's most significant \nactions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs this exquisitely crafted and meticulously detailed masterwork \nshows, no scholar is better suited to the task of illuminating the \nNixon-Kissinger years than Robert Dallek. A triumph of bold writing \nand incisive thinking, Nixon and Kissinger will no doubt be judged a \ndefinitive study of these extraordinary American figures. \u0014\n\u0014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u0014\nRobert Dallek is the author of An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, \n1917-1963, which was a #1 New York Times bestseller. His writing has \nappeared in The Atlantic Monthly, the New York Times, and the \nWashington Post. He is an elected fellow of the American Academy of \nArts and Sciences and of the Society of American Historians.\u0014",

No sale.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick deserves the maximum penalty for his crime, five years in a \nfederal prison. And when he is released, Vick should be banned from \nthe NFL for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnough is enough. Vick does not deserve to walk among civilized \npeople. He certainly does not deserve to make millions of dollars \nplaying football.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick and his partners brutally murdered defenseless animals. They \nhelped perpetuate an activity that no doubt resulted in the death of \ncountless other defenseless animals.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Vick receives a 12-month sentence, 10.2 months with the good-time \ncredit, followed by a year's suspension from the NFL, he could be \nback in uniform by his 29th birthday.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor taking part in the execution of eight pit bull terriers, by \nhanging, drowning and slamming one to the ground? For sponsoring \ndogfights and interstate gambling for six years? For condoning the \nexecution, by a .22 caliber pistol, of pit bulls that did not perform \nwell enough in test fights?\u0014\n\u0014\nNo way.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick did the crime. He deserves the full amount of the time.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou can argue that even with a 12-month sentence, Vick will have paid \nhis debt and made amends for his behavior. You can say he has cost \nhimself millions in salary, bonuses and endorsements.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut given the mentality of NFL coaches and teams, Vick will have \nseveral teams bidding for his services soon after his NFL suspension \nends. He'll begin to recoup the millions he lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe image consultants will turn Vick into a champion of the animal \nkingdom. He'll be forgiven for his crimes and be highly sought by \nfantasy football players everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's what we do. We take low-life miscreants who have a unique \ntalent and project qualities on them - they're gracious and giving \nand have soft hearts - because that's what we want in our icons.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow we know Vick is none of those things. The softness of a person's \nheart should be judged on how he treats the defenseless and by how he \nacts when no one is watching.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick fails on both counts.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe does not deserve a lucrative contract to play football. He never \nagain should have tens of thousands of fans in stadiums cheering for \nhim.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Vick did was despicable.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick's athletic skills long have gotten him breaks. As severe as a \n12to 18-month prison term sounds, Vick would be getting another break \nif he receives such a sentence.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll others who engage in dogfighting need to be afraid, very afraid \nthat they're next in line for five years in prison. Every NFL player \nwho thinks he is above the law should be put on notice he is not.\u0014\n\u0014\nPlaying in the NFL is high-reward, high-profile endeavor.\u0014\n\u0014\nVick has shown he deserves neither the reward nor the profile.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe deserves to be punished. Five years in prison and a lifetime ban \nfrom the NFL are good places to start.\u0014\n\u0014\nContact Paul Woody at (804) 649-6444 or pwoody@timesdispatch.co\u0014",

CHEN\u0014\nPublished: September 7, 2007, New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nTRENTON, Sept. 6  Eleven current or former public officials, \nincluding two members of the State Assembly, were charged Thursday \nwith taking thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for promising \nmunicipal business to undercover officers posing as insurance brokers \nin the latest federal probe into New Jerseys rampant political \ncorruption.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe officials, and a man affiliated with one of them, were rounded up \nby agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation early Thursday \nmorning and appeared before a judge in Federal District Court here by \nafternoon. The arrests culminated an 18-month investigation in which \nan undercover agent and cooperating witnesses posed as insurance \nbrokers and traded wads of cash ranging from $1,500 to $17,500 for \nassurances of votes on school boards and city councils.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe investigation initially focused on the Pleasantville Board of \nEducation, which runs a tiny, impoverished school district near \nAtlantic City. With 13 superintendents in the last 10 years, the \ndistrict has been plagued by turmoil and is now working with a \nstate-appointed monitor.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut then, unexpectedly, Pleasantville officials led federal \ninvestigators on what Christopher J. Christie, the United States \nattorney for New Jersey, described at a news conference here as a \ncorruption tour of New Jersey by referring the fake insurers to \nother parts of the state.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat tour, prosecutors said, ranged 125 miles north to Passaic and \nPaterson, two gritty towns just outside New York City known for rough \npolitics, as well as to Newark and Orange. And the way it transpired \nresembled the New Jersey of Hollywood as meetings unfolded in parked \ncars, rest stops on the Garden State Parkway, restaurants and hotels.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe arrests are the latest example of how the states roster of \nelected and appointed officials has come, at times, to resemble a \npolice blotter. Two powerful Democratic veterans  Sharpe James, the \nformer mayor of Newark, and Wayne R. Bryant, a state senator from \nCamden  were indicted earlier this year, and State Senator Joseph \nConiglio, a Democrat of Bergen County, has been notified by \nprosecutors that he is the target of a corruption investigation.\u0014",

A South Carolina Roman Catholic priest \nhas told his parishioners that they should refrain from receiving \nHoly Communion if they voted for Barack Obama. The Democratic \npresi-     dent-elect supports abortion rights, and supporting him \nconstitutes material cooperation with intrinsic evil, the priest \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The Rev. Jay Scott Newman said in a letter distributed \nSunday to parishioners at St. Marys Catholic Church in Greenville \nthat they are putting their souls at risk if they take Holy Communion \nbefore\u0014\ndoing penance for their vote.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Voting for a pro-abortion politician when a plausible \npro-life alternative exits constitutes material cooperation with \nintrinsic evil, and those Catholics who do so place themselves \noutside of the full         communion of Christs Church and under \nthe judgment of divine law, Newman wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\n         Persons in this condition should not receive Holy Communion \nuntil and unless they are reconciled to God in the sacrament of \npenance, lest they eat and drink their own condemnation.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Bishops differ on whether Catholic lawmakers  and voters \n should refrain from receiving Communion if they diverge from church \nteaching on abortion.

    "title": "NEBRASKA REVISES CHILD SAFE HAVEN LAW",
    "words": "November 22, 2008 \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                     Nebraska Revises \nChild Safe Haven Law \u0014\nBy ERIK ECKHOLM, The New York Times\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nDECATUR, Neb. The Legislature on Friday revised an unusual law \npermitting parents to hand children up to age 18 over to state \ncustody without prosecution, instead limiting its reach to infants up \nto 30 days old. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe original law, enacted earlier this year, was intended to protect \nnewborns from being abandoned or killed by panicked young mothers. \nBut since Sept. 1, to the shock of officials and the public in \nNebraska, 35 older children, many from 10 to 17 years in age, have \nbeen dropped off at hospitals. Most were left by desperate parents \nwho said the children were uncontrollable and violent and needed more \ncounseling or psychiatric services than they could find or pay for. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe specter of parents giving up their children prompted national \nsoul-searching about the limits of parental responsibility. It has \nalso highlighted what child welfare experts say is a widespread \nshortage of public and private aid, especially mental health \nservices, for overstressed families and teenagers  a shortage that \nis likely to worsen in the current economic crisis as state \ngovernments cut budgets. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Legislature on Thursday established a commission to propose new \nmeasures to help people like Lavennia Coover, a 36-year-old divorced \nmother of three and kindergarten teacher who was at the end of her \nrope, financially and emotionally, when she made the wrenching \ndecision to hand over her son. I still cry every night, Ms. Coover \nsaid Friday in an interview at her home in Decatur, a speck of a farm \ntown on the Missouri River, about 60 miles north of Omaha. What \nparent wouldnt feel guilty doing this?\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Coovers husband left her alone with three children, including an \nolder bipolar daughter and a 12-year-old boy who is doing well. But \nher 11-year-old son, Skylar, is bipolar, abusive and violent, she \nsaid, and after three years of spotty, expensive and ineffective \npsychiatric care she could see no other way to get him the intensive \nhelp he needs. In September, when he refused to get out of bed and go \nto school, she physically dragged him out for a few days, then gave \nup trying. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sept. 24, after he had become more aggressive and begun throwing \nfood and trashing the house, she told the boy that they were going \nfor a drive to Omaha. Instead she drove to the Alegent \nHealth-Immanuel Medical Center and left Skylar there, invoking the \nsafe-haven law. \u0014\n\u0014\nSkylar suspected what was up. On Labor Day weekend, after a \nparticularly bad spell, he had spent three days  the maximum her \ninsurance would cover  in that hospitals psychiatric unit, and as \nshe turned in its direction that day, he said: Youre taking me back \nthere, arent you? You lied to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nI promise Ill behave, he wailed. I promise Ill go to school. \u0014\n\u0014\nI said, Skylar, you need help that I just cant give you,  Ms. \nCoover recalled. She wept in the emergency room.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Sept. 26 child welfare officials in Douglas County, which includes \nOmaha, filed a petition accusing Ms. Coover of neglect. She is \nworking to have that changed to a no fault transfer of custody. \nBeing officially declared neglectful could jeopardize her teaching \ncredential and future parental rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe abrupt handovers in Nebraska are striking examples of an ongoing, \nmore orderly phenomenon that exposes the shortage of psychiatric help \nfor children. A 2003 report by the General Accounting Office, \ncompiling responses from only 19 states and 30 counties, found that \n12,700 children in one year had been placed in child welfare or \njuvenile justice systems simply so they could receive mental health \ncare. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs the drop-offs continued through the fall in Nebraska, including \nfive cases in which children were driven in from other states, Gov. \nDave Heineman called an emergency session of the Legislature this \nweek to revise the law.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this year, Nebraska was the last of the 50 states to adopt a \nsafe-haven law. But instead of specifying that it applied only to \ninfants up to a certain age, as in other states, Nebraskas version \nused the word child, opening the door to handovers of children up \nto age 18. \u0014\n\u0014\nMany legislators and advocates for children said the desperate \nactions by caretakers had exposed serious gaps in services, \nespecially for families with troubled older children. The findings of \nthe new commission are sure to be scrutinized by other states where \nthe same unmet needs are rumbling.\u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Coover said that her son had received psychiatric care off and \non, with limited coverage by her insurance plan, but that he often \nrefused to take prescribed medications. When he refused to go to \nschool, she could not afford a sitter and did not know where to turn. \u0014\n\u0014\nShe has spoken out, she said, because newspaper descriptions made her \nfamily easily identifiable in their town of 640 and because she \nresented the way state officials described parents like her as \nirresponsibly abandoning their children.\u0014\n\u0014\nFar from abandoning Skylar, she said, she gave her phone number to \nthe hospital and state agencies, has visited him weekly  he is still \nin the same hospital but will soon move into a therapeutic foster \nhome with specially trained parents and services  and hopes he can \nreturn home at some point.\u0014",

    "words": "In 1904, William Borden , the heir of the famous Borden dairy estate, \ngraduated from high school in Chicago. As a graduation gift, his \nparents sent him on a cruise around the world. While on this cruise, \nGod began to open William's eyes and heart to the masses of unsaved \npeople around the world. William wrote to his mother about his desire \nto be a missionary. In one of his early letters he wrote, 'I think \nGod is calling me to be a missionary.' In his final letter he wrote, \n'I know God is calling me to be a missionary.'  At least one friend \nexpressed amazement that William was throwing his life away by \nchoosing to become a missionary.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When he returned home, William enrolled in Yale University, where he \nwas instrumental in starting campus prayer and Bible study groups and \nevangelism initiatives. He also worked with the least of these on the \nstreets of New Haven and founded Yale Hope Mission. Henry Wright, a \nprofessor at Yale, said, 'It is my firm conviction that the Yale Hope \nMission has done more to convince all classes of men at Yale of the \npower and practicability of Christianity to regenerate individuals \nand communities than any other force in the University.' While in \nschool, William renounced his fortune in favor of missions and wrote \ntwo words in the flyleaf of his Bible -- 'No Reserves.' William \nwanted to live by faith and trust God for everything in his life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"William attended a Student Volunteer Movement conference in \nNashville, where he learned about the great number of Muslims in \nChina. He felt God wanted him to go to China, where he hoped to work \nwith Muslims. When he graduated from Yale, he had many lucrative job \noffers, including the opportunity to take over the multi-million \ndollar family business.However, he was determined to fulfill God's \ncall to serve as a missionary. Once again, he opened his Bible to the \nflyleaf and wrote two more words -- 'No Retreats.'\u0014\n\u0014\nWilliam set sail for China on Dec. 17, 1912. He stopped in Egypt to \nstudy Arabic so he would be better equipped to work with Muslims. \nWhile in Egypt, William contracted spinal meningitis and died on \nApril 9, 1913, at the age of 25. Years of training, a promising \nfuture, and William never made it to China. Charlie Campbell, one of \nWilliam's college friends, received his Bible after his death. When \nhe opened it, he found what William had written in the flyleaf. In \naddition to the words 'No Reserves' and 'No Retreats' that William \nhad jotted down during his college days, he found two more words that \nWilliam had written before he died -- 'No Regrets.'\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough William Borden never made it to the mission field in China, \nhe touched hundreds of students at Yale University and Princeton \nDivinity School who became missionaries. Because the news of his \ndeath was published all over the world, many people wrote letters to \nhis family expressing how their lives had been influenced by \nWilliam's story of faith and commitment to the cause of Christ.His \nstory continues to inspire selfless service for the cause of Christ.\" \nAs believers may we truthfully confess with William Borden of Yale, \n'No Reserves, No Retreats, and No Regrets.'\" (from Franklin Kirksey, \n\"Grandfather's Gavel\"; Omar C. Garcia, \"William Borden, Go Beyond: \nLive Adventurously for God,\"\u0014",

    "words": "Barbie says forget \npast, he was only doing duty\u0014\n         \u0014\n                 PARIS  (2/26/83) Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, \nknown as the \"Butcher of Lyon, said in\u0014\n         a television interview broadcast yesterday that he has \nforgotten his past and the rest of\u0014\n         the world should forget it, too.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Barbie, head of the Gestapo in Lyon from 1942 to 1944, said \nhe was only doing his job when\u0014\n         he fought the French resistance. He is accused of executing \n4,000 people, torturing\u0014\n         thousands more and deporting 7,500 French Jews to \nconcentration camps.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Apart from what has happened today, I would assess my life \nas being absolutely positive. \u0014\n         If Germany had won the war, there would hardly be any \ninterest in my case, Barbie said in the                   interview \nwith Bolivian journalists Caries Soria and Ugo Roncal as he was being \nflown to France.\u0014\n         Sogoria and Roncal said Barbie did not show remorse for his \nactions, but rather exas-\u0014\n         peration at the turn of events, muttering off camera, \nDamned are the vanquished.\u0014\n\u0014\n            Barbie was twice sentenced to death in absentia by French \ncourts. He was expelled Feb. 5\u0014\n         from Bolivia, where he hid for years, and France has charged \nhim under a new law for\u0014\n         crimes against humanity. I did my duty, Barbie, 69, said \nin the interview. I was chief of the          \u0014\n         anti-resistance group in France. ... There were several \ngroups, each with its own work, he said in\u0014\n         Spanish. My particular job was the war against the French \nresistance.\u0014\n  \u0014\n             Asked about Jean Moulin, a hero of the French \nresistancein World War II whom Barbie\u0014\n         is accused of beating to death personally, Barbie said: \nThat was part of the war.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Looking for a historic analogy, he said Napoleon was \ncondemned by all of Europe for\u0014\n         his tyranny, but 200 years later, he is made a hero. \u0014\n\u0014\n          Barbie also said events of the war years should be \nforgotten. I have forgotten. If they\u0014\n         have not forgotten, it is their business. I have forgotten.\u0014\n\u0014\n          The interview was conducted as Soria and Roncal accompanied \nBarbie on the Bolivian\u0014\n         military plane from La Paz to Cayenne, French Guyana, and \nthen from Cayenne to France\u0014\n         on a French aircraft. Soria said Barbie did not know until \nhe reached Cayenne that his ultimate  \u0014\n         destination was France because Bolivian authorities never \ntold him why they were expelling\u0014\n         him.\u0014\n         \u0014\n           In the beginning, he had a little bit of a sarcastic \nsmile, Soria said. He thought he was\u0014\n         going to West Germany. In French Guyana, he knew his final \ndestination was France, then he \u0014\n         appeared more resigned. You could see it in his expression, \non his face.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             Barbie refused to talk specifically about his activities \nduring the war.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             I cant give you details. Forty years have passed. I \ndont remember any more, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n             Soria said Barbies last words to the journalists were: \nMy life is lost. Soria said he\u0014\n         told him that the death penalty no longer exists in France. \nHe responded: That means\u0014\n         nothing. My life is lost.\u0014",

Human \nrights groups and the state government say that as many as 500 people \nmay have been killed in the early hours of Sunday morning, in three \ndifferent villages. \u0014\n\u0014\nSundays killings were an especially vicious expression of \nlong-running hostilities between Christians and Muslims in this \ndivided nation. Jos and the region around it are on the fault line \nwhere the volatile and poor Muslim north and the Christian south \nmeet. In the past decade, some 3,000 people have been killed in \ninterethnic, interreligious violence in this fraught zone. The \npattern is familiar and was seen as recently as January: uneasy \ncoexistence suddenly explodes into killing, amplified for days by \nretaliation. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Adamu, a Muslim herder, said he went to Dogo Na Hawa, a village \nof Christians living in mud-brick houses on dirt streets, to avenge \nthe killings of Muslims and their cattle in January. \u0014\nThe operation had been planned at least several days before by a \nlocal group called Thank Allah, said one of Mr. Adamus fellow \ndetainees, Ibrahim Harouna, who was shackled on the floor next to \nhim. The men spoke in Hausa through an interpreter.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey killed a lot of our Fulanis in January, Mr. Adamu said, \nreferring to his ethnic group. So I knew that this time, we would \ntake revenge. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis victims were sleeping when he arrived, he said, and he set their \nhouse on fire. Sure enough, they ran out. \u0014\n\u0014\nI killed three people, Mr. Adamu said calmly. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe and the other detainees showed no sign that they had been \nmaltreated; some confessed to killings, and others denied them, \nspeaking in front of the police. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe police quickly arrested about 200 people in connection with the \nkillings, and many of them were crouching anxiously in rows on a bare \nconcrete floor, outside the police headquarters on Wednesday morning. \nThe police have confiscated 14 machetes, 26 bows, arrows, 3 axes, 4 \nspears and 44 guns. Victims, many of them women and children, were \ncut down with knives, short and long; few survived. \u0014\n\u0014\nUsually in such attacks, there are twice as many injuries as deaths, \nsaid Ben Whitfield of the Doctors Without Borders team in Jos. Its \nunreal, he said. These people were definitely caught in the middle \nof the night and meant to be killed. Like others in Jos, police \nofficials say they are hoping for peace after years of sectarian \nkillings in the region. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut they are not sure they will get it. The streets in this \nmetropolis of several million were largely deserted Wednesday. \nResidents spoke of fear and anger, and about 4,300 have fled.\u0014",

    "words": "There is much to admire in India today, including its vibrant \ndemocracy and economy and its rich traditions. It should also lead \nthe way in protecting and empowering women by ending so-called honor \nkillings. \u0014\n\u0014\nJim Yardley recently reported in The Times on the case of Nirupama \nPathak, a 22-year-old journalism graduate student from northern India \nwho was found dead in her bedroom in April. Police arrested her \nmother on suspicion of murder; the family insisted Ms. Pathak had \nkilled herself after confessing that she was pregnant. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe legal process must move forward, but what is clear is that Ms. \nPathaks family  members of the Brahmin caste, the highest Hindu \ncaste  fiercely disapproved of her engagement to a young man she had \nmet at school who was from a middle-upper caste. When she told her \nfamily of her plans to marry, The Times reported, she was accused of \ndefiling her Hindu religion. \u0014\n\u0014\nHer family gave police conflicting stories about how Ms. Pathak died. \nFirst, it was said that she had died from electrocution. Then the \nclaim was that she had hanged herself. The autopsy showed that she \nhad suffocated. \u0014\n\u0014\nResponding to an apparent resurgence in honor killings, Prime \nMinister Manmohan Singh ordered a cabinet-level commission this month \nto consider tougher penalties in such cases. In June, Indias Supreme \nCourt asked seven states and the national government to report on \nwhat is being done to address the problem. Mr. Singh and the court \nneed to follow through. \u0014\n\u0014\nHonor killings are widely reported in the Middle East and South Asia, \nbut in recent years they also have taken place in Italy, Sweden, \nBrazil and Britain. According to Navi Pillay, the United Nations high \ncommissioner for human rights, there are 5,000 instances annually \nwhen women and girls are shot, stoned, burned, buried alive, \nstrangled, smothered and knifed to death by fathers, brothers, sons, \nuncles, even mothers in the name of preserving family honor. Ms. \nPillay has rejected arguments that such family violence is outside \nthe conceptual framework of international human rights. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is a reason these religious and cultural beliefs are allowed to \npersist. Politicians dont have the courage to call it what it is: \nmurder.\u0014\n\u0014\nPUBLISHED: JULY 12, 2010, NEW YORK TIMES\u0014",

He could \nthink of nothing else, and one day studying Greek, he scribbled in \nthe cover of his textbook that Sarah goes from place to place, \nsinging sweetly, full of joy. She loves to be alone, walking in the \nfields and groves, and seems to have someone invisible always \nconversing with her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey married on July 28, 1727, the bride (then 17) in a green dress. \nJonathan was hired by a Massachusetts church. But parishioners often \ncriticized the young couple. Jonathan was too strict for some, Sarah \ntoo extravagant for others.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven worse, they evidently were intimate on the Lords Day. Colonial \nNew Englanders believed that babies were born on the same day of the \nweek as conceived. When six of the Edwardss 11 children arrived on \nSundays, it sent tongues wagging. Such intimacy wasnt appropriate \nSunday behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut through all the hardships, the couple nurtured their love. They \ncherished afternoon horseback rides along forest trails. They had \nnightly devotions, and Jonathan read Sarah his compositions daily. He \ndevoted an hour each day to the children and took them on trips one \nat a time.\u0014\n\u0014\nGeorge Whitefield wrote: A sweeter couple I have not seen. Their \nchildren were not dressed in silks and satins, but plain, examples of \nChristian simplicity. Mrs. Edwards is adorned with a meek, quiet \nspirit; she talked solidly of the things of God, and seemed to be \nsuch a helpmeet for her husband, that she caused me to renew those \nprayers, I have put up to God, (for) a wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nJonathans last words were, Give my love to my dear wife, and tell \nher that the uncommon union which has long subsisted between us has \nbeen of such a nature as I trust is spiritual and therefore will \ncontinue forever.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later a reporter tracked down 1,400 descendants of Jonathan and \nSarah, finding among them 80 college presidents, professors, and \ndeans, 100 lawyers, 66 physicians, 80 political leaders, three \nsenators, three governors, countless preachers and missionariesand \none traitor, Aaron Burr.\u0014",

    "words": "August 23, 1572 \u0014\nNot Peace but a Sword on St. Bartholomew's Day\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nIn France, following the Reformation, Calvinists known as Huguenots \nsprang up in large numbers. The Roman Catholic establishment \npersecuted them. Manipulated by French political leaders, the \nHuguenots rose to defend their rights. Their behavior and methods in \nturn outraged Catholics. War ravaged France. Although fewer in \nnumbers than their foes, the Huguenots fought so fiercely they \nmanaged to extract concessions which allowed them to build churches \nand manage affairs in cities where they had majorities. But the \nbloodshed imprinted lasting animosity between Protestants and the \nCatholic majority.\u0014\n\u0014\nOut of this smoldering hatred flared up one of the most regrettable \nevents of church history. On August 22, 1572 an attempt was made in \nParis to assassinate Huguenot leader and French patriot Coligny. \nWounded, he returned home to recover. Accounts disagree as to what \nhappened next and who was responsible. Late on this day, August 23, \n1572, armed men, led by the Guises, broke into Coligny's apartment, \novercame the fierce resistance of his guards and killed him. \nColigny's death was the signal for a general butchery of the \nHuguenots. This atrocity is known to history as the St. Bartholomew's \nDay Massacre because it lasted well into that saint's day.\u0014\n\u0014\nCatholics slaughtered Huguenots in cold blood into the morning of the \n24th in Paris and for days in outlying regions. As many as 70,000 \nperished. The rest fled to fortified cities and fought back. Their \nmovement became known as La Cause (The Cause) and pitted them against \nThe Holy League (La Sainte Ligue). Brutal fighting raged across the \nFrench kingdom. \u0014\n\u0014\nCharles IX publicly claimed he had ordered the massacre. Certainly \nthe Paris constabulary were warned in advance to prepare for \ndisturbances. Many historians have seen the plot as the work of \nCatherine de Medici, who felt her power threatened. Possibly Charles, \nby taking credit, was trying to reap a political benefit from the \ngruesome event. If so, he won no plaudits outside Catholic regions. \nPope Gregory XIII struck a special medallion to commemorate the \n\"holy\" act but most other European reaction was horrified. Charles \nhimself suffered psychological agonies from the affair.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not the end of the matter. When \nthe Protestant Henry of Navarre converted to Catholicism in order to \nbecome king, he granted his Huguenot compatriots a number of rights \nunder the Edict of Nantes. These rights were gradually eroded, more \nHuguenot revolts occurred and, finally, 400,000 fled the country into \nvoluntary exile under Louis XIV.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nEerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity.

    "words": "NET WORTH OF OUR PRESIDENTS\u0014\n\u0014\nThe net worth of the presidents varies widely. George Washington was \nworth more than half a billion in today's dollars. Several presidents \nwent bankrupt. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe fortunes of American presidents are tied to the economy at the \ntimes when they lived. For the first 75 years after Washington's \nelection, presidents generally made money on land, crops, and \ncommodity speculation. A president who owned hundreds or thousands of \nacres could lose most or all of his property after a few years of \npoor crop yields. Wealthy Americans occasionally lost all of their \nmoney through land speculation -- leveraging the value of one piece \nof land to buy additional property. Since there was no reliable \nnational banking system and almost no liquidity in the value of \nprivate companies, land was the asset likely to provide the greatest \nyield, if the property yielded enough to support the costs of \noperating the farm or plantation. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause there was no central banking system and no regulatory \nframework for commodities, markets were subject to panics. The panic \nof 1819 was caused by the deep indebtedness of the federal government \nand a rapid drop in the price of cotton. The immature banking system \nwas forced to foreclose on many farms. The value of the properties \nthat were foreclosed on was often low, because land without a \nlandowner meant land without a crop yield. The panic of 1837 caused a \ndepression that lasted six years. It was triggered by a weak wheat \ncrop, a drop in cotton prices, and a speculation-induced leverage \nbubble in the value of land. These factors caused the U.S. economy to \ngo through a multi-year period of deflation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe sharp fluctuations in the fortunes of the first 14 presidents \nwere a result of the economic times. \u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning with Millard Fillmore in 1850, the financial history of the \npresidency entered a new era. Most presidents were lawyers who spent \nyears in public service. They rarely amassed large fortunes and their \nincomes were often almost entirely from their salaries. From Fillmore \nto Garfield, these American presidents were distinctly middle class. \nThey often retired without the money to support themselves in a \nfashion anywhere close to the one that they had in office. Buchanan, \nLincoln, Johnson, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield had almost no net worth \nat all.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rise of inherited wealth in the early twentieth century \ncontributed to the fortunes of many presidents, including Theodore \nRoosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and both of the \nBushes. The other significant change to the economy was the advent of \nlarge professionally organized corporations. These corporations \nproduced much of the oil, mining, financial, and railroad fortunes \namassed at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the \ntwentieth. The Kennedys were wealthy because of the financial empire \nbuilt by Joseph Kennedy. Herbert Hoover made millions of dollars as \nthe owner of mining companies. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe stigma of making money from being a retired president also began \nto disappear. Calvin Coolidge made a large income from his newspaper \ncolumn. Gerald Ford, who had almost no money when he was a \nCongressman made a small fortune from serving on the boards of large \ncompanies. Clinton made millions of dollars from writing his \nautobiography. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nWe analyzed presidential finances based on historical sources. Most \nmedia evaluations of the net worth of presidents have come up with a \nvery wide range, a spread in which the highest figure was often \nseveral times the lowest estimate. Most sources provided no hard \nfigures at all. Largely, we have focused on the analysis of recent \nchief executives. This is because it is much easier to calculate \nfigures in a world where assets and incomes are a matter of public \nrecord.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most important conclusions of this analysis is that the \npresidency has little to do with wealth. Several U.S. presidents \nbrought huge net worths to the job. Many lost most of their fortunes \nafter leaving office. Some never had any significant money at all. \u0014\n\u0014\nMichael B. Sauter, Ashley C. Allen, and Douglas A. McIntyre are \neditors of 24/7 Wall St.\u0014",

This revolt was one of \nmore than 250 documented revolts by slaves. The most famous slave \nrevolts included those lead by Denmark Vesey and Gabriel Prosser. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome people called Nat Turner a heathen while others called him a \nChristian prophet. Nat Turner was possessed by the spirit world of \nboth his African ancestors and the new Christian world he was forced \ninto. It is said that as a child Turner spoke about things that \noccurred before his birth. He was known as a outstanding and gifted \nspeaker. He said aloud what the slaves felt inside. Turner found the \nbiblical scriptures that called slavery unjust and contrary to the \nwill of God. He had numerous visions about God's justice for the \nslaves and held the slave community spellbound as he preached and \ncommunicated his visions. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt was a series of visions from God that convinced Nat that he should \nstruggle against the enslavement of his people. The first of these \nvisions occurred in 1828. In this vision, it was revealed to Turner \nthat the time was coming when \"the first would be last and the last \nwould be first.\" Nat's visions culminated in a slave uprising that \nbegan on August 21, 1831. Including his master and his family, sixty \nwhites were killed in a twenty four hour period. The following day \nState and Federal troops arrived in Southampton county to stop the \nrevolt. Once the revolt was put down, black slaves were randomly \narrested, put on trial and hanged. Just before being sent to the \ngallows, Turner was asked, \"Do you not find yourself mistaken now?\" \nto which Nat replied, \"Was not Christ crucified.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe aftermath of the Southampton revolt led to the strengthening of \nthe \"Black Codes\" throughout the south. These codes included laws \nthat specified that slaves cannot: assemble in groups of more than 5; \nown property or testify in court; strike a white; learn to read or \nwrite; buy or sell goods; conduct a religious service without a white \nperson present; beat drums, etc. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe frequent and numerous slave revolts proved that the slaves were \nnot happy. They yearned for freedom and were willing to pay for it \nwith their lives, if necessary.\u0014",

    "words": "March 22, 235 \u0014\n\u0014\nNicea Ruling on Easter Day\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat is the most important day in the Christian year? Ask the average \nperson in the United States and chances are you will hear \n\"Christmas.\" But in the early centuries of the church, the day of the \nresurrection was more important.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom its earliest days, the church annually celebrated the \nanniversary of Jesus' resurrection, often calling the holiday the \nChristian Passover. (The Greek name for Passover was Pasch, so Easter \nis sometimes called Paschal; Easter is an English word.) Even while \nthe apostles were alive, Christians moved their day of worship to \nSunday because Christ had risen from the grave on the first day of \nthe week. Christians were often baptized at Easter. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the second century, however, a debate arose over when to celebrate \nthe resurrection. Most churches held the festival on the Sunday \nclosest to the Jewish Passover. Sometimes there was doubt as to which \nof the two nearest Sundays should be observed. The churches in Asia \nMinor frequently observed the resurrection on the date of the Jewish \nPassover, even when it was not on a Sunday. In Rome, different \ncongregations observed different days!\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the first three centuries of the church, it was frequently \nunder persecution and there was no attempt to standardize the \nChristian festivals. However, when Constantine became emperor and \nChristianity was no longer illegal, it was possible to consider more \ncarefully the date of Easter. One of the purposes of the Council of \nNicea in 325 was to settle that date.\u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine did not want Easter to be celebrated on the Jewish \nPassover. He said it was a Christian \"duty to have nothing in common \nwith the murderers of our Lord\" (ignoring the fact that Christ's \nexecution was a joint effort of Jews and Gentiles).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Nicea accordingly required the feast of the \nresurrection to be celebrated on a Sunday and never on the day of the \nJewish Passover. Easter was to be on the Sunday after the first full \nmoon following the Spring equinox. This meant the date of Easter \nwould always fall between March 22nd and April 25th. Today, March 22, \nis the earliest date on which Easter can fall. Since there is seldom \na full moon on March 21st, Easter does not often fall on the 22nd. \nThe last time it did was in 1818. In the twentieth century, it never \nfell on this day.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ruling of the Council was not immediately accepted everywhere. It \ndid not sit well with those who had been celebrating the resurrection \non Passover to suddenly learn they were being called heretics. \nConfusion was also caused because Rome and Alexandria fixed the \nSpring equinox (the day in the Spring when day and night are equal) \nby different methods. Eventually, however, the ruling of the Council \nof Nicea was accepted by all of the western church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story by Diane \nSeverance, Ph.D.\u0014\nChinews. \"Today in History, March 22.\"\u0014\n\"Easter.\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, edited by F. \nL.

    "title": "NO EASY ANSWERS TO WHY GOD ALLOWS SUFFERING, EVIL",
    "words": "PSALM 13, GENESIS 22\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is probably no greater argument for God's non-existence than \nthe problem of evil. \u0014\n\u0014\nTheodicy, a term used by philosophers and theologians to define the \nproblem of evil, is a problem for theists because if God exists as an \nall-knowing, all-powerful and all-loving God, why is there evil and \nsuffering?\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, when speaking of evil being freely done by humans, we can \nmore easily provide a solution to the problem by arguing that humans \nhave free will, and thus human actions to do evil are the choices of \nthose humans.\u0014\n\u0014\nSomeone chooses to hurt another human being, and thus the evil being \ndone is by human volition.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even in these instances, we are faced with a theological problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor example, although it was the planning and choosing of terrorists \nto board planes on Sept. 11, 2001, a plan and choice that ended the \nlives of thousands of innocent people, the questions is, \"Why did God \nnot stop them?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf God is all-knowing, and thus God knows the future, why did God not \nstop the planes from taking off or stop those men from boarding the \nplanes?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, even if God may not be considered all-knowing, surely \ntraditional concepts of God tell us that God is all-powerful.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf so, why did God not use that power to stop the planes just as they \nwere about to crash into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the \nfield in Pennsylvania? Are there things that God cannot know and that \nGod cannot do?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut perhaps the most scathing question about why evil happens \nconcerns the very character of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Christians believe anything about God, it is that God is love, and \nas a benevolent God, we would hope that God would intervene when evil \nis being done.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd yet, there is evil. What does this say about God's love for \nhumanity, particularly when innocent humans suffer in multitudes? \nDoes God truly love?\u0014\n\u0014\nAn even larger problem is that of the suffering caused by natural \ndisasters. Though humans may have an influence on the way our \nenvironment operates, the existence of natural disasters throughout \nthe history of the world serves very well the argument for God's \nnon-existence.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr, at the very least, if a being known as God does exist, that being \ndoes not exist as the God we humans have defined as all-knowing, \nall-powerful and all-loving. In this regard, the atheist's argument \nis valid.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut perhaps what troubles me the most as a theist who is riddled with \ndoubts and questions concerns the story from Genesis 22  the story \nof God commanding Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, I know we read this story and say \"All's well that ends well,\" \nrushing past all that happens in the story to the happy ending, but \nthis skirts the heart of the problem we are faced with in this text.\u0014\n\u0014\nGod, according to this story, actually commanded Abraham to sacrifice \nhis son in order to test Abraham's loyalty.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes God commanding Abraham to sacrifice Isaac match anything we know \nof God's character? What kind of God forces this kind of test on a \nperson? Could God not have tested Abraham in another way?\u0014\n\u0014\nCould we say that God, for all intents and purposes, would have been \nthe author of this evil act if Abraham would have gone through with \nit?\u0014\n\u0014\nI know, I know, he did not go through with it because \"God stopped \nhim.\" But what if God had not stopped him? Or what if God had called \nout to Abraham to stop what he was doing, but Abraham did not hear \nGod, or he was confused about what to do and he went forward with \nGod's original command? Would this make Abraham guilty of murder  or \nGod?\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of this might be splitting hairs, but with such an important \nquestion as the problem of evil, we need to be as thorough as \npossible with our questions, and we ought to deal honestly with God's \nexplicit and active role in evil or at least in God's complicit and \ninactive role in allowing evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy? Because the problem of evil is not just an abstract \nphilosophical and theological problem. It is a very personal problem, \nand none of us is free from suffering. And, when we do experience \nsuffering, life becomes disoriented, and the expression \"it feels \nlike my world is falling apart\" is very appropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor theists, like myself, however, there is no good solution to the \nproblem of evil, although for me it is easier to see God as not being \nall-knowing and all-powerful than it is to question God's benevolence.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut though each solution is inadequate, I do think we can follow the \npattern of many of the psalms of lament that not only express the \nanguish of human suffering, but that also offer a model for \nprotesting God's involvement, or at least God's neglect.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide \nyour face from me?\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThese opening words of Psalm 13 express the honest pain the psalmist \nfeels as he questions the love and providence of God. He takes his \nanger to God in a bold and honest prayer of accusation, blaming God \nfor forgetting him, for hiding from him, for not loving him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason he can call out to God with such raw and honest language \nis that God is the only one to whom he can bring his prayers of \nprotest that call out to God for help, particularly when the pain, \nthe suffering, the loss is so overwhelming.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven Jesus, in his most agonizing moments of death, screamed in \nprotest to God, \"My God, my God. Why have your abandoned me?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTheodicy will continue to remain a conundrum. Some have been so \nconfounded by the problem that they have abandoned a belief in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile I have not reached the point of completely abandoning my belief \nin God, I am often confused by God's justice and I can only cry out, \n\"How long, O Lord?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDrew Smith, an ordained Baptist minister, is director of \ninternational programs at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, \nArk.

    "title": "NERO UNLEASHED FIRST WAVE OF TERROR",
    "words": "July 19, 64 \u0014\n\u0014\nNero Unleashed First Wave of Terror\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first state-sponsored terror against Christians in the Roman \nEmpire came at the order of one of the most debased of all emperors: \nNero. Tacitus, the Roman historian, in Book XV of his Annals,gives a \nlengthy account of Nero's debaucheries and cruelties. These led the \nRomans to distrust him.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo despised was Nero that when Rome caught fire, on this day, July \n19, 64, popular opinion attributed the catastrophe to him. Many \ncitizens perished in the flames. The fire was aggravated by rowdies \nwho threw firebrands into untouched houses, claiming they had been \nordered to do so. In the public mind, those orders came from Nero. A \nrumor spread that Nero had appeared on a stage during the catastrophe \nand sung a song \"comparing present misfortunes with the calamities of \nantiquity,\" especially Troy.\u0014\n\u0014\nNero tried to counter this downturn in his \"public approval ratings\" \nby throwing open his own resources to the homeless. He sponsored a \nnumber of religious activities designed to show himself innocent. \nNothing worked. And so he determined to find scapegoats. He fastened \nupon the Christians as most suitable for his diabolical purpose.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few who admitted their faith were tortured until they revealed the \nnames of others. Beginning a few weeks after the fire, the city was \nthe scene of every imaginable torment. And not Rome only, for \npersecution spread throughout the empire. But in the capital Nero \nheld nightly spectacles in which every torture was applied to the \nsuffering saints.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome were burned alive. Others were sewn into the skins of wild \nanimals and given to dogs to tear. Still others were crucified. \nMartyrs were exhibited in the circus with Nero presiding, dressed as \na charioteer. The wicked emperor threw open his own gardens to more \nsuch spectacles. So many Christians died so brutally that public \nsympathy swung in their favor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe people realized that Christians were being put to death not for \nstarting the fire but to cover Nero's crimes and to sate his appetite \nfor cruelty. Compassion for the meek followers of Jesus, whose \nblameless conduct was apparent to many, led to a new wave of \nconversions.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who almost certainly perished in Nero's fury in Rome was \nthe apostle Peter. Paul is thought to have been executed a few years \nlater. Others who were martyred elsewhere in the empire were the \nBishop of Damascus and a man mentioned in scripture: Joseph called \nBarsabas. Paul's fellow minister, Trophimus, is also said to have \nperished in this outpouring of hostility as did many others whose \nnames we do not know. Christ had taught that as men persecuted him so \nthey would persecute his followers. A servant is not above his master.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDurant, Will. Caesar and Christ.

Paul simply assumes that believers will give all they can to \nmeet as many needs as they can in order to glorify God as much as \nthey can.

    "title": "NEWSWEEK DOES EXTENSIVE STUDY ON FORGIVENESS",
    "words": "Newsweek magazine (9/27/2004) ran a major article on the question of \nforgiveness. That's pretty unusual for a secular magazine, but the \nsubject is more than a theological issue, it is one of the hottest \nfields of research in clinical psychology today. It raised the \nquestion of how many of us are ready to forgive someone who has done \nus harm or hurt our feelings or even the jerk who cut into the line \nat Krispy Kreme? . \u0014\n\u0014\nThe conclusion of the Newsweek studies is phenomenal. It clearly \ndocuments that persistent unforgiveness is part of human nature, but \nit appears to work to the detriment not just of our spiritual \nwell-being but our physical health as well. Dr. Everett Worthington, \nof Virginia Commonwealth University, is one of the leaders in these \nstudies. His experience makes him a great candidate for this project. \nHis own mother was viciously killed a few years ago in Richmond by an \nintruder into her home where she lived alone. He sets an example for \nus on learning to forgive. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis research suggests that forgiveness works in at least two ways. \nOne is by reducing the stress of the state of unforgiveness.  It \nhelps solve or prevent some physiological consequencessuch as \nincreased blood pressure and hormonal changeslinked to \ncardiovascular disease, immune suppression and, possibly, impaired \nneurological function and memory. That's not preacher talk, folks; \nthat's science at work.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other benefit of forgiveness is more subtle; it relates to \nresearch showing that people with strong social networksof friends, \nneighbors and familytend to be healthier than loners. Someone who \nnurses grudges and keeps track of every slight is obviously going to \nshed some relationships over the course of a lifetime. Forgiveness, \nthe researchers say, should be incorporated into one's personality, \none's way of life, not just to a specific incident. Bitterness in us \nand an unwillingness to forgive always has a destructive impact in \nour lives. Again, that's not preacher talk; that's science at work. \nJesus would agree with that, by the way.\u0014",

Shed \nstayed at my house a few years ago when she was escaping a bad \nrelationship. She lives Down East, back in her hometown in Carteret \nCounty, North Carolina, in a small one-room house that was her \ngrandmothers sharecropping cabin. She rents the cabin from the man \nwho now owns the land; it is not hers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIve been there once. She had a mattress on the floor, a sofa from a \nRent-a-Center, and a picture of her grandmother on the wall. I wanted \nto let her know that if she was evacuating from the hurricane, there \nwas a sofa waiting for her here.\u0014\nNaw, Im going to ride it out, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone I know Down East and on the shore is riding it out. For a \nfew its bravado, but for most of them, its just that they cant go. \nThere arent enough seats in the car, or the car is busted, or \ntheres no car at all. There are too many babies or too many old \nfolks. There are jobs that wont be there for them if they miss a few \ndays. There are paychecks that havent yet cleared. There are food \nstamps that ran out last week. And there isnt enough money in \nanyones damn bank account.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut, you know, we all love a good hurricane. We fetishize storms. We \nare glued to our televisions and we are refreshing our screens. We \ntalk about the wind speed, we marvel at the tattered piers. Its \nalmost like we want it. Truth is, I think Alyeesha and all my friends \nare going to be just fine during this storm. After all, as terrifying \nas it is, we know its not Florence that wreaks havoc on North \nCarolina. Its everything that comes after the storm, and everything \nthat came before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hurricane is the drama, the excitement we need. We gather bottled \nwater, toilet paper, snacks. Its something we can do, something we \ncan prepare for. We like the idea of bracing ourselves against the \nwind. We feel enraptured, \u0014\nintoxicated, instinctual, alive. Our lives can be so mundane. So we \nwatch, we watch, we watch. We gorge on hurricanes.\u0014\nWe look away from the flood we know is coming. The slow seep of water \ndown from the mountains, spreading out of its riverbed path, breaking \nout of creeks and cricks, rushing off the pavement of cities and \nheading Down East. The water swallows up crops and homes and pigs. We \nknow this slow seep is not just water, but poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe try not to speak of it. The smeared red clay on living room walls. \nStalled out Buicks getting their last rust. Somebodys work tools \nsinking into the river. Humid air plastering an old Myrtle Beach \nt-shirt onto a body as it shovels filthy toys into trash bags. It is \nmud and muck and poverty. And we know its coming. Its all very \npredictable. So we look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty has always been a flood and not a hurricane. Its always been \na slow, rolling disaster, with muddy gray water under an incongruent \nbright blue sky. Its always been a slow build of mold between \ngenerations, of people making do with babies in faded red milk crates \nfloated on mattresses down city streets. Look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is slow. Its a looming light bill and a long wait on child \nsupport. Its the uncomfortable plastic chairs at DSS and the \ncaseworkers who dont make eye contact. Its the 10 months of \npregnancy with no insurance and lying to the doctor about the cramps \nbecause you cant afford a referral. Its the long wait in jail \nbecause you cant afford bail and long Christmas days when you cant \nafford presents. Its the long nights with the heat out and the long \ncalls trying to reach the landlord. Its the hours in detention after \nyour own boss at the meat processing plant calls immigration on you \nand the long stare you give him while he hires your cousin for less \nmoney under the table. Sometimes poverty is even the long last \nminutes trying to get through the locked door at the Hamlet Chicken \nPlant. So we look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nPoverty is predictable. Its the predictability of underfunded \nschools and outdated textbooks. Its the predictability of an entire \ntwo generations of fathers and mothers being locked up and their \nleft-behind children staring cold-eyed and speaking tight-lipped \nduring the Pledge at school. Its the predictability of legislators \nturning their heads and hog waste and coal ash breaching their \nlevies. Its the predictability that after the storm we will arrest \nthe looters who spent their last dollars on gas when prices surged by \n50 cents before the storm. The predictability of all this makes us \nlook like fools, like fortysomething men wanting twentysomething \nwives. And we are embarrassed by it all. We will look away.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe already know where the flood waters will go. They will follow a \nslow, predictable path. We know who lives in low lying areas, we know \nwhat neighborhoods are on the south side of the tracks. From \nAppalachia down, every town has Hillers and Creekers. Floodplains \nread like maps of the economy and race.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlyeesha has the grit to make it through the storm, but after the \nwinds pass and the bottled water gets loaded back up, she knows that \nthe countrys attention will just move on. Jim Cantore does not come \nfor poverty.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlyeeshas little house may be flooded out. She may lose everything. \nThere is no insurance company to call. Her landlord may just tell her \nhe cant do nothing, just move along. Her friend who drives her to \nwork may not be able to pick her up, and she may lose her job. She \nwill be left standing in the still waters of America, brown water on \nher brown legs, on land that was not her grandmothers and is not \nhers, with no place but my sofa to go.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats the predictable slow drip of poverty. All your life youve \nwatched the water rise, knowing no one is coming to get you. After \nall, they told you to get out.\u0014",

As he neared their land, he was suddenly surrounded by a \nsavage band of warriors, all pointing their spears straight at his \nheart.

Snyder's genius \nand courage lies having the guts NOT to adopt the traditional \njournalistic frame of either \"What a tragedy, too bad nothing can be \ndone!\" or \"Why do THOSE women go back to their batterers?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead of blaming the victim or focusing on their perceived \ninadequacies, she has the guts, nuance and complexity to frame it \nlike this: \"Why do our systems (legal, media, practical, \npsychological, social, cultural) provide so little protection and \nsupport to women who want to leave batterers and don't want to be \nbeaten up or assassinated by men who say they love them? What can WE \n(the larger society) do to change this?\u0014\n\u0014\nShe shifts the responsibility from the victim to the larger systems \nin which they are entangled, and often inadvertently victimized by. \nShe's not afraid of a feminist analysis of male privilege and its \nrole in the thinking and emotions of batterers and the failure of \nlarger systems to treat this issue as seriously as, say, gun violence \nin high schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is not a depressing book, at least not to me, because she \nexplores solutions, such as intervention programs for batterers, and \nother changes in law and policy that are doing good. I also ended up, \noddly enough, with more compassion for batterers -- when you look at \nthis from the whole systems perspective, you see their backgrounds \nare also marked frequently with emotional or physical abandonment, \nwitnessing domestic violence as children or being beaten themselves,, \nand alcoholic or addicted parents. Very inspiring book Hope it helps \ncatalyze a movement. Sometimes the changes needed are as simple as \ngiving a woman the money to get the locks changed, or not bailing the \nguy out immediately.\u0014\n\u0014\nNO VISIBLE BRUISES by Rachel Snyder\u0014\n\u0014\n-------\u0014\n\u0014\n just finished No Visible Bruises and found a lot that was valuable \nin it. I have worked with child survivors of domestic abuse and have \none relative who fled an abusive marriage and another who was killed \nby a family member. The degree to which Snyder embeds herself with \npolice officers, counselors, and others addressing this complicated \nand devastating problem is admirable. The story of the Cleveland \npolice officer, in particular, is very moving.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, there were two major omissions. The first is the absence of \nreligion as a confounding factor. The Southern Baptist Convention is \nin turmoil over the churches response, or lack thereof, to domestic \nviolence. This is an issue not just for Baptists, but for all faiths \nthat promote mens superiority and womens submission. Snyder does \nnot address the role of religion and religious organizations, not as \nan exacerbating factor nor as an avenue for victims to get help.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe second is the omission of middle/upper class abuse among her \ncases. A shelter worker I spoke to told me that wealthier women have \na much harder time getting help - they are often economically \ndependent, they fear no one would believe their successful husband \nwas doing this, and they are often more isolated within their \ncommunity. This omission weakens the book considerably, as readers \nwho are middle/upper class might (continue to) view domestic violence \nas a problem of those people. Of course it is not, but a reader of \nSnyders book would not come away with that impression.\u0014\n\u0014\nSnyder makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of domestic \nviolence as progressive and pervasive. However, the narrowness of her \nfocus makes the book less informative than it might have been.\u0014",
