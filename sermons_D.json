    "title": "DOES GOD SUFFER WITH US?",
    "words": "\"People who severely suffer are not helped by the assurance \nthat all is going well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   In a previous issue of Pastoral Psychology (see 8363), Michael \nCavanagh proposed that some conceptions of God are psychospiritually \nhelpful, and others unhelpful.  Least helpful are the views of God as \nvengeful, needy, as a caretaker, and as a tutor.  Marcel Sarot of \nUtrecht University, The Netherlands, further develops the theological \ndistinction between adequate and inadequate conceptions of God.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The task is challenging because it's difficult to diagnose the \nconcept of God underlying a problem, and because the minister must \nhave the theological discernment of what are satisfactory and \nunsatisfactory concepts.  Concerning compassion, at issue is whether \nthe helpful view of God is as a fellow-sufferer or as an impassible \nnon-sufferer.\u0014\n\u0014\n   God as a co-sufferer is validated by the belief that only one who \nreally suffers is able to identify with and enter into another's \npain, thereby offering comfort and hope.  On the other hand, some \nargue that God is able to give comfort because He Himself is not \nsuffering as we are, and He offers hope that all will be well in the \nlong run.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Sarot's conclusion is that both concepts can be beneficial, \ndepending on the degree of pain and suffering involved.  God as \nimpassible and non- suffering is demonstrated by the parent who is \nable to comfort and sympathize with a child's relatively minor \nsufferings because he is not experiencing the same agony the child \nis.  For serious griefs, however, it is more comforting to think of \nGod as entering into our suffering with us, though not \"participating \nin and upset by each discomfort.\"  Empirical research is beginning to \nconfirm this theological position.\u0014\n\u0014\n  \"Pastoral counseling and the compassionate God\" by Marcel Sarot.  \nPastoral Psychology, Jan 1995(Vol 43, No 3).

French novelist Francois Mauriac captured the \ndanger in his story \"The Woman of the Pharisees.\"  This woman, the \n\"grande dame\"  of the valley, very rich in houses and land, was \ncommitted to the poor people in her village, feeling it her duty to \nvisit them all regularly, always leaving behind a gift suitable to \ntheir needs -- as she saw them -- along with a suggestion that a \nlittle more ambition and a little more thrift could improve their \nsituation.  She never left a poor family's house without making them \nfeel worse for her having been there.  She depressed them with her \ndutiful visits and gifts, and they hated her for the gifts almost as \nmuch as they hated themselves for accepting them.  Her duty was \nactually to her reputation as a rich woman committed to poor people.\u0014\n     Mauriac's story reminds one of an epitaph written by C.S. Lewis:\u0014\n       Erected by her sorrowing brothers\u0014\n       In memory of Martha Clay\u0014\n       Here lies one one who lived for others,\u0014\n       Now she has peace.

    "words": "A Story To Live By\u0014\n by Ann Wells (Los Angeles Times)\u0014\n\u0014\n My brother-in-law opened the bottom drawer of my sister's bureau and \nlifted out a tissue-wrapped package.  \"This,\" he said, \"is not a \nslip.  This is lingerie.\"  He discarded the tissue and handed me the \nslip. It was exquisite; silk, handmade and trimmed with a cobweb of \nlace. The price tag with an astronomical figure on it was still \nattached.  \"Jan bought this the first time we went to New York, at  \nleast 8 or 9 years ago. She never wore it. She was saving it for a \nspecial occasion. Well, I guess this is the occasion.\" He took the \nslip from me and put it on the bed with the other clothes we were \ntaking to the mortician. His hands lingered on the soft material for \na moment, then he slammed the drawer shut and turned to me. \"Don't \never save anything for a special occasion. Every day you're alive is \na special occasion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nI remembered those words through the funeral and the days that \nfollowed when I helped him and my niece attend to all the sad chores \nthat follow an unexpected death. I thought about them on the plane \nreturning to California from the Midwestern town where my sister's \nfamily lives. I thought about all the things that she hadn't seen or \nheard or done. I thought about the things that she had done without \nrealizing that they were special.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm still thinking about his words, and they've changed my life. I'm \nreading more and dusting less. I'm sitting on the deck and admiring \nthe view without\u0014\nfussing about the weeds in the garden. I'm spending more time with my \nfamily and friends and less time in committee meetings. Whenever \npossible, life should be a pattern of experience to savor, not  \nendure. I'm trying to\u0014\nrecognize these moments now and cherish them. I'm not \"saving\" \nanything; we use our good china and crystal for every special \nevent-such as losing a pound, getting the sink unstopped, the first \ncamellia blossom. I wear my good blazer to the market if I feel like \nit. My theory is if I\u0014\nlook prosperous, I can shell out $28.49 for one small bag of \ngroceries without wincing. I'm not saving my good perfume for  \nspecial parties; clerks in hardware stores and tellers in banks  have \nnoses that function as well as\u0014\nmy party-going friends'.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Someday\" and \"one of these days\" are losing their grip on my \nvocabulary. If it's worth seeing or hearing or doing, I want to see \nand hear and do  it now.\u0014\nI'm not sure what my sister would have done had she known that she \nwouldn't be here for the tomorrow we  all take for granted. I think \nshe would have called\u0014\nfamily members  and a few close friends. She might have called a few \nformer friends to apologize and mend fences for past squabbles.  I \nlike to think she would have gone out for a Chinese dinner,  her \nfavorite food. I'm\u0014\nguessing- I'll never know.  It's those little things left undone that \nwould make me angry if I knew that\u0014\nmy hours were limited. Angry because I put off seeing good Friends \nwhom I was going to get in touch with-someday. Angry because I hadn't \nwritten certain\u0014\nletters that I intended to write-one of these days. Angry and sorry \nthat I didn't tell my husband and daughter often enough how much I \ntruly love them.\u0014\n\u0014\nI'm trying very hard not to put off, hold back, or save anything that \nwould add laughter and luster to our lives. And every morning when I \nopen my eyes, I tell myself that it is special. Every day, every \nminute, every breath truly is...a gift from God.\u0014",

    "words": "[Note: Sometimes a story comes to our attention that needs no \npolishing or enhancement to make it good. This is one of those.  It \nis a real letter submitted to the IRS in the midst of last year's \n(1994) weird and bizarre denial of dependents, exemptions, and \ncredits.  We believe the letter speaks for itself.]\u0014\n\u0014\nDear Sirs:\u0014\n         I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two \nof the three dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. \nThank you.   I have questioned whether these are my children or not \nfor years. They are evil and expensive. It's only fair that since \nthey are minors and not my responsibility that the government (who \nevidently is taxing me more to care for these waifs) knows something \nabout them and what to expect over the next year. You may apply next \nyear to reassign them to me and reinstate the deduction.  This year \nthey are yours!\u0014\n\u0014\n         The oldest, Kristen, is now 17.  She is brilliant.  Ask \nher!  I suggest you put her to work in your office where she can \nanswer people's questions about their returns. While she has no \nformal training, it has not seemed to hamper her knowledge of any \nother subject you can name.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaxes should be a breeze; Next year she is going to college.  I think \nit's wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little \nexpense. While you mull that over, keep in mind that she has a \ntruck.  It doesn't run at the moment so you have the immediate \ndecision of appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the \nvehicle or getting up early to drive her to school.  \u0014\n\u0014\nKristen also has a boyfriend.  Oh joy!  While she possesses all of \nthe wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it \nbest to occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence, and in \nthe face of overwhelming passion, safe sex. This is always \nuncomfortable and I am quite relieved you will be handling this in \nthe future.  May I suggest that you reinstate Joycelyn Elders who had \na rather good handle on the problem.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick is 14.  I've had my suspicions about this one.  His eyes are \na little close together for normal people.  He may be a tax examiner \nhimself one day if you do not incarcerate him first.  In February, I \nwas\u0014\nawakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing \nPat home.  He and his friends were TP'ing houses.  In the future \nwould you like him delivered to the local IRS office or to Ogden, UT? \u0014\n\u0014\n Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare.  His hair is purple.  \nPermanent dye, temporary dye, what's the big deal?  Learn to deal \nwith it.  You'll have\u0014\nplenty of time as he is sitting out a few days of school after \ninstigating a food fight.  I'll take care of filing your phone number \nwith the vice principal.  Oh yes, he and all of his friends have \nraging hormones.  This is the house of testosterone and it will be \nmuch more\u0014\npeaceful when he lives in your home.  DO NOT leave any of them \nunsupervised with girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatables, \nvehicles, or telephones.  (I'm sure that you will find telephones a \nsource of\u0014\nunimaginable amusement, and be sure to lock out the 900 and 976 \nnumbers!)\u0014\n\u0014\nHeather is an alien.  She slid through a time warp and appeared quite \nby magic one year.  I'm sure this one is yours.  She is 10 going on \n21.  She came from a bad trip in the sixties.  She wears tie-dyed \nclothes, beads, sandals, and hair that looks like Tiny Tim's. \nFortunately you will be raising my taxes to help offset the pinch of \nher remedial reading courses.  Hooked On Phonics is expensive so the \nschools dropped it.  Good news! You can buy it yourself for half the \namount of\u0014\nthe deduction that you are denying!  It's quite obvious that we were \nterrible parents (ask the other two) so they have helped raise this \none to a new level of terror. \u0014\n\u0014\n She cannot speak English.  Most people under twenty understand the \ncurious patois she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the \ndrugged/reggae/yuppie/ political doublespeak.  I don't. The school \nsends her to a speech pathologist who has her roll her R's. It added \na refreshing Mexican/Irish touch to her voice.  She wears hats \nbackwards, pants baggy and wants one of her ears pierced four more \ntimes. There is a fascination with tattoos that worries me but I am \nsure that you can handle it.  Bring a truck when you come to get her, \nshe sort of \"nests\" in her room and I think that it would be easier \nto move the entire thing than find out what it is really made of.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou denied two of the three exemptions so it is only fair you get to \npick which two you will take.  I prefer that you take the youngest, I \nstill go bankrupt with Kristen's college but then I am free! If you \ntake\u0014\nthe two oldest then I still have time for counseling before Heather \nbecomes a teenager.  If you take the two girls then I won't feel so \nbad about putting Patrick in a military academy.

For those not familiar with the  \nDarwin Award - It's an annual honor given to the person who did  the \nuniversal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in \nthe most extraordinarily stupid way. As always, competition this year \nhas been keen. Some candidates appear to have trained their whole \nlives for this event.\u0014\n\u0014\n 1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned \nin two feet of water after squeezing head first through an \n18-inch-wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys.\u0014\n\u0014\n 2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who \"totally \nzoned when he ran,\" according to his wife, accidentally jogged off a \n200-foot-high cliff on his daily run.\u0014\n\u0014\n 3. Buxton, NC: A man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he  \nhad dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it. Beachgoers said \nDaniel Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun, or protection from the wind, \nand had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday \nafternoon when it collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand. \nPeople on the beach, on the outer banks, used their hands and \nshovels, trying to claw their way to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, \nVA, but could not reach him. It took rescue workers using heavy \nequipment almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked \non. Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\n 4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in Lompoc, CA, as \nhe fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was \nburglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed \nin his mouth (to keep his hands free) crammed against the base of his \nskull as he hit the floor. \u0014\n\u0014\n 5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, \n20, was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, \n23, who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the \nflakvest Berrena was wearing.\u0014\n\u0014\n 6. Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26, was killed in February in\u0014\n Selbyville, Del., as he won a bet with friends who said he would not \nput a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the \ntrigger.\u0014\n\u0014\n 7. In February, according to police in Windsor, Ont., Daniel  Kolta, \n27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus earning a \ntie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles.\u0014\n\u0014\n 8. In September, a 7-year-old boy fell off a 100-foot-high bluff \nnear Ozark, Ark., after he lost his grip swinging on a cross that \nmarked the spot where another person had fallen to his death in 1990.\u0014\n\u0014\n DARWIN AWARD HONOURABLE MENTIONS\u0014\n \u0014\n (1) In Guthrie, Okla., in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a \nmillipede with a shot from his .22-caliber rifle, but the bullet \nricocheted off a rock near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in \nthe head, fracturing his skull.\u0014\n\u0014\n (2) In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Martyn Eskins, attempting to clean \nout cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in favor of a \npropane torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second \nfloors of his house.\u0014\n\u0014\n (3) Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in Andover Township, NJ,  in \nSeptember, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by a quarter-stick \nof dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around at 2 AM, \nthe bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window \nto see what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that \nthe window was closed. \u0014\n\u0014\n (4) Taking \"Amateur Night\" Too Far: In Betulia, Colombia, an annual \nfestival in November includes five days of amateur bullfighting. This \nyear, no bull was killed, but dozens of matadors were injured, \nincluding one gored in the head and one Bobbittized. Said one \nparticipant, \"It's just one bull against a town of a thousand morons\"\u0014",

I'll confess that I lied.\u0014\nI really went out for a moonlight ride.\u0014\nThen all of a sudden, she saw a big flash\u0014\noh God, Please help us!   We're going to crash!\u0014\n\u0014\nShe doesn't remember the force of impact.\u0014\nJust that everything all of a sudden went black.\u0014\nShe felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble,\u0014\nAnd heard, call an ambulance! These kids are in trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nVoices she heard...... a few words at best.\u0014\nBut she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck.\u0014\nThen wondered to herself if Jeff was all right,\u0014\nAnd if the people in the other car were alive.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe awoke in the hospital to faces so sad.\u0014\n\"You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad.\"\u0014\nThese voices echoed inside her head,\u0014\nAs they gently told her that Jeff was dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey said \"Jenny, we've done all we can do,\u0014\nbut it looks as if we'll lose you too.\"\u0014\nBut the people in the other car!?? Jenny cried.\u0014\n \"We're sorry, Jenny, they also died.\u0014\n\u0014\nJenny prayed, \"God, forgive me for what I've done\u0014\nI only wanted to have just one night of fun.\"\u0014\n\"Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim,\u0014\nAnd wish I could return their families to them.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Tell  Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied,\u0014\nAnd that it's my fault so many have died.\"\u0014\nOh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me??\u0014\nThe nurse just stood there ~ she never agreed.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes\u0014\nAnd a few moments later Jenny died.\u0014\nA man asked the nurse, \"Why didn't you do your best\u0014\nto bid that girl her one last request??\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe looked at the man with eyes oh so sad.\u0014\n\"Because the people in the other car were her mom and dad.\"\u0014\nThis story is sad and unpleasant but true,\u0014\nso young people take heed, it could have been you.\u0014\n\u0014\nDrinking and driving is NOT cool.

The problem \noccurs when cells are instructed by the little chromosomes to make a \nmale baby instead.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause there are only so many cells to go around, the cells \nnecessary to develop a male's reproductive organs have to come from \ncells already assigned elsewhere in the female.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecent tests have shown that these cells are removed from the \ncommunications center of the brain, migrate lower in the body and \ndevelop into male sexual organs.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you visualize a normal brain to be similar to a full deck of \ncards, this means that males are born a few cards short, so to speak. \nAnd some of their cards end-up in their shorts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis difference between the male and female brain manifests itself in \nvarious ways. Little girls will tend to play things like house or \nlearn to read. Little boys, however, will tend to do things like \nplacing a bucket over their heads and running into walls. Little \ngirls will think about doing things before taking any action. Little \nboys will just punch or kick something and will look surprised if \nsomeone asks them why they just punched their little brother who was \nhalf asleep and looking the other way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis basic cognitive difference continues to grow until puberty, when \nthe hormones kick into action and the trouble really begins.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter puberty, not only the size of the male and female brains \ndiffer, but the center of thought also differs. Women think with \ntheir heads.\u0014\n\u0014\nMale thoughts often originate lower in their bodies where their \nex-brain cells reside.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, the size of this problem varies from man to man. In some \nmen only a small number of brain cells migrate and they are left with \nnearly full mental capacity, but they tend to be rather dull, \nsexually speaking.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch men are known in medical terms as \"Republicans.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOther men suffer larger brain cell relocation. These men are \nmedically referred to as \"Democrats.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA small number of men suffer massive brain cell migration to their \ngroins.

He failed \nthe test. \u0014\n\u0014\nOswald Smith had set his direction, but now life gave him a detour. \nWhat would he do? As Oswald Smith prayed, God planted another idea in \nhis heart. If he could not go as a missionary, he would build a \nchurch which could send out missionaries. And that is what he did. \nOswald Smith pastored The People's Church in Toronto, Canada, which \nsent out more missionaries than any other church at that time. Oswald \nSmith brought God into the situation, and God transformed his detour \ninto a main thoroughfare of service. (Brian L.Harbour, \"Rising Above \nthe Crowd\")\u0014",

The\u0014\n                    Human Genome\u0014\n                    Project, at $250\u0014\n                    million and\u0014\n                    counting, is\u0014\n                    biology's moon\u0014\n                    shot. In the eyes of\u0014\n                    boosters, it\u0014\n                    promises to provide\u0014\n                    no less than the operating instructions for a \nhuman body, and will\u0014\n                    revolutionize the detection, prevention and \ntreatment of conditions\u0014\n                    from cancer to depression to old age itself. In \nthe eyes of critics, it\u0014\n                    threatens to undermine privacy and bring on \n\"genetic discrimination\"\u0014\n                    in insurance and employment. Near the finish \nline, one effect is\u0014\n                    indisputable: the genome has reignited the \nbiotech industry.\u0014\n                    Explaining the genomeand what it means for you. \u0014\n\u0014\n                    Every Friday morning at 11, the directors of the \nfive labs leading the race to\u0014\n                    decipher the human genome confer by phone to \nassess their progress. In\u0014\n                    mid-March, it was clear they were closing in on \nthe next big milestone:\u0014\n                    reading the 2 billionth chemical \"letter\" in \nhuman DNA. But since some of\u0014\n                    those letters were redundant, a count of 2 \nbillion would not really tell how\u0014\n                    close they were to the finish line of 3.2 billion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Greg Schuler, a molecular biologist turned \ncomputer jock at the National\u0014\n                    Institutes of Health, had just spent the weekend, \nsitting on the sofa with his\u0014\n                    laptop in front of his fireplace at home, writing \na 674-line program to\u0014\n                    reanalyze the overlaps. When he sicced it on the \nredundant sequences, the\u0014\n                    answer popped out: the Human Genome Project had \nalready passed the 2\u0014\n                    billion mark, on March 9. It had taken four years \nto determine the first billion\u0014\n                    letters in the human genome, but only four months \nfor what Schuler calls \"that\u0014\n                    next odometer moment.\" The actual chemical letter \nwasdrumroll,\u0014\n                    pleaseT.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    All right, so it didn't really matter which of \nthe four letters making up DNA\u0014\n                    claimed position number 2,000,000,000 in the \nlargest, most expensive, most\u0014\n                    ambitious biology project ever undertaken. But \nafter 13 years and $250\u0014\n                    million, through the work of some 1,100 \nbiologists, computer scientists and\u0014\n                    technicians at 16 (mostly university) labs in 6 \ncountries, the announcement\u0014\n                    meant that the Human Genome Project was two \nthirds of the way toward its\u0014\n                    goal of determining the exact chemical sequence \nthat constitutes the DNA in\u0014\n                    every cell of every human body. With competitors \nin the private sector\u0014\n                    goading them on, scientists in the public project \nhave tripled their pace,\u0014\n                    sequencing 12,000 letters every minute of every \nday, 24/7. By last weekend\u0014\n                    the project, financed by the U.S. government and \nBritain's Wellcome Trust,\u0014\n                    had sequenced 2,104,257,000 chemical letters. At \nthis rate, it will complete\u0014\n                    its \"working draft\"90 percent of the genome, \nwith an accuracy of 99.9\u0014\n                    percentin June. And science will know the \nblueprint of human life, the code\u0014\n                    of codes, the holy grail, the source code of Homo \nsapiens. It will know,\u0014\n                    Harvard University biologist Walter Gilbert says, \n\"what it is to be human.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    That knowledge promises to revolutionize medicine \nand vault the biotech\u0014\n                    industry into the Wall Street stratosphere. But \njust as no one foresaw eBay or\u0014\n                    Amazon when Apple unveiled the first home \ncomputer in 1977, so there is no\u0014\n                    crystal ball clear enough to reveal how knowing \nthe entire human genome will\u0014\n                    change the way we live and even the way we think \nabout who we are. It is a\u0014\n                    pretty good bet, though, that doctors will drip \ndroplets of our genes onto a\u0014\n                    biochip to figure out if we have the kind of \nprostate cancer that will kill or not,\u0014\n                    or to figure out if ours is the kind of leukemia \nthat responds to this drug rather\u0014\n                    than that one. They will analyze our children's \ngenes to rank their chances of\u0014\n                    succumbing to heart disease or Alzheimer's. \nScientists will learn which genes\u0014\n                    turn on when a wound heals, when a baby's fingers \ngrow, when a scalp\u0014\n                    becomes bald or a brow wrinkled, when a song is \nlearned or a memory\u0014\n                    formed, when hormones surge or stress overwhelms \nusand they will learn\u0014\n                    how to manipulate those genes. Babies will be \ndesigned before conception.\u0014\n                    Employers will take your genetic profile before \nthey offer you a job, or\u0014\n                    withdraw an offer if they don't like the cut of \nyour DNA. The human genome\u0014\n                    sequence \"will be the foundation of biology for \ndecades, centuries or millennia\u0014\n                    to come,\" says John Sulston, director of the \nSanger Centre, the genome lab\u0014\n                    near Cambridge, England, where a spiral staircase \nin the lobby twists upward\u0014\n                    like the double helix itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    And all of it will emerge from something like \nthis:\u0014\n                    ATGCCGCGGCTCCTCC... on and on, for about 3.2 \nbillion such letters.\u0014\n                    Each letter represents a moleculeadenine, \ncytosine, guanine, thymine. Every\u0014\n                    cell of every human body, from skin to muscle to \nliver and everything in\u0014\n                    between (except red blood cells), contains a copy \nof the same DNA. The\u0014\n                    totality of DNA present in the cells of a species \nis its genome. Although the\u0014\n                    genetic age has brought incessant reports about \ngenes \"for\" homosexuality,\u0014\n                    risk-taking, shyness, anxiety, cancer, \nAlzheimer's and more, the only thing a\u0014\n                    gene is actually \"for\" is a protein. The A's, \nT's, C's and G's constitute a code.\u0014\n                    Each triplet of letters instructs special \nmachinery inside a cell to grab onto a\u0014\n                    particular amino acid. TGG, for instance, \nsnatches the amino acid tryptophan.\u0014\n                    If you string together enough amino acids, you \nhave a proteina stomach\u0014\n                    enzyme that digests food, insulin that \nmetabolizes carbohydrates, a brain\u0014\n                    chemical that causes depression, a sex hormone \nthat triggers puberty. A gene,\u0014\n                    then, is an instruction, like the directions in a \nbead-making kit but written in\u0014\n                    mole-cule-ese. Humans have perhaps 80,000 genes, \nand we are 99.9 percent\u0014\n                    identical. That is, at only one in 1,000 chemical \nletters does the genome of,\u0014\n                    say, Woody Allen differ from that of Stone Cold \nSteve Austin.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Even at its inception, the creators of the Human \nGenome Project suspected\u0014\n                    that it would transform biology, vaulting it past \nphysics as the hot science. But\u0014\n                    at the moment of its creation, the project was an \nunwanted child. Charles\u0014\n                    DeLisi, newly arrived at the Department of \nEnergy, was in charge of research\u0014\n                    into the biological effects of radiation. In \nOctober 1985, he was reading a\u0014\n                    government report on technologies for detecting \nheritable mutations, such as\u0014\n                    those in the survivors of Hiroshima. It hit him: \ngiven the slow pace at which\u0014\n                    biologists were deciphering genes, which you need \nto do in order to assess\u0014\n                    mutations, they would finish... oh, about when \nhumans had evolved into a new\u0014\n                    species. \"We just weren't going to get there,\" \nsays DeLisi. So he dashed off\u0014\n                    memos, ordered up reports, begged scientists to \nserve on planning\u0014\n                    committeesand got responses like \"I don't want \nto spin my wheels\" on a\u0014\n                    project that had little chance of happening.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    For biologists and the genome, it was far from \nlove at first sight. Critics\u0014\n                    pointed out that some 97 percent of the human \ngenome3.1 billion of the 3.2\u0014\n                    billion A's, T's, C's and G'sdoes not spell out \na gene. Why bother\u0014\n                    sequencing this \"junk\" DNA, whose presence no one \ncan explain, especially\u0014\n                    when there was no known way to tell what was junk \nand what was a gene?\u0014\n                    But when a panel of leading scientists, including \nskeptics, unanimously\u0014\n                    endorsed the project in 1988, and it wrested \nfunding from Congress, the\u0014\n                    Human Genome Project was out of the gate, headed \ntoward a completion\u0014\n                    date of 2005 at a nice, sedate pace. It didn't \nlast. In May 1998, gene-hunter\u0014\n                    extraordinaire J. Craig Venter and his newly \nformed Celera Genomics vowed\u0014\n                    to trounce the public project by finishing the \nhuman genome sequence in just\u0014\n                    three years. That made Francis Collins, director \nof the National Human\u0014\n                    Genome Research Institute, scramble. His labs had \nsequenced less than 3\u0014\n                    percent of the genome at the original halfway \npoint, so he ordered everyone\u0014\n                    to forget about the double-checking and the \nexploring of cool scientific\u0014\n                    puzzles and just churn out the *#@*ing A's, T's, \nC's and G's. It worked. In\u0014\n                    October 1998 Collins announced that his team \nwould have a rough draft in\u0014\n                    2001; in March 1999 he pushed it to this spring.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    What will it mean to know the complete human \ngenome? Eric Lander of\u0014\n                    MIT's Whitehead Institute compares it to the \ndiscovery of the periodic table\u0014\n                    of the elements in the late 1800s. \"Genomics is \nnow providing biology's\u0014\n                    periodic table,\" says Lander. \"Scientists will \nknow that every phenomenon\u0014\n                    must be explainable in terms of this measly \nlist\"which will fit on a single\u0014\n                    CD-ROM. Already researchers are extracting DNA \nfrom patients, attaching\u0014\n                    fluorescent molecules and sprinkling the sample \non a glass chip whose surface\u0014\n                    is speckled with 10,000 known genes. A laser \nreads the fluorescence, which\u0014\n                    indicates which of the known genes on the chip \nare in the mystery sample\u0014\n                    from the patient. In only the last few months \nsuch \"gene-expression\u0014\n                    monitoring\" has diagnosed a muscle tumor in a boy \nthought to have leukemia,\u0014\n                    and distinguished between two kinds of cancer \nthat require very different\u0014\n                    chemotherapy. Soon, predicts Patrick Brown of \nStanford University,\u0014\n                    expression analysis will distinguish prostate \ncancers that kill from prostate\u0014\n                    cancers that don't, neurons in a depressed brain \nfrom neurons in a normal\u0014\n                    brainall on the basis of which genes are active.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Humankind's history is also written in its DNA. \n\"Rare spelling differences in\u0014\n                    DNA can be used to trace human migrations,\" says \nLander. \"Scientists can\u0014\n                    recognize the descendants of chromosomes that \nancient Phoenician traders\u0014\n                    left behind when they visited Italian seaports.\" \nGenetic data support the oral\u0014\n                    tradition that the Bantu-speaking Lemba of \nsouthern Africa are descendants\u0014\n                    of Jews who migrated from the Middle East 2,700 \nyears ago. And they\u0014\n                    suggest that 98 percent of the Irish men of \nConnaught are descended from a\u0014\n                    single band of hunter-gatherers who reached the \nEmerald Isle more than\u0014\n                    4,000 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    But decoding the book of life poses daunting \nmoral dilemmas. With\u0014\n                    knowledge of our genetic code will come the power \nto re-engineer the human\u0014\n                    species. Biologists will be able to use the \ngenome as a parts listmuch as\u0014\n                    customers scour a list of china to replace broken \nplatesand may well let\u0014\n                    prospective parents choose their unborn child's \ntraits. Scientists have solid\u0014\n                    leads on genes for different temperaments, body \nbuilds, statures and cognitive\u0014\n                    abilities. And if anyone still believes that \nparents will recoil at playing God, and\u0014\n                    leave their baby's fate in the hands of nature, \nrecall that couples have already\u0014\n                    created a frenzied market in eggs from Ivy League \nwomen.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Beyond the profound ethical issues are practical \nconcerns. The easier it is to\u0014\n                    change ourselves and our children, the less \nsociety may tolerate those who do\u0014\n                    not, warns Lori Andrews of Kent College of Law. \nIf genetic tests in utero\u0014\n                    predict mental dullness, obesity, short \nstatureor other undesirable traits of\u0014\n                    the momentwill society disparage children whose \nparents let them be born\u0014\n                    with those traits? Already, Andrews finds, some \nnurses and doctors blame\u0014\n                    parents for bringing into the world a child whose \nbirth defect was diagnosable\u0014\n                    before delivery; how long will it be before the \nsame condemnation applies to\u0014\n                    cosmetic imperfections? An even greater concern \nis that well-intentioned\u0014\n                    choices by millions of individual parents-to-be \ncould add up to unforeseen\u0014\n                    consequences for all of humankind. It just so \nhappens that some disease\u0014\n                    genes also confer resistance to disease: carrying \na gene for sickle cell anemia,\u0014\n                    for instance, brings resistance to malaria. Are \nwe smart enough, and wise\u0014\n                    enough, to know how knocking out \"bad\" genes will \naffect our evolution as a\u0014\n                    species?\u0014\n\u0014\n                    From the inception of the genome project, \nethicists warned that genetic\u0014\n                    knowledge would be used against people in \ninsurance and employment.\u0014\n                    Sorting out whether this is happening is like \njudging whether HMOs provide\u0014\n                    quality care. Systematic surveys turn up few \nproblems, but horror stories\u0014\n                    abound. One man underwent a genetic test and \nlearned that he carried a\u0014\n                    marker for the blood disorder hemochromatosis. \nAlthough he was being\u0014\n                    success- fully treated, his insurer dropped him \non the ground that he might\u0014\n                    stop treatment and develop the disease. Another \nhad a job offer withdrawn\u0014\n                    for \"lying\" during a pre-employment physical. He \nwas healthy, but carried a\u0014\n                    gene for kidney disease. And last December Terri \nSeargent, 43, was fired\u0014\n                    from her job as an office manager after she \ntested positive for the genetic\u0014\n                    disease that killed her brother. She began \nreceiving preventive treatments.\u0014\n                    When her self-insured employer got the first \nbill, she was fired.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    So far 39 states prohibit, at least in part, \ndiscrimination in health insurance\u0014\n                    based on genetic tests; 15 have some ban on \ndiscrimination in employment.\u0014\n                    But many of the laws have loopholes. (One of the \n15 is North Carolina,\u0014\n                    where Seargent lives.) Employers still, \napparently, want genetic information\u0014\n                    about their workers. A 1999 survey by the \nAmerican Management\u0014\n                    Association found that 30 percent of large and \nmidsize firms obtain such\u0014\n                    information on employees. Seven percent use it in \nhiring and promotions. \"It is\u0014\n                    still possible to have information about your \ngenome used to take away your\u0014\n                    health insurance or your job,\" says Collins. \"As \nyet, we have not seen\u0014\n                    effective federal legislation [to prevent this]. \nWith genes getting discovered\u0014\n                    right and left, the opportunities for mischief \nare on an exponential curve.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                    Perhaps the greatest unknown is how the \ncompletion of the Human Genome\u0014\n                    Projectnot just getting C's, G's, T's and A's, \nbut learning the function of\u0014\n                    every genewill shape our views of what we are. \nThere is a great risk of\u0014\n                    succumbing to a naive biological determinism, \nascribing to our genes such\u0014\n                    qualities as personality, intelligence, even \nfaith. Studies of twins have already\u0014\n                    claimed (to great criticism, but claimed \nnonetheless) that genes even shape\u0014\n                    whether an individual will favor or oppose \ncapital punishment. \"We do ascribe\u0014\n                    some sort of quasi-religious significance to our \nDNA,\" says Collins. \"We have\u0014\n                    a tendency to be more deterministic than we \nshould.\" For now, the power,\u0014\n                    and the limits, of the genome can only be guessed \nat. The stage is set. The\u0014\n                    players are ready. After millions of dollars and \nmillions of hours, the curtain is\u0014\n                    rising on what our children will surely, looking \nback in awe, see as the dawn\u0014\n                    of the century of the genome.\u0014\n\u0014\n                    With Thomas Hayden, William Underhill in London \nand Gregory Beals\u0014",

    "title": "DEMONS AND SALVATION",
    "words": "EXORCISING DEMONS AND \nSALVATION\u0014\n\u0014\nWILLIAM P. TUCK\u0014\nFirst Baptist Church, Bristol, Virginia\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe eyes of the demonic seem to be burning brighter again with the \nappearance of movies and novels like Rosemary's Baby and The \nFxorcists. Although the world is in a scientific and technological \nrevolution, the impact of the occult with its astrology, seances, \nSatan cults, astrologers, witches, horoscopes, and drugs reveals an \nemerging force which must be confronted in the Age of Aquarius. In \nthis sense, then, the scripture, while sounding a bit like a tale of \nEdgar Allan Poe, does have a faintly contemporary ring.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe disciples never forgot the experience with the demoniac of \nGadara. So vivid was it in their minds that all three of the Synoptic \nGospels record it. After an exhausting day Jesus and his disciples \ntook a small boat across the Sea of Galilee.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs soon as the vessel touched the southern shore of the Sea of \nGalilee, Jesus and his disciples began to climb slowly up the steep \ngorge to the bluff above. Suddenly out of the darkness of the \nmountain graveyard leaps a screaming, naked,hideous creature, \ndragging and clanging the chains which were supposed to restrain him. \nHis eyes were wide with derangement, his body was covered with huge \nbloody welts, his arms were waving wildly, his long hair was \nentangled in a mass of twisted knots, and his movement seemed to \nindicate that he possessed superhuman strength.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile the disciples were frozen with fear, the tormented creature \nthrows himself at the feet of Jesus. Jesus said to the man, Come out \nof him, evil spirit. In Jesus' words to the dempniac the tense is \nimportant. From the moment of his encounter with the demoniac, Jesus \nrepeatedly ordered the demons to be exorcised, but his first efforts \nwere unsuccessful. Then Jesus asked what may sound to us like a \nstrange inquiry: What is your name? What importance could that \npossibly have? In an age when belief in demon possession was \nprevalent, the knowledge of a demon's name gave the exorcists power \nover him. Instead of giving his name, the demons replied with a \nnumber. We are six thousand.\u0014\nThis was the number of soldiers in a Roman regiment. There are many \nof us; we are a mob; we are Legion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe herd of swine on the slopes nearby indicates that we are in pagan \ncountry. No Jew would raise pigs, religiously unclean animals. The \nstrange request by Legion to enter the hogs, if the demons are to be \ncheated out of a human habitat, was an attempt to avoid the abyss of \nthe deep sea waters, the final area of destruction for all evil \nspirits. Ironically, the force of the demonic entrance into the pigs \nis severe enough to send the whole herd of two thousand plunging to \ntheir death into the depths of the sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice the epilogue. When the pigs herdsmen rush into the city and \nbring back the owners, do they rejoice at the great miracle which \nthey have seen? Instead of celebrating in the wonder of the \nredemption which the demoniac received, the people fear Jesus, the \nexorcist, and ask him to leave. The demoniac, alone in expressing \ngratitude, requests Jesus to let him go with him. But Jesus sends him \nhome and urges him to tell his friends about the power of God's gift \nof healing.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat are we to make of such a story today? Do we merely reject it as \na folk tale, reflecting the superstition and demonology of its time? \nSome approach the problem of demonology as an ancient way of \nexpressing what is called in contemporary society by psychiatric \nnomenclature. Biblical references to demon possessions are seen as \nOriental descriptions of epilepsy, schizophrenia, or various forms of \ninsanity. Without question there is much truth in this approach.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus did not attribute all illness to demon possession. The blind \nman, Jairus' daughter, the woman with the hemorrhage, the paralytic, \nand the centurian's servant are all cases where Jesus does not \nassociate diseases with evil spirits. In some instances it is clearly \nevident that the person was either an eplileptic or suffered from \nsome kind of psychological disturbance.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the problem of demon possession in the New Testament cannot be \nsolved that easily. Jesus not only spoke about the power of demons \nbut he also exorcised them and commanded his disciples to cast them \nout in his name. Though it may seem embarrassing to a church which \nfunctions in a scientific age, the power to cast out demons was \ncentral to the ministry of Jesus. Harvey Cox has declared, Most of \nus would prefer to forget that for many of his contemporaries Jesus' \nexorcism was jil no way peripheral but stood at the heart of his \nwork. Paul Tillich affirmed that preaching Christ as the power to \nconquer the demonic forces that control our lives, mind and body, \nwill prove to be the most adequate way to communicate the message of \nChrist for the people of our time.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can this demonic imagery be meaningful to us today? The answer \nlies in breaking through the prescientific images of demons and evil \nspirits to the reality to which they attest. The New Testament \nacknowledges vividly the awesome power of evil in such images as \n'~principalities and powers, Messengers of Satan, rulers of \ndarkness, Satan, the father of lies and deception, the \nAntichrist, the evil one, the adversary, and the destroyer. \nPrincipalities and powers, a phrase that recurs frequently in the \nwritings of Paul, was a common New Testament conception of the cosmic \ndimension of the power of evil.\u0014\n\u0014\nModern man laughs at the old Cornish prayer: From ghoulies and \nghosties, and long-leggity beasties, and all things that go bump in \nthe night, good lord, deliver us. We are too modern for that. We \nprefer: From systems and ologies and isms, good Lord, free us. Evil \nbecomes more comfortable for us when it is abstract and impersonal. \nChallenging this comfortable approach, Cohn Morris has stated: I \nmake no apology for calling evil by that old-fashioned, personal \nname, the Devil. It is a good way of keeping us alert to the fact \nthere is about the operation of evil the subtlety of a malevolent \npersonality rather than the crudity of a blind, irrational force.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou do not think evil is real? Can we possibly believe that the \ndepths and the dimensions of the kingdom of evil in the world are \nmerely illusions of the mind. Tell the relatives of the six million \nJews who were annihilated by the Nazis that there is no evidence of \ndemonic power in the world. Tell the villagers at Mai Lai that evil \nis an illusion. Tell it to the parents whose son jumped from the \ntwelfth story after an overdose of LSD. Are we really so civilized \nthat we cannot see the awesome power of evil? We no longer throw ink \nwells at the devil, as Martin Luther once did. We are too civilized \nfor that, too mature! Yet one of the most civilized nations in the \nworld exterminated six million human beings of one race.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us be honest and admit as openly arid forcefully as did the early \nNew Testament Christians that evil is real and demonic. Somewhere we \nhave lost the New Testament urgency of the unseen warfare. Without \nhesitation the New Testament senses a mighty contradiction at the \nheart of the universe. The New Testament writers picture the \nChristian engaged in a combat with the forces of evil, but they shout \na ringing affirmation that in Jesus Christ God has unleashed victory \nover sin, death, and the principalities and the powers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commentaries which I have examined indicate that this demoniac \npassage is without realistic theological or moral value for modern \nman. Rather than being out of focus for today's man, Legion is \nsymbolic of modern man. He is contemporary man; he is each of us. The \ndemoniac becomes our mirror.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus says, What is your name? My name is Legion. I am many. I am \na mob. I do not know who I am. There are many selves within me, and I \nam torn and pulled in every direction, seeking to find myself. How \noften we say: I don't feel like myself today. I was nearly out of \nmy mind. Man is rarely a unity;  he is constantly at civil war \nwithin. In Arthur Miller's play, The Death of a Salesman, the younger \nson, Biff, stands by his father's grave and reflects, He never knew \nwho he was.  But who does? Who are  you? Who am I? Is our name not \nLegion? There are many selves within each of us, many masks we hide \nbehind. \u0014\n Sometimes our masks are peeled back like layers of skin an onion and \nreveal that we are hollow at the center. Was T. S. Eliot correct? Are \nwe merely 'the hollow men, the stuffed men, leaning together, \nheadpiece filled with straw? Without, a polestar, without a center \nof gravity, without knowledge of who we are, we are Legion; our \nnature is that of the demoniac.\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------\u0014\nLegion's cry, then, was real, and it is the cry of every man: What \nhave you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech \nyou, do not torment me. But redemption does come to this disturbed \nman. His torn personality finds wholeness through the power of \nChrist. Come out of the man you, unclean spirit! Here is the act of \nredemption, freeing a man's spirit from chaos to unity, conflict, to \npeace, bondage to freedom, despair to hope, and fragmentation to \noneness. Jesus Christ offers to man the unification and integration \nof his personality. He calls a truce to the internal civil war and \nfurnishes wholeness and stability.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus' exorcism is viewed merely as a healing, the deep \nimplications of the cosmic dimension of salvation are minimized. It \nis clear from the gospel accounts that Jesus wanted to avoid the \nreputation of simply being a healer. There was a cosmic element to \nhis healings. The salvation of Jesus is concerned with the total man, \nnot just man's physical, moral, or spiritual self, but the whole man \nand his interrelatedness. Redemption is concerned with overcoming \nman's estrangement from himself, others, and God.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mighty contradiction which man senses in the universe goes beyond \nhis need merely for redemption of individual sins; he experiences the \npower of collective evil. The modern demons which threaten to destroy \nman are more than just the sum of individual evil acts. Exorcising \ndemons, modern style, will involve redeeming not only individuals but \nalso the systems which have enslaved them. The evil forces which \ncrucified Christ are representative of the corporate aspect of evil: \nreligious intolerance, commercial graft and political corruption, \ninjustice, the mob mentality, public apathy, militarism, and the \nclass system. These evil forces are deeply rooted within our social \nsystems. Jesus was crucified by a system which allowed him to be \nexecuted, although he was found innocent. As a member of the lower \nclass he was not given representation or defense.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut corporate evil is not confined to the first century. Confronting \nthe collective power of evil is the modern equivalent of exorcising \ndemons. The Church, as Walter Rauschenbush said more than fifty years \nago, is the social factor of salvation. The Church is the social \nforce in the world which challenges the collective forces of evil. At \nleast it should be! The Church to use Harvey Cox's phrase, is the \ncultural exorcist. The Church is the social force which says, for \nexample, that not only do we seek to challenge and overcome racial \nprejudice but we shall also strive to help the minority groups to \nattain their own sense of personal respect and dignity.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome voices say that if we get men to make a personal commitment to \nChrist, the problem with society will be solved. I wish it were so! \nIn a deep southern community a young minister friend of mine \nattempted to relate the gospel to men of all races. He was told he \ncould not enter the pulpit again, and he, his wife, and five children \nwere put out of their home within a week. Was that church, where \nindividuals had made commitments to Christ, free from the demonic \npower of evil? A deeper dimension of redemption and healing was \nneeded. Sometimes, instead of being the force to change society, the \nchurch perpetuates the very evil from which it needs deliverance. But \nthe challenge remains: the church is called today to be the exorcist, \nthe healer, and the deliverer from the demonic forces in society.\u0014\n\u0014\nNotice again the epilogue to the story. After the demoniac has \nreceived redemption, the townspeople are terrified by a man who has \nsuch powers and seem little concerned with the change in Legion. The \nowners of the pigs were also greatly disturbed by their loss. They \nappeared more upset about the loss of the pigs than the cure of the \nman. How contemporary can a story be! Pigs are more important than \npeople. Property rights are more important than human rights. The \nmirror is before us as we sense modern man's reaction to open \nhousing, racial desegregation, poverty, and the ghettos. Property is \nmore important than people. Here is a demonic force whose power is so \nintense that it is incessantly moving man closer to chaos. Cured and \nsane, Legion desires to follow Jesus. But Jesus instructs him to go \nhome, the toughest territory of all for him to demonstrate his \nwholeness. Go home and show your family and friends the wholeness and \nunity which God has given you. No easy task for any man.\u0014\n\u0014\nT. H. White in a modern fantasy entitled The Sword and the Stone \ndepicts a contest between Merlin the Magician and the evil witch, \nMadame Mim. It is a contest to the death, both using their greatest \nskills and powers. Madame Mim assumes many horrible and deadly \nshapes, but each time Merlin meets her with one better until finally \nthe witch is annihilated.\u0014\n\u0014\nThrough the centuries evil has assumed many forms, shapes, and \ndisguises. Sometimes it has been recognized in the form of one nation \nenslaving another, or a small group of men crushing any in the way of \ntheir self-appointed goal, or one individual demanding absolute \nobedience to his fanatical wishes. Whatever shape evil may take, the \nChristian must never hose sight of the fact that he is indeed engaged \nin an unseen warfare with principalities and powers.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the Christian engages in this struggle with the assurance of \nvictory. Through Jesus Christ man finds inner courage and strength, \nhaving done all, to stand. The Christian is aware, though he may \nstumble under the impact of the demonic power, ultimately evil will \nbe defeated. In hope and anticipation, he shouts in the face of evil \nthe words of the Apostle Paul in Romans 8:31, 37-39.\u0014",

    "title": "DEMOCRACY ON THE SKIDS",
    "words": "Democracy on skid row?\u0014\nIt's winning here and there, but losing its sustaining culture\u0014\nBY CARL F. H. HENRY from \"Has Democrcrsy Had It's Day\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a swiftly passing half century the relationship of evangelicals to \nAmerican culture has undergone colossal change.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy \"The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism\" (1947) lamented \nthe withdrawal of religious conservatives from the cultural arena, \nthen powerfully dominated by modernist ideology. Failure of \nevangelicas to engage the culture on biblical premise, I warned, \ncould only abandon society to expectations shaped by Darwin and Marx, \nand yield the political climate to liberal optimism.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne would think that the collapse of illusionary communism would \nstimulate resounding praise for political democracy since the defeat \nof Marxism was a decisive moral victory over totalitananism. Instead, \ndoubts about the superiority of democracy seem to run deeper in much \nof the Free World than at any time during the Cold War. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe adequacy of political democracy is being questioned somewhere on \nalmost all continents and, most surprising, America itself now \nreflects a distressing disaffection over various aspects of the \ndemocratic process. Representative democracy and the culture it \nsustains is today in trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\n Contributory factors are multiple. Latin American liberation \ntheologians insist (quite apart from their Marxist propensities) that \ndemocracy is too slow a catalyst to promote social change. Singapore \ncritics think political freedom stifles government authority by \nexaggerating individual rights.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome Russian leaders wonder whether a democracy can cope \nsuccessftilly with high inflation and steep unemployment in a \npost-Marxist era. Many Americans are now skeptical of executive, \nlegislative, and judicial personnel or procedures, of the jury \nsystem, and of the educational merit of a free press, and they \nforfeit voting privileges in distressing numbers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deepest threat to democracy lies in its elevation of economic and \npolitical factors to priority and its failure to respect the \nprecedency of spiritual and moral concerns. All political action \npresupposes ethical and religious assumptions. Those who argue that \nreligious and moral imperatives have no place in a pluralistic \nsociety merely conceal their own naturalistic worldview If democracy \nneglects theological and ethical realities, it is headed for chaos or \nfor totalitarianism.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo be sure, democracy's survival does not require an express cultural \ncommitment to the Christian world-view But not any and every \nworld-view will escape inevitable deteriora\u0014\ntion. If democracy's patron saint becomes the devil, it is \nhell-bound. Democracy functions best in a culture permeated by the \nbiblical emphasis on the universal Creator and Judge of mankind and \non the regeneration of human character.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut such books as my \"Twilight of a Great Civilization,' Chuck \nColson's 'Against the Night: Living in the New Dark Ages,\" and Alan \nBloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\" are nonetheless \nappropriate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe forfeiture of democracy need not be a forfeiture of Christianity, \nbut if we are going to let democracy disintegrate by neglect, we had \nbetter look closely at the alternatives. Evangelicals should realize \nthat democracy is not self-sustaining, and we should probe \npossibilities of walking alongside those who seek to sustain it.\u0014",

    "title": "DISCOURAGEMENT",
    "words": "He pulled out a roll of bills big enough to choke a horse. He \nlooked at me with a determined eye and yet with a sense of sincerity \nthat was hard to question and said, Preacher, when I tried to live \nlike a Christian I was broke all the time. He didn't need to say any \nmore. There was a world of conversation included in that simple \nstatement.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was in Pawnee, Oklahoma, where I was in a revival meeting, that I \nmet this gentleman. The story went something like this, as the pastor \nrelated it to me. He had been trying for some time to reach this man \nwho was, in preacheristic terms, a hard nut to crack. After a \nlong effort to press the claims of Christ upon him, the gentleman \nfinally came and made a commitment of life to Christ, or at least \nthat is what was understood to be happening. His wife and children \nwere very active in the life of the church. They were the kind of \npeople that any pastor would be proud to serve and that any man would \nbe pleased to call his family. It looked like a real victory for both \nthe church and the family.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Jones, as we will call him, then began what both the pastor and \nhis wife admit was a determined effort to live a God-honoring life. \nThis meant changing some things he had been doing. It meant changing \nsome folks he had been running with, and he told me that he did his \nbest to purpose\u0014\nwithin himself to run his business in a Christian manner. Something \nbegan to happen. He was not able to explain because he simply didn't \nknow what it was, but things went from good to bad and from bad to \nworse. He began to lose money. Business fell off. For the first time \nin his life he began to have bills to pay and no money to pay them.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe said, I prayed about this, feeling sure that something would \nbreak. I counseled with the pastor as things got worse and sought the \nadvice of Christian friends. Things only got worse. As I continued \nto watch him, his voice dropped. He began to stare at his desk top \nand occasionally glance up into my eyes. I felt a pain I could not \nsee. He looked as though he was embarrassed at what he was ready to \nsay, but that embarrassed look did not stay long. His brow furrowed, \na wrinkle came in his forehead, and while he did not say it, it was \nperfectly obvious that he wanted to say, I think I got a rotten, \ndirty deal. Or maybe he wanted to say, It doesn't work after all. \nIn fact, he did say, I'll never go through that again.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll sorts of things began to go through my mind. I guess I first \nthought of Scarlet O'Hara following her return to Tara after the \nbattle of Atlanta. She found her mother dead, her father insane, and \nTara, her beautiful Tara, destroyed for all practical purposes. One \nrecalls Scarlet, ravenously hungry, going out into the garden, \nscratching in the dirt, raising her face to heaven and with her fists \nprotesting loudly, Oh God, I'll cheat. I'll steal. I'll lie. I'll do \nanything, but I'll never be hungry again. I thought I saw those \nthings happen in that man's office. Hunger, as Scarlet O'Hara knew \nit, wasn't his problem, but spiritual hunger was his problem. I saw \nthe look of discouragement. I felt the anger. I heard his keen \ndisappointment.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat does one say at a time like this, especially when he has come to \nspeak of the Good News of Jesus Christ. What does one say in the \nface of a genuine effort, apparently,\u0014\nto make it work only to see nothing that resembles success? it wasn't \nvery much, but alit knew to say was, I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis look at me hurt worse than anything that had been said. It seemed \nto convey the feeling, That's all right, preacher. It must be \nembarrassing when your product won't stand up to testing. He wasn't \ntrying to be cute or cutting. I think he was trying to be \nunderstanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe then said with utmost sincereity, Well, it's different strokes \nfor different folks. Religion is all right for some people. It just \ndoesn't seem to be my cup of tea.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll sorts of crazy ideas go through you head at a time like this. The \nfirst thing you want to do is to defend God, try to explain what went \nwrong, as if we can always find a reason for things like that. Then \nyou want to do an analysis on the individual to find faulty motives \nor something like that that explains why one has such an experience. \nThe mind rolls on like a computer trying to grab some rational \napproach to handle the problem, but it invariably comes up dry. And I \nknew for certain that he was in no frame of mind to hear again what \nso many had told him before, you know, the in the Sweet By and By \nstorythings won't always be this way.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was shortly out of the seminary at this time, and my mind \nintuitively turned the pages of my Systematic Theology notes. I was \nadequately prepared to share the prolific jewels of the doctrine of \nevil or the question of suffering, but all of a sudden it seemed so \nshallow. I did recall the caution of my teacher, Dr. William \nHendricks: Gentlemen, don't try to give medicine when you don't know \nwhat the disease is. I gave up on the idea of explaining and simply \nsaid, I've been discouraged too. I think I know what it feels like \nto work so hard and see so little results. I don't know why these \nthings happened, and it's true, they don't make a lick of sense. But \nGod is bigger than this experience. Give him a chance to prove it.\u0014\n\u0014\nA prayer for when you are discouraged:\u0014\n\u0014\nO God of light: I get so discouraged when my path grows dim because \nof the dark clouds of trouble. I confess to you, 0 Lord, that there \nare times when I would rather give up than to go on. Sometimes I see \nno point to continuing on in the struggle for the things I want or \nbelieve in.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are moments when I'm not really sure that you care what happens \nto me in my struggle. Sometimes I get the feeling, Lord, that you \nhave abandoned me and left me to struggle alone. Yet I know that you \nhave not promised to snatch me out of my struggle but that you have \nsaid you would be present with me. And 1 know that you do not create \navenues of escape from trouble, but that you give to those with faith \nthe means with which to endure.\u0014\n\u0014\nLord, help me not to give up, but, rather, give me faith to go on. \nLet me not waste my life wallowing in discouragement, but enable me \nto use such times as opportunities for growth. Help me to see past \nthe discouragement to the goals you have in store for me. Give me \nfaith to risk and try the untried roads in life, that I may feel good \nabout myself and hear you say, Well done! Amen.\u0014\n\u0014\nScriptures about discouragement:\u0014\n\u0014\nThough the fig tree do not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the \nproduce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be \ncut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will \nrejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. God, the \nLord, is my strength; he makes my feet like hinds' feet, he makes me \ntread upon my high places.\u0014\n                                                                  \nHabakkuk 3:17-19 RSV\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul's strength in discouragement:\u0014\n\u0014\nbut he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my\u0014\npower is made perfect in weakness.\u0014\nII Corinthians 12:9a\u0014",

    "words": "Decline \nand Fall\u0014\n                  Tracing history through the generations of \nKennedys. BY NOEMIE EMERY\u0014\n                               From \"The Weekly Standard\", October 2, \n2000, p.38\u0014\n\u0014\nHow long can the will of one man impinge on the life of another? The \nlives of these three menRobert F Kennedy, and his nephews Patrick \nKennedy and John Kennedy Jr.were molded to a large degree by the \nwish of Joseph P Kennedy to make one of his sons president.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor nearly thirty years, his hopes centered on his first son and \nnamesake, a strapping, gregarious figure who fell wholeheartedly in \nwith his father's ambitions. When Joe Jr. died during World War II, \nthe father's eye fell on his second son, Jack, a more complex figure, \nin terrible health, with whom his relations were trickier. Perhaps to \nhis astonishment, that shy, sickly Jack became JFK, a charismatic and \ncanny political leader. But then he was killed, and an attractive man \nand skilled politician became a Lost Prince.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe American people's urge to find him againand the Kennedy family's \nurge to regain its lost powercreated a premature loss of clever and \ncapable political leaders like John and Robert Kennedy, the nation \nhas suffered. In the destruction of two men who were New Democrats \nbefore the term was needed, the Democratic party has suffered. And \nthe Kennedys themselves, tempted by and trapped within this drama, \nare suffering even today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe only substantial volume in this season's run of books on the \ntopic is Evan Thomas's study of Bobby, the third Kennedy son, whose \nlife was consumed in struggles brought on by the family ethos: first \nto define himself as his brother's helper, and then to define himself \nas the family leader.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was, Thomas writes, the runt of the family, almost an \nirrelevancy in his father's schemes. There was the golden trio of \nJoe Jr., Jack, and Kathleen, and there were the others, too young and \ntoo many to matter. Ted, the youngest, accepted his role as the baby, \nthe comic relief But Bobby, seven years younger than his next-oldest \nbrother, had an intense need to prove himself\u0014\n\u0014\nSlighter, less graceful, less good looking than the others, he would \nfind this difficult As Thomas notes, in pictures that showed the \nother children smiling and radiant, Bobby perches by his mother s \nside, his face tense with anxiety He was not only smaller and slower \nthan his brothers, he looked afraid What he was afraid of was being \nignored and discounted.\u0014\n\u0014\nOppressed by a controlling father, John Kennedy rebelled by becoming \nelusive and skeptical. Neglected by an indifferent father, Bobby dove \ninto the family ethos, defining himself as family guardian, the \ncustodian of others. From time to time, he would try to break out to \na life on his own, but he would always come back to the family orbit, \nalways in service to somebody else.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis first rise came with the death of Joe Jr in 1944, which pushed \nJack into the role of heir apparent and Bobby into that of back-up \nson. The second came with Jack s political campaigns, during which \nBobby moved from near-stranger to his older brother's closest \nassociate. Thomas presents Jack's relations with Joe Jr as far more \nstrained and remote than previous writers have suggested and says \nthat Bobby was brought in at first to keep the peace between the \noverbearing father and the independent and frequently rebellious son. \nBobby rose in their esteem to become the central cog in the family \nenterprise. The next-to-last had become the most important.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome biographers claim that by 1960 Joseph P Kennedy had plans to \nmake all three of his sons president. It was certainly he who \ninsisted that Jack make Bobby his attorney general and that Ted \nprepare to run for Jack's Senate seat, when he was old enough, in \n1962. Bobby functioned for most of Jack's term as nearly a \nco-president, overseeing the war on crime, the civil rights crisis, \nback channel approaches to the Soviet Union, guerrilla wars in \nSoutheast Asia, and the Cuban missile crisis.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some ways, however, Robert was less close to his brother than has \nbeen commonly thought. They did not socialize, and, while Bobby was \nan open book to his brother, the more elusive Jack Kennedy had facets \nBobby seldom saw. The president (and his wife) disliked the rowdy \natmosphere of children and celebrities at Bobby's Hickory Hill \nestate. Nor were Bobby and Ethel often at the White House after \nworking hours. The president rigidly divided his relationships, \nseparating 'staff' (the Irish Mafia and Ted Sorensen) from his social \nfriends, Thomas writes. RFK was, in a certain sense, staff\u0014\n\u0014\nYet at work the brothers tended to I blend, able to communicate in \nfamily shorthand, or even in no words at all. In the unwritten \nbargain worked out between them, John Kennedy gave his brother access \nto all arms of government, often overriding the authority of those \ntechnically in office. In return, Bobby picked up for his brother, in \nall his touchy areas of life. Being the keeper to this brother was no \nsmall endeavor, and Thomas entitles his final pre-Dallas chapter \nWorn. By late 1963, Bobby was visibly aging, losing substance and \nenergy, and thinking of a change of duties inside the administration.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a book studded with terse, pungent headings, Mourner comes right \nafter Worn. JFK's death in Dallas cost Bobby not only his job and \nhis brother, but his sense of himself in his world. He had been the \nservant, and now there was no one to look up to and work for. There \nwas a parallel problem, as well, for it is sometimes forgotten how \nmuch his brother looked after him. John Kennedy had given Bobby \nunparalleled access and power, without his having to think about \nmanners or consequence, shielded by JFK's office and political \nskills. Jack could laugh at Bobby, but he also admired him. He \nthought Bobby was.., the sacred one, said Jack's friend Charles \nSpalding; he was the one who expressed the anger and the moral vision \nthe cooler president was reluctant to let show. Jack had a \nconstituency of two hundred million; Bobby a constituency of one. \nNow, for his own ambi. tion and his brother's memory, he had to work \nfor the good will of others, to have them want to have him as a \nleader.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Kennedy was the last iconic figure of the World War Il-Cold War \nconsensus, a group that was elite, bipartisan, and assured. Robert \nKennedy was the first iconic figure of the disruption\u0014\nthat followed, and what made him so hot as a political leader was \nthat the era's sense of anger and perceived injustice mirrored what \nhe felt inside himself In 1964 he won a Senate seat from New York, \nbut, bored with the Senate's rules and procedures, he took more \ninterest in productions like his community development program for \nBedford-Stuyvesant and in trips to Poland, South Africa, and South \nAmerica, where he was treated like a god by the oppressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs time went on, it became increasingly easy for even dispassionate \npeople to be troubled by Lyndon Johnson's handling of the war in Asia \nand the turn the Great Society was taking. But with Robert Kennedy, \nthe policy dissension was also fueled by inner rage. It was unfair \nthat some people were terribly poor, that race was a burden, that \nyoung men, most of them poor, died in a war past explaining. And it \nwas unfair too that his brother was dead, unfair that he and his \nfriends had lost power, unfair that, largely through his own hard \nwork, a man he detested now sat in his dead brother's chair. \nInterviewing him in 1967, Saul Bellow saw the origin of his \nambitions: He never for a moment stopped thinking about his brother. \nHe seemed to be continually grieving.... He was literally, \nmuscularly, tense about it. His face was convulsed with some great \nemotional charge. He was nourishing his grief It gave him energy. \nBellow thought he never wanted it to die.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the Kennedy family, the dynastic goal after Bobby's death on June \n6, 1968, became more than ever a burden:\u0014\nIt is likely that, without the fierce pressure to run for president \nthat descended upon him, Edward Kennedy would now be more slim and \nsober, his first wife would have been less self-destructive, and Mary \nJo Kopechne would be alive today. Certainly the current political \ncareer of his son Patrick is a striking example of the temptations \nand traps of the dynastic dynamic, which can make a career out of \npractically nothing and destroy one's private happiness at once.\u0014\n\u0014\nPatrick never knew his uncle John, who was murdered four years before \nhe was born. He was one year old when his uncle Robert was murdered, \nand two when the accident at Chappaquiddick doomed his father's \npresidential hopes. His mother was a severe alcoholic, his father an \nintermittent one; their marriage broke down when Patrick was seven \nand ended formally when he was thirteen. Through his childhood, he \nsuffered fierce bouts of asthma, and he entered a program for drug \nand alcohol abuse in his late teens.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter dropping out of Georgetown because of the overwhelming \npresence of my family in Washington, he went to Providence \nCollegeand then startled everyone by running for the Rhode Island \nGeneral Assembly. Politics, said an observer, had one virtue that \nPatrick found desirable. It provided structure, and gave him people \nwho organized his life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarrell M. West's recent Patrick Kennedy:The Rise to Power is useful, \nbut shallow and partisan. It takes at face value Patrick Kennedy's \nfaith (not shared by his two most famous uncles) in the expanding \nwelfare state and his view that, under a Republican Congress, \ncenturies of progress in the human rights area are under constant \nthreat of being eroded and dismantled every single day. Worse, West \nseems determined to portray Patrick Kennedy as a more-or-less normal \npolitician, while the truth is that his career has been based wholly \non the family money that got him elected and the money that can be \nwrung by the family name out of gullible donors.\u0014\nIn Patrick's first race, photogenic members of his famous family \nstood outside the polls to have their pictures taken with voters \nbefore they went in to pull the lever. His campaign was an \nall-Kennedy affair, complete with appearances by JFK Jr. and \nPatrick's father, Robert Dreyfuss wrote in the Nation. Patrick spent \n$87,000 to win the part-time, $300 a year position. When Patrick ran \nfor Congress in 1994, the entire dynasty helped him. Star-studded \nfund-raisers.., included numerous Kennedys and friends like... \nSargent Shriver, Pierre Salinger, Jack Valenti, and Tip O'Neill, \nhelping Patrick amass $1 million.\u0014\n\u0014\nJn 1998 he reached the House leadership, being named chairman of the \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, less for any political \ntalents than for wringing huge sums of cash out of liberal donors, by \ntouching the sacred chords of Kennedy memory. He has created a club \nfor $100,000-plus donors, whom he invites to picnics at the family \nestate. What Kennedy excels in is raising money, writes Michael \nBarone in The Almanac of American Politics. He is probably the \nsingle biggest draw at fund-raisers around the country.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen they first reached Congress at the start of 1947, both John \nKennedy and Richard Nixon were picked out by party leaders as \nspokesmen and as possible presidents. No such assessments have come \nPatrick's way. My strengths are not being a legislative titan, he \nonce admitted. My strengths are not being taken that seriously on \nthe substance side. Despite his fast rise and current celebrity, \nthis fact may now be weighing on the young man who has always worried \nthat he wasn't Kennedy enough. He revealed last fall that the \npressures of being a Kennedy caused him to suffer anxiety and \ndepression.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those electioneering in Patrick's first race was his cousin \nJohn F. Kennedy Jr., though, as observers noted, he seemed \nhalf-hearted, and had to be pushed into doing his job. I don't think \nit's fair for me to be here.... The only reason I'm here is for my \ncousin. But I don't believe in it.\u0014\n\u0014\nF\u0014\n rom stories like this, and details in The Day John Died by \nChristopher Andersen, it becomes clear that this most courted of \nheirs to Camelot spent his short life trying to avoid the kind of \ncareer his cousin Patrick embraced. Stunningly handsome, appallingly \nrich, heir to his mother's glamour as well as to the mystique of the \nfather he could not remember, this most striking of all the grandsons \nof Joseph P Kennedy seemed terribly wary of being too tempted by even \nmore fame than he had already, of being made use of by other people, \nand of being steamrollered into doing something he might not want.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's cousins, the senator's sons, were brought up in largely \npolitical households. The president's son was raised in a more \nprivate setting, by a mother who attempted to forearm him. She sent \nhim to survival camps and to work on ranches while she minimized his \nexposure to the raucous Kennedy kin. What once seemed charmingif \nhecticin the Kennedys now appeared toxic and threatening. (One of \nthe big decisions Jackie made in her life was to get the children.., \naway from the Kennedys, said her friend Peter Duchin. One summer, \nJackie sent John on a diving expedition to Micronesia.... She said to \nme, 'Do you think that's far enough away?')\u0014\n\u0014\nPursued all his life by political suitors, JFK Jr. learned early on \nto evade them. He led them on with his appearance at the 1988 \nDemocratic convention, but then withdrew, uncertain of what he wanted \nbut sure enough of what he did not want. I have a slightly \ncontrarian impulse I can't seem to shake, Andersen quotes him. It's \nalways sort of fun to try and play with blocks and see what you can \ncome up with that's a little bit different.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat he came up with was George, a magazine mixing dazzle and \npolitics, that may have mirrored his experience of life. It surprised \nmany by being relatively non-partisan. Would he ever have gone into \nelectoral politics? He defined himself as having an inquisitive, as \nopposed to a partisan, temperament. Friends think he would have been \nreluctant to give up what little remained of his privacy or to take \nsomething he did not think he had earned. When he died last year at \nthirty-eight in a plane crash, he was apparently still toying with \nthe idea of running for an executive post, such as mayor or governor. \nA friend of his said that he and Senator Al D'Amato tried to \nconvince John to run for mayor of New York Cityas a Republican. It \nwas in jest at first, but John was really thinking it over. In many \nways, John was quite conservative.., more of a Republican than a \nDemocrat. He had such a sense of what was appropriate behaviorJohn \nknew right from wrong.~~\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat John Jr. seemed to realize is that a family connection, without \nsome defining vision of one's own, can sustain\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nonly a small life in politics. His father had followed his father's \nwishes to take up a life in politics. But JFK became a leaderand \nlegendonly when he defined his own public persona apart from his \nfather and different from what his older brother's would have been. \nRobert Kennedy became a powerful figure only when he found his own \nvoice. Ted Kennedy could not appeal to a national audience, even with \nthe nostalgia for two murdered brothers. Nor could Bobby's sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is notable that the one rising star in the Kennedy family now is \nKathleen Kennedy Townsendwho was never brought up to be president, \ndid not use family fanfare, did not run in a Kennedy state, lost \nher first race for f Congress, and paid her dues while toiling in \ndull government jobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn instant career, based on one's relatives' fame, can seem very \nappealing. But like most presents, it never comes free.\u0014",

    "words": "Death by Day Trading?\u0014\nCouples Alleged Suicide Pact Leaves 1 Dead, 1 Charged \u0014\n\u0002\u0014\nDec. 6, 2000 A costly obsession with day-trading and a passionate \ncommitment to each other seem to have sealed the suicide pact of a \nLong Island couple. But the lovers scheme didnt turn out exactly as \nthey had planned: One of them survived.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple headed out to execute their grisly plan on the morning of \nNov. 29. It was then, Suffolk County police say, that George \nSchavran, 70, and his live-in lover Catherine Fischer, 42, drove from \ntheir home in Huntington Bay, N.Y., to the nearby Bay Crest Beach \nClub. \u0014\nThere, looking out over the ocean, Schavran allegedly shot Fischer in \nthe head and also shot and killed Graf, the familys longhaired \nGerman Shepherd. He then turned the gun on himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nAround noon, a local fisherman discovered the couple in their car in \nthe club parking lot. Fischer died in the hospital later that day, \nbut Schavran survived after surgery for bullet wounds to the chin and \nhead. He has been arraigned on second-degree murder charges, \naccording to the Suffolk County District Attorneys office, and faces \n25 years to life if convicted.\u0014\nWas day trading enough to drive the couple to choose such a drastic \nend? \u0014\n\u0014\nTo the Brink\u0014\n\u0014\nSome tragic answers lie in a suicide note penned by Fischer and left \nin her home for her sister to find. Both George and I have decided \nthis is the best for everyone, Fischer wrote, according to the Long \nIsland newspaper Newsday, which published the excerpt today.\u0014\nAccording to the newspaper report, Fischers sister said the couple \nhad been driven to the edge by financial and legal problems and had \nbeen planning their suicides for at least a month. Drained of \nfinancial resources by the day trading which had consumed the couple, \nFischer said in the note that she had no belongings left.This was \nreally a sad love story, the victims sister, Susan Baud-Fischer, \ntold Newsday. Its a very sad ending.\u0014\n\u0014\nSchavran and Fischer were said to have run their day trading business \nout of their home office, where they monitored the stock markets with \ntwo computers and a television to watch the tickers. Although the \ncouple seemed to have found early success in day trading, they \neventually got in over their heads and landed in serious financial \nand legal trouble.\u0014\n\u0014\nCourt records from the couples 1999 bankruptcy filings showed they \neach owed almost half a million dollars to creditors, according to \nNewsday. A trustee of Fischers estate told the paper it appeared the \ncouple had gone through extraordinary amounts of money, estimated \nin the millions.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut one of Schavrans business partners challenged the bankruptcy \njudgments, which would have relieved the couple of their debts, the \npaper reported. The partner, Eraldo Barletta of Manhattan, alleged \nthat Schavran stole nearly $3 million from their business and is \nconvinced the couple hid money away, the paper said, citing layers \nand court documents. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Desperation Phase\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Baud-Fischer was surprised when she heard of the \ncircumstances of her sisters death, she told Newsday she immediately \nthought of the financial and legal strain the couple had faced.\u0014\n\u0014\nI couldnt believe it, but I knew they were suffering for quite a \nlong time because of this lawsuit, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nGambling addiction experts say the couples experience is reminiscent \nof the pattern many problem gamblers  including those addicted to \nday trading  follow. \u0014\nIn gambling addiction, theres the winning phase, the losing phase \nand the desperation phase, said Keith Whyte, executive director of \nthe National Council on Problem Gambling, who said he has seen \nparallels between problem online trading and gambling addiction. \nWhen people bottom out, when there is absolutely no where else they \ncan turn, thats a very problematic time. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt this stage, many addicts see few treatment options, find a lack of \nunderstanding of their problem from friends and family and often face \nlegal and financial trouble, Whyte said. Gambling addicts have the \nhighest rate of attempted and completed suicide of any group \nsuffering from a mental health disorder, he added. When someone \nreaches the desperation phase and they dont feel they have options, \nthings like this happen, Whyte said. \u0014\n\u0014\nLosing Nest Eggs\u0014\n\u0014\nOften online trading addicts are driven to the edge when they lose \nlarge sums of money in a short period of time, says Kimberly Young, a \npsychologist and executive director of the Center for Online \nAddiction. The stock market is so volatile, she said. Ive met \nmany day traders who are depressed and suicidal, who lost their nest \negg in three months.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough its difficult to calculate how many online trading addicts \nexist, Young said 10-15 percent of online addiction cases she sees \ninvolve day trading. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs for Schavran, he remains hospitalized seven days after his \napparent suicide attempt. While Baud-Fischer said she was angry with \nhim for taking her sisters life, she also said she \npartially-understood the reason.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe can understand why because they were so deeply in love, she told \nNewsday. \\\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\nABCNEWS.com\u0014",

Those who trekked to the headquarters of \nDale Earnhardt Inc. yesterday were having a hard time believing it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"I've followed racing for 20 years, and Dale \nEarnhardt has always been my hero,\" said Dave Casing, of Michigan, \nwho stopped\u0014\n                     by Morrisville on his trip home from Daytona \nBeach, Fla., where he had watched the race Sunday. \"Something about \nhim\u0014\n                     attracted me - his no-holds-barred, go-for-it, \ngung-ho, relentless approach to racing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"He was my hero,\" said Ron Gist of Union, S.C. \n\"From the git-go, he was the only true race car driver out there. \nHe's a throwback\u0014\n                     to the old days, bumping cars and doing anything \nto win. He made Sundays enjoyable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, \nwas a lightning rod, either loved or hated with precious little \nmiddle ground for\u0014\n                     the undecided. Loved by his fans for his \naggressive driving, he was vilified and cursed for the same reason by \nfans of other\u0014\n                     drivers.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Whatever fans' opinions of him, Earnhardt's rise \nin and dominance of the sport coincided with NASCAR's rise from a \nregional\u0014\n                     pastime to a national obsession, and many give \nEarnhardt credit.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Yesterday, as throngs brought flowers, balloons, \ncards, posters, hats and T-shirts to place on the gate outside \nEarnhardt's garage,\u0014\n                     his followers said he did his job the way \neveryone should - relentlessly striving to be the best. As for his \nwillingness to bump other\u0014\n                     drivers, they described it as the difference \nthat made him the best: He was the gunslinger who keeps a knife in \nhis boot to give\u0014\n                     him the edge, the gambler with a derringer \ntucked in his vest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"He ruled the track, and that's why they called \nhim 'The Intimidator,'\" said Naomi Gist, Ron's wife. \"If it wasn't \nfor the little\u0014\n                     bumps, it wouldn't be racing. NASCAR is never \ngoing to be the same without Dale Earnhardt. It's going to be hard to \nwatch it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"He was definitely an intimidator,\" said Albert \nNorton, of Fayetteville, N.C. \"He was doing a bit of that Sunday.\" \nNorton said he\u0014\n                     was never an Earnhardt fan but dropped by \nyesterday with his son to pay his respects.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Talking about Earnhardt seemed to be the only \nway his fans could cope, but sometimes even that wasn't enough. Radio \nstations\u0014\n                     across western North Carolina opened their phone \nlines to racing fans yesterday, and Earnhardt fans jammed the lines, \nweeping\u0014\n                     over the airwaves as DJs awkwardly tried to \nconsole them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     One 10-year-old girl named Angel choked up \nlisteners of WSOC-FM as she broke down crying on the air. She was in \nthe middle\u0014\n                     of telling a DJ that, once assigned to write an \nessay about a famous person in history, she had chosen the native of \nlittle\u0014\n                     Kannapolis, Dale Earnhardt, as her subject. The \nmemory made her sob.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     As listeners swamped radio stations with phone \ncalls, e-mail and fax messages and requests to play myriad \nsentimental tributes\u0014\n                     to Earnhardt, many motorists drove with their \nheadlights on - \"burning their headlights,\" as locals called it - to \nshow the\u0014\n                     Earnhardt family their respect. Many residents \nof the Charlotte area pledged to light candles in their windows at \nexactly 7:03\u0014\n                     p.m. - the seven for each of Earnhardt's \nchampionships, the three for the number of his fabled black Chevrolet.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Across North Carolina, state flags whipped in \nthe wind at half staff. At Earnhardt's garage, four flags lowered on \ntheir poles\u0014\n                     snapped fiercely in the wind: the U.S. and North \nCarolina flags, a checkered flag, and the black, red and gold \nEarnhardt\u0014\n                     pennant featuring a compass rose.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The crowd in front of the flags - numbering in \nthe hundreds at any time during the day - remained hushed where they \nstood.\u0014\n                     Behind them whirred the generators of nearly 20 \ntelevision satellite trucks. News crews mingled among the crowd, \ninterviewing\u0014\n                     fans as they stood and wept. Overhead, one \nstation's helicopter thumped along in circles. While some fans wept, \nothers placed\u0014\n                     flowers in the gate or read some of the many \nposters and letters left by fans.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Some posters simply said \"The Intimidator,\" \n\"Black Knight\" or \"The Man in Black.\" Others brimmed with emotion.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Dearest Dale,\" read one left by Karen and James \nWilkerson of Salisbury, N.C., \"how do the thousands of loyal fans \nlike me say\u0014\n                     goodbye to you? For so many of us, you were \nNASCAR, you were the only reason we watched the races. We know you \nleft us\u0014\n                     doing what you loved best, but that doesn't ease \nthe horrible pain and loss we feel. You were the Greatest Driver \nEver, and\u0014\n                     nothing in the racing world will ever be the \nsame.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                     \"Thank you for many wonderful Sunday \nafternoons,\" read one left by Bob and Brenda Gascoigne, of Concord, \nN.C.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Another said, simply, \"God speed, Dale.\"\u0014",

Where does this \nidea come from, and\u0014\n                             what does the Bible have to say about \nit? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                      Nathan Miller\u0014\n                                                      Rosedale, Ohio\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A: The exorcism of territorial spirits is a \ngrowing practice\u0014\n                      around the globe, including among evangelicals \nin America. I\u0014\n                      know of a group of Christians who flew to a \nforeign city where\u0014\n                      they spread into key neighborhoods and historic \nspots to\u0014\n                      identify the demons that ruled over those \nareas. Afterward\u0014\n                      they reassembled for a time of aggressive \nprayer to name and\u0014\n                      bind the demons so that the gospel could spread \npowerfully\u0014\n                      there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In terms of influence, perhaps two decades of \noverly\u0014\n                      mechanistic techniques, including church-growth \nmethods\u0014\n                      and step-by-step evangelistic and discipleship \nprograms, have\u0014\n                      left Christians thirsting for raw \nsupernaturalism. In response,\u0014\n                      the church has seen a series of emphases on \npower\u0014\n                      evangelism, prophetic ministry, and even \"holy \nlaughter.\"\u0014\n                      Also, the New Age interest in spirit guides has \nstimulated a\u0014\n                      corresponding fascination among evangelicals \nwith angels\u0014\n                      and demons, evident, for example, in the \nenormous popularity\u0014\n                      of Frank Peretti's novels. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The territorial component grewat least in \npartout of the\u0014\n                      notable effectiveness of citywide evangelistic \ncampaigns in\u0014\n                      Latin America. Some evangelists in those \ncampaigns\u0014\n                      attributed their success to days spent in \nwrestling in prayer\u0014\n                      against the powers of darkness. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I believe there is another influence as well: \nanimism, which is\u0014\n                      strong in much of Latin America, Africa, and \nAsia. In\u0014\n                      animism, all sorts of spirits are \nworshipedincluding those of\u0014\n                      tribes and geographic territories. When this \nanimistic\u0014\n                      world-view is taken at face value, a certain \nlogic follows:\u0014\n                      demons oppose the church; extended prayer leads \nto\u0014\n                      powerful evangelism; some demons are \nterritorial, and thus\u0014\n                      can only be overcome through on-site citywide \nexorcism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is not the first time that Christians have \nattempted to\u0014\n                      discern the bureaucratic structure of the \nspirit world. Some of\u0014\n                      the early church fathers tried to reconstruct \ndemon\u0014\n                      hierarchies. The medieval church tried again. \nBut when the\u0014\n                      Reformation led the church back to the Word of \nGod, Luther,\u0014\n                      Calvin, and Wesley each renounced such \nspeculation as\u0014\n                      futile. What does the Bible itself say about \nthis practice?\u0014\n                      Actually, very little. Instead, the Old \nTestament focuses on\u0014\n                      God's sovereignty, noting that even Satan \nrequires God's\u0014\n                      permission before doing evil (Job 1:6-12). \nWhile Daniel alludes\u0014\n                      briefly to a \"prince of Persia\" and a \"prince \nof Greece\" (10:13,\u0014\n                      20), these \"princes\" are not colleagues ruling \nover different\u0014\n                      regions, but competitors, battling each other \n(see 11:2).\u0014\n                      Daniel is describing the future history of the \nMiddle East: with\u0014\n                      Persia falling before Greece, and Greece \nsplitting into four\u0014\n                      smaller kingdoms (Dan. 11-12). Of course, any \nnation that\u0014\n                      attacks the people of God is serving the cause \nof Satan. This\u0014\n                      much Daniel intends. But Daniel never prays \nagainst demon\u0014\n                      princes over Persia or Greece nor attempts to \ncast them from\u0014\n                      their respective regions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another commonly cited passage is Revelation \n2:12-13,\u0014\n                      which says Satan resides in Pergamum. A \nliteralistic\u0014\n                      interpretation of this passage, however, poses \nmore\u0014\n                      complications than clarification. If, as some \nclaim, a demon's\u0014\n                      power is reflected in the size of its \nterritory, the identification\u0014\n                      with Pergamum reduces Satan to relative \ninsignificance.\u0014\n                      Furthermore, Satan would then need to live and \nwork in\u0014\n                      Pergamum, yet worship in Smyrna (Rev. 2:9) and\u0014\n                      Philadelphia (Rev. 3:9) and teach Sunday school \nin Thyatira\u0014\n                      (Rev. 2:24). This is a lot of commuting for a \n\"territorial\" spirit!\u0014\n                      In the end, the closest things to territorial \nspirits in the New\u0014\n                      Testament are the angelsnot the demonsof \nRevelation 2\u0014\n                      and 3 (each assigned to one of the seven \nchurches). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The Bible has more to say about the practice of \n\"shouting\u0014\n                      down\" the Devil, but in consistently negative \nterms. In\u0014\n                      contrast to the Qumran community (of Dead Sea \nScrolls\u0014\n                      fame), whose liturgy included curses of Satan \nalongside\u0014\n                      praise of God, Jude 8-10 and 2 Peter 2:10-12 \nrebuke those\u0014\n                      who verbally abuse spirits. We do better, Jude \nwarns, simply\u0014\n                      to turn the demons over to God. Satan is indeed \na formidable\u0014\n                      adversary (1 Pet. 5:8), yet Jesus has already \nconquered him\u0014\n                      on the cross (Col. 2:15) and will one day \nconfine him in hell\u0014\n                      (Rev. 20:1-10). In the meantime, we are called \nto oppose\u0014\n                      Satanbut not by identifying the names of his \nsubordinates,\u0014\n                      reconstructing their hierarchy, or mapping \ntheir supposed\u0014\n                      jurisdictions. Rather, we are called to stand \nfirm through\u0014\n                      spiritual disciplines (Eph. 6:10-18), persevere \nin persecution\u0014\n                      (Rev. 3:21), and cast out demons as they become \nmanifest in\u0014\n                      people (Acts 16:16-18). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Chuck Lowe, author of Territorial Spirits \nand World\u0014\n                      Evangelisation?

Missionaries systematically \ndestroyed native\u0014\n                      cultures around the globe. Millions of witches \nwere burned in\u0014\n                      the Middle Ages because the church didn't want \nwomen to\u0014\n                      have any power.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      All of the above statements have three things \nin common.\u0014\n                      One, they are frequently repeated in popular \nand even\u0014\n                      scholarly writing. Two, they portray Christians \nin exceedingly\u0014\n                      unfavorable light. Three, they are all false. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the new book \"Six Modern Myths About \nChristianity &\u0014\n                      Western Civilization\" (InterVarsity), Philip J. \nSampson\u0014\n                      deconstructs such \"modern stories of our place \nin the\u0014\n                      universe [which] cannot be regarded as history \nsimply\u0014\n                      because they are recent texts.\" In addition to \nthe four myths\u0014\n                      mentioned above, he tackles the notions that \nGenesis is an\u0014\n                      environmentalist's nightmare and that \nChristians loathe the\u0014\n                      human body.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sampson traces each myth to its origins, often \nin the\u0014\n                      nineteenth century, then gives it the drubbing \nit deserves.\u0014\n                      Frequently even a cursory look at the \nhistorical facts uncovers\u0014\n                      fraud. For example, Sampson notes, Galileo was \nnever\u0014\n                      tortured; he had servants during his \nimprisonment and died\u0014\n                      peacefully in his bed. Darwin was far more \nconcerned about\u0014\n                      ridicule from his scientific colleagues than \nabout opposition\u0014\n                      from Christians. Missionaries were usually the \nmost vocal\u0014\n                      opponents of colonial injustices such as \nslavery, the liquor\u0014\n                      trade, and the abuse of native women. By the \nbest recent\u0014\n                      estimates, fewer than 100,000 witches were \nexecuted in\u0014\n                      Europe and North America over 300 years of \n\"witch-hunting,\"\u0014\n                      and the numbers were comparatively low in the \ncountries\u0014\n                      (Italy and Spain) where the Inquisition was \nstrongest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Glaring factual errors are not, however, \nSampson's real prey.\u0014\n                      He is most interested in exposing the ways in \nwhich modern\u0014\n                      myths, like ancient ones, are used to bolster \nthe authority of\u0014\n                      ruling powers and discredit potential \nchallengers. Enlightened\u0014\n                      science proclaims its supremacy over \nsuperstitious religion\u0014\n                      by proving that, when the two clashed in the \npast, the church\u0014\n                      always showed itself to be stupid, stubborn, \nand downright\u0014\n                      malicious. Pluralism gets a boost by portraying \nChristianity\u0014\n                      as the mortal enemy of cultural diversity. \nEnvironmentalists,\u0014\n                      feminists, Wiccansanyone can shore up claims to\u0014\n                      legitimacy or even coveted victim status by \ntaking pot shots\u0014\n                      at the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not only do assaults on the church make \nChristians look bad\u0014\n                      and the attackers look good, Sampson argues, \nsuch assaults\u0014\n                      relieve secular powers of responsibility for \nsociety's ills. This\u0014\n                      agenda is particularly evident in the modern \nwitch-hunting\u0014\n                      myth. Sampson writes, \"The fact is that \nsomewhere between\u0014\n                      90 and 99 percent of the cruel deaths reported \nby the story of\u0014\n                      witch-hunting are fictional. Exaggeration on \nthis scale\u0014\n                      requires explanation. What can have possessed \nso wide a\u0014\n                      range of authors to imagine the torture and \nexecution of\u0014\n                      millions of women? No doubt there are many \nsocial and\u0014\n                      psychological factors involved here, but by \ninventing so many\u0014\n                      deaths and attributing them to the church, the \nmodern mind\u0014\n                      evades its own responsibilities and gains an \nalibi for the\u0014\n                      unprecedented slaughter of the twentieth \ncentury.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sampson does a good job of making serious \nmaterial highly\u0014\n                      readable. He has done his research (each \nchapter has\u0014\n                      dozens of endnotes), but he doesn't hit readers \nover the head\u0014\n                      with it. He also remains quite balanced, \nconsidering that his\u0014\n                      topic is a myth-busting defense of \nChristianity. Where critics\u0014\n                      are right and Christians were wrong, Sampson is \nnot afraid to\u0014\n                      admit it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Sampson's approach will not, however, appeal to \neveryone.\u0014\n                      He overwhelmingly relies on secondary sources, \nwhich is\u0014\n                      appropriate where his point is how badly other \nwriters have\u0014\n                      mangled the truth but discomfiting where he is \nattempting to\u0014\n                      set the record straight. The use of endnotes, \nrather than\u0014\n                      footnotes or in-text citation, compounds this \nproblem,\u0014\n                      because the reader cannot immediately tell how \nauthoritative\u0014\n                      Sampson's sources really are. Also, Sampson's \ncases\u0014\n                      against the myths are unevensome appeal \nprimarily to\u0014\n                      Scripture, some to historical facts, some to \ndifferences of\u0014\n                      interpretation. One wonders (a) whether the \n\"winner\" would be\u0014\n                      so clear if different aspects of each case were \nhighlighted,\u0014\n                      and (b) which form of argumentation is closest \nto Sampson's\u0014\n                      expertise. The book's dust jacket declines to \nidentify the\u0014\n                      author's specialty, noting merely that he holds \na Ph.D. in\u0014\n                      \"social sciences.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      6 Modern Myths will raise some eyebrows (mine \nshot up at\u0014\n                      several points) and give lay people valuable \nresources for\u0014\n                      defending Christianity against its cultural \ndespisers.\u0014\n                      Unfortunately, due to its popular focus, the \nbook will probably\u0014\n                      do little to curtail the myths' circulation. \nErasing each of these\u0014\n                      misconceptions from societal memory will \nprobably require an\u0014\n                      all-out scholarly crusade. Perhaps Sampson will \ninspire some\u0014\n                      brave souls to take up the task.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Elesha Coffman is associate editor of Christian \nHistory.\u0014",

Can the eternal God die? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                      James Miller, Lexington, \nKentucky\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A: The background to this question is today's \npost-Christian\u0014\n                      perplexity as to whether physical death is the \nend of the person who\u0014\n                      lived in (or, more accurately, through) the \nnow-defunct body. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      All brands of materialistsscientific, \nphilosophical, theoretical\u0014\n                      Marxist, secular irreligious, and antireligious \nEuropean and\u0014\n                      Americansay it is. Everyone else, from ancient \nEgyptians, Greeks,\u0014\n                      and Norsemen to every form of religion and \ntribal culture the world\u0014\n                      has ever seen, has always been sure it isn't. \nHistoric, Bible-based\u0014\n                      Christianity is part of this consensus. On the \nnature of postmortem\u0014\n                      life there are great differences, but on its \nreality, agreement has been\u0014\n                      so widespread that current Western skepticism \nabout survival seems\u0014\n                      a mere local oddity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So the first thing to say is that all human \nselves, with all the powers\u0014\n                      of remembering, relating, learning, purposing, \nand enjoying that make\u0014\n                      us who we are, survive death, and by dying are \nactually set free from\u0014\n                      all shrinkings of personal life due to physical \nfactorshandicaps,\u0014\n                      injuries, and deteriorations of body and mind; \ntorture and starvation;\u0014\n                      Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, AIDS, and \nthe like. This was\u0014\n                      true for both Jesus and the believing criminal \nto whom he said, as\u0014\n                      crucifixion drained their lives away, \"Today \nyou will be with me in\u0014\n                      paradise\"; and it will be just as true for you \nand me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To be sure, the ugliness and pain and aftermath \nof dying as we know\u0014\n                      it is the penalty of sin. For anyone \nunconverted in heart, who is thus\u0014\n                      already \"dead in transgressions\" (Eph. 2:5), \ndying means entering\u0014\n                      more deeply into the death state (meaning, \nseparation from that\u0014\n                      sharing with God that Scripture calls \"life\"). \nWe need to be clear that\u0014\n                      as our penal substitute, Jesus \"tasted death\" \n(Heb. 2:9) in this deep\u0014\n                      sense precisely to ensure that we would never \nhave to taste it. The\u0014\n                      natural view of his cry from the cross, \"My \nGod, my God, why have\u0014\n                      you forsaken me?\" (first words of Ps. 22, Matt. \n27:46), is that he was\u0014\n                      telling the bystanders, and through them the \nworld, that in fulfillment\u0014\n                      of prophecy he was already undergoing deep \ndeath, as we may call\u0014\n                      it, during those dark hours. Godforsakenness \nwas the hell into which\u0014\n                      Jesus entered on the cross; as Rabbi Duncan \nonce told a class, with\u0014\n                      tears in his eyes, \"it was damnation, and he \ntook it lovingly.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Incarnation gave the eternal Son of God \ncapacity for this experience.\u0014\n                      \"The Word became flesh\" in the sense that \nwithout ceasing to be\u0014\n                      anything that he was before, he added to \nhimself all that humanness\u0014\n                      in this world involvesnamely, life through a \nbody bounded by space\u0014\n                      and time, with all the glories, limitations, \nand vulnerabilities that\u0014\n                      belong to our everyday existence, including in \ndue course leaving\u0014\n                      behind the body through which one has \nconsciously lived all along.\u0014\n                      Shakespeare, we know, acted in the plays he \nauthored and\u0014\n                      produced, and that is a faint parallel to the \nco-Creator living an\u0014\n                      ordered creaturely life within his own created \nworld. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are mysteries here beyond our grasphow, \nfor instance, the\u0014\n                      sense of human and of divine identity meshed; \nhow the Son\u0014\n                      controlled his divine powers so as not to \noverstep the limits of human\u0014\n                      finiteness; how entire dependence on his \nFather's leading for every\u0014\n                      word and deed made him the most unnerving \ninitiative taker ever\u0014\n                      seen; and so on. But the certain fact is that \nas his life was a divine\u0014\n                      person's totally human life, so his dying was a \ndivine person's totally\u0014\n                      human death. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor was Jesus' dying the end of the story. His \nrising from the dead,\u0014\n                      of which Scripture speaks as the work of all \nthree persons of the\u0014\n                      Trinity (John 10:17-18; Acts 13:30; 1 Pet. \n3:18), was a fresh exercise\u0014\n                      of the power that made the world and effected \nthe Incarnation, leading\u0014\n                      on to the further work of power whereby the Son \nwas glorified and\u0014\n                      enthroned, now to live as the God-Man in \nunbroken fellowship with\u0014\n                      his Father forever (Rom. 6:9-10). His \nresurrection and glorification is\u0014\n                      the prototype of what awaits all believers, and \nhis experience of dying\u0014\n                      guarantees that when it is time for us to leave \nthis world his loving,\u0014\n                      supportive, sympathizing presence with us will, \nas William Williams's\u0014\n                      hymn puts it, \"land me safe on Canaan's side.\" \nSuch is God's great\u0014\n                      grace. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theology is not for casual curiosity, but for \nheartfelt doxology, and\u0014\n                      never more so than when Christ's death is the \ntheme.

A consensus was then \nreached to remove the fences so children wouldn't feel confined. The \nopposite effect occurred. Researchers found that the children became \nmore inhibited with their activities. They tended to huddle toward \nthe middle of the playground and exhibited signs of insecurity. When \nthe fences were replaced, the children played with greater enthusiasm \nand freedom. We all need boundaries--something to define the limits \nof safety and security. Existential thought suggests that boundaries \nrestrict creativity, but as the children on the playground \ndemonstrated, we need a clear understanding of what is safe and \nacceptable so our creativity can flourish.\u0014\n\u0014\n* \"Discipline--You Can't Succeed Without It!\" Hank Tate\u0014",

As\u0014\n                      early as the eighteenth century, some scholars \nusing the\u0014\n                      then-new methods of higher criticism had \ndismissed the early\u0014\n                      biblical accounts as legends. By the end of the \nnineteenth\u0014\n                      century, Julius Wellhausen had unified decades \nof theorizing\u0014\n                      about the authorship of the Pentateuch into his \nnow-famous\u0014\n                      (slightly modified) \nJahwist-Elohist-Priestly-Deuteronomist grid.\u0014\n                      Known as the Documentary Hypothesis, this \ntheory claimed\u0014\n                      to detect four different authors or documents \nbehind the\u0014\n                      \"Books of Moses.\" By distinguishing these \nvarious sources,\u0014\n                      one could understand the development and \nprogress of\u0014\n                      Jewish religion from its primitive nomadic \norigins through the\u0014\n                      era of the Prophets onward to a religion of the \nLaw. Thus,\u0014\n                      instead of believing the Law was given to Moses \non Mount\u0014\n                      Sinai in the second millennium B.C., Wellhausen \nthought it\u0014\n                      was composed after the Jews had returned from \ntheir exile in\u0014\n                      Babylon only 450 years before Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though discounting the stories of early Israel \nis not new, the\u0014\n                      rise of the current skepticism is surprising \nbecause of what\u0014\n                      came between the Wellhausens of the past \ncentury and the\u0014\n                      Lemches of the present decade: the moderating \ninfluence of\u0014\n                      William Foxwell Albright, the \"dean of biblical \narchaeology.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      When Albright was born in 1891, Wellhausen's \ntheory had\u0014\n                      already become the reigning orthodoxy in Old \nTestament\u0014\n                      studies. Later, as an established professor of \nSemitic\u0014\n                      languages at Johns Hopkins University, Albright \nrecalled that\u0014\n                      as a young student he had absorbed the \nassumptions of\u0014\n                      higher critics like Wellhausen and had held to \nan \"initially\u0014\n                      rather skeptical attitude toward the accuracy \nof Israelite\u0014\n                      historical tradition.\" However, while taking \npart in\u0014\n                      archaeological digs in Palestine as a graduate \nstudent, his\u0014\n                      skepticism \"suffered repeated jolts as \ndiscovery after\u0014\n                      discovery confirmed the historicity of details \nwhich might\u0014\n                      reasonably have been considered legendary.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Albright came to suspect scholars like \nWellhausen who built\u0014\n                      grand theories on textual speculation. He saw \nlittle use in\u0014\n                      surmising, for example, whether the children of \nIsrael had\u0014\n                      conquered Canaan. To know, one needed to dig \nand see if\u0014\n                      there existed the layers of destruction that \nwould correspond\u0014\n                      to an Israelite conquest. Empirical facts, not \nabstract theory,\u0014\n                      held the answers. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Perfecting modern excavation techniques, \nAlbright and others\u0014\n                      discovered cities in Judah whose destruction \nlayers seemed\u0014\n                      to support the biblical accounts of the \nBabylonian exile.\u0014\n                      Pottery inscriptions revealed the existence of \na Sea People\u0014\n                      called the Philistines. And thirteenth-century \ndevastation\u0014\n                      layers at a site believed to be biblical Bethel \nwere interpreted\u0014\n                      by Albright's student G. Ernest Wright to be \nthe work of\u0014\n                      Joshua's army. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Eventually, even many liberal scholars began to \naccept the\u0014\n                      general outline of biblical history proposed by \nthe\u0014\n                      \"Albright-Wright synthesis.\" So influential in \nthe middle years\u0014\n                      of this century was their biblical archaeology, \nas it came to\u0014\n                      be called, that as recently as 1981 Old \nTestament scholar\u0014\n                      John Bright could state, \"There can really be \nlittle doubt that\u0014\n                      ancestors of Israel had been slaves in Egypt \nand had\u0014\n                      escaped in some marvelous way.

The answer, says James \nHoffmeier of\u0014\n                      Wheaton College in Illinois, is summed up in \none phrase: the\u0014\n                      hermeneutics of suspicion. If Albright had been \nable to\u0014\n                      convince a generation of scholars that the \nBible's account of\u0014\n                      Israel's origin could be matched in general \nterms to the\u0014\n                      evidence from the digs, it was because the \nBible was still\u0014\n                      considered \"innocent until found guilty.\" The \nundoing of the\u0014\n                      Albright antidote to Wellhausen skepticism came \nwhen\u0014\n                      people like Lemche and Thompson began insisting \nthat the\u0014\n                      Bible stories should be viewed as fables until \nindisputable\u0014\n                      evidence proved them to be historical. The \naccounts were now\u0014\n                      seen as fictional until proven factual, guilty \nuntil proven\u0014\n                      innocent. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This virulent neoskepticism has proven \nexceptionally resistant\u0014\n                      to anything smacking of a \"fundamentalist\" \ninterpretation, and\u0014\n                      its proponents have set about revising what \nthey believe was\u0014\n                      the Albright school's overeager attempts to \nidentify\u0014\n                      discoveries as biblical events when other \nevents in Near\u0014\n                      Eastern history could account for them just as \nwell or better.\u0014\n                      For the minimalists, the paradigm shift has \nleft the Bible\u0014\n                      largely irrelevant and the fight over the \nBible's historical value\u0014\n                      pass. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Answering the minimalists\u0014\n                      But the battle for Jericho, the Exodus, and the \nother stories of\u0014\n                      Israel's origins isn't over yet, say Hoffmeier, \nwho has just\u0014\n                      published a monograph titled Israel in Egypt \nwith Oxford\u0014\n                      University Press, and Kenneth Kitchen, a veteran\u0014\n                      ancient-languages expert at the University of \nLiverpool in\u0014\n                      England. It is just the beginning of round \nthree. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In countering the revisionist history, these \ntwo bring\u0014\n                      something to the fight that Lemche and Thompson \nand most\u0014\n                      of the radical minimalists (with the exception \nof D. B. Redford)\u0014\n                      don't have: the credentials of being \nEgyptologists in addition\u0014\n                      to backgrounds in biblical studies and \nSyro-Palestinian\u0014\n                      archaeology. Using their unusual expertise, \nthey are pointing\u0014\n                      to discoveries that, vis--vis the minimalist \npronouncements,\u0014\n                      show the historical plausibility of the \nfollowing Bible stories: \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Father Abraham. The Bible says God called \nAbraham out of\u0014\n                      Ur of the Chaldeans (modern Iraq) and led him \nto the land of\u0014\n                      Canaan (modern Israel). From his descendants \narose the 12\u0014\n                      tribes of Israel. These Semitic-speaking, \nAsiatic people\u0014\n                      migrated to Egypt, returning only 400 years \nlater to settle\u0014\n                      Canaan, the land promised to their forefather. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not so, say the minimalists. One suggests the \nstory is a\u0014\n                      myth written in the sixth century B.C. to \nconsole the Jews\u0014\n                      being held in Babylon with the knowledge that \nthey are really\u0014\n                      \"back home,\" since \"Abraham\" had originated \nfrom there. And\u0014\n                      just as God had led their forefather to Canaan, \nthey too would\u0014\n                      one day return to the land promised his seed. \nSeen this way,\u0014\n                      the story reflects the circumstances of the \nmiddle of the first\u0014\n                      millennium B.C., not the first half of the \nsecond millennium\u0014\n                      B.C. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      If so, asks Kitchen, how does one explain the \nfollowing odd\u0014\n                      coincidences: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Abrahamif he existedwould have lived \nsometime\u0014\n                           between 1800 and 1600 B.C. (using the late \nExodus\u0014\n                           dating based on the death of Pharaoh \nRameses II in\u0014\n                           1213 B.C. and Exodus 1:11, which says that \nthe\u0014\n                           children of Israel built the city of \nRameses). Why,\u0014\n                           then, does the Genesis 14 account of \nAbraham\u0014\n                           defeating a coalition of kings from the \neast fit so well\u0014\n                           the geopolitical conditions of thatand \nonly thatera?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Before that time, the region of Mesopotamia was \nclosely\u0014\n                      governed by the dynasties of Ur, and after that \ntime, the\u0014\n                      empires of Babylon and Assyria controlled the \nregion. Only\u0014\n                      during the first half of the second millennium \ncould kings of\u0014\n                      small city-states have roamed the countryside, \nas did the\u0014\n                      potentates Abraham encountered, looking to \nexpand their\u0014\n                      domains. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Abraham, and later Isaac, made a treaty \nwith King\u0014\n                           Abimelech, and Jacob made a treaty with \nLaban. \"I\u0014\n                           have over 90 documents [of ancient \ntreaties and\u0014\n                           covenants] to compare from 2600 B.C. down \nto 600\u0014\n                           B.C.,\" Kitchen told CT, \"and so there's no \nroom for\u0014\n                           mistake here.\" The treaties, he explains, \ntake\u0014\n                           distinctive forms over the centuries, with \noaths and\u0014\n                           curses and stipulations being presented in \ndifferent\u0014\n                           orders and being given different emphases. \nThe ones\u0014\n                           with Abimelech and Laban fit precisely the \nstructure of\u0014\n                           treaties from the middle of the second \nmillenniumbut\u0014\n                           neither later nor earlier ones. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           The names Yitzchak (Isaac), Ya'akov \n(Jacob), Yoseph\u0014\n                           (Joseph), and Yishmael (Ishmael) all begin \nwith\u0014\n                           something linguists call the \"Amorite \nimperfective.\"\u0014\n                           From studying lists of thousands of names \nfound from\u0014\n                           the third millennium and later, Kitchen \nshows that 55\u0014\n                           percent of the names during the time of \nthe Patriarchs\u0014\n                           begin with an i/y sound, but already \"by \n1500 the\u0014\n                           whole thing drops to a tiny percentage and \nnever\u0014\n                           ceases dropping after that.\" Where, \nKitchen asks, did\u0014\n                           the fiction writers of the middle first \nmillennium B.C. get\u0014\n                           these names if they were composing their \nbiblical\u0014\n                           novellas a thousand or more years after \nthe names had\u0014\n                           fallen from popular use? \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Kitchen asks the same question about \nGenesis 37:28,\u0014\n                           which states that Joseph was sold by his \nbrothers to\u0014\n                           slave traders on their way to Egypt for 20 \nsilver\u0014\n                           shekels. Tracking the price of slaves sold \nfrom 2400\u0014\n                           B.C. to 400 B.C. using extrabiblical \nsources, he finds\u0014\n                           that this amount matches exactly the going \nprice in\u0014\n                           the eighteenth century. Steady inflation \nhad driven it up\u0014\n                           to 30 shekels by the thirteenth century \n(which\u0014\n                           corresponds to Exod. 21:32), 50 shekels in \nthe eighth\u0014\n                           century (which corresponds to 2 Kings \n15:20), and to\u0014\n                           nearly 100 shekels soon after the Exile in \nthe sixth\u0014\n                           century. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Joseph in Egypt. Is it realistic to think that a\u0014\n                      Semitic-speaking foreigner like Joseph, and \nlater Moses,\u0014\n                      could have risen to the highest levels of \nEgyptian\u0014\n                      government? Hoffmeier answers by pointing to an \nEgyptian\u0014\n                      tomb discovered in Sakkara, Egypt, in the late \n1980s. It\u0014\n                      contains the coffin of a Semite named Aper-el \nalong with the\u0014\n                      coffins of his wife and children. His titles \ninclude \"vizier,\"\u0014\n                      \"mayor of the city,\" \"judge,\" \"father of god,\" \n\"child of the\u0014\n                      nursery.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hoffmeier points out that Aper-el's name was \nthe first of a\u0014\n                      high-ranking, Semite official to be found \nthere, even though\u0014\n                      Sakkara has been excavated and explored for \nmore than a\u0014\n                      century. \"If such a high-ranking official as \nVizier Aper-el was\u0014\n                      completely unknown to modern scholarship until \nthe late\u0014\n                      1980s, despite the fact that he lived in one of \nthe better\u0014\n                      documented periods of Egyptian history \n[fourteenth century],\u0014\n                      and was buried in arguably the most excavated \nsite in Egypt,\u0014\n                      it is wrong to demand, as some have, that direct\u0014\n                      archaeological evidence for Joseph should be \navailable if he\u0014\n                      were in fact a historical figure.\" This is even \nmore the case,\u0014\n                      he says, because Joseph lived during a period \nwhen surviving\u0014\n                      Egyptian documents of any kind are sparse and \nbecause\u0014\n                      Joseph operated in the Nile Delta, an area that \nremains\u0014\n                      \"underexcavated\" to this day. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Joseph's high ranking becomes even more \nplausible when\u0014\n                      considering the regular migrations and imperial \ntransactions\u0014\n                      that occurred between Canaan and Egypt, as seen \nin the\u0014\n                      following discoveries: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           The Wisdom of Merikare and the Prophecy of \nNeferti,\u0014\n                           ancient Egyptian documents, report \ninfluxes of\u0014\n                           thousands of Semites into the Nile Delta \nbetween 2200\u0014\n                           and 2000 B.C. Similar patterns of \nsettlement recurred\u0014\n                           over the next thousand years, creating a \n\"significant\u0014\n                           Asiatic population\" in the Delta region, \nsays Hoffmeier.\u0014\n                           The Merikare document explains that these \nAsiatic,\u0014\n                           Semitic-speaking peoples, like Jacob and \nhis sons,\u0014\n                           had come to the fertile Delta area in \nsearch of food\u0014\n                           during times of famine. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           For several periods in its history, \nEgypt's empire\u0014\n                           expanded into surrounding regions, \nincluding Canaan.\u0014\n                           During these times, young men and boys \nfrom those\u0014\n                           provinces were brought to Egypt to be \ntrained in the\u0014\n                           pharaoh's ways and later sent back home as \nregional\u0014\n                           rulers who were loyal to the pharaoh. \nAlso, a study on\u0014\n                           foreign children reared in the pharaoh's \nnurseries\u0014\n                           during the eighteenth dynasty shows that \nsome of\u0014\n                           these children became court officials, and \nthat a few\u0014\n                           eventually attained high government posts. \nThe\u0014\n                           similarities to the stories of Joseph and \nMoses (and\u0014\n                           Aper-el) are obvious. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           For two centuries ending in 1550 B.C., a \nforeign Asiatic\u0014\n                           people called the Hyksos actually ruled \nEgypt. After\u0014\n                           their expulsion, the new pharaoh extended \nhis rule into\u0014\n                           Canaan and Syria, transporting back to \nEgypt many\u0014\n                           prisoners of war.

When I look at the \nquestion as an\u0014\n                           Egyptologist, I know that there are \nthought to have\u0014\n                           been 20,000 in the entire Egyptian army at \nthe height\u0014\n                           of Egypt's empire. And at the battle of Ai \nin Joshua 7,\u0014\n                           there was a severe military setback when \n36 troops\u0014\n                           were killed. If you have an army of \n600,000, that's not a\u0014\n                           big setback.\" In other words, the head \ncount may have\u0014\n                           been far fewer than suggested by a literal \nreading of\u0014\n                           Exodus 12:37. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           While conservative scholars debate an \n\"early\" and\u0014\n                           \"late\" date for the Exodus (fifteenth \ncentury or\u0014\n                           thirteenth century B.C.), all but the most \nskeptical\u0014\n                           scholars agree that the Israelites were in \nCanaan by\u0014\n                           the year 1208 B.C.

But the \nundeniable fact is that\u0014\n                      a pharaoh considered Israel's defeat worth \ninscribing on\u0014\n                      stone, and that a people called Israel lived in \nCanaan by that\u0014\n                      time.

But so far it has \ncreated more\u0014\n                      turmoil in the BGC than in any other Christian \nbody. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The leading proponent of open theism in the \nBGC, Gregory\u0014\n                      Boyd, teaches at Bethel and pastors Woodland \nHills Church\u0014\n                      in St. Paul, one of the five largest churches \nin the conference.\u0014\n                      Last June, he found himself fighting for his \ntheologyand his\u0014\n                      jobas his denomination debated whether it \ncould be open to\u0014\n                      openness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though Boyd had long espoused openness views, \nthese\u0014\n                      views invited relatively little debate until \nfive years ago, when\u0014\n                      BGC pastors started asking about this sentence \nin Boyd's\u0014\n                      1994 book Letters from a Skeptic: \"God can't \nforeknow the\u0014\n                      good or bad decisions of the people he creates \nuntil he\u0014\n                      creates these people, and they, in turn, create \ntheir\u0014\n                      decisions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The complaints increased in volume and \nfrequency until, in\u0014\n                      1996, Bethel formed an internal committee to \nevaluate this\u0014\n                      position and its effect, if any, on Boyd's \nemployment status.\u0014\n                      The committee found Boyd's views \"within the \nbounds of\u0014\n                      evangelical Christian orthodoxy and compatible \nwith the\u0014\n                      theological commitments expected of faculty \nmembers at\u0014\n                      Bethel.\" Boyd thus retained his teaching post.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But the battle was just beginning. BGC \nproponents of\u0014\n                      classical theism, led largely by John Piper, \nsenior pastor of\u0014\n                      Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, were \ndismayed by\u0014\n                      this decision. Groups formed with such names as \nthe Edgren\u0014\n                      Fellowship (named after Bethel's founder) and \nConcerned\u0014\n                      Pastors. Primarily through open letters and \nprint publications,\u0014\n                      they took their concerns to the conference as a \nwhole,\u0014\n                      arguing that the denomination's Affirmation of \nFaith be\u0014\n                      changed to unquestionably exclude open theism.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As the debate heated up, leaders at Bethel and \nthe BGC\u0014\n                      discussed ways to maximize the information and \nminimize\u0014\n                      the misinformation disseminated to conference \nmembers. Out\u0014\n                      of these meetings, the Foreknowledge Web site \nwas born.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      'An equal hearing'\u0014\n                      The Foreknowledge site (now housed at\u0014\n                      BGCworld.org/4know/4know.htm) is maintained by \nGary\u0014\n                      Marsh, director of communication for the BGC. \nIt was\u0014\n                      launched in late 1998 with content from a \npacket produced by\u0014\n                      a BGC group called the Committed Pastors. (To \nalleviate\u0014\n                      confusion: the Concerned Pastors believe, along \nwith Piper,\u0014\n                      that Boyd and his views should be purged from \nthe BGC; the\u0014\n                      similarly named Committed Pastors believe the \nopenness\u0014\n                      debate is not essential enough to split the \ndenomination.) \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Call the Foreknowledge site edited and \norganized, but not\u0014\n                      moderated. Marsh sees it as \"an information \nclearinghouse.\"\u0014\n                      Its stated purpose is \"to help members \nunderstand the\u0014\n                      biblical and philosophical issues being \ndiscussed within our\u0014\n                      conference relating to God's foreknowledge\" and \n\"to give all\u0014\n                      concerned parties an equal hearing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marsh lobbied for the site and its \npost-whatever-comes-in\u0014\n                      structure although his bosses were \"very \nreluctant to put\u0014\n                      anything out other than official notices.\" \nMarsh felt this\u0014\n                      approach was too slow and too limited in scope.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Once the BGC leadership said that Boyd's \nposition was\u0014\n                      within the bounds of evangelicalism,\" Marsh \nsays, \"it was\u0014\n                      incumbent upon them to make information on that \nposition\u0014\n                      available so BGC members could evaluate it for \nthemselves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Marsh, whose other duties include video \nproduction and\u0014\n                      oversight of the BGC magazine The Standard, \nposts\u0014\n                      everything from official conference communiqus \nto letters\u0014\n                      and personal essays. He says he has \"no hard \nand fast\u0014\n                      criteria\" for what he posts and estimates that \n90 percent of\u0014\n                      the material he has received was placed online.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      To qualify for the site, posts had to be signed \n(though Marsh\u0014\n                      notes that a few unsigned posts got through) \nand had to\u0014\n                      address the openness debate. Marsh accepted \nmaterial\u0014\n                      equally from both sides. He describes both \nPiper and Boyd\u0014\n                      as \"sympathetic and anxious to get more \nmaterial on\" the\u0014\n                      site.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"In general,\" Marsh says, \"everyone was \nrepresented who\u0014\n                      wished to be.\" But if Boyd's view of open \ntheology raised\u0014\n                      Baptist eyebrows, so did Marsh's view of the \nopen theology\u0014\n                      debate.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Openness or anarchy?\u0014\n                      This free-for-all approach concerned some \nBethel and BGC\u0014\n                      leaders from the beginning. Marsh says he heard \n\"consistent\u0014\n                      concern that if we appear to acknowledge a \nposition then\u0014\n                      more people will see it as viable and be \npersuaded to join.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      But that wasn't the concern of Bethel president \nGeorge\u0014\n                      Brushaber (also senior adviser for Christianity \nToday), who\u0014\n                      was among those who argued against the site as\u0014\n                      constructed. Discussing such a charged issue in \nan open\u0014\n                      forum, he says, is like \"attempting to moderate \na divisive,\u0014\n                      conflict-laden church business meeting without \nRobert's\u0014\n                      Rules of Order.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      And it seemed to Brushaber that the debate \nsometimes went\u0014\n                      more according to Murphy's Law than Robert's \nRules. The\u0014\n                      open theism debate became the sharpest dispute \nin BGC\u0014\n                      history, and Brushaber attributes much of the \nbitterness to\u0014\n                      the Internetthe Foreknowledge site, partisan \nsites, and\u0014\n                      particularly mass e-mail messages, which tended \nto be the\u0014\n                      most vitriolic dispatches of all.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Rumor and innuendo flew fast, and there was \nfear-mongering\u0014\n                      by partisans on both sides,\" he says. \"Both \nsides were guilty\u0014\n                      of misrepresentation, exaggeration, threats, \nand triumphalist\u0014\n                      gloating. It became recreational sport for many \npartisans.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such vitriol wasn't the norm in other venues, \nBrushaber says.\u0014\n                      Both Bethel and the BGC sponsored live debates, \nsome\u0014\n                      between Boyd and Piper personally, which \nreached a total\u0014\n                      audience of thousands. Unlike Internet \nexchanges, Brushaber\u0014\n                      says, these debates were \"conducted with \nclarity, precision,\u0014\n                      mutual respect, and effectiveness.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brushaber also makes a distinction between open \nforum\u0014\n                      interactions and Web publishing of position \npapers from\u0014\n                      people on all sides of the debate. \"These were \nand rightly\u0014\n                      should have been published in hard copy and \nelectronically,\"\u0014\n                      he says, noting that the Foreknowledge site \nserved a good\u0014\n                      purpose in making such resources widely \navailable.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though the Foreknowledge site was (until \nrecently) hosted at\u0014\n                      Bethel's domain, it is not directly affiliated \nwith the college. If\u0014\n                      Bethel had maintained a site on the topic, \nBrushaber says,\u0014\n                      he would have asked one or more informed people \nwith\u0014\n                      theological insight to moderate the discussion \nand conduct it\u0014\n                      more like a theological or academic conference.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Such a forum would have sealed its doors more \ntightly\u0014\n                      against anonymous posts. \"If persons are \nallowed to hide\u0014\n                      behind faades, I question whether they are \ncontributing in\u0014\n                      wholesome ways to the dialogue,\" says the \nBethel president.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      He acknowledges that this approach would have \nslowed the\u0014\n                      exchange of information and limited the number \nof views\u0014\n                      represented, but in this case, slower is \nbetter. \"The speed of\u0014\n                      the exchanges, faster than the speed of \nreflective thought and\u0014\n                      good discerning judgment, was and is \ndetrimental to serious\u0014\n                      theological dialogue,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Hot off the presses\u0014\n                      Is faster better? Is theology better left to \ntheologians? Does\u0014\n                      an unmoderated forum lead to lack of \nmoderation? The\u0014\n                      Internet as we know it is fewer than 10 years \nold, but such\u0014\n                      questions about the proper way to conduct \ntheological debate\u0014\n                      have been around for centuries. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the early fifth century, Augustine of Hippo \nhad fairly limited\u0014\n                      options for spreading his views. He was, \nhowever, extremely\u0014\n                      creative and prolific with what was available. \nHe debated\u0014\n                      Manichees in the public square. He made posters \nand wrote\u0014\n                      catchy jingles against the Donatists. To bring \ndown his\u0014\n                      bitterest foe, the Pelagians, he penned \ntreatises, open letters,\u0014\n                      and the pre-Gutenberg equivalent of pamphlets in\u0014\n                      easy-to-read, conversational Latin.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Augustine's polemics were significant enough to \nsurvive to\u0014\n                      today, but they are hardly his best work. His \nmotto for these\u0014\n                      campaigns was \"Fill their countenance with \nignominy,\" and\u0014\n                      his words were up to the task. His caricatures \nof the\u0014\n                      Donatists, for example, were so cleverly \nconstructed that\u0014\n                      scholars still struggle not to take them at \nface value.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Publishing and polemics played an even more \ndramatic role in\u0014\n                      the 16th century. Historians' frequent aphorism \nthat \"there\u0014\n                      would have been no Reformation without the \nprinting press\"\u0014\n                      contains a good measure of truth.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In 1517, following standard academic procedure, \nyoung Martin\u0014\n                      Luther drafted a list, in Latin, of 95 theses \nhe wished to\u0014\n                      debate. The document was immediately translated \ninto\u0014\n                      German, copied, and passed around town.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Before the end of the year, nameless scribes \nhad translated\u0014\n                      many of Luther's sermons, writings, and theses \ninto German.\u0014\n                      Then scholars across Europe became interested \nin the\u0014\n                      debate, so the works were translated back into \nLatin for more\u0014\n                      serious study.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      With the 1520 publication of Address to the \nChristian Nobility\u0014\n                      of the German Nation, Luther began his long \ncareer of writing\u0014\n                      for audiences much broader than the ranks of \nprofessional\u0014\n                      theologians. The first press run included 4,000 \ncopies, all of\u0014\n                      which sold out in two weeks.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Luther's work, and the Reformation more \ngenerally, drastically\u0014\n                      altered the German media culture of the early \n16th century.\u0014\n                      Historian Phillip Schaff notes that in 1517 \nthere were only 81\u0014\n                      prints in German, mostly devotional literature, \nnewspapers,\u0014\n                      official documents, and satires. By 1520 the \nnumber of prints\u0014\n                      had risen to 571, and just three years later \nthe total stood at\u0014\n                      944.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As Luther's output increased and his arguments \nwith Roman\u0014\n                      Catholics (as well as other Reformers) grew \nmore rancorous,\u0014\n                      the quality of his work suffered. Scholars who \nstudy his most\u0014\n                      vengeful polemics typically seek to excuse them \nor use them\u0014\n                      to undermine Luther's entire program. These \nworks can hardly\u0014\n                      be compared with his more circumspect writing.\u0014\n                      Nevertheless, they illustrate that even the \nmost respected\u0014\n                      theologians have demonstrated the rancor often \nvisible in\u0014\n                      today's Internet dispatches.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"We should take himthe pope, the cardinals, \nand whatever\u0014\n                      riffraff belongs to His Idolatrous and Papal \nHolinessand (as\u0014\n                      blasphemers) tear out their tongues from the \nback, and nail\u0014\n                      them on the gallows,\" Luther once wrote. In \nanother piece, he\u0014\n                      rejected rabbinical interpretations of \nScripture as \"Jewish piss\u0014\n                      and sh.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Partisans on both sides of the Reformation \nfollowed in this\u0014\n                      coarse mold. Cartoonish woodcuts depicted demons\u0014\n                      defecating in the mouths of Luther's opponents, \npeasants\u0014\n                      breaking wind at the pope, and Luther cooking \nup a devil's\u0014\n                      recipe for falsehood, unbelief, and other \nvices. If today's\u0014\n                      Baptists are, in Brushaber's words, \"guilty of\u0014\n                      misrepresentation, exaggeration, threats, and \ntriumphalist\u0014\n                      gloating,\" Luther and many of his fellow \nReformers would\u0014\n                      probably have had few qualms about it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once the press had been unleashed in \ntheological discourse,\u0014\n                      it was put to work for all sorts of causes. \nMilton campaigned\u0014\n                      fiercely for topics as diverse as \nchurch-sanctioned divorce,\u0014\n                      unlicensed printing, and the elimination of \nbishops. The 18th\u0014\n                      century saw an explosion of pamphleteering on \npolitical and\u0014\n                      religious topics in France, America, Ireland, \nand elsewhere. In\u0014\n                      the 19th century, abolition and other Civil War \nconcerns\u0014\n                      occasioned a flood of cheaply printed, simply \nreasoned, and\u0014\n                      largely emotional appeals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Though theological questions were still debated \nin seminaries\u0014\n                      and at conferences, these venues ceased long \nago to be the\u0014\n                      only battlegrounds. This is especially true in \ndenominations\u0014\n                      like the Baptist General Conference, in which\u0014\n                      member-delegates actually vote on doctrinal \nissues. Each\u0014\n                      BGC congregation sends a number of members to \nvote at the\u0014\n                      Annual Conference in accordance with its \nsizeand\u0014\n                      theological educations and exposure levels vary \nwidely. Votes\u0014\n                      come not just from the pulpits, but from the \npewssomething\u0014\n                      not even Reformation-era propagandists \nenvisioned when\u0014\n                      battling for the hearts and minds of their \nreaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Soapboxes and 'bughouse squares' have always \nbeen with\u0014\n                      us,\" Brushaber says. \"Now the Web serves those \npurposes.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Both ally and enemy\u0014\n                      Was the Web a friend or a foe in the doctrinal \ndebate? John\u0014\n                      Piper did not respond to CT's requests for an \ninterview, but\u0014\n                      Greg Boyd, the man at the center of the BGC's \nbattle, talked\u0014\n                      openly about the process. Boyd says he came \nlate to the\u0014\n                      electronic discussion on open theism. \"For a \nwhile, I had no\u0014\n                      idea how much people used the Internet,\" Boyd \nsays. He\u0014\n                      thought of it as merely \"e-mail with a \nmegaphone.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Once he discovered all the activity at the \nForeknowledge and\u0014\n                      other Web sites, however, he quickly got \ninvolved. He now\u0014\n                      sees the Web as \"a powerful tool that can be \nused for you or\u0014\n                      against you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the positive side, Boyd appreciates the \nWeb's capacity to\u0014\n                      disseminate information efficiently and \neffectively. This\u0014\n                      capacity was showcased at the BGC Annual \nConference in\u0014\n                      1999, where delegates were asked to vote on an \namendment\u0014\n                      to the Affirmation of Faith that had been \ndrafted specifically to\u0014\n                      exclude Boyd's views.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"It always impressed me how much people cited \nthe Web\u0014\n                      site,\" he says. He was also impressed by the \ntraffic on the\u0014\n                      site he started on his own, Gregboyd.org. \"At \none point, we\u0014\n                      were getting 1,000 hits a daypeople coming \nfrom all over\u0014\n                      the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      On the negative side of the Internet question, \nBoyd has two\u0014\n                      primary concerns: that the Web caused the \ndebate to be so\u0014\n                      politicized, and that electronic communication \ncan so quickly\u0014\n                      spin out of control.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Boyd likens online discussion to a conversation \non which an\u0014\n                      interested third party is eavesdropping. He \nsays this\u0014\n                      \"changes the whole flavor\" of the conversation \nas the\u0014\n                      speakers stop listening carefully to each other \nand start\u0014\n                      crafting their statements as sound bites for \nthe eavesdropper.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"By virtue of mass marketing,\" he says, \"you \nlose some\u0014\n                      ground in terms of thoroughness. Now the person \nwith the\u0014\n                      best technology has the upper hand.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Boyd's second concern, the inability to control \nelectronic\u0014\n                      communication, arose from a lesson he learned \nthe hard way,\u0014\n                      when he \"inadvertently and indiscreetly\" used a \nphrasesafe\u0014\n                      havenhe wishes he could just \"let die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After the 1999 vote, one of Boyd's friends \nasked him to\u0014\n                      comment via e-mail on the results. Boyd knew \nthat this friend\u0014\n                      maintained a Web site, but as he wrote the \ne-mail, he never\u0014\n                      realized that his message might be posted for a \nwider\u0014\n                      audience. \"I wasn't literate at all,\" he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the meeting, delegates had voted not to add \nthe proposed\u0014\n                      phrase \"that He knows infallibly all that shall \ncome to pass\"\u0014\n                      to the section in the Affirmation of Faith on \nwhat members\u0014\n                      believe about God. Boyd saw this as a huge \nvictory because\u0014\n                      the BGC had decided \"not to rule out my \nconvictions.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the e-mail to his friend, Boyd said that \nopen theists who\u0014\n                      were worried about being accepted in their \ndenominations\u0014\n                      could consider ministering in the BGC. He \ncalled the\u0014\n                      conference a \"safe haven\" for people who share \nhis views. \"If I\u0014\n                      would have been thinking, haven was not the \nword to use,\" he\u0014\n                      now says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What Boyd meant, he says, is that he felt safe \nin the BGC.\u0014\n                      \"And if it was safe for me,\" he says, \"I \nthought it would be\u0014\n                      safe for others.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In Boyd's opinion, his critics have used the \nphrase as a \"billy\u0014\n                      club\" to make people nervous about open theists \ntaking over\u0014\n                      the conference. It appears in documents from \nthe Edgren\u0014\n                      Fellowship and in numerous other posts at the\u0014\n                      Foreknowledge site. Boyd reports that he even \nsaw it in a\u0014\n                      footnote to a book published last November. His \npublished\u0014\n                      apology, he says, has done little to slow the \ndamage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Through this experience, Boyd says he learned \n\"how\u0014\n                      important it is to weigh your words when you \nput them on the\u0014\n                      Net.\" Once a message is posted, \"you can't pull \nit\u0014\n                      backthey won't let you pull it back.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      'It's not over' In June 2000, delegates to the \nBGC Annual\u0014\n                      Conference cast two votes related to open \ntheism. In the first,\u0014\n                      they affirmed that open theism is \"contrary to \nour fellowship's\u0014\n                      historic understanding of God's omniscience\" \nbut decided that\u0014\n                      because the BGC is not a creedal group, its \nstatement was\u0014\n                      necessarily nonbinding. In the second, they \nstated approval of\u0014\n                      the way the Bethel board had handled its \nevaluation of Boyd. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Traffic to the Foreknowledge site has fallen \noff since the vote,\u0014\n                      and few posts are dated more recently than \nearly autumn.\u0014\n                      Marsh says he has received requests to take the \nsite down\u0014\n                      but has decided to \"let it ride\" for the time \nbeing.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brushaber says the conference has \"moved \nbeyond\" the\u0014\n                      foreknowledge debate, \"but it's not over.\" He \nfigures the topic\u0014\n                      will be discussed in venues like the \nEvangelical Theological\u0014\n                      Society for another 10 to 15 years, but \ndiscussion at that\u0014\n                      level is unlikely to generate the kind of \ntumult that has roiled\u0014\n                      the conference for the past few years.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brushaber does not attribute all of the turmoil \nto the Internet,\u0014\n                      but he feels the free-for-all nature of the new \nmedium bears\u0014\n                      significant blame. The Web \"encourages \nimmediacy over\u0014\n                      wisdom\" and is \"the medium of emotion more than\u0014\n                      considered judgment,\" Brushaber says. \"The \nflood which\u0014\n                      comes from the Web makes all comments, all \nopinions, all\u0014\n                      rumors, and all accusations of equal value by \nreducing them\u0014\n                      all to 'stuff.' It devalues dialogue and \ndebate. It cheapens\u0014\n                      discourse.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Brushaber believes the Web can contribute to \ndiscussion, but\u0014\n                      as a publishing tool rather than a public \nsquare.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The distinction must be made if electronic \nmedia are to be\u0014\n                      useful for the progress of theology,\" he says. \n\"I pray we may\u0014\n                      all learn some lessons from the limitations of \nthe media,\u0014\n                      which have now become apparent.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Author Elesha Coffman is associate editor of \nChristian History magazine\u0014\n                      and regularly writes Christianity Today's \nChristian History Corner.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Copyright  2001 by the author or Christianity \nToday, Inc./Christianity Today\u0014\n                      magazine.

He grew weary of this big, unattractive stone in the center of \nhis lawn, so he decided to take advantage of it and turn it into an \nobject of art. He went to work on it with hammer and chisel, and \nchipped away at the huge boulder until it became a beautiful stone \nelephant. When he finished, it was gorgeous, breath-taking.\u0014\n \u0014\nA neighbor asked, \"How did you ever carve such a marvelous likeness \nof an elephant?\"\u0014\nThe man answered, \"I just chipped away everything that didn't look \nlike an elephant!\"\u0014\n \u0014\nIf you have anything in your life right now that doesn't look like \nlove, then, with the help of God, chip it away!

A group of new arrivals in heaven met \nSaint Peter\u0014\nat the Pearly Gates. He began to show them around, pointing out areas \nof\u0014\ninterest and filling them in on the rules of the kingdom. There were \nmany\u0014\n\"oohs\" and \"aahs\" from the crowd, and they were obviously enjoying\u0014\nthemselves immensely. Suddenly Saint Peter stopped a short distance \nfrom a\u0014\nmassive building which was miles-wide, long and high, and without \ndoors or\u0014\nwindows. \"While we pass this building,\" he said, \"you must walk \nquietly and\u0014\nutter not so much as a sound.\" So the entourage tiptoed obediently \npast the\u0014\nmonolith without a word.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce they were past, however, an inquisitive soul inquired, \"Why did \nwe have\u0014\nto be so quiet when we passed that building?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSaint Peter responded, \"God put the (name a denomination here) in \nthere;\u0014\nthey think they're the only ones up here.\"\u0014",

Sheler \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In a brightly lit examination room in \nClearwater, Fla., an oncologist leads his\u0014\n                      patient in a relaxation exercise designed to \nreduce stress and buttress the\u0014\n                      body's immune system. The patient, a \n67-year-old woman with breast\u0014\n                      cancer, sits motionless, eyes closed. With each \nexhaled breath, she\u0014\n                      whispers, \"Jesus.\" In St. Paul, Minn., cancer \npatients at Abbott Northwestern\u0014\n                      Hospital take turns silently walking a \nlabyrinth, a circular mazelike course.\u0014\n                      The meditative ritual helps patients become \nmore spiritually and\u0014\n                      psychologically \"centered.\" And at the George \nWashington University Medical\u0014\n                      Center in Washington, D.C., a nurse taking an \nincoming heart patient's\u0014\n                      medical history concludes the interview with an \nunusual line of questions:\u0014\n                      \"What gives meaning to your life?\" she asks. \n\"Are you religious?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Is this any way to practice medicine? For a \ngrowing number of healthcare\u0014\n                      providers, the answer is yes. Convinced that \nsurgery and syringes aren't\u0014\n                      the only effective healing tools, some doctors \nand hospitals have begun\u0014\n                      adding a spiritual component to patient \ncarefrom New Age meditation           \u0014\n                      techniques to traditional prayer. While it \nhasn't exactly taken the medical \u0014\n                      profession by storm, there are signs that \nspiritual beliefs and practices are                               \nslowly working their way into the medical mainstream.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mixing faith and medicine is nothing new, of \ncourse. Prayers for divine\u0014\n                      healing are as old as religion itself. And \ntreatments that combine remedies\u0014\n                      with rituals have been around at least since \nJesus, as reported in the\u0014\n                      Gospel of John, used mud and a miracle to \nrestore a blind man's sight. But\u0014\n                      for more than a century, advances in fields \nlike surgery and pharmacology\u0014\n                      have squeezed spirituality out of mainstream \nmedicine. Now, a growing\u0014\n                      public fascination with alternative medicine \nand the mind-body connection is\u0014\n                      sparking renewed interest among doctors and \npatients alike in a variety of\u0014\n                      holistic healing methods, including the \nspiritual.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      School prayer. Nowhere is this quiet revolution \nin healthcare more apparent\u0014\n                      than in American medical education. Nearly two \nthirds of the nation's 125\u0014\n                      medical schools now include coursework on \nspirituality issues. Eight years\u0014\n                      ago, only three did. Courses cover everything \nfrom the efficacy of prayer to\u0014\n                      talking with patients about their faith. A key \nelement, says Christina\u0014\n                      Puchalski of the George Washington University \nMedical Center, is to teach\u0014\n                      future doctors to respect the importance of \npatients' beliefs to their overall\u0014\n                      well-being. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      During a recent class at GWU, some 40 medical \nstudents sat slouched in\u0014\n                      their chairs as Puchalski lectured on the role \nof spirituality in caring for the\u0014\n                      terminally or chronically ill. \"Relief of \nsuffering is more than just relief of\u0014\n                      physical pain,\" Puchalski says. Regardless of \ndoctors' personal beliefs, she\u0014\n                      tells the students, they need to know how to \nrespond when patients ask\u0014\n                      them to pray, for example, or when a worried \nfamily talks of God's miracles. \"I\u0014\n                      have seen physicians actually laugh,\" she says. \n\"That comes from being\u0014\n                      caught off guard.\" Yet while doctors must learn \nto be sensitive to patients'\u0014\n                      spiritual concerns, she says, they need not \ncompromise their own personal\u0014\n                      integrity in the process: If praying with a \npatient seems inappropriate, \"then\u0014\n                      just sit quietly with them or say, 'You'll be \nin my thoughts.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Injecting spirituality into medicine is not \njust an academic exercise. A\u0014\n                      growing number of hospitals and clinics around \nthe country now offer\u0014\n                      spirituality-based adjunct therapies ranging \nfrom prayer and meditation to\u0014\n                      massage and music therapy. \"We try to help them \nsee that they can live life\u0014\n                      with purpose and meaning despite their \nillness,\" says Richard Sellers,\u0014\n                      spiritual care director for Allina Metro \nHospitals in Minneapolis. Patients who\u0014\n                      engage in such activities, says Sellers, often \nreport feeling better and seem\u0014\n                      to do better in treatment: \"When you do things \nlike the labyrinth, you lower\u0014\n                      your blood pressure, respiration, and heart \nrate. When you do that, you can\u0014\n                      strengthen your immune system over time.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Healthful faith? The changing perceptions of \nspirituality have been fueled by\u0014\n                      an explosion of scientific studies exploring \nwhether prayer helps\u0014\n                      heart-surgery patients heal faster, for \nexample, or whether going to church is\u0014\n                      linked to longevity. In one recent study, Duke \nUniversity researchers found\u0014\n                      that people who attend religious services at \nleast once a week are 40\u0014\n                      percent more likely to have lower blood \npressure than those who don't.\u0014\n                      Indeed, of some 1,200 studies recently compiled \nby Oxford University Press,\u0014\n                      about two thirds suggest some link between \nreligious involvement and\u0014\n                      better health. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Not everyone is convinced that spirituality is \ngood medicine. Richard Sloan, a\u0014\n                      medical professor at Columbia University, has \ntaken on the spirituality crowd\u0014\n                      in articles in the New England Journal of \nMedicine and Lancet, arguing that\u0014\n                      combining spirituality and medicine \"leads to \nbad science, poor medicine,\u0014\n                      and watered-down religion.\" Moreover, Sloan \nsays, there's a grave danger in\u0014\n                      prescribing faith. \"When you suggest that \nreligious devotion is related to\u0014\n                      good health outcomes,\" he says, \"you're \nimplying the opposite: that getting\u0014\n                      sick or responding poorly to treatment is due \nto insufficient faith. That's\u0014\n                      unconscionable.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Even supporters agree that some boundaries \nshould not be crossed.\u0014\n                      Proselytizing by caregivers, for example, \nshould be strictly taboo. And many\u0014\n                      proponents are not persuaded by some of the \nmore dramatic studies, such\u0014\n                      as those on the power of intercessory prayer. \nSays Puchalski: \"We're simply\u0014\n                      asking that doctors talk to their patients \nabout matters of faith and that\u0014\n                      patients be treated as more than a body.\"\u0014",

This can be \nthrough volunteering or giving blood. \"Helping others will help \npeople regain a sense of power and mastery,\" says Fletcher. \u0014\n\u0014\n                           First Responders at Risk\u0014\n\u0014\n One group that experts feel is especially in need of coping \nstrategies are \"first responders\"  which includes rescue workers and \nthe media.\u0014\n\u0014\n Fletcher says these people deal with their emotions during traumatic \nevents through disassociation or emotional numbing, but \"it will hurt \nthem emotionally\" in the long run.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Overdedication is one of the biggest risks to rescue workers and \nthe media,\" says Dr. Robert Ursano, chair of the Department of \nPsychiatry at Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md. For \nthese professionals, chronic exposure to horrific images holds up the \ngrieving process. \u0014\n\u0014\n Ursano says that rather than masking emotions through work, these \nprofessionals should prevent the tragedy from dominating their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Rest, recovery and time out are the best remedies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n The same is true for those Americans who have watched the events \nunfold on TV. Just turning off the TV and returning to your normal \nlife is a start, he says.\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Helping Others Grieve\u0014\n\u0014\n Some will only have to cope with the disturbing images, but others \nwill be dealing with the loss of a loved one. How, then, do we \nprovide solace to those who are suffering such pain?\u0014\n\u0014\n \"This is very hard,\" says Rothbaum, \"but just expressing concern \nhelps.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Though Rothbaum says our society is generally not good at \nacknowledging anything negative, there are two things to keep in \nmind. \u0014\n\u0014\n \"Just acknowledge it, number one. And secondly, offer assistance. \nLet them know you're there for them.\" Most important, says Rothbaum, \n\"it's OK to admit, 'I don't know what to say.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Regardless of geographic and emotional closeness to the devastation, \nwe have all experienced some degree of psychological aftermath. \nComing to terms with your emotions is the first step in the healing \nprocess and knowing, as Ursano says, \"The first thing to remember is \nthat the vast majority of people will do just fine.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                                Copyright  2001 ABC News Internet \nVentures.\u0014",

    "words": "Who Are We to Judge?\u0014\n                      Did Jesus forbid us from judging others?\u0014\n                      B. Larson, Arlington Heights, Illinois\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By Lewis B. Smedes | posted 10/8/01\u0014\n                      In three words, blunt and absolute, Jesus \ncommanded us, \"Do not\u0014\n                      judge\" (Matt. 7:1). But did he really mean that \nwe should never judge\u0014\n                      others? He goes on to suggest that it's not the \nact of judging but the\u0014\n                      attitude with which we do it that God is most \nconcerned about\"For\u0014\n                      in the same way you judge others, you will be \njudged\" (7:2). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are other Scriptures that either cloud or \nshed light on the\u0014\n                      issue. Paul told the Christians in Rome not to \njudge one another\u0014\n                      (Rom. 14:13) but taught the Corinthians that \nthey were to judge sinful\u0014\n                      believers and leave people outside the church \nto God (1 Cor.\u0014\n                      5:12-13). James said he who judges his brother \nspeaks against the\u0014\n                      law (4:11) but also implied that our judgments \nof others must be\u0014\n                      done with mercy (2:12-13).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Common sense suggests that if no one ever \njudged other people,\u0014\n                      there would be no real human community. In a \nsinful world, no\u0014\n                      community can exist for long where nobody is \never held accountable:\u0014\n                      no teacher would grade a student's performance; \nno citizen would sit\u0014\n                      on a jury or call a failed leader to account. \nAnd, when you come to\u0014\n                      think of it, nobody would ever forgive anyone \nfor wrongs he had done;\u0014\n                      we only forgive people for what we blame them, \nand we blame them\u0014\n                      only after we have judged them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I would suggest that, in our day and age, we \nneed morenot\u0014\n                      lessjudgment. Modern Americans suffer from a \nfear of judging.\u0014\n                      Passing judgment on the behavior of fellow \nhuman beings is\u0014\n                      considered an act of medieval, undemocratic \nintolerance.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Why? Because, our culture tells us, we are all \nflawed people, and\u0014\n                      people with flaws have no right to judge other \npeople's flaws.\u0014\n                      Furthermore, modern Americans do not believe \nthat there are\u0014\n                      objective standards by which to judge. And \nwhere there are no\u0014\n                      standards, there is nothing by which to measure \nbehavior.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Of course, the person who takes Jesus at all \nseriously does not\u0014\n                      kowtow to modern relativism. Judgment, for \nChristians, is an\u0014\n                      important piece of work that God calls us to \ndo, especially in a world\u0014\n                      going morally haywire.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When a person judges, she also forms an \nopinion. But an opinion is\u0014\n                      not necessarily the same as a judgment. \nOpinions are often framed\u0014\n                      by our fears, pride, or ignorance. If all we \nhad were human opinions,\u0014\n                      we might agree with those who say we should \nnever judge.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Judgments are opinions that we form only after \nwe have made a\u0014\n                      serious effort to know the facts, and, for \nthose of us who are\u0014\n                      Christians, only after we have consulted the \nmoral teachings of\u0014\n                      Scripture and prayed for Spirit-informed \ndiscernment. Any lazy or\u0014\n                      biased fool can have opinions; making judgments \nis the hard work of\u0014\n                      responsible and compassionate people.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      For all of these reasons, common sense \nindicates that Jesus could\u0014\n                      not have meant that we are never to make \njudgments on what\u0014\n                      people, including ourselves, are up to.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But our common sense is hardly the litmus test \nof what Jesus\u0014\n                      meant, for in the end it is his Word that we \nlive by. It's helpful, then,\u0014\n                      to consider Jesus' bold command in its biblical \ncontext.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus may have been moved to speak as he did by \nthe haughty way\u0014\n                      the Pharisees had of judging people. In Matthew \n5:20 through 7:6,\u0014\n                      Jesus warns his disciples against following the \ntraditions and\u0014\n                      practices of the Pharisees, who judged others \nas if they themselves\u0014\n                      were beyond judgment. What's more, they judged \npeople by the\u0014\n                      letter, not the spirit, of the law.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So, most likely, Jesus meant, \"Do not judge at \nall if you judge others\u0014\n                      the way the Pharisees do. If you do judge \npeople this way, you will\u0014\n                      be judged with the same severity.\" Jesus' \nintent comes out in his\u0014\n                      metaphor of motes and beams (Matt. 7:3-5). We \nall have beams in\u0014\n                      our eyes, so to speak; to judge people for the \nlittle motes stuck in\u0014\n                      their eyes while we have big beams in our own \nis devilish arrogance\u0014\n                      as well as folly.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nobody with a beam in his eye can see things \nclearly. He is\u0014\n                      dangerously low on discernment. And, since we \nall have this\u0014\n                      distorted perspective, we need either to be \nvery humble or else leave\u0014\n                      judging to God alone. We have a moral \nresponsibility to judge the\u0014\n                      moral behavior of othersbut only if we are \nhumbly aware that we\u0014\n                      will sometimes be dead wrong and never totally \nright. We must\u0014\n                      remember that our ability to judge is limited \nand especially that we\u0014\n                      are sinful people who will ourselves, one day, \ncome under judgment.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Lewis B.

    "words": "Good Question: Did Jesus Really Descend to Hell?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the Apostles' Creed, there is a statement \nabout Jesus descending\u0014\n                      into hell. Did he literally go there?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Each Sunday, millions of Christians around the \nworld recite the\u0014\n                      Apostles' Creed, including that statement: \"I \nbelieve that\u0014\n                      Jesusdescended into hell.\" Yet a few years \nback at one\u0014\n                      Christian college, a series of chapel messages \non the Apostles'\u0014\n                      Creed had to omit this item, because none of \nthe 12 professors\u0014\n                      of Bible and theology believed it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Actually the statement is not found in the \nearliest form of the\u0014\n                      Apostles' Creed. It echoes Acts 2:31, and seems \nto be there\u0014\n                      simply to make the point that Jesus' death was \nreal and\u0014\n                      complete. Jesus went to hades, which in the \nGreek signifies the\u0014\n                      world of the departedparadise for some, pain \nfor others.\u0014\n                      When the Apostles' Creed took its English form \nin the sixteenth\u0014\n                      century, \"hell\" meant hades as such, rather \nthan the final state\u0014\n                      of the lost (which Jesus called gehenna), as it \nalways is today.\u0014\n                      So, should those who accept the Bible as their \nsupreme\u0014\n                      authority for belief hold to the Creed's \ndoctrine on this point?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Scripture tells us very little about Jesus' \nstate between his\u0014\n                      death and resurrection. The most commonly cited \nbiblical\u0014\n                      passages are Acts 2:31; Ephesians 4:8-10; 1 \nPeter 4:6; and,\u0014\n                      most importantly, 1 Peter 3:18-20.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Ephesians 4 is likely a reference to the \nIncarnation, and 1\u0014\n                      Peter 4:6 could apply to any preaching of the \ngospel. But\u0014\n                      numerous interpretations of 1 Peter 3:18-20 \nexist. Some say\u0014\n                      the 1 Peter 3 passage should not be taken \nliterallythat it is\u0014\n                      symbolic, conveying in graphic form the idea \nthat redemption is\u0014\n                      universal in its extent. This, however, \ninvolves a more\u0014\n                      spiritualized hermeneutic than usually \npracticed by\u0014\n                      evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Others contend that this refers to a descent by \nJesus into the\u0014\n                      realm of the dead between his death and \nresurrection, and an\u0014\n                      actual preaching to its occupants, either \noffering salvation to\u0014\n                      them or declaring his own triumph over death \nand judgment\u0014\n                      upon those who in their earthly life did not \nrespond to God.\u0014\n                      This interpretation, however, seems in conflict \nwith the rest of\u0014\n                      Jesus' life and ministryand with the context \nof the passage,\u0014\n                      which emphasizes a faithful, gentle witness, \ngiving a reason for\u0014\n                      one's faith, even in the face of opposition \n(vv. 15-17).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      At the same time, the non-literal \ninterpretation has difficulty\u0014\n                      accounting adequately for the reference to Noah \n(v. 20),\u0014\n                      unless the preaching was restricted only to \npeople from Noah's\u0014\n                      time, which seems strange. It also appears to \nconflict with the\u0014\n                      theological context, or how our interpretation \nfits with other,\u0014\n                      more clearly established doctrines. Here we \nencounter biblical\u0014\n                      references teaching the finality of death over \nand against any\u0014\n                      opportunity for salvation, at least since the \ntime of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Many consider the parable of the rich man and \nLazarus (Luke\u0014\n                      16:19-31) pertinent to the question, as are \nmuch of Psalm 49\u0014\n                      and Revelation 20:11-15. Hebrews 9:27 indicates \na close\u0014\n                      linkage between death and judgment, with \nnothing mentioned\u0014\n                      as intervening. And Jesus' statement to the \nthief on the\u0014\n                      cross\"today you will be with me in paradise\" \n(Luke\u0014\n                      23:42,43)also is relevant.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One other interpretation, held by Augustine and \ndefended\u0014\n                      strongly by several evangelicals, seems more \npromising. In this\u0014\n                      view, Christ preached \"in spirit\" through Noah \nas Noah built the\u0014\n                      ark. This was a message of repentance and \nrighteousness,\u0014\n                      given to unbelieving people who were then on \nearth but now\u0014\n                      are \"spirits in prison\" (i.e., in hell).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      While this reference to spirits in prison is \nnot completely\u0014\n                      natural, this view fits better with the other \nconsiderations. It also\u0014\n                      is supported by 1 Peter 1:10-12, which speaks \nof the Spirit of\u0014\n                      Christ in the prophets who spoke. While none of \nthe\u0014\n                      interpretations is totally without difficulty, \none might conclude\u0014\n                      that this is the most adequate reading of the \nrelevant data.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Robert Mounce, in his commentary Living Hope, \nsays that the 1\u0014\n                      Peter 3:18-20 passage is \"widely recognized as \nperhaps the\u0014\n                      most difficult to understand in all of the New \nTestament.\" Even\u0014\n                      if one holds that Jesus did descend into hell \nto offer salvation\u0014\n                      to those who had lived on earth before him, \nthis special effort\u0014\n                      does not apply to those who lived and died \nlater.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There is one thing of which we can be certain: \nJesus' death\u0014\n                      was a literal event, not some temporary state of\u0014\n                      unconsciousness. Hence, in his resurrection, \nChrist did indeed\u0014\n                      conquer deathboth in its spiritual and \nphysical forms.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Bible-believing Christians can allow themselves \nto differ on the\u0014\n                      nature of Jesus' descent into hell. Some will \nbe able to recite\u0014\n                      this part of the Apostles' Creed with \nconviction, while others\u0014\n                      may choose to remain silent.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Millard J.

But those \nwho have\u0014\n                          died can gain\u0014\n                      admittance if others are baptized for them. \nToday, Mormon doctrine\u0014\n                      requires that the dead person for whom someone \nelse is baptized\u0014\n                      must be named (hence their interest in \ngenealogical research), and\u0014\n                      proxy baptism is considered one of the most \nimportant elements of\u0014\n                      Mormon \"temple work.\" So it is surprising to \ndiscover that the Book\u0014\n                      of Mormon never mentions the doctrineeven more \nso knowing\u0014\n                      that the Bible and the Book of Mormon are \nbetween them believed\u0014\n                      to contain \"the fullness of the gospel\" and \nthat the Book of Mormon\u0014\n                      ostensibly contains \"the fullness of the \neverlasting gospel.\" Still, this\u0014\n                      does not prevent the Mormon's Doctrines of \nSalvation from boldly\u0014\n                      asserting, \"The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \n'The\u0014\n                      greatestcommandment given us, and made \nobligatory, is the\u0014\n                      temple work in our own behalf and in behalf of \nour dead.' \"\u0014\n                      Presumably, this is the biblical basis for 1 \nCorinthians 15:29. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Mormon teaching aside, how should we understand \nthis verse?\u0014\n                      Christian leaders have long been leery of \nimposing on the\u0014\n                      consciences of believers as being crucial what \nis mentioned in only\u0014\n                      one verse. It's not that something becomes \n\"truer\" or more binding if\u0014\n                      it is repeated many times. Rather, when \nsomething is mentioned\u0014\n                      only once, it cannot be given the same weight \nof importance as the\u0014\n                      central themes of Scripture. (One of the marks \nof heterodoxy is that,\u0014\n                      while central truths are skirted, relatively \nperipheral matters become\u0014\n                      life-and-death issues.) More important, when \nsomething is\u0014\n                      mentioned only once, there is more likelihood \nof misinterpreting it,\u0014\n                      whereas matters repeatedly discussed are \nclarified by their\u0014\n                      repetition in various contexts. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      We can see this problem in the more than 40 \ninterpretations of 1\u0014\n                      Corinthians 15:29 that B. M. Foschini \ncatalogued 50 years ago in\u0014\n                      Catholic Biblical Quarterly. They included that \nChristians in Corinth\u0014\n                      were being \"baptized into the ranks of the \ndead\" by martyrdom\u0014\n                      (thinking of \"baptism\" in the light of Mark \n10:38; Luke 12:50), that\u0014\n                      this was ordinary Christian baptism that took \nplace \"over\" the grave\u0014\n                      of the dead, or that new Christians were \nbaptized to \"replace\"\u0014\n                      Christians who had died. Though interesting, \nthese proposals lack\u0014\n                      credibility. The most plausible interpretation \nis that some in Corinth\u0014\n                      were getting baptized vicariously for the dead. \nSeveral factors,\u0014\n                      however, put this into perspective. Although \nPaul does not explicitly\u0014\n                      condemn the practice, neither does he endorse \nit. Several writers\u0014\n                      have offered the following analogy. Imagine a \nProtestant writing,\u0014\n                      \"Why do they then pray for the dead, if the \ndead do not rise at all?\"\u0014\n                      No one would take this as an endorsement of the \npractice of\u0014\n                      praying for the dead; it is a criticism of the \ninconsistency of praying\u0014\n                      for the dead while holding that the dead do not \nrise. To make this\u0014\n                      rhetorical question an endorsement of the \npractice of praying for\u0014\n                      the dead, one would expect, \"Why do we then \npray for the dead?\"\u0014\n                      Likewise, in 1 Corinthians 15:29 Paul preserves \nthe more distant\u0014\n                      they. After all, his primary concern in 1 \nCorinthians 15 is the\u0014\n                      defense of the Christian doctrine of \nresurrection. His rhetorical\u0014\n                      question in verse 29 may simply be pointing out \nthe inconsistency of\u0014\n                      those who deny the final resurrection, granted \ntheir rather strange\u0014\n                      baptismal practices. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      And they were strange. There is no good \nevidence for vicarious\u0014\n                      baptism anywhere in the New Testament or among \nthe earliest\u0014\n                      apostolic fathers. By the same token, there is \nno hint that this\u0014\n                      vicarious baptism (if that is what it was) was \nintended by the\u0014\n                      Corinthian believer to cover as many deceased \npeople as could be\u0014\n                      named. If the practice existed at all, it may \nhave been tied to a few\u0014\n                      people or special casesfor example, when a \nrelative died after\u0014\n                      trusting the gospel but before being baptized. \nWe really do not\u0014\n                      know. If it were something like that, one could \nunderstand why Paul\u0014\n                      does not make a federal case of it. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In any case, Paul's clear emphasis is that \npeople are justified by\u0014\n                      grace through faith, which demands a personal \nresponse. Christian\u0014\n                      baptism is part of that personal response, even \nas it is a\u0014\n                      convenantal pledge. In contrast, baptism on \nbehalf of someone who\u0014\n                      has not exercised such faith sounds like \nmagicof something far\u0014\n                      from Pauline thought. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By D.

On\u0014\n                      the nature of postmortem life there are great \ndifferences, but\u0014\n                      on its reality, agreement has been so \nwidespread that current\u0014\n                      Western skepticism about survival seems a mere \nlocal oddity. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      So the first thing to say is that all human \nselves, with all the\u0014\n                      powers of remembering, relating, learning, \npurposing, and\u0014\n                      enjoying that make us who we are, survive \ndeath, and by dying\u0014\n                      are actually set free from all shrinkings of \npersonal life due to\u0014\n                      physical factorshandicaps, injuries, and \ndeteriorations of\u0014\n                      body and mind; torture and starvation; \nAlzheimer's disease,\u0014\n                      Down syndrome, AIDS, and the like. This was \ntrue for both\u0014\n                      Jesus and the believing criminal to whom he \nsaid, as crucifixion\u0014\n                      drained their lives away, \"Today you will be \nwith me in\u0014\n                      paradise\"; and it will be just as true for you \nand me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To be sure, the ugliness and pain and aftermath \nof dying as we\u0014\n                      know it is the penalty of sin. For anyone \nunconverted in heart,\u0014\n                      who is thus already \"dead in transgressions\" \n(Eph. 2:5), dying\u0014\n                      means entering more deeply into the death state \n(meaning,\u0014\n                      separation from that sharing with God that \nScripture calls \"life\").\u0014\n                      We need to be clear that as our penal \nsubstitute, Jesus \"tasted\u0014\n                      death\" (Heb. 2:9) in this deep sense precisely \nto ensure that we\u0014\n                      would never have to taste it. The natural view \nof his cry from\u0014\n                      the cross, \"My God, my God, why have you \nforsaken me?\" (first\u0014\n                      words of Ps. 22, Matt. 27:46), is that he was \ntelling the\u0014\n                      bystanders, and through them the world, that in \nfulfillment of\u0014\n                      prophecy he was already undergoing deep death, \nas we may\u0014\n                      call it, during those dark hours. \nGodforsakenness was the hell\u0014\n                      into which Jesus entered on the cross; as Rabbi \nDuncan once\u0014\n                      told a class, with tears in his eyes, \"it was \ndamnation, and he\u0014\n                      took it lovingly.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Incarnation gave the eternal Son of God \ncapacity for this\u0014\n                      experience. \"The Word became flesh\" in the \nsense that without\u0014\n                      ceasing to be anything that he was before, he \nadded to himself\u0014\n                      all that humanness in this world \ninvolvesnamely, life through\u0014\n                      a body bounded by space and time, with all the \nglories,\u0014\n                      limitations, and vulnerabilities that belong to \nour everyday\u0014\n                      existence, including in due course leaving \nbehind the body\u0014\n                      through which one has consciously lived all \nalong.\u0014\n                      Shakespeare, we know, acted in the plays he \nauthored and\u0014\n                      produced, and that is a faint parallel to the \nco-Creator living an\u0014\n                      ordered creaturely life within his own created \nworld. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are mysteries here beyond our grasphow, \nfor\u0014\n                      instance, the sense of human and of divine \nidentity meshed;\u0014\n                      how the Son controlled his divine powers so as \nnot to overstep\u0014\n                      the limits of human finiteness; how entire \ndependence on his\u0014\n                      Father's leading for every word and deed made \nhim the most\u0014\n                      unnerving initiative taker ever seen; and so \non. But the certain\u0014\n                      fact is that as his life was a divine person's \ntotally human life, so\u0014\n                      his dying was a divine person's totally human \ndeath. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor was Jesus' dying the end of the story. His \nrising from the\u0014\n                      dead, of which Scripture speaks as the work of \nall three\u0014\n                      persons of the Trinity (John 10:17-18; Acts \n13:30; 1 Pet. 3:18),\u0014\n                      was a fresh exercise of the power that made the \nworld and\u0014\n                      effected the Incarnation, leading on to the \nfurther work of power\u0014\n                      whereby the Son was glorified and enthroned, \nnow to live as\u0014\n                      the God-Man in unbroken fellowship with his \nFather forever\u0014\n                      (Rom. 6:9-10). His resurrection and \nglorification is the\u0014\n                      prototype of what awaits all believers, and his \nexperience of\u0014\n                      dying guarantees that when it is time for us to \nleave this world\u0014\n                      his loving, supportive, sympathizing presence \nwith us will, as\u0014\n                      William Williams's hymn puts it, \"land me safe \non Canaan's\u0014\n                      side.\" Such is God's great grace. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theology is not for casual curiosity, but for \nheartfelt doxology,\u0014\n                      and never more so than when Christ's death is \nthe theme. So\u0014\n                      Williams's contemporary Charles Wesley was \nreally giving our\u0014\n                      question a perfect and final answer when he \nwrote: \u0014\n\u0014\n                           Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies:\u0014\n                           Who can explore his strange design?\u0014\n                           In vain the first-born seraph tries\u0014\n                           To sound the depths of love divine.\u0014\n                           Tis mercy all! let earth adore,\u0014\n                           Let angel minds inquire no more. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                      By J.

Van Leeuwen\u0014\n                      Translations are both a gift and a problem for \nthe body of Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      As members of that body, we are called to think \nand live biblically.\u0014\n                      Especially since the Reformation called the \nchurch to biblical\u0014\n                      renewal, we have been afforded many Bible \ntranslations that have\u0014\n                      shaped the language, thought, and life of the \nWest.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      More recently, a wealth of new translations has \nenabled millions to\u0014\n                      read the Bible in language that is not \nforbiddingly difficult or foreign to\u0014\n                      them. All this was and remains a great gift to \nthe church. I myself\u0014\n                      am honored to have made a small contribution to \nthe New Living\u0014\n                      Translation (NLT).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But translation is also a problem. Every \ntranslation imperfectly\u0014\n                      represents the original, because languages and \ncultures differ in\u0014\n                      ways that translation by itself cannot \novercome. Translations\u0014\n                      interpose a fallible human interpretation \nbetween us and the infallible\u0014\n                      Word. These basic problems affect all \ntranslations. But the increase\u0014\n                      in Bible translations during the last 60 years \nhas created new\u0014\n                      problems for the church.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Newer translationsthe NLT, New International \nVersion (NIV), New\u0014\n                      Revised Standard Version (NRSV), Revised \nEnglish Bible (REB; a\u0014\n                      revision of the New English Bible), and Today's \nEnglish Version\u0014\n                      (TEV, also called The Good News Bible), among \nothersare all\u0014\n                      influenced by a theory called dynamic or \n\"functional equivalence\"\u0014\n                      (FE) translation. Such translations serve their \nintended purposes and\u0014\n                      audiences well. More important, they have led \nmany to Christ. But I\u0014\n                      and a growing number of linguist-translators \nbelieve FE theory is\u0014\n                      inadequate as the only model for translation. \n(Translations\u0014\n                      themselves are often better and sometimes worse \nthan their\u0014\n                      theories.) Linguists argue that the church \nneeds not one but several\u0014\n                      types of translation, each with its own use. \nThat's why I'm advocating\u0014\n                      another modern translation, one that works from \na different theory\u0014\n                      than FE.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      How did we get to this point?\u0014\n                      FE theory is closely identified with an \nevangelical who, over the last\u0014\n                      half century, has done more to foster Bible \ntranslation around the\u0014\n                      world than anyone else. His name is Eugene \nNida, and every\u0014\n                      translator today has been affected by his work. \nEven secular\u0014\n                      translators pay homage to Nida. His theory and \npractice of\u0014\n                      translation was first called \"dynamic \nequivalence\" translation and,\u0014\n                      later, \"functional equivalence\" translation. If \nyou read a Bible\u0014\n                      translated in the last half-century, you \nprobably read a Bible\u0014\n                      influenced by Nida. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the 1940s, Nida and others of the American \nBible Society\u0014\n                      developed practical guidelines for missionary \ntranslators working\u0014\n                      among peoples who often did not have a written \nlanguage, let alone a\u0014\n                      Bible, to read. Bible translators learned that \nthey had to make\u0014\n                      translations understandable to people with \nlittle access to preachers\u0014\n                      and teachers, and whose culture was different \nfrom the world of King\u0014\n                      David or of Jesus and the apostles. They made \ntranslations that\u0014\n                      often supplied the information needed by \nisolated tribal peoples. In\u0014\n                      doing so, they often changed what the original \nsaid, somewhat like\u0014\n                      an explanatory paraphrase.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is this type of translation (focusing on \nease of understanding for the\u0014\n                      intended reader) that has become dominant, not \nonly in the\u0014\n                      Two-Thirds World but also in the modern West, \nwith its long history\u0014\n                      of Bible teaching and preaching, and its \nseminaries and colleges to\u0014\n                      train leaders in Scripture and biblical \nlanguages.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Parallel events took place in the \nEnglish-speaking world. In the 20th\u0014\n                      century, older English translations seemed \nincreasingly out of date\u0014\n                      and difficult to read, especially for new \nChristians. Many became\u0014\n                      discouraged and gave up reading the Bible for \nthemselves.\u0014\n                      Practically speaking, many Christians lost the \nBible with its \"power\u0014\n                      to save\" and to give wisdom for right living \nhere and now (see Rom.\u0014\n                      1:16 and 2 Tim. 3:15-17). They also were in \ndanger of losing touch\u0014\n                      with Christ himself: without the Bible, we do \nnot have Christ in his\u0014\n                      fullness, for it alone shows us who Jesus is \ninfallibly.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      As society changed and the Bible seemed \nincreasingly foreign, a\u0014\n                      variety of attempts were made to make the Book \nmore accessible.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In the 1940s, J.B. Phillips began producing his \nNew Testament \"in\u0014\n                      modern English,\" as the title eventually \nproclaimed. He followed an\u0014\n                      already established British tradition of \noffering expansive, interpretive\u0014\n                      readings of Scripture that tried to lay out in \neasily understandable\u0014\n                      language what was said more briefly and \npregnantly in Scripture.\u0014\n                      Phillips's work got many people reading the \nBible again, in\u0014\n                      paraphrase form. In America, the director of \nMoody Press, Kenneth\u0014\n                      Taylor, realized that his children were not \nunderstanding the Bible as\u0014\n                      it was devoutly read at the family dinner \ntable. So, on his daily train\u0014\n                      ride to work, he began to rewrite the family \nKing James Version in\u0014\n                      language that his kids could understand and \nenjoy. It turned out that\u0014\n                      The Living Bible (its eventual name) not only \nhelped the Taylor\u0014\n                      children but fulfilled the desire of millions \nof Americans for a Bible\u0014\n                      that was not difficult, a Bible that made sense \nto them.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Phillips and Taylor both retold the Bible in \nfamiliar, explanatory\u0014\n                      languagea procedure FE translations imitate. \nPhillips worked from\u0014\n                      the original languages; Taylor did not. But \nthey helped pave the way\u0014\n                      for FE translations.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A Christian missionary translator and linguist, \nErnst-August Gutt,\u0014\n                      believes that there can be several types of \ntranslation (one of which\u0014\n                      is FE), depending on the purpose and audience \nof the translation.\u0014\n                      What is crucial is that readers are made aware \nof what type of\u0014\n                      translation they are dealing with. A paraphrase \nor story Bible is not a\u0014\n                      translation, though it is useful for many \nreaders.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      FE translations (again, most Bibles today) \noften change the\u0014\n                      language, images, and metaphors of Scripture to \nmake\u0014\n                      understanding easier. But for serious study, \nreaders need a\u0014\n                      translation that is more transparent to the \n\"otherness\" of Scripture.\u0014\n                      We need a translation that allows the Bible to \nsay what it says, even\u0014\n                      if that seems strange and odd to readers at \nfirst glance. If God is\u0014\n                      \"other\" than we are, we should be willing to \nwork at the \"otherness\"\u0014\n                      of the Bible, in order to understand what the \nLord is saying through\u0014\n                      his Word. The purpose of the Bible is not to \nmake Jesus like us, but\u0014\n                      to make us like Christ. The Bible is designed \nto change us, to make\u0014\n                      us different, heirs of Abraham according to the \npromise fulfilled in\u0014\n                      Christ (Acts 2).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We need translations for people who are eager \nand willing to make\u0014\n                      the effort to overcome the difficulty of \nreading a book that is in fact\u0014\n                      foreign to us. Indeed, when we come to serious \nBible study, whether\u0014\n                      in a church group, Sunday school, or college \nclassroom, this type of\u0014\n                      translation becomes necessary, for we are \ntrying to get as close as\u0014\n                      possible within the limits of our own language. \nWhen the martyr and\u0014\n                      translator William Tyndale did this, he shaped \nthe English language\u0014\n                      in ways that were biblical. The KJV translators \nwho inherited\u0014\n                      Tyndale's work gave the English-speaking world \na Bible that shaped\u0014\n                      its language, life, and faith for hundreds of \nyears. The danger of FE\u0014\n                      translations is that they shape the Bible too \nmuch to fit our world and\u0014\n                      our expectations. There is a danger that the \nBible gets silenced\u0014\n                      because we have tamed and domesticated it.\u0014\n\u0014\nTroubles in Translation\u0014\n                      It is hard to know what the Bible means when we \nare uncertain about\u0014\n                      what it says. In class, teachers with Greek and \nHebrew often find\u0014\n                      themselves retranslating a passage to show \nstudents more directly\u0014\n                      what the literal Hebrew or Greek said. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The problem with FE translations (i.e., most \nmodern translations) is\u0014\n                      that they prevent the reader from inferring \nbiblical meaning because\u0014\n                      they change what the Bible said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Comparing a few translated verses with those of \nthe KJV, the\u0014\n                      classic, more direct translation will \nillustrate my point. The KJV\u0014\n                      translates part of Colossians 3:9-10 as \"Ye \nhave put off the old man\u0014\n                      with his deeds; and have put on the new man.\" \nThe KJV at this point\u0014\n                      offers a transparent or direct translation of \nthe Greek. (I prefer not to\u0014\n                      call it \"literal\" because translations always \nadd, change, and\u0014\n                      subtract from the original. The only literal \nBible is written in Hebrew\u0014\n                      and Greek.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A transparent translation conveys as much as \npossible of what was\u0014\n                      said, and how it was said, in as near \nword-for-word form as the target\u0014\n                      language allows, though inevitably with some \ndifference and\u0014\n                      imperfectly. In this verse, the KJV translators \neven alert readers, with\u0014\n                      the use of italics, that the second instance of \nthe word man is not\u0014\n                      actually in the Greek text, though it's pretty \nclear that it is meant by\u0014\n                      the original. (Just as we might say to a \nwaitress, \"My daughter will\u0014\n                      have fries, and I will [have fries] too\"we \nleave out the phrase in\u0014\n                      brackets because it is clearly understood.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"The old man the new man\"the English words \nare simple and\u0014\n                      clear, like the Greek. What Paul said here is \nplain. What he meant\u0014\n                      is not, at least to most readers. For Paul, all \nhumans are included\u0014\n                      \"in Adam\" or \"in Christ,\" and at present, \nChristians live an uneasy\u0014\n                      existence in both camps. In Colossians 3, \"the \nold man\" refers to\u0014\n                      Adam, the first man (Gen. 1-5), and \"the new \nman\" refers to Christ,\u0014\n                      the last Adam and true \"image of God\" (Col. \n1:15; Rom. 5:12-21; 1\u0014\n                      Cor. 15:45-50; Eph. 4:22-24).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Jesus makes right and restores all that the \nfirst man corrupted. In\u0014\n                      Christ the purposes of God for creation and \n\"man\" are fulfilled. So\u0014\n                      when Paul says \"put on the new man,\" he means \n\"put on the Lord\u0014\n                      Jesus Christ,\" as he says in Romans 13:14 (see \nGal. 3:27). Today it\u0014\n                      might be better to translate the phrases as \n\"the old Adam. the new\u0014\n                      Adam,\" to show that Paul preaches Christ in Old \nTestament terms.\u0014\n                      In Genesis, Paul's Greek Old Testament (the \nSeptuagint) translated\u0014\n                      \"Adam\" as ho anthropos, \"the man,\" and since \nthe Septuagint was\u0014\n                      the version all Gentile churches used, the \nreference to Adam would\u0014\n                      be picked up at once.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Paul's literal words here are easy to \nunderstand, but his meaning\u0014\n                      requires more effort. The meaning of Paul's \nwords depends upon\u0014\n                      background knowledge and context not found in \nColossians 3. Some\u0014\n                      of the necessary background is given in the \npreceding paragraph.\u0014\n                      The issue of context is more complex.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Paul wrote 2,000 years ago in a different \ncontext. Can his words be\u0014\n                      relevant in our context today? Yes. Though \nhumans live in many\u0014\n                      different situations, all Christians through \ntime and space relate to\u0014\n                      Christ in the same way that Paul's first \nreaders did. Their lives and\u0014\n                      ours are \"hidden in Christ\" (Col. 3:3). Our \nultimate, common context\u0014\n                      is Christ, \"in whom all things were created in \nwhom all things hold\u0014\n                      together\" (Col. 1:16-17)though our particular \ncontexts may differ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are several ways readers can quickly gain \nthe outside\u0014\n                      knowledge they need to infer the meaning of \nPaul's words. Pastors\u0014\n                      and teachers with a knowledge of Greek can help \nthem. Study\u0014\n                      Bibles and commentaries can help. Reading and \nrereading the entire\u0014\n                      Bible in a direct translation is best of all, \nthough it is slower and\u0014\n                      harder.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Newer FE translations, however, try to \nshort-circuit the problem of\u0014\n                      background and context by changing what was \nwritten. They do not\u0014\n                      so much translate Paul's words into English \nwords as try to find a\u0014\n                      meaning already familiar to Americans. They \nhope the new American\u0014\n                      meaning will affect readers the same way Paul's \nmeaning affected\u0014\n                      his readers. The two meanings are meant to be \nfunctionally\u0014\n                      equivalent.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Let us see if newer FE type translations \nsucceed in their goal at\u0014\n                      Colossians 3:9-10. Here are two attempts:\u0014\n\u0014\n                      1. \"You have taken off your old self with its \npractices and have put on\u0014\n                      the new self\" (NIV; compare NRSV, TEV).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      2. \"You have discarded the old human nature and \nthe conduct that\u0014\n                      goes with it, and have put on the new nature \nwhich is constantly\u0014\n                      being renewed\" (REB; compare RSV).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Most Americans have ideas about their (inner \nand outer) self and its\u0014\n                      renewal and can talk about it in all sorts of \nwords and ways. We get\u0014\n                      a new religion or hairdo and say, \"Look at the \nnew me!\" We build our\u0014\n                      biceps or ego and talk about our \"new \nself-image.\" We have various\u0014\n                      ideas about human nature too, perhaps that it \nis sinful or basically\u0014\n                      good. But are our modern meanings the same as \nPaul's? Do\u0014\n                      translations 1 and 2 really help us understand \nwhat Paul said and\u0014\n                      meant?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      I think not. Translations like \"your old self\" \nand \"new self\" may\u0014\n                      unwittingly lead readers away from Christ (\"the \nnew man\") to the\u0014\n                      individual self, one of America's greatest \nidols. And while Paul's\u0014\n                      \"man\" refers concretely and specifically to \nAdam and Christ, \"human\u0014\n                      nature\" is an abstract, philosophical idea \nwhose meaning changes\u0014\n                      with the wind. Both translations prevent \nreaders from learning that\u0014\n                      the \"new man\" is not us but Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      We become new persons only \"in Christ\" (Gal. \n3:27) and by taking\u0014\n                      off Adam and putting on Christ, who is our life \n(Col. 3:3). By seeking\u0014\n                      familiar modern meanings, these newer \ntranslations make it much\u0014\n                      harder to see the deep biblical pattern of \nPaul's thought. They\u0014\n                      obscure the words and metaphors by which the \nSpirit has woven a\u0014\n                      coherent tapestry of meaning that stretches \nfrom Genesis to\u0014\n                      Revelation. This practice removes the \ninformation we need to\u0014\n                      understand, because it hides the Bible's \ndynamic unity and\u0014\n                      coherence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Biblical metaphors drop into our hearts like a \nseed in soil and make\u0014\n                      us think, precisely because they are not \nobvious at first. The\u0014\n                      translator who removes biblical metaphors to \nmake the text \"easier\"\u0014\n                      for readers may defeat the purpose of the Holy \nSpirit, who chose a\u0014\n                      metaphor in the first place. Metaphors grab us \nand work on us and in\u0014\n                      us. They have the spiritual power to transform \nour minds. The\u0014\n                      abandonment of basic biblical metaphors in many \ntranslations\u0014\n                      follows naturally from FE theory, because the \ntarget languages may\u0014\n                      not use such expressions. But it is the \nforeignness of metaphors\u0014\n                      that is their virtue. Metaphors make us stop \nand think, Now what\u0014\n                      does that mean?\u0014\n\u0014\n                      It is not clear to me that replacing metaphors \nwith abstractions\u0014\n                      makes it easier for readers. \"God is my rock\" \nis just as easy to\u0014\n                      understand as \"God is my firm support\" but \nmeans far more. \"Walk\u0014\n                      in love\" is simple, as is FE's \"live a life of \nlove\" (Eph. 5:2, NIV). But\u0014\n                      \"walk in love\" resonates with the rich system \nof biblical metaphor\u0014\n                      rooted in Old Testament wisdom, where life is \njourney on a good or\u0014\n                      bad way, and in Acts, where Christianity became \nknown as \"the\u0014\n                      Way\" (Acts 9:2). Metaphors are multifaceted and \nfunction to invoke\u0014\n                      active thought on the part of the receiver. \nReceivers must think and\u0014\n                      feel their way through a metaphor, and it is \nthis very process that\u0014\n                      gives the metaphor its power to take hold of \nreceivers as they take\u0014\n                      hold of it.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Similar problems occur in Hebrews 2:5-9, when \nthe NRSV changes\u0014\n                      RSV's direct translation, \"son of man,\" to \n\"mortals\" (plural), thus\u0014\n                      obscuring the crucial link between \"son of man\" \nin Psalm 8:4-8 and\u0014\n                      Jesus. This NRSV change from direct to FE \ntranslation also\u0014\n                      destroys the link with Jesus as the \"son of \nman\" in the Gospels\u0014\n                      prefigured in Daniel 7.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Here are some other examples of FE \ntranslations' obscuring the text.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A. In Galatians 5:16-26, Paul contrasts \"the \nworks of the flesh\" with\u0014\n                      \"the fruit of the Spirit\" (RSV, NRSV). Paul's \nwords here and\u0014\n                      elsewhere have often been misunderstood as \nmeaning an opposition\u0014\n                      between the Spirit and our unspiritual \n\"material\" body. To avoid this\u0014\n                      misunderstanding, the New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) \nrenders \"flesh\" as\u0014\n                      \"self-indulgence,\" while the NIV speaks of \n\"sinful nature\" (with a\u0014\n                      footnote on flesh). This does two things: it \nprevents us from finding\u0014\n                      out why Paul used the Greek word for \"flesh,\" \nand it may mislead us\u0014\n                      to infer that human nature is sinful or evil, \neven though the \"Word\u0014\n                      became flesh\" (John 1:14).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      B. In Ecclesiastes (and only in Ecclesiastes), \nthe NIV translates\u0014\n                      hebel as \"meaningless.\" Hebel is the most \nimportant word in\u0014\n                      Ecclesiastes and appears 37 times; its \ntranslation dramatically\u0014\n                      shapes our understanding of the entire book. \nHebel means\u0014\n                      something like \"breath,\" \"mist,\" or \"fog\" (See \nJames 4:14, \"What is\u0014\n                      your life? A mist\"). In Ecclesiastes hebel \ndescribes life\u0014\n                      metaphorically, as a breath, mist, or fog. \nUnfortunately, the NIV's\u0014\n                      interpretation forces readers to read the book \nonly one way, and to\u0014\n                      conclude roughly that life without God is \nmeaningless. Other\u0014\n                      scholars are convinced that Ecclesiastes does \nnot say life is\u0014\n                      \"meaningless,\" but that it is like a breath or \nfoghard to grasp,\u0014\n                      beyond control, sometimes impenetrable, here \ntoday and gone\u0014\n                      tomorrow.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      My point is not primarily whether the NIV is \nright or wrong but that its\u0014\n                      abstract interpretation denies the church \naccess to what the Spirit\u0014\n                      actually said. (In this respect, the KJV \ntranslators also missed the\u0014\n                      mark by choosing vanity.) Translation may too \nquickly interpose\u0014\n                      interpretation that interferes with the \npriestly and prophetic calling of\u0014\n                      believers. \"Meaningless\" also makes \nEcclesiastes seem a \"foreign\u0014\n                      body\" in the Bible, instead of a book whose \nreflections on life as\u0014\n                      God's gift and as \"breath\" have much in common \nwith the Psalms\u0014\n                      (144:3-4), Job (7:7,16-18), Isaiah (40:6-8, \nusing a different metaphor),\u0014\n                      Jesus (Matt. 6:25-34), and James.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      C. In Romans 1:17-18, Paul uses parallel \nlanguage to say that\u0014\n                      \"God's righteousness is revealed\" in the gospel \nand that \"God's\u0014\n                      wrath is revealed\" from heaven. Since Luther, \nmany scholars have\u0014\n                      thought this means a righteousness that God \ngives to us. Luther's\u0014\n                      big question was \"How can I, a sinner, be \nrighteous or justified\u0014\n                      before God?\" (Greek uses one word group based \non the root dik-,\u0014\n                      but English uses two roots: just- and right-). \nBut many scholars now\u0014\n                      maintain that since the theme of Romans is not \nus but Christ, \"God's\u0014\n                      righteousness\" more probably expresses the \nthought of God's\u0014\n                      character (of who he is) than of his gift (what \nhe's done for us). Thus\u0014\n                      both phrases, the one about God's righteousness \nand wrath, speak\u0014\n                      of God's character.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Some FE translations make it difficult even to \ndiscuss this issue,\u0014\n                      because they give us only a meaning based on \nLuther's\u0014\n                      interpretation of Paul, which points to the \ngift of righteousness in the\u0014\n                      first phrase but the character of God in the \nsecond. The NIV\u0014\n                      translates the two phrases as \"a righteousness \nfrom God,\" and \"the\u0014\n                      wrath of God.\" The TEV actually paraphrases \nthem as \"the gospel\u0014\n                      reveals how God puts people right with himself\" \nand \"God's anger is\u0014\n                      revealed.\" We may call such translations \n\"closed\" rather than \"open\"\u0014\n                      because they shut down the process of wrestling \nwith what God has\u0014\n                      said through Paul. By choosing one meaning and \nrejecting another,\u0014\n                      they close the door to reflection and new \ninsight.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      D. Similarly, Paul often refers to the \"pistis \nof Christ.\" Pistis means\u0014\n                      \"faithfulness\" or \"faith.\" Was Paul saying here \nthat we are saved by\u0014\n                      our \"faith in Christ\" or that \"the faithfulness \nof Christ\" in his life and\u0014\n                      death saves sinners? When translations decide \nquestions like this\u0014\n                      for us, they may prevent us from a Spirit-led, \nfuller understanding of\u0014\n                      God's Word.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      When our translations do not say what the \nHebrew or Greek say, it\u0014\n                      is hard to know what the Bible means. We need \nto understand better\u0014\n                      why these problems arise. A look at the \ntranslator's task will help us.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Translators Do\u0014\n                      At their best, Bible translations richly convey \nwhat God has said,\u0014\n                      and can enrich the understanding of even those \nwho read the original\u0014\n                      languages. Yet translation is a difficult and, \nin some ways,\u0014\n                      impossible task. Translations always compromise \nand interpret. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Depending on context, the same words can mean \ndifferent things.\u0014\n                      \"Money talks\" means one thing as a boast made \nby the man who\u0014\n                      bribed the jury, another when spoken by the \ninnocent victim. \"Yeah,\u0014\n                      yeah\" may mean \"Yes, yes!\" Spoken with a \ncynical voice, it means\u0014\n                      \"Blah, blah, I don't believe you.\" Listeners \nand readers necessarily\u0014\n                      infer the meaning of what was said or, in \nstories, what happened.\u0014\n                      Much of our ability to understand language \ndepends on knowledge\u0014\n                      not found in the words themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Take another example. Suppose, just before \nbedtime, an insomniac\u0014\n                      is asked, \"Would you like some coffee?\" She \nresponds simply,\u0014\n                      \"Coffee would keep me awake.\" Her host \ncorrectly infers something\u0014\n                      like \"No thank you, I do not want coffee \nnow\"even though this was\u0014\n                      never said. But suppose coffee is offered to \nHomer Simpson\u0014\n                      struggling to stay awake at the nuclear power \nplant. When Homer\u0014\n                      says the very same words (\"Coffee would keep me \nawake\"), we\u0014\n                      know he means \"Yes! Yes! Bring me coffee!\" (and \nprobably \"Don't\u0014\n                      forget the donuts!\" as well). In each case, \nthere is a gap between\u0014\n                      what was said and what was meant in a \nparticular context. This gap\u0014\n                      can be bridged only by inference based on \nunspoken background\u0014\n                      knowledge and context.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There may also be a gap between what was said \nand meant and\u0014\n                      what is inferred. These gaps may or may not be \nbridged\u0014\n                      successfully. Sometimes we get it wrong. Today \nthere is an intense\u0014\n                      discussion among linguists and translators \nabout the theory and\u0014\n                      practice of translation. How do we best deal \nwith the problem of\u0014\n                      understanding? This debate is taking place also \nin distinguished\u0014\n                      evangelical organizations like SIL \nInternational (formerly known as\u0014\n                      the Summer Institute of Linguistics). Here I \noffer my own perception\u0014\n                      of what is involved in translation and \nunderstanding.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A translator's first and most important job is \nto bridge the language\u0014\n                      gap. She seeks the best way of saying in \nEnglish what was said first\u0014\n                      in Hebrew or Greek. But even this is not \nsimple. No English word\u0014\n                      fully matches a Greek or Hebrew word. For \ninstance, the biblical\u0014\n                      words for \"soul\" are the Hebrew nephesh and the \nGreek psyche.\u0014\n                      Unfortunately, nephesh is also translated as \n\"life,\" \"appetite,\" \"neck\"\u0014\n                      and \"person,\" among other words. We may think \nthat only humans\u0014\n                      \"have souls,\" that \"souls are immortal\" and \nthat Jesus \"saves souls.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      But in Hebrew, both man and beast are \"living \nnephesh,\" and a dead\u0014\n                      person is a \"dead nephesh.\" In biblical Hebrew \nand Greek, to save a\u0014\n                      nephesh or psych means to save a life or \nperson. The shed,\u0014\n                      sacrificial blood of Jesus atones for our \n\"lives\" according to the law of\u0014\n                      Leviticus, because \"the life (nephesh) is in \nthe blood\" (Lev. 17:11-14).\u0014\n                      Even the best translator is forced to choose \nEnglish words, none of\u0014\n                      which exactly matches the Hebrew or Greek.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      The matter is not trivial. Biblical salvation \nrestores the whole\u0014\n                      creation. To \"save souls\" in the sense of a \nsaving a \"spiritual\" part of\u0014\n                      us is not biblical. The New Testament teaches \nthe resurrection of the\u0014\n                      body, and life in a new creation where heaven \ncomes down to earth.\u0014\n                      As our earlier biblical examples showed, even \nwhen a translation\u0014\n                      captures what was said in clear, simple \nEnglish, we may not\u0014\n                      understand what it means or its relevance \ntoday. \"Put on the new\u0014\n                      man\" is clear English, but few realize Paul \nmeans Christ. We lack\u0014\n                      the background biblical knowledge and extended \ncontext for us to\u0014\n                      correctly infer what he meant by what he said.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Reading the Whole Bible\u0014\n                      For us moderns to understand the Bible, we have \nto learn a lot about\u0014\n                      the world of the Bible and the world in the \nBible; otherwise it just\u0014\n                      doesn't make sense. For example, Leviticus is \nan entire book\u0014\n                      designed to teach us what holiness issomething \nwe Christians\u0014\n                      desperately need: \"Just as he who called you is \nholy, so be holy in\u0014\n                      all you do; for it is written, 'Be holy, \nbecause I am holy'\" (1 Pet.\u0014\n                      1:15-16, quoting Lev. 11:44, 45). \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Without knowing the meaning of holy, clean, and \nunclean, and of\u0014\n                      blood and leprosy in the Book of Leviticus, we \ndo not fully\u0014\n                      understand the story of Samson, the lion, and \nthe honey. Nor do we\u0014\n                      fully see the point of Jesus' healing lepers \nand the woman with an\u0014\n                      issue of blood. Holiness is much more than \n\"separation\"though\u0014\n                      that is part of it. It means freedom from that \n\"uncleanness\" that puts\u0014\n                      us out of joint with God and man. Holiness \nmeans harmony with\u0014\n                      God, ourselves, our neighbors, and the creation \n(see Gordon\u0014\n                      Wenham's very helpful The Book of Leviticus \n[Eerdmans, 1979]).\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Salvation is to make us holy so that God can \ndwell among his\u0014\n                      people (Ex. 29:45-46; Rev. 2\u0014",

Barton Hinkle, December 4, \n2001 syndicated columnist\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd Lord, we pray for our nation. We have sinned against Almighty \nGod. At the highest level of our government, we've stuck our finger \nin Your eye. The Supreme Court has insulted You over and over again, \nLord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've \nforbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God \nas best they can, and organizations have come into court to take the \nknowledge of God out of the public square of America.\u0014\nThen people say, why isn't God looking after us? We've sinned against \nyou, Lord. We ask that You might forgive us and that you might bring \nus to the place where we are truly sorry for o1lr sins. As a nation, \nwe repent before You.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo said Virginia's own Pat Robertson after the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. Clearly, Robertson would number himself among the nation's \nsinners. Not so clear is whether he has the spine to repent.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Rev. Pat has put his foot in it a couple of times this year \n-concurring with (then hastily distancing himself from) Jerry \nFalwell's blockhead blather placing blame for the attacks on the  \nACLU, homosexuals, and others. Earlier in the year he seemed to \ncondone (before hastily backtracking again)\u0014\nChina's policy of forced abortion and sterilization. Still, he that \nis without sin among you, let him\u0014\nfirst cast a stone and all that. People say stupid things and most of \nus, were our every utterance broadcast to the wider world, probably \nwould glow redder than Rudolph's nose. But most of us have not gone \ninto business with a brutal dictator who has given aid and comfort to \nOsama bin Laden. Robertson has.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Washington Post's Colbert King has done yeoman work bird-dogging \nsome of the details; others have unearthed more. The dictator is \nCharles Taylor, the ruler of Liberia. Robertson has an agreement with \nhim concerning a Robertson-initiated venture named -with cruel \nirony--Freedom Gold Limited.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1998 Robertson created Freedom Gold based in (really) the Cayman \nIslands after a visit from a Liberian delegation. Its purpose is the \nexploration for and mining of gold in Liberia. The agreement signed \nby Taylor and a Robertson representative gives the Liberian \ngovernment a 10-percent equity interest, with an option to buy 15 \npercent of the shares later.\u0014\n\u0014\nSO WHAT SORT of fellow is Taylor? Well. The New York Times describes \nhim as \"the warlord who destroyed Liberia in one of the most barbaric \ncivil wars in Africa's recent history, and who terrorized its people \ninto electing him in 1997. Having made an inaugural promise to 'not \nbe a wicked president,' Mr. Taylor, 52, has spent the past three \nyears becoming the single most destabilizing force in West Africa. \n...[H]e has transformed Liberia into what one Western diplomat in the \nregion calls 'Charles Taylor Inc.' In addition to Sierra Leone's \ndiamonds, he has plundered his country's natural resources, enriching \nhis family and a small circle.\" A recent Associated Press story \ninformed readers only one traffic light in Liberia still functions. \nPromised reconstruction, of the capital, Monrovia, has not occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaylor is a former guest of the Massachusetts correctional system, \nwhere he was staying pending extradition on charges of embezzlement. \nHe broke out. His next stop was Libya, where he received military \ntraining from Moammar Khadafi's sycophants. He is a chum of Sierra \nLeonean warlord Foday Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front \nforces--loyal also to Taylor-- have, according to The Los Angeles \nTimes, \"terrorized Sierra Leone's population by raping, killing, and \nchopping off the hands and limbs of thousands of civilians in [a] \nquest to wrest control of the country and its diamond mines.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nA Strategic Commodities Act passed last year gives Taylor \"the sole \npower to execute, negotiate, and conclude all commercial contracts or \nagreements with any foreign or domestic investor for the exploitation \nof the strategic commodities of the Republic of Liberia.\" The London \nObserver terms the place \"a 'vampire state,' dedicated to satisfying \nthe greed of a single man.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCalling Liberia a republic is a sick joke. According to the \nhuman-rights organization Freedom House's report Freedom in the World \n2000-2001: Security forces continued to commit abuses with impunity, \nincluding arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings. \nHuman rights defenders, journalists, and political activists are \nincreasingly under threat in Liberia. The U.S.-based Carter Center, \nwhich has been promoting political and human rights in Liberia for \nseveral pears, closed its Monrovia office in November [of 2000], \nsaying the atmosphere was no longer conducive to carrying out its \nwork.\u0014\n\u0014\nAND THE Osama connection?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn September, 1998, one of bin Laden's top aides met with Taylor \nlieutenant Ibrahim Bah, a onetime Hezbollah militiaman. Not long \nthereafter two al-Qaeda terrorists wanted for the bombings of \nAmerican embassies in Kenya and Tanzania showed up to buy diamonds \nfrom the Revolutionary United Front at fire-sale prices for resale at \nhigher prices elsewhere.  Bah brokered continuing sales, and Taylor \ngot a cut. The transactions have put millions in bin Laden's pocket.\u0014\n\u0014\nWriting in The New Republic, Ryan Lizza speculates that Taylor \ncould use proceeds from his share of any Freedom Gold profits to buy \narms for the Revolutionary United Front and maintain control over the \nSierra Leone diamonds that have so benefited bin Laden.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut even if the world's foremost mass murderer were not remotely a \npart of the picture, Taylor hardly qualifies as a poster boy for the \nBetter Business Bureau. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn response to King's commentary on the Taylor deal, Joseph \nMathews--Freedom's Gold vice president of finance and \nadministration--wrote King to say Robertson \"has no more of a \nrelationship with President Taylor than any foreign business investor \nin the United States can be said to have with President Bush.  King \nasks, trenchantly, whether Bush has an agreement with a foreign \nmining company that gives his administration\" a 10 percent interest \nin the business. In a recent conversation Mathews said, \"We are not \nthere [in Liberia] to associate with Taylor\" but to offer \nhumanitarian\" help. \u0014\n\u0014\nNow, let us be clear: There is nothing intrinsically wrong with \nmoney. The question is, what is money being used for? Is it being \nused for God's glory, or is it being used only for pleasure? Is it \nbeing used for pride, to support dictators, and for the purchase of \narms with which to kill people, or is it being used for a higher \npurpose?\u0014\n\u0014\nRobertson said that, too. Perhaps he should ask Taylor how he plans \nto use any proceeds from his government's share of Freedom Gold. If \npast is precedent, he is more likely to spend it passing out bullets, \nnot Bibles.\u0014",

Maudlin | posted 9/26/01 \u0014\n\u0014\n                           SIX MONTHS TO LIVE: Learning from a Young \nMan with Cancer\u0014\n                           Daniel Hallock\u0014\n                            \u0014\n                      Late in november 1999, in Farmington, \nPennsylvania, 22-year-old Matt\u0014\n                      Gauger discovered he had lymphoma. The cancer \nhad already spread\u0014\n                      from his abdomen to his chest. In a week he \nwent from being a\u0014\n                      music-loving, basketball-playing \ntwentysomething to being a hospital\u0014\n                      patient doped up on morphine and with very poor \nprospects. He\u0014\n                      undertook a rigorous course of chemotherapy, \ngot engaged in\u0014\n                      December, married in January, had a positive \nspring, relapsed in May,\u0014\n                      and died in June.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      During the course of his illness, several \npeople became Christians or\u0014\n                      rededicated themselves to living for God \nbecause of how Matt\u0014\n                      conducted himself.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      What makes Six Months to Live by Daniel Hallock \nmore than a script\u0014\n                      for a TV Tragedy of the Week is that it was \nlived out in the context of\u0014\n                      an intentional Christian community called the \nBruderhof. The Bruderhof\u0014\n                      is an international neo-Anabaptist group \nstarted by Eberhard Arnold in\u0014\n                      1920 in Germany. They eventually found their \nway to the United States\u0014\n                      in 1954, via England and Paraguay, and now \nnumber over 3,000\u0014\n                      spread over nine communities on three \ncontinents. The head elder is\u0014\n                      Johann Christoph Arnold, the grandson of the \nfounder. While Bruderhof\u0014\n                      members resemble the Amish or Hutterites, they \nare a comparably\u0014\n                      new group made up mostly of people who have \ncome out of the\u0014\n                      secular world and have chosen to enter this one.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Dying is a particularly good context for \nviewing the nature of\u0014\n                      community life. We see Matt surrounded by \nfriends at the outset of his\u0014\n                      diagnosis, even adopted by a larger family \nwhile Matt's parents worked\u0014\n                      at the Bruderhof community in Australia. Matt's \nparents are flown back\u0014\n                      to be with their son and relieved from having \nto work.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      After Matt is married, the same is done for his \nwife's parents. Not\u0014\n                      many companies, no matter how generous their \nbenefits plan, would\u0014\n                      cover months off with pay as well as covering \nrelocation costs. When\u0014\n                      Matt relapses, his parents are sent for again, \nand as they walk toward\u0014\n                      the house where their son awaits them, \ncommunity members line the\u0014\n                      sidewalk holding lanterns and singing, showing \ntheir support.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      More than a mere support group, this community \nis a church. What\u0014\n                      God is doing is the ever-asked question on \npeople's lips. Making\u0014\n                      sense of Matt's suffering and death is, from \nbeginning to end and for all\u0014\n                      involved, a theological journey. As Hallock \nreflects, \"The anguish of\u0014\n                      Matt's loss. was carried not only by his \nwidow, his parents, and\u0014\n                      hers, but by an entire community that \nsurrounded and upheld them.\u0014\n                      Moreover, it was accepted and embraced and \nplumbed for meaning in\u0014\n                      a way I can't imagine happening anywhere else.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Suffering and God's Will\u0014\n                      This being a theological journey, the answers \nwere not always easy\u0014\n                      or, I believe, necessarily right. Matt's wife, \nCynthia, records how their\u0014\n                      God-can-work-miracles phase of dealing with the \ncancer ended with\u0014\n                      news of a relapse: \"But God had answered our \nprayers so wonderfully\u0014\n                      this far, and now this!\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      On whether to pursue another round of \nchemotherapy, Cynthia shares\u0014\n                      this strange line of reasoning: \"What if it \nworked, and gave us more\u0014\n                      time, but we weren't supposed to have that \ntime?\" Eventually they\u0014\n                      decided to \"leave everything to God,\" which to \nthem meant saying no\u0014\n                      to chemotherapy.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Head elder Arnold gave his perspective to Matt: \n\"God was saying,\u0014\n                      'Uh-uh. You're no good to me.' God had allowed \nhim to have cancer. It\u0014\n                      was a terrific blowthere was no question. But \nperhaps God couldn't\u0014\n                      use him with all his gifts. I said, 'Matt, God \nhad to bring you low,\u0014\n                      because God works in the weak. Now you have to \nask for strength to\u0014\n                      accept it.' Amazingly, he agreed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Their zeal to live all out for God comes across \nespecially in Cynthia's\u0014\n                      closing thoughts, which she recorded a few \nweeks after Matt's death:\u0014\n                      \"People tell me how deeply Matt's life affected \nthem. They tell me that\u0014\n                      it's made them love others more, or showed them \nhow short life is. But\u0014\n                      that makes me really angry. I think, 'Wow, I \nlost my husband so that\u0014\n                      you can love your wife more?. To me it isn't \nright if the love people\u0014\n                      feel because of Matt is just wasted on \nthemselves. If the kingdom is\u0014\n                      going to come, it's going to cost each of us \nsome kind of sacrifice.\u0014\n                      And I think a lot of people try and hide so \nthat they're not used by\u0014\n                      God. If we ask for renewal, we have to be \nwilling to pay the price.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      One of the arguments for cloistered communities \nis that they provide a\u0014\n                      living testimony to the rest of us that there \nare alternatives to the\u0014\n                      accepted structures of our lives. They are a \nwitness to life in another,\u0014\n                      more explicitly Christian, key. In fact, \nHallock seems earnestly to\u0014\n                      desire that we understand this utopian side of \nBruderhof existence.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      \"Matt and Cynthia did not suffer together in a \nvacuum, but in the\u0014\n                      context of an entire community who suffered \nwith them and on their\u0014\n                      behalf. And because their pain was shared by \nothers, it was somehow\u0014\n                      robbed of its power to end in despair.\" Often \nwe hear the different main\u0014\n                      characters share how their lives were \nmeaningless or dark before they\u0014\n                      joined the community. Again and again we see \nthe Bruderhof as the\u0014\n                      answer to their problems.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In fact, I worry that wanting a good ending \nthat affirms the community\u0014\n                      may have played too large a role in Matt's \nstory. I can't imagine a\u0014\n                      pastor agreeing to a shotgun wedding of a \ncancer patient. Matt had\u0014\n                      known Cynthia for a time before his illness, \nwhen he had an extended\u0014\n                      stay at her Bruderhof community in New York \nearlier in 1999. But he\u0014\n                      returned to Pennsylvania and told friends he \nwas not ready for\u0014\n                      marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      In November, he finds out he has cancer. He is \nnot close enough to\u0014\n                      Cynthia to tell her directly; she hears about \nhis illness from others.\u0014\n                      She writes an encouraging note. Matt asks \nChristoph if he should\u0014\n                      pursue the marriage since \"my chances are not \ngreat,\" but he still\u0014\n                      feels the relationship \"would be good for me.\" \nChristoph agrees. So\u0014\n                      does Cynthia. So do Matt's parents. So does the \ncommunity. They\u0014\n                      are engaged in December and married two weeks \nlater in January.\u0014\n                      Cynthia becomes a 21-year-old widow five months \nlater. Cynthia's\u0014\n                      mother found it all \"bittersweet.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A 22-year-old dying of cancer is a tragedy, \nperiod. But for Christians\u0014\n                      death is not the last word and it certainly was \nnot for the Bruderhof.\u0014\n                      The book, like the community it reflects, is \ndeep, fascinating,\u0014\n                      theologically rich, and not for everyone.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Michael G.

    "words": "Don't Ever Say That Again\u0014\n\u0014\nIn A 3rd Serving of Chicken Soup for the Soul, there is a story about \na\u0014\nstudent who was unlike most students. One day in the 11th grade he \nwent into\u0014\na classroom to wait for a friend. The teacher appeared and asked him \nto go\u0014\nto the blackboard. He replied, \"Im not one of your students.\" The \nteacher\u0014\nsaid, \"Doesnt matter. Go to the board anyhow.\" The student told him \nhe\u0014\ncouldnt do that and when the teacher asked \"why not?\" the student \ntold him\u0014\nhe was mentally retarded. The teacher came over to the student and \nsaid,\u0014\n\"Dont ever say that again. Someones opinion of you does not have to \nbe\u0014\nbecome your reality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIt became a liberating moment for the student, a time of great \nlearning. The\u0014\nteacher, Mr. Washington, became the students mentor. Later that \nschool year\u0014\nMr. Washington addressed the graduating seniors. And in his speech he \nsaid,\u0014\n\"You have greatness within you .. You can touch millions of peoples\u0014\nlives.\" After the speech the student went up to Mr. Washington and \nasked him\u0014\nif he had greatness within him. The teacher replied, \"Yes, Mr. Brown, \nyou\u0014\ndo.\" The student thanked him and told him that one day he would make \nthe\u0014\nteacher proud.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his senior year it happened that Brown was placed in Mr. \nWashingtons\u0014\nspeech and drama class. Although Brown was a special education \nstudent, the\u0014\nprincipal realized that this would be a good match up. Mr. Washington \ngave\u0014\nBrown a larger vision of himself. While other teachers passed Brown \nfrom\u0014\nclass to class, Mr. Washington made more demands of him. He made him\u0014\naccountable. He enabled him to believe in himself. Years later the \nfamous,\u0014\nLes Brown, produced five specials on public television. Mr. \nWashington saw\u0014\nthe program and called Les Brown to tell him how proud he was of his\u0014\nachievement.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen others believe in us we gain confidence in ourselves and are \nable to do\u0014\ngreat things. Naturally, we still have to apply ourselves. Les Brown \nhad to\u0014\nwork hard to finish high school. But, he was now motivated to learn. \nOur\u0014\nchildren need to hear from us that we believe in them. Our students, \nwho\u0014\ncould be our friends, relatives, or co-workers will be motivated to \naspire\u0014\nto greater things when we believe in them.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Keith Wagner, St. Pauls United Church of Christ, Sidney, Ohio\u0014",

    "words": "March 11, 2002 Vol. 159 No. 10 TIME Mag.\u0014\nDying to Have a Family\u0014\nGenetic screening guaranteed a healthy baby. Did Mom make the right \nchoice?\u0014\nBY NANCY GIBBS\u0014\n\u0014\nChildren are the hands by which we take hold of heaven, Henry Ward \nBeecher\u0014\nonce observed, which may be as good an explanation as any for why a \nwoman\u0014\nfacing death would go to any length to bear a child. And what greater \ngift could\u0014\nshe give than the gift of a healthy life--even if she might not be \nthere to share\u0014\nit?\u0014\n\u0014\nThat was the question on the table last week with news of the birth \nof the first\u0014\nbaby ever bred to avoid the risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. \nThere may\u0014\nbe only a dozen families in the world that carry this particular gene \nmutation,\u0014\nwhich causes dementia and death, often by age 45. One 33-year-old \nwoman\u0014\nknew all too well what the disease does to a brain--and a family. Her \nfather died\u0014\nat 42; her sister began declining at 38 and within five years needed \nfull-time\u0014\ncare; and her brother's memory began to crack at 35. A professional \ngeneticist,\u0014\nthe woman also knew what it would take for her and her husband to \nhave a\u0014\nhealthy child. By prescreening her eggs for the defective gene, \ndoctors were\u0014\nable to insert only healthy embryos during in-vitro fertilization. \nLast week the\u0014\nJournal of the American Medical Association reported that the woman \ngave\u0014\nbirth a year and a half ago to a girl who was spared the family \ncurse. The child,\u0014\nhowever, almost certainly will not be spared the experience of \nwatching her\u0014\nmother fade away and die, probably before the girl is 10 years old.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case was more an ethical than a scientific landmark. There was \nthe familiar\u0014\nslippery-slope question that arises with all genetic tinkering: Today \nwe screen\u0014\nfor deadly genes, tomorrow for baldness and tone deafness? But last \nweek's\u0014\ncase had a whole other layer of tragedy and quandary. Is it fair for \na woman to\u0014\ngive birth who will probably \"not be able to care for or even \nrecognize her child\u0014\nin a few years?\" asked an editorial in J.A.M.A. In the arguments over \nlife and\u0014\nchoice, the right to have a baby is implicitly absolute. Saul \nBellow's virility is\u0014\ncelebrated when he becomes a father at 84, as is Larry King's when he \nhas a\u0014\nbaby at 65, months after angioplasty. Does a shortened life \nexpectancy make a\u0014\nwoman more unfit for motherhood?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe mother's children--she is reportedly pregnant again, this time \nwith\u0014\ntwins--are likely to be raised by a single parent. But this is true \nfor 1 in 4\u0014\nchildren, and it has become an accepted medical practice to help \nwidows\u0014\nbecome pregnant through artificial insemination with the late \nhusband's sperm.\u0014\nThose who feel that having a baby is a basic human right argue that \nthis couple\u0014\nbehaved in an especially ethical way by going to such effort and \nexpense to\u0014\nensure that their children would be born free of the disease. In this \nsense the\u0014\ncase is comparable to that of a woman with cancer who forgoes \nchemotherapy\u0014\nin the hope of having a healthy baby, knowing that her own life may be\u0014\nshortened in the process.\u0014\n\u0014\nThose who focus as much on responsibilities as on rights note that \n\"when\u0014\npeople adopt children, the agencies that help them must think about \nthe\u0014\nwell-being of the child,\" says Erik Parens, a research associate at \nthe Hastings\u0014\nCenter--and that includes the couple's capacity to function as \nparents. It would\u0014\nbe hard for a woman with such a medical history to adopt. But the \nreproduction\u0014\nbusiness is virtually unregulated and profit driven, with the ethics \nimprovised at\u0014\nbest. \"There is a need for general oversight,\" argues Parens, \n\"instead of the\u0014\nfree-for-all we now have.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is also the need for compassion. If having a child is one of \nlife's divine\u0014\nexperiences, why should it be denied to a woman already robbed of \nwhat she\u0014\nthought would be the rest of her life, the chance to grow old with \nher husband\u0014\nor hold a grandchild? Does the gift of life and love truly lose its \nvalue just\u0014\nbecause the mother who gives it will not live to see it through?\u0014\n\u0014\nKimberly Quaid, a psychologist who counseled the family during the \nprocess,\u0014\ndescribes the parents as \"10 times more thoughtful about what they \nchose to\u0014\ndo than other people who have children.\" She is horrified by the \nsuggestion\u0014\nthat the couple should have remained childless. \"Because this woman \nknows\u0014\nshe's going to develop dementia in the next decade or two, it's wrong \nfor her to\u0014\nhave children? That's going down a road of getting involved in \npeople's\u0014\nreproductive rights that we've never gone down before.\" The parents \nare not\u0014\nrelying on public financial support, she notes. \"They are not asking \nfor anything\u0014\nbut to be left alone.\" And they are undoubtedly praying that by the \ntime the\u0014\nmother's symptoms develop, science may be able to save her, just as \nit has\u0014\nalready saved her baby. \u0014\n\u0014\nReported by Amanda Bower/New York and Marguerite Michaels/Chicago\u0014",

Leaders \nfrom 32 associations were\u0014\n                            present for the two-day meeting. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Virginias district associations face \nnumerous challenges, including\u0014\n                            division among moderate and \nfundamentalist churches over issues of\u0014\n                            theology and practice, competition with \nVBMB ministries, struggle to\u0014\n                            find direction as denominations undergo \ntransition and lack of interest\u0014\n                            in associational programs among younger \nmembers in churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                The summit was called to grapple with \nthese and other issues. In\u0014\n                            addition to a discussion of multiple \npossible scenarios for associations\u0014\n                            in Virginia, participants heard a church \nhistorian recount the role of\u0014\n                            Baptist associations in early America and \na church consultant assess\u0014\n                            the viability of associations over the \nfirst half of the 21st century. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 The oldest organization \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Though associations originated among \n17th century Baptists in\u0014\n                            Great Britain, the first district \nassociation in Virginia was established in\u0014\n                            1766, according to Fred Anderson, \nexecutive director of the Virginia\u0014\n                            Baptist Historical Society. In an address \ndetailing the history of\u0014\n                            associations in Virginia, Anderson said \nchurches banded together\u0014\n                            around single issues, such as opposition \nto alcohol or missions, or to\u0014\n                            work for religious liberty. Over time \nthey grew, merged and some\u0014\n                            disbanded. Others, like Goshen, Dover, \nMiddle District and\u0014\n                            Portsmouth, still function after more \nthan two centuries. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Charles W. Deweese, executive \ndirector-treasurer of the Baptist\u0014\n                            History and Heritage Society, a national \nsociety to preserve and\u0014\n                            promote Baptist history, told \nparticipants that Baptist associations\u0014\n                            constituted the heart and soul of \ndenominational life in America prior\u0014\n                            to 1900. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                They had clear theological and \npractical reasons to exist, he said.\u0014\n                            They monitored doctrinal matters, gave \nadvice about Baptist practices,\u0014\n                            worked with churches seeking pastors, \nperformed benevolent work\u0014\n                            such as missions and education, offered \nfellowship with other Baptists\u0014\n                            and served as a forum to model preaching. \nThey also dealt with every\u0014\n                            imaginable controversy that erupted in \nBaptist churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Deweese cited several lessons for \ntoday from the history of Baptist\u0014\n                            associations. First, every association \nshould be free to protect its\u0014\n                            independence and the independence of its \nchurches. Second,\u0014\n                            associations should sharpen their \ncreative impulses in order to clarify\u0014\n                            their mission and priorities. Third, \nassociations need to communicate\u0014\n                            more effectively with their churches \nabout issues of substance. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Fourth, said Deweese, associations \nare pivotal arenas for\u0014\n                            launching healthy discussions of Baptist \nidentity. Fifth, associations\u0014\n                            should shed their timidity and create \ntheir own future rather than\u0014\n                            conforming to state and national \ndenominational patterns. Finally,\u0014\n                            associations should reexamine their \npartnerships to ensure they are full\u0014\n                            partners with other denominational \norganizations. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Deweese told summit participants he \ndid not know whether\u0014\n                            associations could regain the influence \nthey enjoyed prior to the\u0014\n                            mid-20th century, but he encouraged every \nassociation to claim its\u0014\n                            rightful place in the overall scheme of \nBaptist life. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 District associations needed \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Participants at the summit concluded \nthat associations are still \u0014\n\u0014\n                            necessary in the 21st century. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                The association, or the Southern \nBaptist Convention for that matter,\u0014\n                            may not survive, said Stephen Welch, \nexecutive director of the Mount\u0014\n                            Vernon Baptist Association in Northern \nVirginia, but I am convinced\u0014\n                            the first thing the churches would create \nis the association. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Even when they agreed that district \nassociations are essential, most\u0014\n                            supported the idea that associations \nshould be reinvented to meet\u0014\n                            changing realities. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                George Bullard, director of the \nHollifield Leadership Center in\u0014\n                            Hickory, N.C., argued that associations \nare in the process of\u0014\n                            becoming. There is no single model of \nassociation that everyone\u0014\n                            should follow. There could be as many \nmodels for associations as\u0014\n                            there are people in this room, said \nBullard. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                He expressed concern that many \nassociations are modeling\u0014\n                            themselves after state conventions or \nnational denominations. The latter are\u0014\n                            organizations, according to Bullard, \nwhile associations and churches\u0014\n                            are organisms. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                  Associations must assist churches \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Bullard insisted that associations \ncan tinker with mechanisms of\u0014\n                            the denomination all they want, but it \nwill not give them a future unless\u0014\n                            they have connected with the spiritual \njourney of the congregations\u0014\n                            themselves. The first step to a viable \nfuture, he said, is to create\u0014\n                            relationships with churches and not deal \nwith structures. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                He compared associations to the work \nof the Holy Spirit. As the Holy\u0014\n                            Spirit serves as a comforter, so \nassociations must come alongside\u0014\n                            congregations and coach them to reach \ntheir full kingdom potential, he\u0014\n                            said. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                To be effective in the future, said \nBullard, associations need to take\u0014\n                            four steps. First, they must resist the \ntemptation to serve all their\u0014\n                            congregations the same way. Instead they \nshould work with effective\u0014\n                            and innovative congregations rather than \nwaste their resources trying\u0014\n                            to rescue unsuccessful ones. Too many \nassociations, he lamented, do\u0014\n                            nothing for innovative churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Second, Bullard said associations \nshould perform triage with\u0014\n                            churches and help those transform who \nare ready to transform. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Third, the church consultant said \nassociations must alter their\u0014\n                            thought pattern to acknowledge that most \nof their congregations are\u0014\n                            plateaued or dying and allow them to be \nwho they are. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Finally, Bullard said associations \nmust have a strategy for creating\u0014\n                            new congregations because new units reach \nmore lost people. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Most associations spend at least 80 \npercent of their resources on\u0014\n                            congregational support, said Bullard, \nwhen they should divide their\u0014\n                            budget and energy equally on these four \nstrategies. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Bullard added that associations can \naccomplish few of these until\u0014\n                            they focus on relationships with \nchurches, a point that was affirmed by\u0014\n                            retired director of missions Rolen \nBailey: There has to be a trust level\u0014\n                            that is earned by those who work with \nchurches on the associational\u0014\n                            level. That takes time. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Helping churches, said Bullard, is \nthe only way to keep moderate\u0014\n                            and fundamentalist churches together in \nthe same association. To get\u0014\n                            the two together as one needs a \nsuperordinate goal. The superordinate\u0014\n                            goal cannot be missions as it once was, \nbut helping churches. The\u0014\n                            commonality is not theology or philosophy \nbut the ability of\u0014\n                            associations to show care for each \nindividual church. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 Rebuild relationship with the state \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                 A topic of discussion at the summit \nwas the rift that has existed\u0014\n                            between district associations in Virginia \nand the state denomination,\u0014\n                            particularly the VBMB, since the VBMB \ndeployed consultants in seven\u0014\n                            regions around Virginia beginning in 1997 \nto represent the VBMBs\u0014\n                            work to churches. Some associational \nleaders interpreted this move by\u0014\n                            the state denomination as an effort to \nmarginalize or compete with\u0014\n                            associations. Since then they have argued \nthat the relationship\u0014\n                            between district associations and the \nBaptist General Association of\u0014\n                            Virginia is not clear. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                Retiring BGAV executive director \nReginald McDonough\u0014\n                            acknowledged that Virginias associations \nand the BGAV need to deal\u0014\n                            with the tension of Autonomy whereby \neach claimed total\u0014\n                            independence from the other when it \nserved their purposes. I think we\u0014\n                            have a major issue in the future in \ndealing with this, whereas once we\u0014\n                            had a more interdependent relationship. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                In an apparent acknowledgment of this \ntension the executive director\u0014\n                            of the Dover Baptist Association, Steve \nAllsbrook, expressed his desire\u0014\n                            to have the state treat associations as \npeers rather than customers.\u0014\n                            Tim Boschen, director of missions in the \nAlbemarle Baptist\u0014\n                            Association, added that he hoped Virginia \nBaptists could stop thinking\u0014\n                            of Virginia territorially, as a map. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                George Bullard urged associations and \nthe state to avoid an\u0014\n                            adversarial relationship by locating a \nconnecting point where the two\u0014\n                            levels of denomination can serve Virginia \nBaptist churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                                However it plays out, figuring out a \ncollaborative relationship\u0014\n                            between associations and the General \nAssociation and truly partnering\u0014\n                            is one of the most important things you \ncan do.

    "title": "DYING IN AMERICA: EVERYDAY ETHICAL ISSUES",
    "words": "Dying in America: \"Everyday\" Ethical Issues\u0014\nBY Steve Ivy \u0014\n\u0014\nDeaths of ancient humans were recorded with careful notation of each \ngeneration's decreasing lifespan. Psalm 23, perhaps the most widely \nrecited psalm, is a reflection on dying. Scripture, philosophy, legal \ncodes and religious practices have variously described a \"good death.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMany ethical issues confront Americans as we approach death. In \npublic conversation, \"physician-assisted suicide\" and \"euthanasia\" \nare legal and political flashpoints. This essay focuses on everyday \npractices that would bend care of the dying more toward ethical \nbehavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, can medicine support a \"good death\"? When death appears the \ninevitable outcome of an illness, what should we expect of \nphysicians, nurses and hospitals? \u0014\n\u0014\nDying is a messy business. It is messy because the dying person \nseldom conforms to our need for schedules. It is messy because the \nhuman body is not a machine and thus does not respond identically \nfrom one situation to the next. Peace and dignity are difficult to \nachieve in many death situations. We should expect health-care \nproviders to prepare loved ones for the messiness and to accept the \nmessiness themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nDying involves the whole person. We should expect health-care \nproviders to focus on the patient's whole situation, not a single \nproblem. Health-care providers are oriented to rescue people from \ndeath. They are trained to act \"heroically\" within a special field. \nEach specialist may not be willing/able to see beyond a technical \ncorrection to the larger problem. We should expect them to act \nrealistically, not heroically. \u0014\n\u0014\nDying involves a person's entire relational web. We should expect \nhealth-care providers to include that web in both care decisions and \ncaring actions. Too many deaths occur in intensive care units where \nfamilies have greatly restricted access. Most of those deaths could \noccur in more gentle surroundings, even if the institution is the \nbest place to provide end-of-life care. \u0014\n\u0014\nDying is sometimes physically painful. We should expect health-care \nproviders to provide adequate pain control, as determined by the \ndying person's values. Some will prefer to suffer increased pain in \norder to consciously relate to loved ones. Others will prefer to be \nsedated so as to not suffer pain, even if the sedated state removes \nthem from relationships. \u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, can congregations support a \"good death\"? The church has \nresponsibility to bring the gospel into conversation with all \nrealities of life, including death.\u0014\n\u0014\nDying is a spiritual experience. We should expect churches to reclaim \npart of the responsibility for end-of-life care from the medical \nestablishment. This will necessitate grappling with the facts of \nhuman finitude and mortality. Practices such as discussing living \nwills, durable powers of attorney for health care, and choices people \nface at the end of life will bridge part of the gap between medicine \nand church. More intensive use of rituals and family support are \nrequired. \u0014\n\u0014\nDying is a hopeful business. Churches teach that the power of divine \nlove exceeds all human limits. Churches can apply this to care of the \ndying by supporting people in ceasing to oppose death. \"We do not \nlive to ourselves, and we do not die to ourselves. If we live, we \nlive to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord\" (Rom 14:7-8). \nDecisions are too often made that do nothing to further life, but \nonly oppose death. The church can nurture people through ritual and \npresence to not oppose death. \u0014\n\u0014\nDying is a redeemed experience. \"I am sure that neither death, nor \nlife ... shall separate us from the love of God ...\" (Rom 8:38-39). \nThe church needs to companion people as they approach death. If the \nchurch is indeed the body of Christ in today's world, what better way \nto demonstrate the truth that nothing separates us from God's love? \nIt is true that many dying people draw smaller circles of \nrelationship as they approach death. However, their loved ones \nrequire ongoing encouragement, support and love. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf \"good death\" is to become more common in America, both medicine \nand church must be transformed. That requires difficult and complex \nchanges in the daily practices of medical and spiritual leaders. \nShould such everyday practices be nurtured, the problems encountered \nat the extremes will be much less frequent. \u0014\n\u0014\nSteve Ivy is vice president for values, ethics, social \nresponsibility, and pastoral services of Clarian Health Partners in \nIndianapolis, Ind.\u0014",

Unfortunately, they must\u0014\n           also sometimes face ministerial incompetence. \u0014\n\u0014\n           Leonard Sweet observed several years ago that most \nministers were trained in seminary to\u0014\n           minister in a church and world that no longer exist. How \ntrue: Learning curves and stress\u0014\n           levels for clergy are at an all-time high. Many clergy are \nleaving their calling out of\u0014\n           frustration and an inability to retool or work with the \nestablished church (that doesn't want\u0014\n           to change to better minister in an emerging culture). \u0014\n\u0014\n           Counsel offered deacons and spiritual leaders in Acts, \nTitus and Timothy calls us to be\u0014\n           peacemakers, not troublemakers; discerning rather than \njust reactive; and redemptive while\u0014\n           making decisions for the good of the body of Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\n           All this becomes difficult when there is ministerial \nincompetence resulting from: inadequate\u0014\n           skill sets to move the church forward; burnout; or \nreacting out of emotional baggage rather\u0014\n           than clear leadership of the Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n           What are some practical handles for deacons and churches \nin the face of incompetence?\u0014\n           These ideas have been effective in many local \ncongregations. \u0014\n\u0014\n                Take your time in searching for new ministers. Do \nyour homework to help insure a\u0014\n                good match. \u0014\n                Call a minister to help you accomplish your church's \nvision. Don't expect the minister\u0014\n                to bring the vision and \"save the church.\" \u0014\n                Require your ministers to be involved in continuing \neducationat the church's\u0014\n                expensein order to help them retool and stay \ncurrent. \u0014\n                When tension occurs in the relationship, talk to the \nminister before you talk to\u0014\n                others. Be up front and clear about the issues. \u0014\n                Don't say to the minister, \"Many people are angry \nabout ...\" Be specific. If you can't\u0014\n                call names and be clear about the issues, reconsider \nthe conversation. \u0014\n                When you approach the clergy, approach as a friend, \nadvocate, prayer partner and\u0014\n                helper in finding answers and maybe new skills for \nministering in your situation. \u0014\n                Require clergy to take all of their vacation time and \ndon't expect them to return for\u0014\n                funerals, etc. Clergy need a full vacation without \nfears of being called back. \u0014\n                Spread the leadership and pastoral care base. \nExpecting clergy to provide all the\u0014\n                leadership needsweddings, budgets, personnel, \nbuilding management, funerals,\u0014\n                fund raising, hospital visitsis unrealistic.

    "title": "DIVIDED BY CHRIST",
    "words": "DIVIDED BY CHRIST\u0014\n\u0014\nWhether Christians under early Muslim rule used polemic or polite \ndialogue to defend their faith, they hit an impasse at the \nIncarnation.\u0014\nSamuel Hugh Moffett\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians who lived under Muslim rule in the eighth century found \nthemselves with an unusual statussecond-class but sometimes \nrespected, more often pitied for their \"inferior\" religion than \ndirectly persecuted. This led to some interesting debates.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, as now, some Christians cast the discussion in confrontational \nterms, while others opted for measured interfaith dialogue. The ways \nin which John of Damascus (ca. 675-749) and Nestorian Patriarch \nTimothy I (779-823 or 778-821) approached Islam highlight the \ncontrast.\u0014\n\u0014\n(Note: Nestorianism, which rejected the complete blending of Christ's \nhuman and divine natures, was denounced at the 431 Council of \nChalcedon. Despite this apparent deviation from orthodox \nChristianity, Patriarch Timothy presents the faith clearly in his \ndebate with the caliph.)\u0014\n\u0014\nPolemic Contrasts\u0014\nJohn of Damascus, like his father and grandfather before him, held a \nposition of honor in the local Muslim government. But for reasons \nunknown, in about 726 he retired from public office and entered the \ngreat monastery of Mar Saba (St. Sabas) near Jerusalem.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile there he wrote the Fount of Knowledge, a massive work that \ncontained a section \"On Heresies.\" Here we find his judgment against \nIslam, which he viewed not as a new religion but as a heretical \nschism from Christianity. He also viewed Islam as a threatwhile he \nwas writing Fount of Knowledge, a nearby bishop was executed for \npreaching against Islam.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn begins with the unequivocal statement, \"There is also the \nsuperstition of the Ishmaelites which to this day prevails and keeps \npeople in error, being a forerunner of the Antichrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough John does not soften his language, he does at least credit \nMuhammad with leading his people from idolatry to monotheism, to the \n\"One God, creator of all, who has [not] been begotten\" Then the \nargument quickly resumes.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn was no gentle compromiser. He was severely careful (and was \nusually successful) neither to distort Muslim teaching nor to paint \nit any more Christian than it actually was.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe finished the sentence above with the complete Islamic formula: \n\"who has neither been begotten nor has begotten,\" thereby clearly \nrelating all his criticisms to the basic theological difference \nbetween Islam and Christianity, namely Christology.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn's subsequent arguments are subsidiary: the lack of reference to \nMuhammad's prophethood in the Bible (which Muslims accept as \nrevelation); the impossibility of separating God from his Word and \nhis Spirit; the defense of Christian veneration of the cross as no \nmore an idolatry than the Muslim veneration of the ka'ba; and \ncriticisms of Muslim polygamy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll these are lesser differences. To John, the crucial difference is \nthis: the God of the Muslims is not the Christian God. Allah had no \nson. John's God is the Father of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolite distinctions\u0014\nPatriarch Timothy took a more moderate approach in his dialogue with \nAbbasid caliph Mahdi a generation later. The all-powerful caliph \ninvited the argument himself, and, considering the times and the \nsituation, both patriarch and caliph displayed remarkable tolerance \nand courtesy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the patriarch later recorded the proceedings, he had scarcely \nfinished the customary complimentary address when the caliph \"did \nsomething to me which he had never done before; he said to me, 'O \nCatholicos, [how can] a man like you who possesses all this knowledge \nand utters such sublime words concerning God,[say that God] married \na woman from whom He begat a Son.'\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThus, as bluntly as when John of Damascus 40 years earlier wrote \nagainst Islam, the arguments began again on the subject of \nChristology.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Timothy was no polemicist, and times had changed. He coolly \nagreed that the statement was a blasphemy: \"Who would say such a \nthing?\" Nevertheless, he continued, \"Christ is the Son of God\"not, \nhowever, \"in the carnal way.\" And the debate went on for two days.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe arguments ranged from how God could have a son and how he could \ndie, to the mathematical contradiction involved in the doctrine of \nthe Trinity; and from Muslim claims of Muhammad's supreme prophethood \nto their charges that Christians had corrupted their own Scriptures.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the second day, the caliph asked the most sensitive question of \nall. \"What do you say about Muhammad?\" One can almost sense the tense \nsilence in the room as all wondered how the Christian from the \ndhimmis would answer his Muslim king.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhereas John of Damascus brusquely described Muhammad as \"a false \nprophet,\" Timothy managed to combine polite diplomacy with Christian \nintegrity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe patriarch noted the good that Muhammad had accomplished: he \n\"taught the doctrine of the unity of God,drove his people away from \nbad works and brought them nearer to the good ones,separated his \npeople from idolatry and polytheism, and attached them to the cult \nand the knowledge of one God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe caliph said, \"If you [only] accepted Muhammad as a prophet, your \nwords would be beautiful and your meanings fine.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe patriarch, equally courteous, compared the Gospel to a precious \npearl and closed with this prayer for the caliph: \"May God grant to \nus that we mayshare [the pearl of the faith] with you.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSamuel Hugh Moffett is emeritus professor of missions at Princeton \nTheological Seminary.

    "words": "Did God Die on the Cross?\u0014\n                      As Jesus' life was a divine person's totally \nhuman life, so his\u0014\n                      dying was a divine person's totally human death.\u0014\n\u0014\n                        Question:   Since Jesus was divine, how do we \nexplain his\u0014\n                           death? Can the eternal God die? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                           James Miller, Lexington, \nKentucky\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A: The background to this question is today's \npost-Christian\u0014\n                      perplexity as to whether physical death is the \nend of the person who\u0014\n                      lived in (or, more accurately, through) the \nnow-defunct body. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      All brands of materialistsscientific, \nphilosophical, theoretical\u0014\n                      Marxist, secular irreligious, and antireligious \nEuropean and\u0014\n                      Americansay it is. Everyone else, from ancient \nEgyptians, Greeks,\u0014\n                      and Norsemen to every form of religion and \ntribal culture the world has\u0014\n                      ever seen, has always been sure it isn't. \nHistoric, Bible-based\u0014\n                      Christianity is part of this consensus. On the \nnature of postmortem\u0014\n                      life there are great differences, but on its \nreality, agreement has been\u0014\n                      so widespread that current Western skepticism \nabout survival seems\u0014\n                      a mere local oddity.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      So the first thing to say is that all human \nselves, with all the powers\u0014\n                      of remembering, relating, learning, purposing, \nand enjoying that make\u0014\n                      us who we are, survive death, and by dying are \nactually set free from\u0014\n                      all shrinkings of personal life due to physical \nfactorshandicaps,\u0014\n                      injuries, and deteriorations of body and mind; \ntorture and starvation;\u0014\n                      Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, AIDS, and \nthe like. This was\u0014\n                      true for both Jesus and the believing criminal \nto whom he said, as\u0014\n                      crucifixion drained their lives away, \"Today \nyou will be with me in\u0014\n                      paradise\"; and it will be just as true for you \nand me. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      To be sure, the ugliness and pain and aftermath \nof dying as we know\u0014\n                      it is the penalty of sin. For anyone \nunconverted in heart, who is thus\u0014\n                      already \"dead in transgressions\" (Eph. 2:5), \ndying means entering\u0014\n                      more deeply into the death state (meaning, \nseparation from that\u0014\n                      sharing with God that Scripture calls \"life\"). \nWe need to be clear that\u0014\n                      as our penal substitute, Jesus \"tasted death\" \n(Heb. 2:9) in this deep\u0014\n                      sense precisely to ensure that we would never \nhave to taste it. The\u0014\n                      natural view of his cry from the cross, \"My \nGod, my God, why have\u0014\n                      you forsaken me?\" (first words of Ps. 22, Matt. \n27:46), is that he was\u0014\n                      telling the bystanders, and through them the \nworld, that in fulfillment\u0014\n                      of prophecy he was already undergoing deep \ndeath, as we may call it,\u0014\n                      during those dark hours. Godforsakenness was \nthe hell into which\u0014\n                      Jesus entered on the cross; as Rabbi Duncan \nonce told a class, with\u0014\n                      tears in his eyes, \"it was damnation, and he \ntook it lovingly.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Incarnation gave the eternal Son of God \ncapacity for this experience.\u0014\n                      \"The Word became flesh\" in the sense that \nwithout ceasing to be\u0014\n                      anything that he was before, he added to \nhimself all that humanness\u0014\n                      in this world involvesnamely, life through a \nbody bounded by space\u0014\n                      and time, with all the glories, limitations, \nand vulnerabilities that\u0014\n                      belong to our everyday existence, including in \ndue course leaving\u0014\n                      behind the body through which one has \nconsciously lived all along.\u0014\n                      Shakespeare, we know, acted in the plays he \nauthored and produced,\u0014\n                      and that is a faint parallel to the co-Creator \nliving an ordered\u0014\n                      creaturely life within his own created world.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      There are mysteries here beyond our grasphow, \nfor instance, the\u0014\n                      sense of human and of divine identity meshed; \nhow the Son controlled\u0014\n                      his divine powers so as not to overstep the \nlimits of human finiteness;\u0014\n                      how entire dependence on his Father's leading \nfor every word and\u0014\n                      deed made him the most unnerving initiative \ntaker ever seen; and so\u0014\n                      on. But the certain fact is that as his life \nwas a divine person's totally\u0014\n                      human life, so his dying was a divine person's \ntotally human death.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Nor was Jesus' dying the end of the story. His \nrising from the dead, of\u0014\n                      which Scripture speaks as the work of all three \npersons of the Trinity\u0014\n                      (John 10:17-18; Acts 13:30; 1 Pet. 3:18), was a \nfresh exercise of the\u0014\n                      power that made the world and effected the \nIncarnation, leading on to\u0014\n                      the further work of power whereby the Son was \nglorified and\u0014\n                      enthroned, now to live as the God-Man in \nunbroken fellowship with his\u0014\n                      Father forever (Rom. 6:9-10). His resurrection \nand glorification is the\u0014\n                      prototype of what awaits all believers, and his \nexperience of dying\u0014\n                      guarantees that when it is time for us to leave \nthis world his loving,\u0014\n                      supportive, sympathizing presence with us will, \nas William Williams's\u0014\n                      hymn puts it, \"land me safe on Canaan's side.\" \nSuch is God's great\u0014\n                      grace.\u0014\n\u0014\n                      Theology is not for casual curiosity, but for \nheartfelt doxology, and\u0014\n                      never more so than when Christ's death is the \ntheme. So Williams's\u0014\n                      contemporary Charles Wesley was really giving \nour question a perfect\u0014\n                      and final answer when he wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n                           Tis mystery all!

    "words": "Do Demons Have Zip Codes? \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The closest things to territorial spirits in \nthe New\u0014\n                      Testament are angels, not demons.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          Q:\u0014\n                             We hear a lot today about citywide \nexorcisms of territorial\u0014\n                             spirits. Where does this idea come from, \nand what does\u0014\n                             the Bible have to say about it? \u0014\n\u0014\n                                                          Nathan \nMiller\u0014\n                                                           Rosedale, \nOhio\u0014\n\u0014\n                      A: The exorcism of territorial spirits is a \ngrowing practice\u0014\n                      around the globe, including among evangelicals \nin America. I\u0014\n                      know of a group of Christians who flew to a \nforeign city where\u0014\n                      they spread into key neighborhoods and historic \nspots to\u0014\n                      identify the demons that ruled over those \nareas. Afterward they\u0014\n                      reassembled for a time of aggressive prayer to \nname and bind\u0014\n                      the demons so that the gospel could spread \npowerfully there. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      In terms of influence, perhaps two decades of \noverly\u0014\n                      mechanistic techniques, including church-growth \nmethods and\u0014\n                      step-by-step evangelistic and discipleship \nprograms, have left\u0014\n                      Christians thirsting for raw supernaturalism. \nIn response, the\u0014\n                      church has seen a series of emphases on power \nevangelism,\u0014\n                      prophetic ministry, and even \"holy laughter.\" \nAlso, the New Age\u0014\n                      interest in spirit guides has stimulated a \ncorresponding\u0014\n                      fascination among evangelicals with angels and \ndemons,\u0014\n                      evident, for example, in the enormous \npopularity of Frank\u0014\n                      Peretti's novels. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      The territorial component grewat least in \npartout of the\u0014\n                      notable effectiveness of citywide evangelistic \ncampaigns in Latin\u0014\n                      America. Some evangelists in those campaigns \nattributed their\u0014\n                      success to days spent in wrestling in prayer \nagainst the powers\u0014\n                      of darkness. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      I believe there is another influence as well: \nanimism, which is\u0014\n                      strong in much of Latin America, Africa, and \nAsia. In animism, all\u0014\n                      sorts of spirits are worshipedincluding those \nof tribes and\u0014\n                      geographic territories. When this animistic \nworld-view is taken at\u0014\n                      face value, a certain logic follows: demons \noppose the church;\u0014\n                      extended prayer leads to powerful evangelism; \nsome demons\u0014\n                      are territorial, and thus can only be overcome \nthrough on-site\u0014\n                      citywide exorcism. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      This is not the first time that Christians have \nattempted to\u0014\n                      discern the bureaucratic structure of the \nspirit world. Some of\u0014\n                      the early church fathers tried to reconstruct \ndemon hierarchies.\u0014\n                      The medieval church tried again. But when the \nReformation led\u0014\n                      the church back to the Word of God, Luther, \nCalvin, and\u0014\n                      Wesley each renounced such speculation as \nfutile. What does\u0014\n                      the Bible itself say about this practice? \nActually, very little.\u0014\n                      Instead, the Old Testament focuses on God's \nsovereignty,\u0014\n                      noting that even Satan requires God's \npermission before doing\u0014\n                      evil (Job 1:6-12). While Daniel alludes briefly \nto a \"prince of\u0014\n                      Persia\" and a \"prince of Greece\" (10:13, 20), \nthese \"princes\"\u0014\n                      are not colleagues ruling over different \nregions, but\u0014\n                      competitors, battling each other (see 11:2). \nDaniel is describing\u0014\n                      the future history of the Middle East: with \nPersia falling before\u0014\n                      Greece, and Greece splitting into four smaller \nkingdoms (Dan.\u0014\n                      11-12). Of course, any nation that attacks the \npeople of God is\u0014\n                      serving the cause of Satan. This much Daniel \nintends. But\u0014\n                      Daniel never prays against demon princes over \nPersia or\u0014\n                      Greece nor attempts to cast them from their \nrespective regions. \u0014\n\u0014\n                      Another commonly cited passage is Revelation \n2:12-13, which\u0014\n                      says Satan resides in Pergamum. A literalistic \ninterpretation of\u0014\n                      this passage, however, poses more complications \nthan\u0014\n                      clarification. If, as some claim, a demon's \npower is reflected in\u0014\n                      the size of its territory, the identification \nwith Pergamum reduces\u0014\n                      Satan to relative insignificance. Furthermore, \nSatan would then\u0014\n                      need to live and work in Pergamum, yet worship \nin Smyrna\u0014\n                      (Rev. 2:9) and Philadelphia (Rev. 3:9) and \nteach Sunday school\u0014\n                      in Thyatira (Rev. 2:24). This is a lot of \ncommuting for a\u0014\n                      \"territorial\" spirit!

In contrast\u0014\n                      to the Qumran community (of Dead Sea Scrolls \nfame), whose\u0014\n                      liturgy included curses of Satan alongside \npraise of God, Jude\u0014\n                      8-10 and 2 Peter 2:10-12 rebuke those who \nverbally abuse\u0014\n                      spirits. We do better, Jude warns, simply to \nturn the demons\u0014\n                      over to God. Satan is indeed a formidable \nadversary (1 Pet.\u0014\n                      5:8), yet Jesus has already conquered him on \nthe cross (Col.\u0014\n                      2:15) and will one day confine him in hell \n(Rev. 20:1-10).

    "title": "DIVVYING UP THE MOST SACRED PLACE",
    "words": "DIVVYING UP THE MOST SACRED PLACE\u0014\nEmotions have historically run high as Christians have staked\u0014\ntheir claims to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\u0014\n\u0014\nby Chris Armstrong\u0014\n\u0014\n   The Holy Land -- the region where Jesus walked and lived and\u0014\n   died -- exerts a strange power over the hearts of believers.\u0014\n   Readers who have been to Jerusalem and visited its sites may\u0014\n   thus feel at least a twinge of sympathy for a group of elderly\u0014\n   monks living in that city, who recently made the news in a\u0014\n   most unseemly way.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Last Monday, chairs, iron bars, and fists flew on the roof of\u0014\n   one of the most revered sites in Christianity, the Church of\u0014\n   the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. When the dust cleared, 7\u0014\n   Ethiopian Orthodox monks and 4 Egyptian (Coptic) monks had\u0014\n   been injured. The fight started when an Egyptian monk decided\u0014\n   to move his chair into the shade, technically -- argued the\u0014\n   Ethiopians -- encroaching on the latter's jurisdiction.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Jurisdiction? Did we miss something?\u0014\n\u0014\n   The argument these monks are making refers to an Ottoman\u0014\n   Turkish edict issued by the sultan in 1752 and reaffirmed in\u0014\n   1852. Still in force today, this edict defines exactly which\u0014\n   parts of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre belong to each of\u0014\n   six Christian groups: the Latins (Roman Catholics), Greek\u0014\n   Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Copts, and\u0014\n   Ethiopians.\u0014\n\u0014\n   But let's start with the basics. The \"Holy Sepulchre\" is the\u0014\n   cave in Jerusalem where Christ is supposed to have been buried\u0014\n   and to have risen from the dead. It was discovered -- the\u0014\n   tradition goes -- by Emperor Constantine's mother Helena, who\u0014\n   also picked up some pieces of the True Cross while hanging\u0014\n   around the Holy Land. Helena had her son begin work on the\u0014\n   first \"Church of the Holy Sepulchre,\" which was dedicated\u0014\n   around 335. From that point the church has gone through many\u0014\n   cycles of destruction and rebuilding -- and since the\u0014\n   accession to power of the Ottoman Turks in 1517, many\u0014\n   political machinations among Christian groups trying to gain\u0014\n   control over all or part of the edifice. This they achieved by\u0014\n   gaining firmans (royal decrees) from the Turkish authorities\u0014\n   validating their claims.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Why such squabbling over a building? We get a sense of the\u0014\n   emotional power this sacred place has had for generations of\u0014\n   Christians from Boniface of Ragusa, a Franciscan who in 1555\u0014\n   was put in charge of rebuilding the tomb itself to strengthen\u0014\n   the structure and repair damage caused during five centuries\u0014\n   of pilgrimage. As his workers dug down for this major\u0014\n   renovation, they uncovered the rock of the tomb. This had not\u0014\n   been seen since 1009, when the Khalif of Egypt al-Hakim had\u0014\n   ordered the destruction of an earlier version of the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Boniface wrote:\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"When, for necessity, we had to remove one of the alabaster\u0014\n   slabs which covered the Sepulchre, placed there by Saint Helen\u0014\n   in order to be able to celebrate the holy sacrifice of Mass,\u0014\n   there appeared to us that ineffable place in which laid for\u0014\n   three days the Son of Man. ... The place, which had been\u0014\n   soaked with the precious blood and with the mixture of\u0014\n   ointment with which he was anointed for burial and from where\u0014\n   spread to everywhere glowing light as if they were the\u0014\n   luminous rays of the sun, was uncovered by us, venerated with\u0014\n   devotional moans, with spiritual joy and with tears together\u0014\n   with those present (there were in fact not a few Christians,\u0014\n   both Western and Eastern), who full of heavenly devotion, some\u0014\n   shed tears, other profoundly excited, all were astonished and\u0014\n   in prey of a sort of ecstasy.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   This moment of ecumenical ecstasy did not last, however, and\u0014\n   other firmans extracted from the Turkish authorities through\u0014\n   the 17th century raised first the Franciscans, then the\u0014\n   Orthodox, and finally the Franciscans again to the status of\u0014\n   custodians of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In one such\u0014\n   move in 1633, the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Theophanius made\u0014\n   a bid to wrest control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\u0014\n   from the Western church by obtaining a firman back-dated to\u0014\n   the 7th century, which gave the Patriarch's church\u0014\n   jurisdiction over a number of holy sites connected with the\u0014\n   Church. After this document was exposed as a forgery and\u0014\n   withdrawn, it was open season on the Church. By 1637, various\u0014\n   parts of the holy site had changed hands a half-dozen times,\u0014\n   sold each time to the highest bidder by the obliging sultan\u0014\n   Murad IV.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In the 18th century, the friars were able to set aside their\u0014\n   differences with Armenian and Greek Orthodox Christians long\u0014\n   enough to make some further repairs. But on Palm Sunday in\u0014\n   1767, a squabble broke out between the Greeks and the\u0014\n   Franciscans, and the Ottoman authorities laid down yet another\u0014\n   firman, this time splitting the structure between Western and\u0014\n   Eastern Christian groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n   In 1852, in the face of looming conflict between Western\u0014\n   Catholic powers and Eastern powers championed by the Russian\u0014\n   czar, Nicholas, Turkey imposed a truce and reaffirmed the\u0014\n   division of the Church established in the 1767 firman, now\u0014\n   under the name \"Status Quo.\" As is usual in history, nobody\u0014\n   since 1852 has been happy with the status quo -- but nobody\u0014\n   has been able to agree on how to change it. So, right off the\u0014\n   bat, the Crimean War (1853-56) erupted over this very question\u0014\n   of rights over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And so, the\u0014\n   other day, elderly monks threw furniture and punches over the\u0014\n   crossing of an invisible line on the church's roof.\u0014\n\u0014\n   The hope of unity seems dim in the face of such strife. But if\u0014\n   our divisions are ever to be healed, it can only be as we seek\u0014\n   the forgiveness made available by the Event memorialized\u0014\n   (whether or not it took place precisely there) in this holy\u0014\n   place. As Pope Paul VI prayed on January 4, 1964:\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"This is the place, where You, O Lord, were accused;\u0014\n   You, the just one, were put to judgment;\u0014\n   You, Son of man, were tormented, crucified and put to death.\u0014\n   You, Son of God, were blasphemed, laughed at and repudiated;\u0014\n   You, the light, were put out;\u0014\n   You, the King, have been exalted on a cross;\u0014\n   You, Life, met with death, and You, dead, rose to life ...\u0014\n   We adore You, O Lord Jesus. We came to beat our breasts,\u0014\n   to ask Your forgiveness, to implore your mercy ...\u0014\n   because you are our redemption and our hope.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   *About Helena and the discovery of the tomb and the True\u0014\n   Cross, see http://ChristianityToday.com/ct/2000/142/58.0.html.\u0014\n\u0014\n   *About the Great Schism and the Crusades -- the root events of\u0014\n   East-West disputes -- see\u0014\n   http://ChristianityToday.com/ch/54h/54h10a.html.\u0014\n\u0014\n   *For a fuller version of Boniface's account of uncovering of\u0014\n   the tomb in 1555, see this Franciscan-sponsored\u0014\n   http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspturk.html.\u0014\n   The same site contains the page with the prayer of Pope Paul\u0014\n   VI: http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspintr.html.\u0014\n\u0014\n   About the recent fight on the Church's roof, see\u0014\n   \nhttp://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20020729/od_nm/church_dc_1.\u0014",

    "title": "DEVIL IN A RED FEZ",
    "words": "Devil in a red fez\u0014\nThe lie about the Freemasons lives on \u0014\n\u0014\nBY DAN GILGOFF, US News and World Report, 9/2/02\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the ribald French journalist Gabriel Jogand-Pages walked into a \nParis church in April 1885 and told a priest he'd been divinely moved \nto rediscover the Catholicism of his birth, you'd think he would have \nbeen laughed out of town. Jogand-Pagesbetter known by his pseudonym, \nLo Taxilwas founder of France's Anti-Clerical League and \nFreethinkers Society. He'd edited popular church-bashing magazines \nlike Down With the Clergy! and authored pornographic books such as \nThe Pope's Mistresses. And Taxil had a personal ax to grind with \nRome: He'd been successfully prosecuted by the church for libel, \nthough he managed to avert a prison sentence. \"Taxil had so many \nenemies,\" says William Harman, a religion professor at the University \nof Tennessee-Chattanooga, \"that I'm amazed he was able to walk around \nfreely.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAll of which makes the church's decision to welcome him back into the \nfold look pretty imprudent. But there he was, in 1887, gushing to \nPope Leo XIII that his bliss was so complete upon their meeting that \nhis dearest wish was to die then and there. Just a few years earlier, \nhe'd accused the pope of poisoning people. But the church had \npractical reasons to forgive Taxil. Post-revelation, he aimed his \nbogus expossthis time with the church's endorsementat another \ninstitution: the Freemasons, a fraternal order dating to the Middle \nAges. Europe's growing circuit of Masonic lodges posed a threat to \nCatholicism; Masons promoted individual rights and, at least in \ntheory, accepted non-Christian members. To Taxil, a secret \nbrotherhood begged for \"illumination.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBeginning in 1884, Taxil turned out roughly a dozen bookssome longer \nthan 1,000 pagesthat painted the Freemasons as Satanists. His \ninvented accounts of Masonic rituals included a \"Mistress of the \nTemple\" who worshiped \"holy Lucifer\" as the \"only true God.\" The pulp \nfictions sold in the hundreds of thousands and spurred translations \nin English, German, Italian, and Spanish. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfraid of targeting nearby lodges, Taxil fabricated an entire cast of \nfar-flung Masons. His most popular creation was Diana Vaughan, a \nmember of a fictitious group of American Freemasons called the \nPalladian Order, whose inner workings she described in her \nautobiography. \"Her Luciferian origin and principles,\" Taxil wrote, \n\"were shown . . . by the devils who attended her and through whose \naid she made excursions to Mars.\" Such accusations were eagerly \nimbibed by a public wary of the secretive and politically progressive \nMasons. \u0014\n\u0014\nTaxil's spawn. His writings didn't affect Freemason membership \nnumbersmany French freethinkers publicly denounced Taxil as a fraud. \nBut he did inspire others to craft ever more sensational accounts of \nthe Mason-Satan connection. Antisemitic contemporaries recalibrated \nhis rhetoric for their own use. \"It's obvious that whoever wrote the \nfirst version of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was directly \ninfluenced by Taxil,\" says Bill Ellis, author of Raising the Devil: \nSatanism, New Religions, and the Media.\u0014\n\u0014\nTaxil's work informs today's extremist Christian literature as well. \nChick Publications, which distributes Christian tracts, offers a \nshort comic strip that calls Masonry witchcraft and fezzes (worn by \nthe Shriners, a subset of Masonry) \"idols dedicated to a false god.\" \nIt even refers to Albert Pike, a real South Carolina Mason who was \ncaricatured into a Satanist by Taxil. In his 1991 bestseller New \nWorld Order, evangelist Pat Robertson implicated Freemason \n\"occultism\" in a supposed international financial conspiracy. And a \nMississippi group called Ex-Masons for Jesus brands the order a \n\"pagan religion.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTaxil himself had no intention of aiding any Christian cause: He \nwanted to embarrass Rome. After promising to present Diana Vaughan to \nthe public in April 1897, he instead used the occasion to reveal \nhimself as a fake and to thank the church for its gullibility. \n\"Palladism, my most beautiful creation, never existed except on paper \nand in thousands of minds,\" he told a crowd of 300. They were \nincensed, but Taxil had once more outwitted his audience: He had \nrequested that all umbrellas and canes be checked at the door.\u0014\n\u0014\nNote:  The entire issue was dedicated to hoaxes.\u0014",

    "title": "DECONSTRUCTING ISLAM",
    "words": "Deconstructing Islam\u0014\nApologist Jay Smith takes a confrontational approach.\u0014\nBy Stan Guthrie | posted 08/30/2002\u0014\n\u0014\nJay Smith is a third-generation missionary kid who grew up in North \nIndia. Smith, a member of the Brethren in Christ Church who earned a \nmaster's in Islamic studies at Fuller Theological Seminary, went to \nLondon to help churches and students dealing with intellectual \nattacks from Muslim campus radicals. As he researched Islam, Smith \ncame across new historical and linguistic criticisms of the Qur'an, \nwhich Muslims revere as their holy book. They believe God, using an \nangel, dictated the Qur'an in Arabic to Muhammad in the seventh \ncentury.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe literary critics, called Western Orientalists, are subjecting the \nQur'an to the same kinds of questions the Bible has faced since the \n19th century. They say the Qur'an is an entirely human, fallible \ndocument. The Atlantic summarized the approach in a January 1999 \narticle by Toby Lester, \"What is the Koran?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith began using this kind of information to answer Muslim preachers \nwho spoke from atop the ladder at Speaker's Corner in London. He \noften experienced a violent response. In April 1995, angry Muslims \nkicked him to the ground, nearly knocking him unconscious. Finally, \nthe police told Smith to stop debating unless he climbed the ladder \nhimself, so they could keep an eye on him.\u0014\nSmith has debated Muslims on many Sundays since then. He had his \nfirst formal debate at Cambridge that August, facing Jamal Badawi \nfrom Halifax on the topic, \"Is the Qur'an the Word of God?\" He has \nengaged in over a dozen more formal debates since then and has \ntrained other Christians.\u0014\nSome Western missionaries, however, criticize Smith for generating \nmuch heat but little light among Muslims. Dudley Woodberry, formerly \nSmith's instructor at Fuller, says of the approach, \"It can raise \nquestions, particularly for the Western-educated person. I think it's \nprobably counterproductive in a non-Western context.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith freely admits that the approach will not work in \nMuslim-majority areas of the world, where such boldness would provoke \nsevere persecution. But he says that Muslims in the West use it in \ntheir attempts to convert Christians, and that they interpret \nChristians' typical evangelistic restraint as weakness. He thinks \nthey have a point, and says current missiology has created \"a whole \nindustry of fear.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Qur'an has huge errors in it, enormous errors,\" Smith says. \"My \ngoal is to eradicate the whole edifice of Islam so that [Muslims] can \nthen look for the alternative.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nMuslim apologist Shabir Ally, of the Islamic Information and Da'wah \nCenter in Toronto, who has debated Smith four times, runs an \nextensive website (www.islam info.com). Christians experienced in \nworking with Muslims have their own (www.answering-islam.org). Smith \nalso participates in a debate-oriented website (www.debate.org.uk).\u0014\n\u0014\nSmith calls on Christians to match the passion of Muslims. \"I was \nnever commissioned to go and die,\" Smith says. \"Most people ask me, \n'Aren't you scared for your health? Aren't you scared you're going to \nbe killed?'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"So what? Yes, probably I will be killed. I told my wife I'll \nprobably die before she does. If I were to die, \u0014\nthere would be 10 or 20 people to take my place willingly.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 Christianity Today. \\Click for reprint information.\u0014\nSeptember 9, 2002, Vol. 46, No. 10, Page 37\u0014",

    "title": "DON'T LET ANGER GET THE BEST OF YOU",
    "words": "Don't Let Anger Get the Best of You\u0014\nBy Winifred Yu Walking \\\u0002\u0014\n\u0014\nYou're late for a job interview when traffic slows to a crawl. At the \nsupermarket, a customer wheeling a full cart cuts ahead of you in the \nexpress check-out line. You spend months on a make-it or break-it \nproject, and your lazy colleague lands the promotion.\u0014\n\u0014\nFeel that burn? Before you implode with rage or erupt into a tantrum, \ntake a deep breath and remember this: Anger hurts. Study after study \nhas found that high levels of anger and hostility are associated with \ngreater risk for heart disease, poor immune responses, and even a \npropensity for obesity. Men with high anger scores were three times \nmore likely to develop heart disease than their calmer cohorts, a \nHarvard School of Public Health study found. And in women, arguments \nwith spouses raise hormone levels and lower immunity -- a real \nproblem, since lower immune response may boost women's risk of cancer.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnger unleashes a torrent of hormones that wreak havoc on our \ncirculatory and immune systems. When we are angry, our \nfight-or-flight response prompts our adrenal glands to send out an \nextra jolt of adrenaline and cortisol. The two hormones then cause \nthe heart rate to speed up, blood pressure to soar, and the immune \nsystem to slow down -- all helpful responses if you're going to fight \nor flee, but not if you're going to stand and seethe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe extra hormones also cause blood platelets to clump and fat cells \nto empty into the bloodstream. Then, when the extra energy isn't \nused, the liver converts the fat into cholesterol. Extra cholesterol \ncreates plaque in the arterial walls, which, over time, raises the \nrisk for heart disease. To make matters worse, hostile people are \nmore likely to overeat, smoke, and drink too much alcohol, studies \nhave found.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt doesn't seem to matter whether you release the anger or hold it \nin, experts say. The effects on your health are the same. \"Anger is \nanger,\" says Redford Williams, M.D., director of the Behavioral \nMedicine Research Center at Duke University Medical Center and \nco-author of the book Life Skills. \"Both are harmful to health.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news is, it is possible to control your anger. \"By \nevaluating it and using various techniques, you can talk yourself out \nof it,\" Williams says. \"That's what's nice about us humans: We can \nalways do something or not do something to change our behavior.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTake stock\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people who are angry don't recognize themselves as angry, \naccording to Knoxville psychologist Richard Driscoll. He suggests \nthat you ask yourself these questions to measure your anger quotient: \nDo you feel as if you are frequently mistreated by others? Do you \noften consider minor inconveniences to be personal attacks against \nyou? Do you complain often? Do you exaggerate the actions of others \nor take their affronts personally? On the road, do you frequently \ncurse other drivers, to the point that driving has become unpleasant?\u0014\n\u0014\nKeep a record\u0014\n\u0014\nMany people are unaware of what ticks them off, says Jerry \nDeffenbacher, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of \nColorado in Fort Collins. \"For lots of us, our anger sort of \nhappens,\" he says. \"We don't know what it comes from. We're just on \nautomatic pilot.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTo get a better sense of what makes you mad, keep a journal of \nsituations that rile you. Reflect on why they set you off and make \nyou feel wronged. Ask yourself honestly whether your anger is \njustified. By writing down feelings and situations, you'll become \nmore aware of the events that get your ire and maybe even avoid them.\u0014\n\u0014\nChange or accept\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you feel anger welling up, take a change-it or accept-it \napproach. If, for example, your neighbor's garbage is fluttering into \nyour yard yet again, it's time to put your problem-solving skills \ninto motion. Calmly discuss the situation, and look for ways to \nchange it.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you can't do anything about the situation -- the rude driver who \njust cut you off has left the scene -- work to put your anger on hold \nright then and there. Accept that you can't do anything about it, \ntake some deep breaths, and move on to something else.\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't take it personally\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many times have you said to yourself, \"That shouldn't have \nhappened to me\" or \"I don't deserve that\"? Such thinking can easily \nset off angry feelings. But smart people realize that, sometimes, the \nwater-on-the-back-of-a-duck approach is the best way to deal with \nmany of life's unfairnesses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Many of us have a God-like or little-kid-like mentality that we \nshouldn't be imposed upon, frustrated, or have things happen to us,\" \nDeffenbacher says. \"That's a demanding kind of thinking. Fact is, \nyou're going to have your base rate of crummy things happen to you.\" \nThe better able you are to accept that, the less angry you'll be.\u0014\n\u0014\nStop dwelling on the past\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you still remember a minor infraction long after it happened, it's \ntime to let go. Life has moved on, and so should you. Practice \nunderstanding people who have dealt you minor wrongs. Think of the \nproblem as having been caused by the situation, not the person. If \nit's a more serious matter, such as childhood abuse or an unfaithful \nspouse, consider seeing a therapist to help you work through and \nrelease the pain, says Susan Heitler, Ph.D., a psychologist in Denver.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdjust your routine\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you've been keeping track of your anger, you know what sets you \noff. Use that information to avoid upsetting situations. For \ninstance, if you know that the grocery store is crowded on weekends, \nshop after work. By avoiding frustrating situations, you dodge anger.\u0014\n\u0014\nUltimately, the ways you react to upsetting situations and express \nyour anger come from a combination of several factors, including \ngenetics, upbringing, and culture. Your response also varies by day, \ndepending on your mood and even how tired you are.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, angry people can learn to become happy people. \"We just \nhave this personality type that sometimes gets us into trouble,\" \nWilliams says. \"You'll always have that tendency to get angry. But \nyou can probably control it enough to keep it from damaging your \nhealth.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1998 The Readers's Digest Association, Inc.

    "words": "Do Non-Charismatics \"Do\" Holy Spirit Baptism?\u0014\nAsk D. L. Moody, Charles G. Finney, Jonathan Edwards, or Cotton \u0014\nMather!\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nby Chris Armstrong\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Recently we've heard a lot about the rapid worldwide growth of \u0014\n   Pentecostal and charismatic groups. Researcher David Barrett \u0014\n   and his team have been reminding us for years that these \u0014\n   groups have passed all others in their global spread. Polls \u0014\n   here at home have showed similarly high domestic growth rates \u0014\n   in such groups.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Some secular commentators have found this growth menacing --\u0014\n   the burgeoning of yet another potentially violent, reactionary \u0014\n   religious group. Some evangelicals, too, are discomfited, \u0014\n   finding the charismatics' emphasis on Spirit-bestowed gifts \u0014\n   such as tongues and prophecy exotic, if not downright alien.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Yet one needn't search far in the history of evangelicalism to \u0014\n   discover a close affinity between charismatic and non-\u0014\n   charismatic evangelicals. And evangelicals who envy the \u0014\n   charismatics' global growth may even find in this affinity a \u0014\n   source of inspiration.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   The truth is, some of the most prominent, influential leaders \u0014\n   and groups in the evangelical lineage have yearned for, \u0014\n   attained, and taught a transformative, post-conversion \u0014\n   experience identified with the Holy Spirit.\u0014\n\u0014\n   Sure, these experiences have not usually come attached to the \u0014\n   gift of tongues. But in other ways they have resembled closely \u0014\n   the modern charismatic experience dubbed \"baptism in (or with, \u0014\n   or of) the Holy Spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Take, for instance, the prayers of the early American Puritan \u0014\n   Cotton Mather (1663-1728), recorded in his diary. Mather asked \u0014\n   God to \"fulfill the ancient Prophecy, of pouring out the \u0014\n   Spirit on all Flesh,\" and in so doing \"revive the \u0014\n   extraordinary and supernatural Operations with which He \u0014\n   planted His Religion in the primitive Times of Christianity, \u0014\n   and order a Descent of His holy Angels to enter and possess \u0014\n   His Ministers, and cause them to ... fly thro' the World with \u0014\n   the everlasting Gospel to preach unto the Nations.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Transported by the power of this vision, Mather concluded \u0014\n   after this prayer that the Holy Spirit was already preparing \u0014\n   to so empower his ministers, and that as a result \"The World \u0014\n   shall be shaken wonderfully!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   In 1734, the great theologian and preacher of awakening \u0014\n   Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) carried the same torch as he \u0014\n   prayed the words of Ephesians 1:17-19 over his congregation in \u0014\n   Northampton, \"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the \u0014\n   Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of \u0014\n   revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your \u0014\n   hearts enlightened, that you may know ... what is the \u0014\n   immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe.\"\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\n   Soon after, the people of Northampton experienced a spiritual \u0014\n   awakening that \"greatly enlivened\" their public worship and \u0014\n   spurred them to seek out and pray for the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   About a century later, a young lawyer named Charles Finney \u0014\n   (1792-1875) also discovered the energizing power of the Holy \u0014\n   Spirit. He gave his experience the name used in his day by \u0014\n   some Methodists: \"As I turned and was about to take a seat by \u0014\n   the fire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. \u0014\n   Without any expectation of it ... the Holy Spirit descended \u0014\n   upon me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body and \u0014\n   soul. No words can express the wonderful love that was shed \u0014\n   abroad in my heart. I wept aloud with joy ...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n   Finney joined the young Methodist \"holiness movement\" in \u0014\n   recommending the experience to all Christians -- and \u0014\n   especially all Christian workers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   A few decades later, Dwight L. Moody (1837-1899) stood in this \u0014\n   same tradition when, at the prayerful instigation of two \u0014\n   elderly Free Methodist women, \"Auntie Cook\" and \"Mrs. Snow,\" \u0014\n   he travailed in prayer that he might \"get the power.\" As R. A. \u0014\n   Torrey (1856-1928; founder of Biola University in California) \u0014\n   later told it, Moody received his answer without warning in \u0014\n   the midst of the bustle and hurry of New York's Wall Street:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   \"The power of God fell upon him as he walked up the street and \u0014\n   he had to hurry off to the house of a friend and ask that he \u0014\n   might have a room by himself, and in that room he stayed alone \u0014\n   for hours; and the Holy Ghost came upon him, filling his soul \u0014\n   with such joy that at last he had to ask God to withhold His \u0014\n   hand, lest he die on the spot from very joy.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Embarking on an evangelistic tour of England, Moody now found \u0014\n   that \"the power of God wrought through him mightily in North \u0014\n   London, and hundreds were added to the churches.\" Always after \u0014\n   that, Moody urged his friend, \"Torrey, I want you to preach on \u0014\n   the baptism with the Holy Ghost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   None of these evangelical forefathers stressed the \u0014\n   extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit listed in 2 Corinthians \u0014\n   12 and taught in the Pentecostal and charismatic movements. \u0014\n   None even dwelled on the Spirit's work of sanctification \u0014\n   (Christian holiness or \"fruit of the Spirit\") -- long the \u0014\n   theme of the Wesleyans and arguably the primary focus of \u0014\n   scriptural and traditional teaching on the Spirit. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   But each of them sought an experience of \"Holy Spirit baptism\" \u0014\n   subsequent to conversion that would provide boldness and power \u0014\n   in ministry -- reflecting the Spirit-led boldness of the \u0014\n   apostles (Acts 4:8, 13, 29, 31). \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   Those who wonder at the rapid global spread of Christian \u0014\n   \"Spirit movements\" should not overlook this spiritual \u0014\n   explanation. And those who are deeply committed to the \u0014\n   worldwide preaching of the gospel, yet feel little affinity \u0014\n   with charismatic Christianity, might wish to recall this \u0014\n   deeper, shared meaning of the Holy Spirit's baptism: Though \u0014\n   Scripture and tradition join in insisting that the Holy Spirit \u0014\n   does far more in the lives of ordinary Christians than equip \u0014\n   them \"to boldly go\" and spread the gospel, it appears that He \u0014\n   does do at least this -- and does it surpassing well.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n   *The basic idea of this article and several of the examples \u0014\n   come from an essay by Richard Lovelace, emeritus professor of \u0014\n   church history at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary: \u0014\n   \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit and the Evangelical Tradition,\" \u0014\n   Pneuma: The Journal of the Society for Pentecostal Studies 7:2 \u0014\n   (Fall, 1985), 101-123.\u0014",

Leithart\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When David first meets Abigail, his second \nwife-to-be, she is married to another man, a\u0014\n                     prosperous farmer named Nabal. In Hebrew, \nNabals name means Fool,1 a clear sign that he\u0014\n                     wont amount to much in the biblical world. \nIndeed, Nabal dies almost as soon as he is\u0014\n                     introduced (and Davids wedding plans are then \nset in motion). Yet Nabal the Fool still plays an\u0014\n                     important part in the narrative. An \nunderstanding of his role has been lost over the years,\u0014\n                     however, due to the common misreading of two \nkey, yet rather crude, phrases that have been\u0014\n                     cleaned up by generations of translators.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     As the story opens in 1 Samuel 25, David and his \n400 supporters are hiding out in the region of\u0014\n                     Carmel, on land belonging to Nabal. They have \nbeen chased there by King Saul, who correctly\u0014\n                     fears that the young warrior is destined to the \nthrone. Nabal is not around, but his workers are: Its\u0014\n                     shearing time, and Nabals 3,000 sheep and 3,000 \ngoats are getting their annual haircuts. The\u0014\n                     workers dont mind the soldiers presence, \nhowever, since the soldiers offer the farmhands\u0014\n                     some protection. One of Nabals laborers later \nreports: [Davids] men were very good to us, and\u0014\n                     we suffered no harm, and we never missed \nanything when we were in the fields, as long as we\u0014\n                     were with them; they were a wall to us both by \nnight and by day, all the while we were with them\u0014\n                     keeping the sheep (1 Samuel 25:15-16). \u0014\n\u0014\n                     But when David asks Nabal to recompense his men \nfor protecting the workers, he is rebuffed.\u0014\n                     Nabal asks Davids messengers: Who is David? \nWho is the son of Jesse? There are many\u0014\n                     slaves today who are breaking away from their \nmasters. Shall I take my bread and my water and\u0014\n                     the meat that I had butchered for my shearers, \nand give it to men who come from I do not know\u0014\n                     where? (1 Samuel 25:10-11).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Enraged, David orders his men to strap on their \nswords and return to Nabals estate. [Nabal]\u0014\n                     has returned me evil for good, David fumes. \nGod do so to David and more also, if by morning I\u0014\n                     leave so much as the last male of all he owns \n(1 Samuel 25:22).2 In the original Hebrew,\u0014\n                     Davids language is in fact far cruder than this \nEnglish translation, however. In Hebrew, David\u0014\n                     actually threatens to kill every last one who \npisses against the wall (mastin beqir)thereby\u0014\n                     likening his enemies to dogs, as well as \nidentifying them as men. The cleaned-up English\u0014\n                     translation also obscures the reference in the \noriginal Hebrew to the wall of protection Davids\u0014\n                     men had provided; through Nabals ingratitude, \nhe and his men have in effect pissed on this\u0014\n                     wall. But apart from the King James Version, \nmost every major English translation prudishly\u0014\n                     replaces Davids pisser with the term male.3\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When Nabals farmhands learn that Davids troops \nare heading toward them, they appeal to\u0014\n                     Abigail and explain to her how David protected \nthem (They were a wall to us [1 Samuel 25:16])\u0014\n                     and how Nabal has reacted violently and unfairly.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Abigail gathers together two hundred loaves of \nbread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five\u0014\n                     measures of grain, one hundred raisin cakes and \ntwo hundred fig cakes, and loads it all on\u0014\n                     donkeys. Without telling her husband, she heads \nout into the wilderness in search of David.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     When she finds David, she bows before him and \nbegs him to ignore Nabal: My lord, do not take\u0014\n                     seriously this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as \nhis name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly\u0014\n                     is with him (1 Samuel 25:25). She predicts \nDavid will become prince over Israel and offers him\u0014\n                     the food and wine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     David acquiesces: Blessed be the Lord, the God \nof Israel, who sent you to meet me today!\u0014\n                     Blessed be your good sense, and blessed be you, \nwho have kept me today from blood guilt and\u0014\n                     from avenging myself by my own hand! For as \nsurely as the Lord the God of Israel lives, who has\u0014\n                     restrained me from hurting you, unless you had \nhurried and come to meet me, truly by morning\u0014\n                     there would not have been left to Nabal so much \nas the last one who pisses against the wall (1\u0014\n                     Samuel 25:32-35). (Here, too, English \ntranslations usually mention only the last male.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Abigail returns home and finds her husband \nfeasting like a king (1 Samuel 25:36). Nabal is\u0014\n                     merry and drunk, and Abigail decides not to tell \nhim about her encounter with David until the next\u0014\n                     day: In the morning, when the wine had gone out \nof Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his\u0014\n                     heart died within him; he became like a stone. \nAbout ten days later the Lord struck Nabal, and he\u0014\n                     died (1 Samuel 25:37).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Throughout history, most translators have \ninterpreted the Hebrew phrase (best hayyayin\u0014\n                     minnbl), rendered here as when the wine had \ngone out of Nabal, as an indication that Nabal\u0014\n                     had sobered up. The New International Version \nreads when Nabal was sober; the New Jewish\u0014\n                     Publication Society has when Nabel had slept \noff the wine; and the New American Standard\u0014\n                     Bible and the New Revised Standard Version \ntranslate the phrase as when the wine had gone\u0014\n                     out of Nabal, closely following the King James \nVersion and the American Standard Versions\u0014\n                     when the wine was gone out of Nabal. Ancient \ntranslations show a similar range. The Latin\u0014\n                     Vulgate renders the phrase as when Nabal had \ndisposed of the wine (cum digessisset vinum\u0014\n                     Nabal) and the Greek Septuagint reads to become \nsober from the wine (hos exenepsen apo\u0014\n                     tou oinou Nabal).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     But the grammatical construction used here (the \nparticle be with the infinitive construct)\u0014\n                     commonly denotes action simultaneous with the \nmain verb.4 A more accurate translation would\u0014\n                     be While the wine was going out from Nabal, his \nwife told him ... Nabal is clearly doing\u0014\n                     something while Abigail is speaking.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     A handful of scholars have recognized the pun \nbetween the name Nabal and nebel, meaning\u0014\n                     wineskin. Wineskins are made from animal \nbladders, and, as Jon Levenson of Harvard\u0014\n                     University has suggested, Nabal the man is here \nbeing equated with a bladder.5 The wine goes\u0014\n                     out of Nabal just as it goes out of a \nwineskin-bladder. Though Levenson does not say so, this\u0014\n                     means that when Abigail informs Nabal of her \nencounter with David, her husband is emptying his\u0014\n                     bladder after a heavy night of drinking.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     This is not simply a vulgar detail, but an \nimportant one, for two reasons. \u0014\n\u0014\n                     First, it fulfills Davids threat to eliminate \nthose who piss against the wall. The biblical author is\u0014\n                     making it clear that the main pisser is Nabal \nhimself. The wall he pisses on, at least\u0014\n                     metaphorically, is David and his men. Nabal is \nelsewhere identified as a member of the Calebite\u0014\n                     (klibbi) clana pun on the Hebrew calev, or \ndog, so it is hardly surprising that he pisses on a\u0014\n                     wall.6 Twice, David threatens to kill the \npisser by morning light (1 Samuel 25:22,34), and that is\u0014\n                     when Nabals heart dies. But, significantly, \nDavid doesnt have to do anything; rather, the Lord\u0014\n                     strikes Nabal.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Second, the phrase creates a striking parallel \nbetween Nabal and Saul, Davids greatest enemy.\u0014\n                     The suggestion that Nabal is an alter ego of \nSaul is commonplace.7 Nabal isnt a king like Saul,\u0014\n                     but, as many commentators have noted, he is very \nrich and he feasts like a king (1 Samuel\u0014\n                     25:2,36). In the next chapter, Saul confesses \nthat he has played the fool (the Hebrew verb is\u0014\n                     sakal, 1 Samuel 26:21); as we have noted, \nNabals name means fool. When we look at Nabals\u0014\n                     treatment of David, the parallels with Saul \nbecome clearer. While David was serving Nabal (1\u0014\n                     Samuel 25:7), his men did not insult Nabals \nservants, or steal anything from them, but instead\u0014\n                     were like a wall to Nabals house and goods (1 \nSamuel 25:16-17,21). David had already\u0014\n                     performed similar service for Saul. But both \nNabal and Saul are completely ungrateful and refuse\u0014\n                     to reward him with anything in return. Instead, \nthey return evil for Davids good (1 Samuel 25:21).\u0014\n                     Nabal gives David nothing, contemptuously called \nhim the son of Jesse (1 Samuel 25:10), as\u0014\n                     Saul had done (see for example 1 Samuel \n22:7,8,13), and dismisses him as a rebel.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     The reference to Nabals urinating further \nreinforces the analogy between Nabal and Saul. For in\u0014\n                     the immediately preceding chapter (1 Samuel 24), \nDavid and his men see Saul defecating in a\u0014\n                     cave (the Bible uses the polite euphemism \ncovering his feet [1 Samuel 24:3] but some modern\u0014\n                     translations are more explicit). David and his \nmen have been hiding in the cave, in the wilderness\u0014\n                     of Ein Gedi, when Saul unknowingly enters. \nDavids men tell their leader: Here is the day of\u0014\n                     which the Lord said to you, I will give your \nenemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it\u0014\n                     seems good to you (1 Samuel 24:4). But David \nrefuses to attack the king from behind. Instead\u0014\n                     he clips the hem of Sauls garment, showing he \ncould easily have killed Saul had Saul not been\u0014\n                     the Lords anointed. David then forbids his \nmen from attacking Saul. Instead, David calls out\u0014\n                     loudly, My lord, the king! (1 Samuel 24:8) to \nget Sauls attention, and he bows before the king in\u0014\n                     obeisance. David asks Saul: Why do you listen \nto the words of those who say, David seeks to do\u0014\n                     you harm? This very day your eyes have seen how \nthe Lord gave you into my hand in the cave;\u0014\n                     and some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. \nI said, I will not raise my hand against my lord;\u0014\n                     for he is the Lords anointed (1 Samuel \n24:10). He then presents Saul with the swatch of hem\u0014\n                     that he has cut off.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Weeping, Saul proclaims, Now I know that you \nshall surely be king. He begs David, Swear to\u0014\n                     me by the Lord that you will not cut off my \ndescendants after me (1 Samuel 24:21). David agrees,\u0014\n                     and Saul returns to Jerusalem, leaving David \nbehind in the wilderness.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Davids direct threat to Nabal in the following \nchapter contrasts sharply with the restraint David\u0014\n                     has shown in his dealings with Saul. David has \nbeen a wall and guardian to Saul, and Saul has\u0014\n                     continually pissed on himseeking to kill him, \npursuing him around the countryside, offering\u0014\n                     and then withdrawing his daughter as a bride, \nand so on. But despite Sauls constant hostility,\u0014\n                     David promises not to harm his descendants (see \nalso 1 Samuel 20:15).\u0014\n\u0014\n                     Davids restraint is vindicated in the Nabal \nepisode. Here David learns that he no more needs to\u0014\n                     strike the dog Saul than the dog Nabal. The \nIsraelite deity YHWH himself can be depended on to\u0014\n                     cut down those who piss against the protective \nwall. YHWH has killed Nabal; he will take care of\u0014\n                     Saul, too, and, ultimately, will give the crown \nto David.\u0014\n\u0014\n                     We know David has learned his lesson. \nImmediately following the Nabal account is a second\u0014\n                     episode in which David shows remarkable \nrestraint in dealing with Saul (1 Samuel 26). That\u0014\n                     episode closely parallels the story in 1 Samuel \n24. Again the king is vulnerablethis time\u0014\n                     sleeping outdoors at Gibeah, with his spear by \nhis headwhen David discovers him. David\u0014\n                     refrains from killing Saul, but takes the kings \nspear and water jug as proof that he could have,\u0014\n                     had he chosen to. He makes a speech similar to \nthe one he gave outside the cave at Ein Gedi\u0014\n                     (The Lord forbid that I should raise my hand \nagainst the Lords anointed 1 Samuel 26:11=1\u0014\n                     Samuel 24:6), but with a significant addition: \nAt Gibeah, a wiser David adds: As the Lord lives,\u0014\n                     the Lord will strike him [Saul] down; or his day \nwill come to die; or he will go down into battle and\u0014\n                     perish (1 Samuel 26:10). That is, David neednt \nslay Saul because the Lord will do it himself.\u0014\n                     Through his encounter with Nabal, David has \nlearned that the Lord knows how to deal with fools\u0014\n                     and dogs.\u0014\n\u0014\n                          For further reading, see Peter J.

The story \nof a journey into darkness and murderand the investigation that \nbrought a killing spree to an end \u0014\n \u0014\nBy Evan Thomas\u0014\nNEWSWEEK \u0014\n  \u0014\n      Nov. 4 issue   John Williams had been a talkative little \nshowoff when he was growing up. His grandfather, who raised him after \nhis mother died and his father disappeared, nicknamed him Governor. \nHe was still strutting when he went to visit his family in Baton \nRouge, La., about nine months ago, with a man he said he was helping \ntravel back to Jamaica in tow.   \u0014\n\u0014\nHE CLAIMED that he was in the immigrant import-export business, \naccording to his cousin Charlene Anderson. He said he helped people \nwho were in trouble get in and out of the country. He was so well \ndressed, kind of like he had been put up on a shelf, she told \nNEWSWEEK. But when John, who had changed his last name to Muhammad, \nshowed up a few months later, late last summer, he was dirty and \nhungry, and his posturing had veered into dangerous delusion. \nSummoning Anderson into the kitchen, he closed the door and unzipped \na long green duffel bag. Inside the bag was a case, and inside the \ncase was a rifle. Muhammad explained that he was working for a secret \nSpecial Forces group to recover missing C-4 explosives stolen from a \nmilitary base by drug smugglers. Muhammad was accompanied by a \nteenage boy named Lee. Lees not my son, Muhammad explained. Hes \non the special team with me. He was hired to blend in with the \njuveniles on the street. See that boy? Hes highly trained. She \nasked why he didnt work through local law enforcement. He told me \nhe couldnt do that because nobody knew they existed, she says. \nCousin Charlene wasnt sure what to believe. I thought it was very \nstrange. It really spooked me.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf authorities are right, by the time Muhammad and his young sidekick \nwere done last week, many millions of people had been traumatized by \ntheir grotesque playacting. The two pretenders left a blood-soaked \ntrail as they wandered from Washington state to Alabama to \nmetropolitan Washington, D.C. They left little catch-me-if-you-can \nclues and odd allusions to Jamaican music and folklore. They \nmethodically shot people of all ages, genders and races, and they \nmade outrageous demands for money. But it was never very clear what \nthey were really up to, aside from trying to get attention. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat they got. before moving in for the arrest last week, the Feds \nand the police prepared for pitched battle. Local police SWAT teams, \nthe FBIs elite Hostage Rescue Team and other state and federal \nparamilitary units strapped on their body armor and shouldered their \nautomatic weapons. For more than two hours, at a McDonalds parking \nlot near the highway rest stop where the snipers car had been \nspotted, the assault was elaborately staged and mounted. Finally, at \nabout 3 a.m., as choppers roared overhead and searchlights glared, \nthe black ninjas leapt into action and encountered the enemy ... \npeacefully dozing. One official said the sniper suspects barely \nstirred as police smashed through the windows of the car and screamed \nat the men to surrender. They practically slept through the \ntakedown, the official said.  \u0014\n\u0014\n  \u0014\n        Maybe they were just worn out by shooting people (13 over 21 \ndays, plus two more in Alabama in late September; 11 died). Maybe \nthey hadnt heard the news reports that the Feds were closing in. \nWhatever the case, few law-enforcement officials expected such a \ndocile ending to a ghastly siege that had terrorized metropolitan \nWashington and transfixed the media. The suspects, John Allen \nMuhammad, 41, and John Lee Malvo, 17, were penniless drifters. They \nwere not stumblebums. Muhammad, though an insubordinate soldier, had \nbeen a skilled marksman in the Army. He had transformed his aged \nChevy Caprice into a kind of Rube Goldberg killing machine by cutting \na hole in the trunk to help create a hidden snipers perch. He had \ntrained his young friend Malvo, whom he reportedly called Sniper, \nto shoot a human being from a hundred yards or so. Police believe \nthat the two men took turns and theorized that Muhammad took the more \ndifficult head shots, while Malvo aimed for the victims torso.\u0014\n\u0014\n        But demonic geniuses they were not. As the death toll mounted \nand the talking heads blathered, an ever more menacing picture of the \nsniper had seized the public imagination. He was the Scarlet \nPimpernel with an assault weapon, clever, taunting, elusive, ghosting \nabout in a white van that seemed to magically melt through massive \ndragnets. Not just the cable-TV criminologists but also the \ngovernments own experts were fooled. Until the last couple of days, \nmost top officials at the state-local-federal joint command center in \nRockville, Md., thought they were looking for an intelligent, \nwell-organized white male, one veteran federal investigator told \nNEWSWEEK.\u0014\n\u0014\n        Someone capable of randomly picking off pretty much anyone \nwho walked into his gun sights, day after day, must be in the thrall \nof some frothing-at-the-mouth psychosisif not the Devil, certainly \nhis disciples. Right? Some top federal officials had suspected that \nthe snipers were Qaeda assassins. Muhammad may have conceivably been \na sympathizer or a self-recruited terrorist. A convert to Islam who \nclaimed to have provided security for Louis Farrakhan during the 1995 \nMillion Man March on Washington, Muhammad had been heard by neighbors \npraising the 9-11 hijackers for their efficiency. But his motives, as \nwell as the nature of his relationship with the teenage Malvo, remain \nmurky. His anger at his ex-wife over a particularly ugly \nchild-custody battle appears to have enraged him more than any \npolitical or religious obsession. He is a chilling figure, but mostly \nbecause he seems to have shown that almost any sore loser with a \nstore-bought gun and a sniper scope can paralyze the nations \ncapital. Imagine what a few well-trained teams could do.\u0014\n        \u0014\n The made-for-TV plot line appeared to pit the dogged Montgomery \nCounty, Md., police chief, Charles A. Moose, in an almost personal \ntest of wills with the mysterious sniper. After grimacing and \nglowering through his daily press briefings, Chief Moose finally \npermitted himself to smile last Thursday, as he reeled off the names \nof all the different state, local and federal agency officials who \nshared in the glory of the capture. But the Feds and locals soon \nstarted squabbling over the honor (and headlines) of prosecuting \nMuhammad and Malvo. Federal prosecutors interrupted a potentially \npromising interrogation by local officials in order to move the \nsuspects to a federal courtwhere the two men were assigned lawyers \nand clammed up. Informed sources tell NEWSWEEK that the search for \nthe snipers was chaotic and sometimes floundering, that various \ncliques among the more than a dozen different jurisdictions or law- \nenforcement agencies handling the case often failed to communicate \nwith each other, sometimes even when they were in the same room. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe missed chances during the three-week investigation are hard to \nfathom even for those not directly affected, but probably \nunforgivable to the families of the victims. While investigators \nsearched for the mythical white van, Muhammads blue Caprice had \nrepeated encounters with police. On Oct. 3, two hours before the \nsnipers shot a 72-year-old man standing on a curb and just eight \nhours after completing a rampage that claimed five victims, D.C. \npolice pulled over the Caprice on a minor traffic violationand let \nhim go. Early on Oct. 8, the day after he shot a 13-year-old outside \nhis middle school, Muhammad was found asleep in his car by Baltimore \npolice. The patrolmen told him to move on. And on Oct. 21, the day \nbefore the snipers claimed their final victim, a bus driver, Fairfax, \nVa., police caught Muhammad running a red light. The Washington Post \nreported last week that Muhammads battered Caprice attracted enough \nsuspicion over the past month that on at least 10 different \noccasions, the authorities ran its license plate through the \nnational police database. Finding nothing, the police let the car, \nand its drivers, go on their way.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe snipers wanted to talk to the police. But the police kept hanging \nup. Its not that investigators didnt wish to open a dialogue. Chief \nMooses emotional outburst at the press for leaking the first clues \nleft by the sniperthe tarot card and the empty .223 shell casing \nafter the school shooting on Oct. 7was intentionally exaggerated, \naccording to an informed source. Moose was trying to signal the \nsnipers that he really did want to open a private channel. But when \nthe snipers tried to call the FBI tip line or the local police, they \ncouldnt get anyone to pay attention. Overwhelmed by the volume of \ncalls (more than 100,000) and inadequately prepared to spot the \nsnipers secret code, the phone operators dismissed the callers as \ncranks.\u0014\nIt was the snipers frustration over what they called, in a letter \ntacked to a tree, the incompetence of your force that may have \nfinally led Muhammad and Malvo to play into the hands of Chief \nMooses team. The endgame of the investigation, reconstructed by \nNEWSWEEK, was a wild coast-to-coast race to connect the dots and find \nthe killers before they struck againor slipped away for good. Like \nmost police investigations, its success owed more to luck and the \nclumsiness of the culprits than brilliant criminal profiling or \ndazzling forensics. Ultimately, authorities believe, the snipers were \ndone in by their egos, their insistence on gaining attention and \nnotoriety. The first real break in the case may have come when \nMuhammad and Malvo couldnt resist bragging about their past exploits.\u0014\n\u0014\nI. TANGLED LIVES\u0014\nIt is hard to know just how John Muhammad might have crossed over \nfrom being a run-of-the-mill loser, an overbearing father who conned \nand intimidated his ex-wives, to become a homicidal Svengali who led \na teenage accomplice into mass murder. But its possible to trace a \ncontinuum into ever more hostile, devious and menacing behavior. \u0014\n\u0014\nCriminal psychiatrists automatically look for severe child abuse or \nneglect in the case of serial killers. John Williams (he legally \nchanged his name to Muhammad in 2001) grew up without parents. His \nmother died of cancer when he was 3, and his father seems to have \nbeen mostly absent. He was raised by his elderly grandfather and an \naunt in a poor neighborhood in East Baton Rouge. But he was a \ngregarious, happy-go-lucky kid, according to his cousin Charlene. He \nwas part of a brood of youngsters who spent their time climbing trees \nand digging for crayfish in a nearby canal (and, according to another \ncousin, breaking into houses for the fun of it).\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had a streak of arrogance and a temper. Enlisting in the National \nGuard, he was twice court-martialed, once for disobeying an order, \nthe second time for striking a noncommissioned officer. He moved from \nwoman to woman, having one son by a girlfriend and a second son by \nhis first wife. When he moved out with another woman and his marriage \nbroke up in 1985, the divorce was bitter. He tried to stay in his \nsons life in an occasional but peculiarly heavy-handed way, ordering \nhis ex-wife not to feed their son certain types of food.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe found some kind of order and meaning by becoming a Muslim and \njoining the U.S. Army. Squared away, physically fit, with a crushing \nhandshake, he was superficially an adequate soldier, serving as a \nmechanic in a combat engineering brigade. His sergeant, however, says \nhe was trouble from day one. Youd give him an order and youd get a \ncertain glare, retired Sgt. Kip Berentson told NEWSWEEK. He loved \nbeing in charge and he had a warped sense of humor. Williamss unit \nwas sent to Operation Desert Storm to clear mines and bulldoze holes \nin enemy lines. A few nights before the invasion of Iraq, Sergeant \nBerentson awoke in the early hours to find his tent, with 16 sleeping \nmen inside, on fire. Someone had tossed in a thermite grenade. \nBerentson, who was fed up with Williamss \u0014\ninsubordination, immediately suspected Williams and told the Armys \nCriminal Investigative Division. Berentson says he last saw Williams \nbeing led away in handcuffs. Williamss military records make no \nmention of the incident; indeed, they suggest Williams had a \ndistinguished gulf-war stint. But Berentson always kept Williamss \nname and dog-tag number in his wallet. He says he was not surprised \nto see Williamss face on television. He was, he added, a damn \ngood shooter. \u0014\n\u0014\nWilliams, who now called himself Muhammad, left the Army in February \n1994. He had trouble coping with civilian life. Manipulative and a \nbit of a scam artist, he tried various business schemes that fell \napart. In Tacoma, Wash., he started a martial-arts school with a man \nnamed Felix Strozier under the grand name Strozier & Muhammad Team \nof Champions Ltd. Muhammad boasted that he had been in the Special \nForces in the Army, which was untrue. When the business collapsed, \nMuhammad owed Strozier $500, which, according to Strozier, he never \nrepaid. Muhammads family car-repair business also failed, along with \nhis second marriage.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad was extremely verbally abusive to his wife, Mildred, \naccording to Isa Nichols, a business consultant who worked with \nMuhammad and his wife. He shoved her, Nichols said. In her divorce \npapers, Mildred described Muhammad as a very irrational man who \nregularly threatened to tap her phones and destroy her. In March \n2000, Muhammad took their three childrenand vanished.\u0014\nHe took the kids to Antigua. He told his landlady that he hated the \nInternet and added, oddly, that he didnt like waters touching his \nskin. He boasted to an acquaintance that he was a crack shotthat he \ncould kill a man from half a mile away. He tried to raise his \nchildren as strict Muslims, but he was unable to support them. By the \nsummer of 2001, he was back in Washington state.\u0014\n\u0014\nMildred was so distraught after Muhammad stole their children that \nshe wound up in the hospital suffering from anemia and malnutrition. \nNichols took pity and helped her get them back. She gave the \nauthorities Muhammads license-plate number. The child-welfare \nauthorities found the kids living at a homeless shelter with their \nfather in Bellingham, Wash. The children were taken away and returned \nto Mildred. Muhammad was furious and humiliated. In February 2002, \nsomeone shot and killed 21-year-old Keenya Cook. Cook lived with her \naunt Isa Nichols. She had just opened the door when she was shot in \nthe face. The crime was unsolved at the time, but police are \ninvestigating whether the bullet was meant for Nichols and fired by a \nvengeful Muhammad.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad found, or created, a new son. He apparently first met young \nJohn Lee Malvo in Antigua, where the boy was living with his mother. \nMalvo was a grave young man who responded to Muhammads \nself-improvement program, jogging in the mornings, working out, \nfollowing the dietary rules of Islam. It is not clear exactly how \nMalvo ended up in Washington state with Muhammad, but his mother, who \nwas living in Florida, bitterly objected and went looking for the \nboy. She went to the police, who found him staying with Muhammad at \nthe homeless shelter. Police reunited the mother and son, but then \nshe disappeared again. Malvo stayed with Muhammad. The two were seen \nplaying chess together at Stuarts Coffee Shop downtown. Malvo called \nMuhammad Dad and appeared deferential, saying Yes sir, no sir in \npublic. The two did not mix with the other regulars, and Muhammad \nkept a large, military-issue duffel bag by his side at all times, \neven in the bathroom. Muhammad made a mild pass at the guitar player, \nHannah Parks, telling her he was a music agent. He backed off when \nshe asked for his card. She thought he was a friendly, weird guy. \nBut not dangerous.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad did ask what she thought about the whole 9-11 thing, but \nhe was guarded about his own beliefs, Parks told NEWSWEEK. He was \nless cautious with Harjeet Singh, a buddy who worked out with \nMuhammad and Malvo at the local YMCA. They said 9-11 was very good, \nSingh told NEWSWEEK. They said it should have been done a long time \nago. Muhammad marveled at the damage a relatively small number of \nterrorists could do, Singh says. They said 19 people did what a \nwhole army couldnt have done.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Singh, Muhammad and Malvo contemplated their own acts of \nterrorism. They hate police, said Singh. He claims that Muhammad \nshowed him designs for a silencer that could be attached to a rifle. \nThey said they were going to shoot a police officer. Then the other \npolice officers and firemen and the mayor would get together for a \nfuneral. Singh told NEWSWEEK that the two men planned to bomb the \nfuneral. They just wanted to spread fear. They wanted to kill \npeople, said Singh.\u0014\n\u0014\nSingh said that he was too afraid of Muhammad to go to the police. \nBut when Singh was arrested for domestic violence in June, Singh \nclaims he told the police as well as the FBI about Muhammads plot. \nFBI officials confirmed that they had learned of the story about \nMuhammad and referred it to the ATF (which investigates weapons and \nexplosives crimes). It is not clear what the Feds did with the \ninformation, though local police officials are now telling reporters \nthat Singh may be embellishing his story.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe so, but given the carnage allegedly wreaked later by Muhammad \nand Malvo, perhaps not by much. By June 2002, Muhammad and Malvo had \nleft Washington state and begun to drift eastward. They showed up in \nBaton Rouge at the end of July, dirty and haggard. Some of Muhammads \ncousins thought young Malvo seemed fearful and withdrawn. Looking \nback, Charlene Anderson can see red flags. When Muhammad took her \naside andpretending to be a Special Forces commandoshowed her his \nrifle, he opened a box of bullets and asked if she knew where he \ncould get more. Anderson, a police officer, wondered, Doesnt the \nmilitary give them to him? She went to work early the next morning. \nMuhammad slept until early afternoon. I thought hes supposed to be \ndown here working on this secret mission and hes in bed asleep all \nday, she recalled. I feel like he was trying to reach out to me ... \nbut I know that I wont ever see him again, unless theyre shipping \nhim home in a box to be buried.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuhammad and Malvo drifted east and north, allegedly ambushing the \npair at the Montgomery, Ala., liquor store (Muhammad was apparently \nthe shooter). In New Jersey, Muhammad bought and fitted out his \nsniper mobile. Before he allegedly began killing, he may have gone to \nsee his three children, who live with Mildred, just outside \nWashington in Clinton, Md. A neighbor walking his dogs claims to have \nhad a brief conversation with Muhammad. (Mildred is in seclusion.) \nDid something happen there that drove him over the edge? Did he \nsomehow transfer his rage on the citizenry of greater metropolitan \nWashington?\u0014\n\u0014\nII. THE ENDGAME\u0014\nThe call came in to Chief Mooses office at the Montgomery County \nPolice Department on Friday, Oct. 18, two weeks and 11 victims into \nthe sniper nightmare. A public-information officer answered. \nAccording to a law-enforcement source, the angry caller said \nsomething like, Do you know who youre dealing with? Dont mess with \nme. The caller told the Montgomery police to check out a \nmurder-robbery at a liquor store in Montgomery. Law-enforcement \nsources offer conflicting accounts about whether the caller \nspecifically said, Montgomery, Alabama, or just Montgomery. In \nretrospect, it is clear that the snipers were showing off. They were \npointing police to the shooting of two women at a state liquor store \nin Montgomery, Ala., on Sept. 21. Ambushed, one woman was shot in the \nback, the other in the back of the neck. (One died.) The shooter, \npolice now believe, was John Muhammad. The link to the Montgomery, \nAla., shooting would prove to be crucial. At the time, however, the \nhint from the angry caller did not really capture the attention of \nthe sniper task force. The public-information officer who took the \ncall didnt realize he was talking to the sniper. A second call from \nthe same man an hour later was abruptly cut off; apparently, the \ncaller had run out of change at a pay phone.\u0014\nThe investigators were inundated. After a shooting, calls were coming \nin at the rate of 1,000 an hour. The task-force leaders and their \ntroopsseveral thousand men and women, some drafted from other \ngovernment agencies to man the phones 24 hours a daywere exhausted \nand staggering under the weight of hopes raised and dashed. Top \nofficials muttered about the irresponsibility of the press. They were \nangry that reporters had let slip that the Pentagon had provided spy \nplanes to track the snipers. Its a chess move we would rather have \nmade in the dark, one police official said. In the large, cluttered \noffice space in Rockville, Md., that served as a bullpen for all the \ndifferent investigative agencies, bleary-eyed investigators tracked \ndown tips, mostly nutty or useless, but some that seemed promising \nand led nowhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was, for instance, the Dentist. He had been fingered by a \ncaller to the tip line, who phoned police to say that he knew of an \nodd and angry dentist who loved guns. The dentists home was in what \npolice called the red zone, the area in Montgomery County where the \nprofilers thought the sniper probably lived. The first time police \nvisited the dentists house, they heard the double click of a \nshotguns being cocked. The next day a victim was gunned down in \nFredericksburg, Va., 45 minutes away from the dentists office. \nFederal agents returned and found the dentistwith a high-powered \nrifle, capable of shooting .223 ammunition, in his trunk. Peering \nthrough the dentists office window, they observed a map of the \nregion, with the locations of all the sniper attacks marked with \ncolored pins. The cops got a warrant to seize the gunbut the \nballistics didnt match the snipers bullets. The dentists alibi was \nrock solid, said a frustrated gumshoe.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there was the Good Ole Boy. He was another gun-crazed white man \nwith suspicious habits. The police put him under surveillance. One \nnight in the middle of the siege, he was observed shooting pool and \ndrinking aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq0cauamk'z-aaaa'pqaafrankenstein \nwith his buddies until 2 a.m. Not serial-killer behavior, the cops \nconcluded.\u0014\nThat week, while detectives futilely chased white vans and trucks by \nthe thousand, the sniper had seemed to go quiet. Then on Saturday \nnight, Oct. 19, he struck again, shooting a traveler as he left the \nPonderosa Steak House in Ashland, Va. Alerted by an anonymous call \n(now believed to be Muhammad), the police found a three-page letter. \nIt was sealed in a sandwich bag, tacked to a tree behind the \nrestaurant. For you, Mr. Police, it read. Call me God. The words \nmatched those written on a tarot card discovered by investigators \nafter the Oct. 7 shooting of the schoolboy. The letter continued, We \nhave tried to contact you to start a negotiation and listed a \nhalf-dozen attempts to call police or FBI tip lines that were \nrebuffed as a hoax or joke. If the authorities wanted to stop the \nkillings, the letter warned, they would place $10 million in the \naccount of a Visa bank card. The letter provided a PIN and an account \nnumber for a card that turned out to be stolen. Police were told to \nstand ready to take a call at a pay phone near the Ponderosa at 6 \na.m. that Sunday. The sniper gave the cops until 9 a.m. Monday to \ndeposit the money. The letter writers warned of more body bags, and \nadded, P.S., your children are not safe anywhere at any time.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the snipers list of foiled attempts to contact the authorities, \none in particular stood out. It said, simply, Priest at Ashland. \n(Investigators theorize that the shooter called a priest not for \nforgiveness but to find a go-between.) Around noontime, after Sunday \nmass, the FBI visited St. Anns Catholic Church in Ashland. The \npastor, Msgr. William Sullivan, told the investigators that he had \nindeed received a call from a man who reportedly introduced himself, \nI am God. According to the priest, the caller complained that the \nwoman at the Home Depot (FBI cyber analyst Linda Franklin, 47, slain \non Oct. 14) would not have died if police had not ignored his calls. \nIt took two visits from the FBI to surface the key detail. The caller \nhad instructed the priest to write down a message for police to look \ninto Montgomery, Alabama. The caller wanted the police to know about \nthe slaying at the liquor store. The call was garbled; the priest had \nthought he was talking to a crank. But this time round, the reference \nto Montgomery seized the attention of investigators. That call did \nit, said one top law-enforcement official. After two and a half \nweeks of flailing and false leads, the trail was about to grow warm.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt about 9 that Sunday, Montgomery, Ala., Police Chief John Wilson \nwas just settling down for an evening of football on TV. He had \nwatched the Atlanta Falcons game with a friend and polished off a \nsteak dinner and a glass of wine. The call came from his chief of \ndetectives, Maj. Pat Downing. Youre not going to believe this, \nsaid Downing. A detective from the sniper task force in Montgomery \nCounty, Md., had called. He told his Alabama counterpart that the \nsniper task force had received a phone call from a man who claimed to \nbe the sniper. Faced with skepticism, the angry caller had reportedly \nsaid, I know something about a murder-robbery at an ABC liquor store \nin Montgomery, Alabama, near Ann Street.\u0014\n\u0014\nWilson and Downing were surprised. They knew all about the Sept. 21 \nslaying. A Montgomery cop had chased the killer on foot for a quarter \nof a mile before he got away (a blue car had pulled out and suddenly \ncut off the policeman). The case was languishing, unsolved. Could the \nmissing Alabama killer turn out to be the Washington sniper? It \nsounded so farfetched and too good to be true, says Wilson. \nNonetheless, the Montgomery police turned over a stack of evidence \nfrom the shooting to the local FBI office. On Monday afternoon, a \nMontgomery-based FBI agent, Margaret Faulkner, flew to Washington \nwith the package.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most important piece in the pile, it turned out, was the \nfingerprints pulled off a copy of a gun magazine, an ArmaLite \ncatalog, apparently dropped near the scene of the liquor-store \nkilling. No match had been found in state records. But the \nfingerprints had never been entered into the federal database \n(Alabama does not belong to the service that provides it). On Monday \nnight, task-force investigators searched for a matchand found one. \nThe fingerprints belonged to one Lee Malvo, a juvenile who was facing \nillegal immigration charges in the small town of Bellingham, Wash. He \nhad been reported to the INS after police were called in to deal with \na dispute involving the boys mother and another man. That mans \nname, it appeared, was John Muhammad. Investigators finally had a \nname; in fact, two names.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe task force was finally beginning to get somewhere. But there was \nno eureka moment, say investigators. News of the fingerprint match \nwas not widely shared, and many investigators learned of the \nbreakthrough only from water-cooler gossip. Communication between \nlocals and Feds and rival agencies like the ATF and FBI was erratic. \nIf anything, the gumshoes seemed to be stumbling in the dark. The \nmissed phone calls from the sniper (which the press had found out \nabout) were an embarrassment, however understandable under the \nstressed circumstances. Because they wanted to be meticulous about \nhandling and preserving evidence, ever so carefully fingerprinting \nand tagging the plastic sandwich bag tacked to the tree and its \ncontents, investigators had not read the snipers letter until Sunday \nmorningafter the 6 a.m. time set in the letter for the phone call \nfrom the sniper. That is why Chief Moose abruptly went before the \ncameras on Sunday night to deliver a cryptic message: To the person \nwho left us a message at the Ponderosa last night, you gave us a \ntelephone number. We do want to talk to you. Call us at the number \nyou provided.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Monday morning, the shooter called police again. But when the cops \ntraced the call to a phone booth in Richmond, Va., they caught the \nwrong men: two illegal \nimmigraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaypaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.hiaqcqjjhpdaaai1eaijeitcjt.ebktxaaaay0caezjrek'haaaa \nwho just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. One was \ndriving a white van. A beleaguered Chief Moose was forced to deliver \nmore mysterious messages: We are going to respond to a message that \nwe have received. We will respond later. We are preparing that \nresponse at this time, the chief announced. Later that afternoon, he \nbegged the callers to try again. The audio was unclear, he said, \nand we want to get it right.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe snipers delivered their response at 5:57 the next morning, \nTuesday, Oct. 22. A Montgomery County bus driver was fatally shot as \nhe stood in the vehicles lit, open doorway, taking a break before \nbeginning his morning run. In the woods, investigators found another \nletteragain insisting that money be deposited in the bankcard \naccount and threatening the lives of children. (Once again, the \ninvestigators read the letter too late to take a scheduled phone call \nfrom the snipers.) The snipers demanded that the authorities respond \nnot just with money but also by repeating what appeared to be a \ncheeky taunt: We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose. The \nduck reference is from a folk tale in which a boastful rabbit tries \nto catch a duck in a nooseonly to have the duck fly away, dragging \nthe rabbit, then dropping him inside a tree stump, where the rabbit \nis trapped.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the average TV viewer, the investigators were beginning to look \nlike cornered rabbits. But behind the scenes, the FBI thought they \nmight have found a clever ruse to catch the killers. The Feds \ndeposited $100,000 in the bank-card account, NEWSWEEK has learned. \nThe card had been stolen from a woman in Arizona, so the bureau had \nto go to the bank and ask it to reopen the account and increase the \ndaily withdrawal limit to $1,000. As it turned out, the trap was not \nsprung because the pair never got the chance to use the card. By \nWednesday, the noose was beginning to tighten around the ducks neck \nin a chokehold that would permit no escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Washington state, the feds were learning some very interesting \ninformation about 17-year-old John Lee Malvo and his older friend \nJohn Muhammad, 41. The two, who lived together for a time at a \nhomeless shelter, seemed to have a curious bond. Muhammad referred to \nMalvo as his stepson, but he was not. At one point, the gumshoes \nlearned, the duo had stayed in Tacoma with Robert Edward Holmes, an \nold Army buddy of Muhammads. Holmes told investigators that Muhammad \nhad appeared in the spring of 2002 toting an AR-15, a semiautomatic \nassault rifle that shoots a .223 round. The gun had a telescopic \nsight, and Muhammad concealed it in an aluminum case. Can you \nimagine the damage you could do if you could shoot with a silencer? \nMuhammad had exclaimed, according to Holmes. Neighbors had heard \nshooting with a high-powered rifle in the backyard. On Wednesday \nmorning, federal investigators began combing the yard with a metal \ndetector, looking for shell casings.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack at task-force headquarters, the sniper investigation was turning \nup a lead that was at once embarrassing and promising. The Feds ran a \ncheck on Muhammads license and found, to their astonishment, that he \nhad been discovered by Baltimore police asleep in his car on the \nnight of Oct. 8, about a half-hours drive from the scene of the \nshooting the day before at Tasker Middle School in Bowie, Md. The \nBaltimore cops had run a check on the cara blue 1990 Chevy \nCapriceand found nothing amiss. Muhammad had been allowed to go \nabout his business.\u0014\nMoving quickly now, police traced the registration on the car to \nCamden, N.J. It turned out that Muhammad had bought the battered \nclunker with roughly 150,000 miles on it for $250 from the Sure Shot \nAuto Shop in Camden. (The cars last use: as an undercover vehicle by \nthe cops.) Last week federal agents arrested Nathaniel Osbourne, 26, \nin Flint, Mich. Osbourne was listed as co-owner of the car with \nMuhammad. Held as a material witness, he is not a suspect in the \nshootings, but an FBI spokesman said, We believe he has valuable \ninformation about the sniper case.\u0014\n\u0014\nNOTE: SEE \"DESCENT INTO EVIL, PART 2\"\u0014",

    "words": "Remarkably, law-enforcement sources tell NEWSWEEK, some investigators \ncontinued to cling to the belief that the sniper or snipers were \ndriving a white van or truck. Like the talking heads on TV, they had \nconvinced themselves that the snipers must be white men driving a \nwhite truck. They had trouble accepting that they should have been \nlooking for two black men driving a blue car. They were fixated on \ncars fleeing the scene. It does not seem to have really occurred to \nthem that the shooters would hang aroundas they almost surely did. \nAs it turned out, a witness had reported seeing a Caprice driving \nslowly with its lights off near the scene of the Oct. 3 shooting in \nnortheast D.C. But in the dark, the witness remembered the cars \ncolor as burgundy, not blue, and the lead was lost in the chatter \nover white vehicles. A witness outside the Fredericksburg, Va., \nMichaels craft store, scene of a shooting on Oct. 4, reported a \ndark-colored vehicle with New Jersey tags leaving the scene. A \nwoman calling the tip line on Oct. 7 said she had spotted a black man \ncrouching beneath the dashboard in a dark Chevy Caprice. The woman \nwas struck by the intensity of the mans stare. The agent on the tip \nline brushed her off. Were looking for a white truck, she said.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, by Wednesday night, Muhammad and Malvo were at the top of \nthe list of suspects, Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan \ntold NEWSWEEK. Wednesday, it kept going back and forth, he said. \nDoubts remained. The investigators had been burned by false leads \nbefore. I expected calls on at least three other days telling me We \ngot himand they turned out not to be the ones, said Duncan. There \nwas still the question of how to run down the suspects. SWAT and HRT \nteams were looking through cheap hotels. D.C. cops were patrolling \nwith the Caprices New Jersey license-plate number written on Post-It \nnotes stuck on their dashboards. The investigators hotly debated \nwhether to release the suspects photographs. Some feared that would \nonly tip them off and make them flee. Or worse, provoke them to \nstrike again. Others feared the suspects would be found first by \nvigilantes. The concern was that, God forbid, its not the people \n[the real snipers] and someone takes matters into their own hands, \nsaid Duncan. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe debate raged until almost midnight, when Moose finally emerged to \ntell reporters that police were on the lookout for Muhammad and \nMalvo. The investigators did not release the description of the blue \n1990 Chevy Caprice or its New Jersey license-plate number, NDA21Z. \nBut reporters with police scanners had already heard the identifying \ninformation being relayed to patrol officers in their cruisers.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was that fortuitous leak that led to the snipers arrest. At a \nrest stop off I-70, near the Pennsylvania border, a truckdriver, \nRonald Lantz, was listening to his favorite program, Truckin Bozo \nRadio Show, out of WLW-AM in Cincinnati, when he heard the host \nbroadcast a description of the blue Caprice. Lantz looked out his \nwindow, and there it was. He immediately called 911. It was 12:54 \na.m. At just about the same time, the rest-stop custodian, Larry \nBlank, was hunkered down in a white van with another man who had \nspotted the blue Caprice. They, too, dialed 911. After the first \npolice arrived, Lantz and another trucker blocked the rest-stop exits \nuntil the SWAT teams came storming in, some two hours later. \u0014\nTop officials on the sniper task force could hardly believe that the \nordeal was over. When he awoke Thursday morning, the first question \nthat popped into County Executive Duncans head was: Has anyone \ngotten shot? By evening, the state and local law-enforcement chiefs \nand top federal officials jammed into Chief Mooses office. No one \nwanted to declare victory until the ATF had made a match between the \ngun found in the cara Bushmaster XM-15and the bullet fragments \nextracted from 11 of the snipers victims. They waited and waited, \nuntil ATF Special Agent Joe Riehl finally walked into Mooses office \nat about 8 p.m. and shut the door. Outside, lower-level investigators \nlistened anxiously for some sign. There was silence. Then, at last, \nthe sound of clapping. Moose emerged, looking stern as usual. Duncan \nteased him, Can you smile now? The chief looked up and a huge grin \nspread across his face.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suspects were whisked away to an undisclosed location and \nplaced in separate interrogation rooms. When prosecutors stepped out \nfor a moment and left Malvo alone, he tried to escape. He somehow \nbroke the table leg to which he had been handcuffed and started \nclimbing up through the ceiling tiles. Pulled back down, he soiled \nhimself, and had to be given a new prisoners jumpsuit. \u0014\nThe spirit of good cheer on the sniper task force lasted less than a \nday. By Friday, state and federal prosecutors were bitterly vying for \nthe chance to prosecute Muhammad and Malvo. A meeting between the \nvarious agencies and jurisdictions broke down in acrimony. When FBI \nagents were called on their cell phones and ordered to take the \nsuspects from the interrogation room, task-force cops and prosecutors \nexploded in anger. Malvo had sat in stony silence, but Muhammad was \nbeginning to answer a few questions. Hoping that he would warm up and \nbegin to spill, agents and officials crowded around closed-circuit \nmonitors to watch the questioning. The Feds insisted that the \nsuspects had to be taken before a federal magistrate and formally \ncharged with a federal crimeor risk having the case thrown out for \nan illegal arrest. But local officials blamed Thomas Dibiagio, the \nU.S. Attorney in Baltimore, for hogging the limelight and ruining any \nchance of getting the suspects to talk before they were silenced by \ndefense lawyers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe may never know why they [Muhammad and Malvo] did what they did \nbecause of what Dibiagio did, said an angry local official. \nMontgomery County States Attorney Douglas Gansler went ahead and \ncharged the two men with six counts of murder in Maryland. Virginia \nofficials also say they are eager to try the men for murder, and the \nauthorities in Montgomery, Ala., also filed homicide charges. It is \nunclear how the legal wrangling will sort itself out. If the Feds \ncharge Muhammad with extortion that results in murder (the demand for \n$10 million, or else), he could get the death penalty. He could also \nbe executed under state law if the Maryland governor, as expected, \ngoes along. Minors generally escape capital punishment, though not in \nVirginia, and under some circumstance Malvo could be certified as \nan adult.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trials are sure to be media circuses. The cable-TV experts will \ncome back out to psychoanalyze the defendants, to make some sense out \nof what they did in the month of October 2002. The prosecutors will \ntry to make Muhammad coldly sane. He may be talking nonsense, but \nthat doesnt mean hes delusional, says one prosecutor involved in \nthe investigation. Psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor at \nNew York University School of Medicine and one of the few talking \nheads to get it right during the long sniper siege, cautions against \nexpecting clear-cut or rational answers. You have to suspend logic, \nshe says, when asked questions like why a Muslim killer would turn to \na Roman Catholic priest. We dont know what his underlying fantasy \nwas.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe do know what his overlying reality may have been. It stretched far \nbeyond the corpses and crime scenes and well beyond the Beltway. With \none rifle, an old car and a teenage disciple, authorities believe, he \nbrought terror to the nations capital. For almost three weeks, he \nkept schoolchildren in a state of lockdown, a term normally \nassociated with prisons. He forced high-school homecoming games to be \nplayed on undisclosed secure military bases. He made children run \nwhen they got off the school busnot to the playground, but for \ncover. He caused thousands of sad conversations between parents and \ntheir children, who were painfully learning to adapt to an age in \nwhich everyone, old and young, feels less safe than before. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis story was reported by Pat Wingert, Suzanne Smalley, T.

    "title": "DR. CLARENCE JORDAN, THE COTTON PATCH GOSPELS",
    "words": "Dr. Clarence Jordan, author of \"The Cotton Patch Versions...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBorn in the deep South in 1912, Dr. Clarence Jordan brought the \nScriptures to life with his modern day Southern translations of the \nNew Testament, his poignant sermons, and his inspired and insightful \ninterpretation of the Sermon on the Mount and what it means to \nChristians today.\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia Farms - Early Years\u0014\n\u0014\n In 1942 Clarence and Florence Jordan came to Sumter County, Georgia \nto live out the teachings of Jesus amid the poverty and racism of the \nrural South. Koinonia Farm was founded in Americus, Georgia, as a \npioneering interracial community where blacks and whites could live \nand work together in a spirit of partnership. Based on a radical call \nto discipleship, Koinonia Farm confronted racism, militarism, and \nmaterialism with a commitment to racial integration, pacifism, a \nsimplified lifestyle, sharing of possessions, and stewardship of the \nland and its resources.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe interracial community grew through the turbulent 1950's, as the \nJordans and their neighbors farmed together, ate meals, and attended \nBible studies and summer youth camps. Throughout the 1950s and early \n60s, Koinonia Farms withstood firebombs, bullets, KKK rallies, death \nthreats, property damage, excommunication from churches, Grand Jury \ninvestigations, and economic boycotts.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Patch translations\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 1940's, Jordan began to translate the New Testament into the \ncontemporary southern idiom. His translations not only contemporized \nthe language of scripture, but also transfered the events to the 20th \ncentury and the American South. After Jesus is born in Gainsville, \nGeorgia, Joe takes him across the border to Mexico to protect him \nfrom Governor Herod. In the book of Acts (\"The Happenings\"), Paul and \nBarney travel to New Orleans and beyond telling the story of Jesus. \nPaul addresses his epistles to churches in Atlanta, Memphis, and New \nOrleans.\u0014\n\u0014\nA scholar of the Bible and ancient languages, Dr. Jordan used \noriginal Greek manuscripts for his translations. By the time of his \ndeath in 1969, he had completed the the Sermon on the Mount, the \nGospels of Matthew and Luke, Acts, Paul's epistles, Hebrews, the \ngeneral epistles, and the first eight chapters of the Gospel of John.\u0014\n\u0014\nRich in humor and unsparing in their earthiness, Jordan's \ntranslations and lectures \"explode in our ears the mighty ideas which \ntransformed the early disciples and enabled them to turn their world \nupside down.\" (Dallas Lee, Introduction to The Cotton Patch Evidence)\u0014\n\u0014\nKoinonia Partners and Habitat for Humanity\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept that grew into Habitat for Humanity International was \nborn at Koinonia Farm. In 1965 Millard and Linda Fuller first visited \nKoinonia Farm, where they and Jordan later developed the concept of \n\"partnership housing\" -- where those in need of adequate shelter \nwould work side by side with volunteers to build simple, decent \nhouses.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1968, with Koinonia at a crossroads, Jordan received a brief note \nfrom Millard Fuller, \"What do you have up your sleeve?\" Koinonia Farm \nchanged its name to Koinonia Partners and launched several innovative \n\"partnership\" programs, including \"Partnership Housing\". Using \nvolunteer labor and donations, Koinonia built 194 homes from 1969 to \n1992\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence Jordan died in 1969, just before the first house was \ncompleted. The Fullers remained at the farm for several years and \nfounded Habitat for Humanity International in 1976 in Americus, \nGeorgia. To date, Habitat for Humanity volunteers and homeowners have \nbuilt more than 100,000 houses around the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nMembers of the Koinonia community still remember Clarence Jordan and \nhis commitment to radical discipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nClarence was speaking with a pastor once, and the pastor was \nbemoaning the fact that he couldn't get his deacons to give any more \nmoney for the janitor's salary. So Clarence asked, \"How many children \ndoes your janitor have? The minister replied, \"Eight.\" \"And how many \ndo you have?\" The minister responded, \"Four.\" Clarence continued, \"Do \nyou make more money than the janitor?\" \"Yes\" \"I can solve your \nproblem. You swap salaries with the janitor.\"\u0014",

    "title": "DOOMED CHURCHES",
    "words": "Doomed Churches\u0014\n\u0014\nSome years ago Robert D. Dale, professor of pastoral leadership and \nchurch ministries \u0014\nat Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary  wrote an article in the \nBaptist Program entitled, \"Is Your Church Doomed to Die?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis article listed some spiritually unhealthy churches.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe churches could be busy.\u0014\nThe churches could be going through the same motions \u0014\nas if it were spiritually healthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuppose your church had a sign in front of your church building \u0014\ndepicting the spiritual health of your church?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we can learn to recognize unhealthy churches, \u0014\nthen we should be more capable of building healthy ones.\u0014\n\u0014\nSee, if you recognize any of the churches that Robert Dale listed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Good Old Days Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis church is living in the past.\u0014\nThey resist change.\u0014\nThe glories of yesterday are preferred over the uncertainties of \ntoday and tomorrow.\u0014\nThey do not have the faith to risk.\u0014\nThis church would prefer the past.\u0014\nIn the past there was a defined church field.\u0014\nIn the past there was an entrenched power structure.\u0014\nIn the past there was a simple program.\u0014\nIn the present the character of the church is being challenged.\u0014\nWill the church reach out to surrounding communities?\u0014\nWill the church adjust its ministries to meet present needs -- and \nthose of newcomers?\u0014\nWill the church make room in its leadership for new leaders?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Stillborn Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis church was probably born out of hate or competition.\u0014\nThis church probably began as a result of a split or schism.\u0014\nThe climate of this church is probably negative.\u0014\nIt is easier to know what the congregation is against, than what it \nis for.\u0014\nIn his article Robert Dale told of two neighboring pastors.\u0014\nThey were leaders of congregations split out of each other.\u0014\nThe pastors discovered a sure way to motivate their members.\u0014\nAll they had to do was make a comparison of their church \u0014\nto the nearby \"enemy\" congregation.\u0014\nA \"Catch Calvary\" campaign or an \"Eradicate Emmanuel\" effort \u0014\nwas guaranteed to ignite the old rivalries.\u0014\nOften a negative beginning for congregations \u0014\ncan tilt their motivations and ministries in negative directions for \nyears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Family Chapel Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe center aisle in a family Chapel serves as more \u0014\nthan a back-door-to-the-pulpit passageway.\u0014\nIt's serves also to divide the house into opposing sides -- into \"us\" \nand \"them\".\u0014\nWhen the family chapel is made up of two extended clans, \u0014\nblood ties are more often thicker than the Spirit.\u0014\nKinship may decide votes.\u0014\nOld battles, fought decades ago, may undermine the family chapel's \nministry.\u0014\nThere are many instances where the family cemetery \u0014\ndoes more to insure the congregation's existence than anything else.\u0014\nIf you would like to see how crucial a cemetery is to some family \nchapels, \u0014\nannounce two workdays.\u0014\nAnnounce one workday for a general spring-cleaning for the church \nbuilding.\u0014\nAnnounce the other workday for a \nlEt's-get-the-cemetery-ready-for-memorial day effort.\u0014\nSee which workday would get the most support.\u0014\n\u0014\nDip 'n Drap Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome congregations baptize a lot of people.\u0014\nBut yet, they may grow very little.\u0014\nPeople are saved, but the church doesn't grow.\u0014\nWhen instant maturity is expected to follow instant birth \nautomatically, immaturity results.\u0014\nAny church with a dip'em and drap'em approach to evangelism \u0014\neventually suffers from the liabilities of immaturity:\u0014\nchurch fusses, majoring on minor issues, susceptibility to false \ndoctrines, \u0014\nand marginal appreciation for ethics and applied Christianity.\u0014\nWhen salvation is considered only a point in time rather than a \nprocess through time, \u0014\npeople are apt to be evangelized , but not nurtured.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Doctrinal Specialty Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvery congregation must know what it believes and practices.\u0014\nBut if a church's complete confession of faith can be summed up \nliterally on its church sign, \u0014\nit isn't taking advantage of all the richness of the gospel.\u0014\nA balanced doctrinal diet means all preaching and teaching emphasis \u0014\nisn't focused on one pet belief -- even if it is an important \nessential of faith. \u0014\nA good example is where only the Holy Spirit is stressed and the \nFather and Son are not.\u0014\nWhen a church goes to seed on a favorite doctrine,\u0014\na lopsidedness occurs which makes balance growth difficult.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Serve-Us Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome congregations act as if they exist for only themselves.\u0014\nThey have the same attitude as this self-centered prayer: \u0014\n\"Bless me and my wife,\u0014\nMy son, John, and his wife,\u0014\nWe four,\u0014\nNo more!\"\u0014\nServe-us congregations have the convenience store mentality.\u0014\nThey serve up fast faith like fast food.\u0014\nService and ministry beyond the local membership are almost \ncompletely ignored.\u0014\nThe serve-us church often keeps most of its offerings \u0014\ninside the congregation for the use of its members.\u0014\nMissions and outreach are not stressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo Growth Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis church takes pride in stressing fellowship \u0014\nto the almost complete neglect of evangelism.\u0014\nDale related of leading an evangelism workshop in a church of this \ntype.\u0014\nThe pastors said, \"You'd have to talk about 'sharing' faith. \u0014\n'Witnessing' is too strong a word for our church.\"\u0014\nThere have been religious groups to have an anti-evangelism stance.\u0014\nOne sect even outlawed evangelism and marriage.\u0014\nAfter one generation, they realized what is always true for \nChristendom:\u0014\nwe are only one generation away from extinction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Widow Maker Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong ago when ships were sailing the ocean, \u0014\nsome vessels gained the reputation as being jinxed.\u0014\nAs this reputation spread, crews were almost impossible to find.\u0014\nWhen the owners had recovered their investment, \u0014\nthe \"widow makers\" were deliberately wrecked.\u0014\nThese ships were believed to be too dangerous for man.\u0014\nThere are some churches that acquire the reputation of widow makers.\u0014\nThey fire or abuse pastor after pastor.\u0014\nCertainly not all pastoral firings are the fault of the congregation.\u0014\nBut when a church has fired four or five consecutive pastors  \u0014\ncould not it be seen as a widow maker?\u0014\n\u0014\nTerrorist Tactics Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome congregations are intimidated by terrorizing members.\u0014\nChurch terrorists start rumors, are outspoken debaters, and play \npolitics.\u0014\nThese power brokers filter every decision and create a fuss \u0014\nwhenever some action they dislike is under consideration.\u0014\nThey use blackmail in its various guises  \u0014\nmoney given to or withheld from the church budget, \u0014\ndesignating gifts to pet projects, \u0014\njob security threatened by community employers, \u0014\nwho are also church leaders, \u0014\nor neurotic needs for recognition or power  \u0014\nis a favorite ploy of religious terrorists.\u0014\nPower and decision-making in the church are important issues.\u0014\nIn a deacon training conference a hundred deacons were asked \u0014\nif their congregations had deacon rotation plans.\u0014\nMany did, but a few reported deacon rotation had been ruled out \u0014\nbecause some deacons had thought that they would lose their status.\u0014\nOne deacon said proudly, \u0014\n\"We don't rotate deacons. We rotate pastors!\"\u0014\nThis statement has overtones of terrorism.\u0014\nIt also could put them in the widow maker church.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuperstar Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis church revolves around a central person, usually the pastor.\u0014\nThe direction of the member's attention \u0014\nis so finely focused that a personality cult often results.\u0014\nThe superstar church may be \"on\" television.\u0014\nPeople may join these congregations to draw their identity \u0014\nfrom a distance relationship with the superstar.\u0014\nThe superstar church gets a lot of denominational attention.\u0014\nIt provides a model for others to imitate.\u0014\nBut when the superstar leaves, the church may lose its momentum.\u0014\nOften, the superstar assumes so much spotlight and responsibility \u0014\nthat the members may remain passive and untrained.\u0014\nRemember, even small churches can have a superstar.\u0014\n\u0014\nSmorgasbord Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany churches attempt to provide something for everyone.\u0014\nThey try to be all things to all persons, \u0014\nwhether they have the resources and opportunities or not.\u0014\nThese churches play follow-the-leader with their programs.\u0014\nIf another area church develops a program, \u0014\nthe Smorgasbord Church feels an obligation to begin that program also.\u0014\n\"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is the style of the Smorgasbord Church.\u0014\nCongregations can have a \"franchised faith\" approach.\u0014\nWhich is to say, just like every McDonald's restaurant, they are \nessentially alike. \u0014\nTwo results are likely.\u0014\nFirst, a one-size-fits-all attitude to ministry will miss at least as \nmany people as it reaches.\u0014\nSecond, trying to provide too wide a range of programs \u0014\nmay stretch their resources to where very little is done well.\u0014\n\u0014\nBermuda Triangle Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople disappear in the Bermuda triangle -- this is the superstition.\u0014\nSome church members disappear into the innards of their church \u0014\nnever to be seen again.\u0014\nThey become inactive church members \u0014\nbecause their heart loyalties probably lie somewhere else.\u0014\nIn our churches more than one in every four are considered inactive.\u0014\nThat is a lot of unincorporated or displaced manpower.\u0014\nThis problem is evident in the largest and the smallest churches.\u0014\nThis problem occurs in the highly mobile military or university \nchurch \u0014\nto the old established First Church or a changing neighborhood \ncongregation.\u0014\nWhen new members are not assimilated and longtime members aren't \nencouraged, \u0014\ninactivity is a likely consequence.\u0014\nInactives can be counted for bragging purposes, \u0014\nbut they can't be counted on for daily ministry to others.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs we see the specific contrast between healthy and unhealthy \ncongregations, \u0014\nlet us determine by the help of God to lead our congregations to be \nspiritually healthy.\u0014\n\u0014\nHealthy congregations honor God!\u0014",

Rather, she \ndrew back and stood away from him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Preston, I've done a terrible thing.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe looked at her in silence.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I'm remarried.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFor several minutes Taylor stared silentl out over the harbor, \noblivious to the joyous e am around them.

They drove across town to a restaurant, and he took \nher hand as she slipped through the door.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow little she has changed, he thought, looking at her angular nose \nand beautiful pale skin.

    "title": "DEATH ROW NUMBERS DECLIE AS CHALLENGES RISE",
    "words": "January 11, 2003, New York Times\u0014\nDeath Row Numbers Decline as Challenges to System Rise\u0014\nBy ADAM LIPTAK\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the first time in a generation, the number of inmates on death \nrow has dropped. And the number of new death row inmates in 2001, the \nmost recent year for which comprehensive data is available, was the \nlowest since 1973.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite enduring and strong popular support for the death penalty, \nthese numbers suggest that those directly involved in the justice \nsystem have serious concerns about the way capital punishment is \ncarried out.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nationwide drop in the number of death sentences is the product \nof several phenomena, including a lower murder rate. But legal \nexperts across the political spectrum agreed that public discomfort \nwith the administration of the system has played a significant role. \nScores of exonerations based on DNA and other compelling evidence, \nrecurring disclosures about sloppy or abusive police work and \nconcerns about racial bias have damaged public confidence.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Justice Harry A. Blackmun once called the machinery of death, \nthese experts say, is no longer considered terribly effective at \ndelivering either justice or death by many of the people most \ndirectly involved in its operation.\u0014\n\u0014\nYesterday, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois pardoned four death row \ninmates who he said were wrongfully convicted. And today, Mr. Ryan is \nexpected to commute the death sentences of many, and possibly all, of \nthe state's death row inmates, about 150, after a review prompted by \nthe exoneration of 13 people who had faced death sentences. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"We're in a period of national reconsideration,\" said Austin D. \nSarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College \nand the author of \"When the State Kills: Capital Punishment and the \nAmerican Condition\" (Princeton University Press, 2001). \u0014\n\u0014\n\"People are asking if the death penalty is compatible with values \nwhich in the American mainstream are taken seriously: equal \nprotection, due process, protection of the innocent,\" Professor Sarat \nsaid. \"What was played out in Illinois will be played out across the \nnation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe number of people on death row had increased consistently and \nseemingly inexorably for decades. In 2001, though, according to \nJustice Department statistics released last month, that number, now \naround 3,600, dropped for the first time since 1976.\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernor Ryan's actions alone make it all but certain that the number \nwill drop further. Recent decisions of the United States Supreme \nCourt will also drive down the number of people on death row, legal \nexperts said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Illinois, more death row inmates were exonerated than executed in \nrecent decades. And though the cost of capital trials and appeals can \napproach $2 million per conviction, only 749 of the 6,754 prisoners \non death row nationwide since 1977, or about 11 percent, had been \nexecuted by the end of 2001. Many more left death row as a result of \nappeals court decisions, commutations and death from natural causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven supporters of capital punishment say the declining number of \npeople sentenced to death represents more careful application of the \ndeath penalty, though some attribute it to continuing refinements in \nthe justice system rather than a direct reaction to the number of \npeople who have been exonerated.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's the product of prosecutors and jurors being more \ndiscriminating,\" said Joshua\u0014",

    "title": "DID MARTIN LUTHER GET GALILEO IN TROUBLE?",
    "words": "Did \nMartin Luther Get Galileo In Trouble?\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Lindberg talks about the early relationship between science and \nfaith and his own journey on the subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhenever argument breaks out over science and religion, those who \nemphasize tension between the two almost inevitably turn to the story \nof Galileo and the Roman Catholic Church. But David Lindberg, \nprofessor emeritus in the history of science at the University of \nWisconsin, says that people may not know the real storyand that this \nmay be partly responsible for misconceptions about the relationship \nbetween faith and science.\u0014\n\u0014\nLindberg is the author of The Beginnings of Western Science. With \nRonald L. Numbers, he is the coeditor of God and Nature, the \nforthcoming eight-volume Cambridge History of Science, and \nBattlefields of Science and Christianity Revisited: From Augustine to \nIntelligent Design.\u0014\n\u0014\nIs Galileo's story a good example of the relationship between science \nand religion?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Galileo case has been taken as symbolic of the relationship \nbetween science and the church. But it wasn't. In fact, the Galileo \ncase was exceptional.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians have grown up with the idea that there was this \nterrible encounter in which the oppressive church stamped out \nscience. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere is another view circulating within the Christian community. \nNamely, that Christianity provided fundamental assumptions without \nwhich modern science could never have occurred. This notion is that \nthe human intellect was designed to be able to comprehend this nature \nthat God had created. \u0014\n\u0014\nI think both ideas are equally false and misleading.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe relationship between science and Christianity goes back to the \nbeginning. The early church fathers found the Greek classical \ntradition, including Greek science, dangerous in a number of \nrespects. It contradicts Scripture at a number of points, so there \nwere skirmishes that continued through the Middle Ages.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt this time, there was a strong scientific movement at the \ncenterpiece of the medieval university education. There were several \noccasions when scientific tradition and Christian theology attempted \nto occupy the same intellectual ground, and there was conflict.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was also competition in addressing the same issue with \ndifferent answers. These participants prefer peace to warfare, so \nthey looked for means of accommodation and compromise, and they found \nthem. In general, they found those means in either reconsidering \ntheir scientific view or reinterpreting the Bible. So, actually, a \npeaceful coexistence was worked out by these medieval scholars.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd they supported the idea that the sun revolves around the Earth?\u0014\n\u0014\nFundamental to the educational system of Europe was a description of \nthe way the universe was arranged. This cosmology placed the Earth at \nthe centerand the earth was a sphere. That was the view of \nAristotle. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1543 Copernicus, who was not a Catholic priest as is often \nmaintained, encountered an ancient idea of a heliocentric universe. \nHe looks at this carefully and finds certain advantages in it. \u0014\n\u0014\nCopernicus argues that the sun is, in fact, in the center and the \nEarth is a planet orbiting around it. Copernicus published that \ntheory in 1543 but it was not widely accepted.\u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo was learned in astronomical matters, but not a particularly \ngood mathematician. There were two reasons he joined the fray over \nheliocentricism. One was the quest for patronage. Second, I also \nthink the arguments that Copernicus had presented influenced him \nconsiderably.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat was happening within the church at this time?\u0014\nBefore Galileo came along, you could hold any view you wanted on a \ncosmological issue. Nothing could be less significant than that \nbecause the church had big problems. That was the tiniest of the tiny \nproblems. The church had just lost half of Europe through the \nProtestant Reformation. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis led to a change in the Catholic Church. The church made a rapid \nmove towards a centralized authoritarian governmentan organization \nwith the literal interpretation of Scripture as an important emphasis.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did the church respond to Galileo's theory?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a committee established called the Holy Office, which had \nthe responsibility to determine the truth in matters of faith. \nCharges were leveled against Galileo, and so the heliocentric \nquestion came before them. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't know much about what went on in their considerations. But \nit's important to look at the whole picture. And one part of that \npicture is that the scientific community is overwhelmingly opposed to \nGalileo. That is, the evidence that Galileo has is not particularly \npowerful. It's not overpowering. He was looked on as a crackpot by \nlots of scientists.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we combine this picture with the authority of the Catholic Church \nto interpret the Bibleand their new attention to literal \ninterpretationit's just clear what the answer is going to be. \nThey're not going to violate their own hermeneutic exegetical \nstandards in order to adopt this crackpot minority opinion of the \nscientific community.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo then he goes before a papal court. It wasn't his science that was \non trial, though. What was he tried for? \u0014\n\u0014\nObedience was the only issue in the trial. And he was guilty. \nEverybody could tell he was guilty because Galileo doesn't just \ndiscuss the pros and cons of the theory, he just advocates all the \nway. It was a blunder on Galileo's part. \u0014\n\u0014\nGalileo then recants. Why?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe had two choices. There was the threat of imprisonment or he could \nrecant. Everybody knew it was a formality, so he didn't cost his \ncause anything to recant.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did the theory of the sun as the center of the universe finally \nget accepted by the church?\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce Newton's theory of gravitation came along, you had overwhelming \narguments in favor of heliocentrism. The church says, \"Okay, now \nwe've got proof, so now we will reinterpret the Bible.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of the 17th century, the church was on board, though \nCopernicus's book stayed on the index of prohibited books until 1835. \nThis geocentric model remained an albatross around the Catholic \nChurch's neck.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow did this become an area of focus for you?\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion has been part of my life since I was born. I grew up in an \nintensely religious evangelical home. My father and both grandfathers \nwere members of the clergy.\u0014\n\u0014\nI went to Wheaton College, where I majored in physics. I then went on \nas a graduate student in physics at Northwestern University. But as I \nproceeded with my education, I became disillusioned with physics when \nit ceased to deal with the world that I could see and feel. It became \nabstract mathematics.\u0014\n\u0014\nI encountered history of science at that point, and went back to \ngraduate school. I became a historian of medieval and early modern \nscience. But in the early 1980s a colleague approached me about \norganizing a conference on science and religion. This was not a topic \nI had really worked with, but it struck a chord because of my own \nreligious background. The conference led to a book, God and Nature. \nReally, I've now spent the last 20 years mainly thinking about the \nhistorical relations of science and religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do you reconcile the struggle between religion and science?\u0014\n\u0014\nI follow St. Augustine on the issue. Augustine says in one of his \nworks that if you want to know astronomy, do not go to the Bible. \nFind yourself an astronomer. It seems to me that is the kind of \nattitude we're just going to have to take.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis notion that the scientist leaves his culture and all of his \nother beliefs at the door of the laboratory when he goes in is just \nsilly. It's scientific propaganda, but it's not true. All of us have \na large, complicated belief system, which is there to influence \nwhenever it's relevant.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

    "title": "DIETRICH BONHOEFFER AND THE IRAQI CRISIS",
    "words": "DIETRICH BONHOEFFER AND THE IRAQI CRISIS\u0014\n\u0014\nI've been involved for the past twenty years with the life of the \nGerman\u0014\npastor, theologian and martyr, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. My introduction to\u0014\nthe life and writings of Bonhoeffer began through the influence of \nProfessor\u0014\nHarvey Cox in 1983 during my year of study at Harvard Divinity School \nas\u0014\na Charles E. Merrill Fellow and Master of Theology degree candidate. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis young German pastor and theologian was executed by the Nazis on \nApril 9,\u0014\n1945, at the Flossenburg concentration camp for his part in the\u0014\nconspiracy against Adolf Hitler. I am convinced that Dietrich \nBonhoeffer's life and\u0014\nlegacy have particular relevance for the decisions we are making as a\u0014\nnation regarding the possible pre-emptive attack on the nation of \nIraq.\u0014\nIn Germany in the 1930's and 40's, there was no lack of religious\u0014\nsupport for Adolf Hitler and his policies. As history bears witness, \nGermany's\u0014\nnationalism and the Nazi ideology were aided and abetted by the\u0014\nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastors and churches swept up in the nationalistic fervor draped their\u0014\nsanctuaries and their buildings with the swastika. It was common for \nthe\u0014\nliturgies of the churches to utilize troops carrying swastikas down \nthe\u0014\naisles of the churches as part of worship. We Americans may be \nrepelled\u0014\nat such a nationalistic demonstration within the context of the \nchurch's\u0014\nworship; however, the patriotic demonstrations that we have observed\u0014\ntaking place within American churches during the past year are no less\u0014\ndisturbing. Without noticing it, a number of pastors and churches have\u0014\nallowed the symbols of the flag and the cross to become intertwined \nand\u0014\nindistinguishable.\u0014\n\u0014\nDietrich Bonhoeffer rightly called this an idolatry and he based that\u0014\nprophetic view upon the first commandment, \"thou shalt have no other\u0014\ngods before me.\" His view was that the State was attempting the usurp \nthe\u0014\nplace of God by equating the purposes of the State with the purposes \nof God.\u0014\nOne of Bonhoeffer's concepts that has particular relevance for \nChristians in\u0014\nthe United States is his belief that no nation can claim ultimate \nallegiance for any Christian. \u0014\nA Christian's highest and final allegiance, according to Bonhoeffer, \nis to\u0014\nGod and God alone. This would mean that if the State launches into\u0014\nactions which are deemed immoral by a Christian, the person of faith \nis bound\u0014\nand obligated to disobey the State. Bonhoeffer would go even further,\u0014\nespecially judging by his actions within the resistance, to support\u0014\nactions which impede the immoral and unjust actions of the \ngovernment. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe noted Jewish theologian and post-Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg\u0014\ncoined the phrase, \"Perpetrators, Victims and Bystanders\", which \nbecame the\u0014\ntitle of his outstanding book on the Holocaust. Hilberg notes that in \nGerman\u0014\nsociety during the years of the Third Reich, every person in Germany\u0014\nfell under one of those classifications. The particularly \ndiscomforting label\u0014\nfor American Christians should be the identity of the \"bystanders.\"\u0014\nThese were the \"good\" people who said and did nothing to avert the \npolicies of\u0014\nwar and hate perpetrated by the Nazis. Eli Wiesel, the noted Holocaust\u0014\nsurvivor and author, stated that \"silence is the friend of the \nperpetrator.\" Bonhoeffer\u0014\nsaid that the \"church has been guilty of silence while evil was \ntaking place.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nPastor Bonhoeffer was convinced that if one called oneself a follower \nof\u0014\nChrist then that person was bound by the concept of responsibility for\u0014\nthose who became victims of an oppressive state. To be a follower of\u0014\nChrist meant to act with courage and faith in opposing the forces of\u0014\ninjustice and violence. Who will be the victims in an attack on Iraq? \nA\u0014\npre-emptive attack against the citizens of a nation that has not\u0014\nprovoked that attack through any aggressive action would clearly be \nseen as\u0014\nvictims. Whatever we may think, the world will view the Iraqis as\u0014\nvictims just as the Polish were seen as victims of the German army's \nattack on\u0014\nPoland in 1939. The United States will be the perpetrators. And who \nare\u0014\nthe bystanders? This group will include the millions of Americans who\u0014\ncould not be bothered to speak their views against the attack on Iraq.\u0014\nBonhoeffer would say then that all of these people, moral as they may\u0014\nappear, are none the less complicit in the guilt of the senseless and\u0014\nneedless deaths of innocent people in Iraq, not to mention the lives \nof\u0014\nour own troops.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce again, the legacy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer reminds me that for a\u0014\nChristian, there must always be a clear distinction between one's\u0014\nallegiance to the State and one's allegiance to God. I am alarmed by \nthe\u0014\ncapitulation of so many public Christian leaders and pastors to this\u0014\ndecision by President Bush to attack the nation of Iraq. I am equally\u0014\nalarmed and dismayed at the apparent lack of moral courage on the part\u0014\nof millions of Americans who seem to be voiceless in this debate. The\u0014\nparallels to Hitler's Germany are abundantly clear. Labeling ourselves\u0014\nas a Christian nation gives us no special privilege to make war at \nwill. If\u0014\nanything, God and the world will hold us much more responsible for our\u0014\nwillful ignorance, our national arrogance and our despicable deeds\u0014\nshould we go to war. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's legacy reminds us, \nespecially the\u0014\nmany Christians in our nation, that we have a \"Response-Ability\" to do\u0014\neverything we can to prevent this attack on an independent nation that\u0014\nposes no immediate threat to us. As a Vietnam-era veteran and a \nBaptist\u0014\nminister, I will continue to speak, work and pray against our nation's\u0014\ngrossly unjust policy of resorting to war for reasons that smell of \ncatering to \u0014\nour lust for oil and our lust for world dominance. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTHE NEXT REICH?\u0014\n\u0014\nLike civilizations past,\u0014\nWe suffered from our delusion\u0014\nThat we were the chosen,\u0014\nThat we were the last word as regards Truth.\u0014\nOur wealth and our strength\u0014\nOnly confirmed the rightness of our cause.\u0014\nAnd body bags are flown to a faraway place\u0014\nTo bring our children and our grandchildren home\u0014\nAfter our cause\u0014\nAnd our enemies are executed.\u0014\nAnd the bodies of women, children and old men\u0014\nLay scattered on the landscape of a foreign land.\u0014\nBut we will have no camera to record \u0014\nThe results of our wanton murder,\u0014\nSo few back home will know.\u0014\nFew will be troubled.\u0014\nWe will continue to live our lives as before,\u0014\nDrinking deep from the wells\u0014\nOf the world's oil\u0014\nTo satisfy our insatiable and expensive tastes.\u0014\nAnd we will go to our churches on Sunday\u0014\nAnd sing \"God Bless America.\"\u0014\nBut can God hear the strains of our idolatrous chorus\u0014\nWhen the armies of our nation commit murder\u0014\nUnder the orders of our emperor\u0014\nWho, the world knows, is wearing no clothes?\u0014\nAnd Silence has taken hold of the tongues\u0014\nOf this nation's so-called \"prophets.\"\u0014\nFor they are afraid to offend those who \u0014\nSupply their gold.\u0014\nThey are afraid not to hold high the flag,\u0014\nOur flag which, for much of the world,\u0014\nResembles a twisted cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nAl Staggs\u0014\n7204 Spring Oak Drive\u0014\nNorth Richland Hills, Texas 76180\u0014\n(817) 577-4334\u0014",

    "title": "DON'T BAN CLONING ONE EDITOR SAYS",
    "words": "Mar 31, 2003 Richmond Times Dispatch\u0014\n\u0014\nDon't Ban Cloning\u0014\n\u0014\nThe House of Representatives took a wayward step when it voted to ban \nhuman cloning of all kinds. No one except the Raelians and other \nnuthouse fugitives disputes the immorality of reproductive cloning - \ni.e., growing replicas of individuals. But cloning for research \npurposes holds scientific promise, and while it does constitute a \nstep down a path fraught with ethical peril, by itself it does not \ncross the bounds of ethics.\u0014\n\u0014\nResearch cloning would involve creating genetically identical embryos \n(of about 150 cells each) for the purpose of harvesting their stem \ncells. Stem cells can become many different kinds of cells and \ntissues, and might hold the cure to diseases such as diabetes, \nParkinson's, and Alzheimer's. It remains an open question whether \nstem cells from cloned embryos have medical advantages over adult \nstem cells; the question cannot be answered without research.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe central ethical question concerns the status of the embryo: Is it \na person? Those who believe life begins at conception argue it is, \nbut their argument has flaws. First, life does not begin at \nconception because life is a continuum; conception joins a live egg \nand live sperm to create a separate live entity. So the question \nreally asks when individual personhood begins. Cloning opponents \nwould contend that a genetically distinct organism amounts to an \nindividual person, or potential person. But identical twins develop \nfrom the same zygote and have the same genetic composition - so if \nthe opponents are correct, then identical twins are one person, not \ntwo.\u0014\n\u0014\nFurther, if an embryo is the moral equivalent of a person, then \ndestroying excess embryos created through in vitro fertilization \nconstitutes premeditated murder just as, for pro-life absolutists, \nany abortion does. This newspaper does not believe either is murder. \nIf destroying an embryo does not constitute a crime against a person, \nthen it is hard to see how replicating embryos for research does.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, at some stage a developing embryo does become a person, \nwhich is why the cloning path is a treacherous one. No one would want \nto see scientists performing medical experiments on newborns, for \ninstance. Precisely when an organism begins to possess personhood is \na question that perhaps only faith can answer if science cannot; \npersonhood may be, like adulthood, a state that develops gradually \neven if the law pinpoints it arbitrarily. And just as one does not \nneed to know the precise moment when a child becomes an adult to say \nit happens after infancy, one does not need to know when a fetus \nbecomes a person to say it happens after the embryo stage.\u0014\n\u0014\nCloning - along with other emerging endeavors such as gene therapy \nand nanotechnology - will require science to walk a fine line. But \nwhen the potential rewards are great, pointing out that the path is \nnot wide open does not make a good argument for refusing to walk it \nat all. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis story can be found at: \nhttp://wWW.tImESDISpatch.com/editorials/mgb5a2ikxdd.html\u0014",

    "title": "DEBATING THE FAITH - MUSLIM VS. MUSLIM",
    "words": "Debating the Faith \u0014\n\u0014\nIn a controversial new book, a Muslim woman and a cleric\u0014\ndebate Islam's role in France's secular society\u0014\n\u0014\nBY NICHOLAS LE QUESNE/PARIS\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1985, the Sudanese government executed a theologian named\u0014\nMahmoud Muhammad Taha for daring to question the Koran. The\u0014\nsages at Al-Azhar University in Egypt had found Taha guilty of\u0014\napostasy for a thesis he developed in his book, The Second Mission of\u0014\nIslam. Taha argued that the Koran contains two categories of verses:\u0014\nthose that the prophet Muhammad recited in Mecca and those recited\u0014\nin Medina. For Taha, the Medina verses, with their emphasis on legal\u0014\nrules, were written in a historical context that no longer exists, so \nIslam\u0014\nshould instead focus on the spiritual and ethical message revealed in\u0014\nMecca. \u0014\n\u0014\nTaha's fate demonstrates how, in most\u0014\nMuslim countries, it remains all but\u0014\nimpossible to reinterpret for modern times\u0014\na text considered to be the literal word of\u0014\nGod. But in France, home to the largest\u0014\nIslamic community in Europe, an effort is\u0014\nin full swing to separate the eternal\u0014\nmessage of Islam from its medieval\u0014\ncultural baggage. \u0014\n\u0014\nSome of the fruits of that effort can be\u0014\nsampled in Loi d'Allah, Loi des Hommes\u0014\n(Law of Allah, Law of Men; Albin Michel)\u0014\nan extended dialogue in which Muslim\u0014\nsociologist Lela Babs and Tareq\u0014\nOubrou, rector of the Mosque de\u0014\nBordeaux, thrash out their often opposing\u0014\nviews on the roles of women and\u0014\nindividual freedom in Islam. Although\u0014\nnon-Muslim readers may be daunted by\u0014\nthe quotations and counter-quotations\u0014\nfrom hadiths (the reported sayings of the\u0014\nProphet) that fill so much of any Muslim\u0014\ntheological discussion, the book provides\u0014\na fascinating glimpse of how Islamic\u0014\ntraditions are faring in a modern, secular\u0014\nsociety. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe book reads like a series of e-mail\u0014\nexchanges, in which Babs and Oubrou\u0014\nput forward their own tightly-argued\u0014\npositions and then respond to each\u0014\nother's criticisms. One of the main strands\u0014\nof debate concerns the nature of the\u0014\nShari'a  Islam's prescriptions for human\u0014\nbehaviour. Babs sees Shari'a as a\u0014\nspiritual code of ethics appealing to each\u0014\nbeliever's individual conscience, not a\u0014\nstrict code of conduct to be enforced by\u0014\nan outside authority. Oubrou argues for a\u0014\nmore traditional interpretation, in which\u0014\nthe expert analysis of religious texts determines the way all \nbelievers should\u0014\nact. For Oubrou, free interpretation of the Koran could lead to \nnothing less\u0014\nthan the disappearance of recognizably Islamic values. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnother crucial exchange focuses on who is qualified to interpret the \nKoran\u0014\nand the hadiths. Babs dismisses the assertion that Sunni Islam has no\u0014\nclergy; although it has no centralized authority, she argues it does \nhave a\u0014\nprofessional category of scholars who control access to the sacred \ntexts. As\u0014\na believer, Babs claims the right to interpret the texts for \nherself. Oubrou\u0014\nrejects this, but does so using an interesting argument. He says it \nis precisely\u0014\nthis disregard for learned interpretation that has enabled terrorists \nto present\u0014\ntheir literal reading of certain Koranic verses as a justification \nfor their deeds.\u0014\n\"These people read the Koran every day,\" says Oubrou, \"and there's no\u0014\nshortage of passages calling for combat and war.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBabs and Oubrou end up agreeing to disagree. With her focus on\u0014\nindividuality and gender equality, Babs is a thoroughly modern \nMuslim. But\u0014\nOubrou accuses her of deforming Islam to fit in with Western values, \ninstead\u0014\nof seeking out the essential truth within Islam itself. Nonetheless, \nOubrou\u0014\nnever denies Babs' right to her opinion. Elsewhere  like Taha \nbefore her\u0014\n she could be facing the hangman's noose.\u0014",

    "title": "DERBY WINNER FUNNY CIDE ROMPS IN THE PREAKNESS",
    "words": "Funny Cide, a New York-bred gelding, came to Kentucky under the radar \nscreen, but he will return to the Empire State a star, winning the \nPreakness Stakes (gr. I) impressively Saturday and putting himself in \na position to win the Triple Crown.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Kentucky Derby (gr. I) winner and his connections -- owners \nSackatoga Stable, Tagg and Santos -- had to endure an unsettling \nsituation along the way. A week after the Derby, a story broke about \na suspicious photograph from the finish of the Run for the Roses, but \nan investigation cleared Santos after showing he clearly was not \nholding anything other than his whip during the race.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Barclay told me to try to save some ground ... then at the \nfive-eighths to give him some loose rein,\" said Santos. \"He just \nloped along and then I used my whip in case there was a camera or \nsomething. I didn't want him to get to looking around or something.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide was sent off the narrow favorite in the Preakness over \nPeace Rules -- who had run third in the Derby -- but it was no \ncontest, Funny Cide winning the Preakness by the second-largest \nmargin in the 128-year history of the middle jewel of the Triple \nCrown.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeace Rules broke sharply and took the lead, with Scrimshaw second, \nand Funny Cide a close third. Down the backside, with about 5  \nfurlongs to run in the 1 3/16 miles race, Peace Rules and Funny Cide \neased in front of the rest of the field. As they came through the \nturn, Santos tapped Funny Cide and he moved away from Peace Rules \nvery easily.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was merely a coronation down the stretch, Funny Cide moving away \nfrom the others in the field with every stride. Longshot Midway Road, \nunder Robby Albarado, came through on the rail for second. Scrimshaw \nran third and Peace Rules finished fourth.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlbarado said Midway Road \"ran an awesome race.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He got squeezed a little bit in the first part of the race, but he \nreally squared himself away quickly. He's a very athletic little \nhorse. He's still a little immature, though. You've got to be careful \nwith him going through those tight spots, but once he got through \nthere (on the rail), he was a game second.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTrainer Bobby Frankel had little to say about the performance of \nPeace Rules, the second choice in the field.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I have nothing to say,\" he said. \"What can I say? He just got beat. \nHe out-broke the field and he got beat. What else can I say?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide ran the distance over a Pimlico surface labeled good in \n1:55.61. He won by 9  lengths, second only to the 10-length margin \nof Survivor in the very first Preakness in 1873.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrado, who rode Peace Rules, said he could see it coming.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I knew I was in a little trouble when I saw Funny Cide beside me,\" \nthe jockey said. \"He was just running beside me.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fractions were :23.37, :47.14, :1:11.62, and 1:36.42.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrainer Bob Baffert's Senor Swinger was fifth, but all Baffert cared \nto talk about was the winner.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"That was really impressive,\" he said. \"Funny Cide was really \nrolling. I couldn't find my horse, so I was watching Funny Cide. Our \nhorse was flying late, but Pat (Day) said he didn't want to go early. \nI think Funny Cide is a little bit like War Emblem, more of a speed \ntype of horse. It was fun watching and listening to the crowd respond \nto Funny Cide when he drew off like that. I'm getting off the trail \nat this bus stop and rooting for Funny Cide to win the Triple Crown. \nEven Cisco the pony is going home.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide becomes the fifth horse since 1997 to head to New York for \nthe Belmont Stakes (gr. I) after winning both the Derby and \nPreakness. The others have all failed. VISA, which sponsors the \nTriple Crown, will pay a $5 million bonus to a Triple Crown winner.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This is just an incredible trip for Sackatoga Stable,\" said co-owner \nJack Knowlton. \"We never thought we'd be at the derby. Then we won \nthe Derby. Then we won the Preakness. We want Belmont to be the best \nrace ever.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide is by Distorted Humor and out of the Slewacide mare \nBelle's Good Cide. He was bred in New York by WinStar Farm.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's just been a tremendous ride except for a couple days,\" Knowlton \nsaid. \"I think Funny Cide today dispelled a lot of questions. Jose \nSantos rode a first-class race.\u0014\n\u0014\nKnowlton said he would not likely quit his job if Funny Cide wins the \nBelmont, but added, \"One of the vice presidents (of VISA) said they'd \nreally like to give away $5 million and I'd really like to get it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFunny Cide returned to New York following the Derby and did not ship \nto Pimlico until the day prior to the Preakness. He will return to \nNew York tonight.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Everything has just gone well the last five weeks,\" Tagg said. \"He \nhas just trained so well.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Belmont could not ask for a better horse to be going for the \nTriple Crown. The owners are from upstate New York, and Tagg and \nSantos are both based in New York.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I never thought he would have any distance problems,\" Tagg said when \nasked about the 1  miles of the June 7 Belmont.\u0014\nBoth Funny Cide and Peace Rules were 5-2 with five minutes to post, \nbut when the race went off, Funny Cide was $1.90 and Peace Rules was \n$2.40.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe winner paid $5.80, $4.60, and $3.40, and Midway Road returned \n$15.40 and $9. Scrimshaw, who was coupled with Senor Swinger, paid \n$4. The exacta paid $120.60, and the trifecta $684.20.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe complete order of finish was: Funny Cide, Midway Road, Scrimshaw, \nPeace Rules, Senor Swinger, New York Hero, Foufa's Warrior, \nCherokee's Boy, Ten Cents a Shine, and Kissin Saint.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I was worried about Peace Rules because I know he has speed,\" Santos \nsaid. \"At the three-eighths pole, I looked back and didn't see anyone \ncoming.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I thought he had it in him to do that (win by so many lengths), but \neverything went so perfectly,\" Tagg said. \"I thought Jose did a super \njob getting him in position, not losing ground. The nine hole is not \nthe perfect spot, but Jose always had him well placed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe win was worth $650,000 to the Sackatoga Stable, headed by Jack \nKnowlton. Funny Cide has now won five of eight lifetime starts and \nhas earnings of $1,889,385.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reported attendance was 100,268, the fourth time in the past five \nyears it has been more than 100,000. The handle was down 7.9% from a \nyear ago, to $59,384,334.\u0014",

    "title": "DNA FREES ANOTHER CONVICTED OF RAPE",
    "words": "May 20, 2003 \u0014\n\u0014\nDNA Clears Rape Convict After 12 Years\u0014\nBy ROBERT D. McFADDEN\u0014\n\u0014\nA 53-year-old man who spent the last 12 years behind bars for a \nHarlem rooftop rape he did not commit was freed by a judge in \nManhattan yesterday after newly discovered DNA evidence proved that \nanother man with an extensive history of robbery and sexual assaults \nwas guilty of the crime.\u0014\nMichael Mercer, who woke up yesterday morning as Prisoner No. 92A7361 \nat the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., had arrived \nin Manhattan by afternoon on a bus with barred windows. He had no \nidea what was happening until he got to court, where Acting Justice \nLeslie Crocker Snyder of State Supreme Court released him on a motion \nby the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.\u0014\n\u0014\nStill in his pine-green prison uniform, looking dazed but rather calm \nunder the circumstances, Mr. Mercer  who had always insisted he was \ninnocent  expressed no anger or bitterness during a news conference \nat the Criminal Court Building at 100 Centre Street, focusing instead \non the wonder of his new freedom.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Nothing,\" he said when asked what he intended to do now. \"My first \nnight as a free man, nothing.\"\u0014\nHe noted that he was not married, but had a daughter in Chattanooga, \nTenn., and a cousin in Queens. He said he was working on a book of \npoetry. He declined to comment only when asked if he would sue the \ncity.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Morgenthau, at the late afternoon news conference, said that the \nnew DNA evidence had shown that the victim in the case had been raped \nby Arthur Brown, 49, who is incarcerated at Green Haven Correctional \nFacility in Stormville, N.Y., serving two life terms for armed \nrobbery, rape and other offenses.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We are grateful that DNA technology allowed us to exonerate an \ninnocent man and we deeply regret that we were not able to do so \nsooner,\" Mr. Morgenthau said. He said he had learned of the new \nevidence only a few days ago and had moved swiftly to confirm it and \nto set Mr. Mercer's freedom in motion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe case underscored the growing use of DNA evidence, which has \nexonerated at least 128 people across the nation of crimes  mostly \nsex crimes  that they did not commit, and focused attention on New \nYork City's \"backlog project,\" which is using a vast databank of DNA \nto re-examine thousands of sex crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs with all DNA exonerations, Mr. Mercer's focused anew on the crime \nthat gave rise to it: the rape of a 17-year-old girl on March 19, \n1991, at her home at 1405 Park Avenue, near 104th Street. The \nassailant boarded an elevator with her and pushed the button for \nfloor 12, while she pushed 18. He then drew a gun, took her to the \nroof, raped and sodomized her, took her money and fled.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor two months, the victim stayed elsewhere with relatives, terrified \nof returning to the scene. But on May 18, 1991, returning to the \nbuilding for the first time, she saw Mr. Mercer. She called the \npolice, who did not arrive promptly. So she followed him and, fearing \nhe would get away, shouted that he had raped her. A crowd attacked \nMr. Mercer, who was rescued and arrested by the police.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reinvestigation of Mr. Mercer's case, Mr. Morgenthau said, \nrevealed that his conviction had been based largely on the victim's \n\"adamant\" identification and on a startling array of similarities \nbetween the guilty and innocent men, including their ages and \nphysical descriptions.\u0014\n\u0014\nMoreover, the prosecutor said, Mr. Mercer acknowledged that at about \nthe time of the rape he had often visited a friend on the 12th floor \nof the building where the rape occurred, which seemed relevant \nbecause the rapist had pushed the button for the 12th floor. Mr. \nMercer even acknowledged having seen the victim in the building on \noccasion in March or April of 1991.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe suspect, who had a record of three felony convictions and eight \nfor misdemeanors, none of them sex crimes, and who was working as a \npainter at a Harlem church, gave evasive or misleading answers to the \ndetectives who questioned him. He gave two home addresses that turned \nout to be false. He said variously that he was at a hospital, a \nmovie, or the home of a friend when the rape occurred. His responses \nonly seemed to confirm his guilt.\u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Mercer was tried twice in 1992 on charges of rape, sodomy and \nrobbery, all in the first degree. His first trial ended on June 15, \nin a hung jury, but at the second trial he was convicted on July 15. \nA serologist told both juries that an analysis of slides taken for a \nrape kit had revealed no evidence of sperm. But the kit and its \ncontents were saved in storage.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe defendant did not testify at the first trial, but did so at the \nsecond. He said that although he did not commit the crime, he had \ngone to 1405 Park Avenue to see his friend on the 12th floor on the \nday of the attack. The jury took only 90 minutes to return a guilty \nverdict on all counts, and Mr. Mercer was sentenced a month later to \n20 1/2 to 41 years in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe appealed, claiming ineffective counsel and an excessive sentence, \nbut his conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division \nin 1995. Mr. Mercer filed other motions, seeking DNA testing. That \nmotion was denied, based on a finding that there was no DNA to be \ntested.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn March 2000, as the technology for extracting new evidence from DNA \ncontinued to improve, the city's criminal justice agencies began a \nproject to retest all of the 17,000 sexual assault-evidence kits in \nstorage. About the same time, felons in the state were required to \nprovide DNA samples for a databank.\u0014\nMr. Mercer did so in 2001, and Mr. Brown last year. Evidence in this \ncase went to a private laboratory last January, and a DNA profile was \ndeveloped. It proved to be that of Mr. Brown. His criminal history \nincluded five knifepoint rapes and robberies in the elevators of \nHarlem housing projects. Captured and convicted in 1981, he went to \nprison for a decade, and was out on parole  and had jumped bail in \nyet another robbery  when the 1991 rape occurred. He was taken into \ncustody in another robbery a month later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe victim in recent days has acknowledged that she made a \"terrible \nmistake\" and is \"extremely upset,\" Mr. Morgenthau said. She is 29 \nnow, single and working in the city. Her mistake was perhaps \nunderstandable, the prosecutor said. She and Mr. Mercer had \nundoubtedly seen one another in the building, he noted, and she had \nbeen traumatized.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright 2003 The New York Times Company\u0014",

Two different \\authors are \\claiming that \\Jesus was \ngay, and the New Age \\Ulysses Press \"would have us believe that Mary \nwas a prostitute when she gave birth to Jesus, and that the grown-up \nJesus committed unspeakable acts with his mother,\" according to the \n\\Associated Press.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrthodoxy will face such nonsense until Christ's Kingdom is fully \nrealized. But when a Christian minister starts spouting such guano, \nit's all the more troubling.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a recent interview (the Associated Press doesn't say with whom), \nLutheran minister \\Thorkild Grosboel of Taarbaek, Denmark, said, \n\"\\There is no heavenly God, there is no eternal life, there is no \nresurrection.\" Hmm. Not much left in the Lutheran \\Book of Concord \nafter that, is there?\u0014\n\u0014\nGrosboel's bishop has demanded that he retract the statements and \napologize. \"There should be no doubt that priests have committed \nthemselves to act within the church's confession of faith,\" said \nLise-Lotte Rebel, adding that his remarks \"caused confusion\" in the \nchurch. She also \\suspended him from this duties as the town's pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuspended? Why not fire him? \"In Denmark, Lutheran pastors are \nemployed by the state, and bishops cannot fire them,\" the AP's Jan M. \nOlsen explains. Ah, the joys of a state church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere's some indication that the government might sack him. Minister \nfor Ecclesiastic Affairs \\Tove Fergo, for example, said it's not \npossible to be a pastor without believing in God and the resurrection.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn any case, Grosboel is a symptom of what's happening throughout the \ncountry. According to Operation World, 90 percent of the country \nbelongs to the \\Danish National Church but most parishes only see 1 \npercent to 4 percent attendance. Less than 5 percent of the Danish \npopulation (about 252,000) are evangelicalsbut it's dropping by 6 \npercent a year.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe World Christian Encyclopedia, however, has more encouraging news. \nEvangelicals are indeed lower than ever, it says, but a growing \npercentage of the population is Pentecostal/Charismatic (they make up \nabout 4 percent of Denmark now). Operation World says only 1.5% is \nCharismatic and that the percentages are shrinking. In any case, the \ncountry needs prayer.\u0014",

    "title": "DID ERIC RUDOLPH ACT IN A \"TRADITION OF CHRISTIAN TERROR?\"",
    "words": "Did Eric Rudolph Act in a \"Tradition of Christian Terror\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nA historian considers the evidence of the Crusades and the \nInquisition.\u0014\nBy Chris Armstrong | posted 06/13/2003\u0014\n\u0014\nThe specter of the \"Christian terrorist\" presented by the recent \ncapture of accused bomber Eric Rudolph has raised again the old \ncharge of the skeptic: \"Why should we be surprised when Christians \nkill people? They've always done so. Church history itself is the \nbest advertisement against the church.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity's opponents love to use church-historical examples that \nto \"prove\" that violence is inherent to the Christian church. The \nmost prominent of these are the Crusades and the Inquisition. The \ncritics ask: Don't such violent blots on the church prove Christians \nhave never followed their Lord's loving, non-violent lead and obeyed \nthe Fifth Commandment?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his book The Case for Faith, pastor-apologist Lee Strobel records \nan interview he conducted with church historian John D. Woodbridge \nabout the Crusades, the Inquisition, and other historical episodes \nthat have provided the church's enemies with so much fodder. \nWoodbridge was careful to admit that even genuine Christians seeking \nto serve their Lord have proved capable of violent acts. But he \ninsisted that this is neither within the spirit nor the practice of \nChristianity as it has been lived over the two millennia since \nChrist. Here is a quick summary of his responses, as reported by \nStrobel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Crusades\u0014\nStrobel sets the scene with an eyewitness description of the First \nCrusade's first hours in Jerusalem. There, at the Temple of Solomon, \n\"men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins.\" Added the \ntriumphant eyewitness, \"It was a just and splendid judgment of God \nthat this place should be filled with the blood of the unbelievers, \nsince it had suffered so long from their blasphemies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, to Woodbridge, as to Strobel and to us, such horrors were \nanything but \"just and splendid.\" From the first Crusade, launched by \nPope Urban II in 1095, to the last, in 1291, at least some of the \ncrusaders \"thought they were doing something magnificent for Christ.\" \nThe goal, after all, was to retrieve the Holy Land from the Muslims, \nwho (it seemed obvious) were enemies of Christ. However, even such \nhigh motives did not keep the Crusaders from indulging in far less \nnoble pursuits. Woodbridge reminds us that in one of the most \nnotorious crusades, the Fourth, \"the participants didn't even make it \nto the Holy Land. They got as far as Constantinople, seized it, and \nset up their own kingdom. Tremendous bloodshed ensued. Western \n'Christians' killed Eastern Christians.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly the Crusades were anything but Christian. From Popes who \npromised people their salvation if they went on Crusades to \ntransparently bloodthirsty and money-hungry people who used Crusades \nas an excuse to pillage, these bloody enterprises \"made a mockery of \nthe teachings of the Bible and can't in any way be squared with \nhistoric Christian beliefs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat, then, are we to conclude? Woodbridge put it like this: \"The \nCrusades . . . need to be confessed as being totally contrary to the \nteachings of the one the crusaders were supposedly following. It's \nimportant to remember that it's not Jesus' teachings that are at \nfault here; it's the actions of those who, for whatever reason, \ngreatly strayed from what he clearly taught: we are to love our \nenemies.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Inquisition\u0014\nWhat, then, of the Inquisition? Here we have an undertaking set up \nwith the highest of theological motives: keeping pure the teachings \nof the church, and preventing innocent people from being led away \nfrom the saving gospel of Christ. How could such goals produce such \nterrible results?\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, the facts: Beginning in 1163, bishops were instructed to \ndiscover heresy and act against hereticsespecially the group known \nas the Albigenses. There followed two more \"waves\" of inquisitionone \nbeginning in Spain in 1472, and one in 1542 that was focused on \nCalvinist Protestants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhatever our opinion of heresy trials as a necessary or effective \nmeasure of church discipline (see our previous newsletter on this), \nit is clear that if there is a \"right way\" to conduct one, these \nInquisitions' way was not it. Swiftly, these became marked by \"secret \nproceedings, supreme authority vested in the inquisitor, and a \ncomplete lack of due process, where the accused didn't know the names \nof their accusers, there was no defense attorney, and torture was \nused to extract confessions. Those who refused to repent were turned \nover to the government to be burned at the stake.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat the Inquisition, like many other historical cases of \"church \nbrutality,\" illustrates is the bloody consequences that ensue when \nsecular powers identify heresy with sedition. In a parallel \nProtestant casethat of Michael Servetus, tried and executed in \nCalvin's Genevait was the state who actually put Servetus to the \ntorch. Why? Because the powers-that-be expected and feared that a \nthreat to the church was also a threat to the state. Woodbridge \nreminds us that throughout the Reformation period, \"religion and \npolitics were bound up together,\" and that this was often an \nexplosive, bloody mixnot the first and not the last.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe deeper question remains: were events like the Crusades and the \nInquisition representative of the history of the Christian churches? \nWoodbridge thinks that although such events were tragedies that the \nchurch can not run away from, \"It's too much of an extrapolation to \nsay that this kind of hateful activity is part of a pattern.\" He \ncontinues:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"For much of their existence, many Christian churches have been in a \nminority situation and therefore not even in a position to persecute \nanyone. In fact, talk about persecutionmillions of Christians \nthemselves have been victims of brutal persecution through the ages, \ncontinuing to the present day in some places. . . . there have been \napparently more Christian martyrs in the twentieth century than in \nany other. To this very day, Christians are being killed for their \nfaith around the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nStrobel emphasizes Woodbridge's point with a quotation from \nChristianity Today editor David Neff: \"The typical Christian lives in \na developing country, speaks a non-European language, and exists \nunder the constant threat of persecutionof murder, imprisonment, \ntorture, or rape.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have far more often suffered than perpetrated terror. This \ndoes not excuse those who in the past have named Christ's name but \nbroken God's Fifth Commandment. But it does put the lie to the \nskeptic's image of a church characterized throughout its history by \nbrutal oppression and violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nChris Armstrong is managing editor of Christian History magazine. \nCopyright  2003 Christianity Today.\u0014",

In an exclusive book excerpt, journalists \nwho\u0014\n                   were there remember what it was like \u0014\n\u0014\n                   By Kenneth T. Walsh \u0014\n                   In the days immediately after 9/11,\u0014\n                   Americans in large numbers showed up at\u0014\n                   the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in\u0014\n                   Boston, apparently looking for strength and\u0014\n                   hope at a hobbes's of national peril and sorrow.\u0014\n                   They were drawn in particular to a film\u0014\n                   recounting the Cuban missile crisis, when\u0014\n                   Kennedy guided the nation through a\u0014\n                   confrontation with the Soviet Union that could \neasily have led to nuclear war.\u0014\n                   Many visitors seemed comforted by the idea that \nprudent leadership and\u0014\n                   common sense could make all the difference, even \nin the worst of times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n                   The fact that Kennedy still has such a hold on \nAmerica's imagination\u0014\n                   comes as no surprise to historians and other \nobservers of popular culture.\u0014\n                   This connection will become even more apparent in \nthe coming weeks as the\u0014\n                   nation marks the 40th anniversary of his \nassassination, on Nov. 22, 1963.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Yet the reasons for his mystique are less clear. \nThe fact that he was\u0014\n                   assassinated in the prime of life goes only so far \nin explaining it. President\u0014\n                   William McKinley, another popular leader, was \nmurdered in 1901, but his\u0014\n                   death generated no vast outpouring of emotion and \nno enduring sense of a\u0014\n                   lost legacy. In contrast, millions of Americans \nstill recall where they were\u0014\n                   when they heard that Kennedy had been shot. (I was \nattending history class\u0014\n                   at St. Rose High School in Belmar, N.J., when the \nprincipal came on the\u0014\n                   public-address system and, choking back tears, \ntold us what had happened.\u0014\n                   Everyone marched to our nearby church, and we \nspent the next few hours\u0014\n                   praying for the president's survival and, a bit \nlater, his soul.)\u0014\n\u0014\n                   We all seem to have vivid memories of his funeral, \ncarried on live television,\u0014\n                   with those unforgettable images of his grieving \nwidow and his young son\u0014\n                   saluting smartly when his father's cortege passed \nby.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   \"Kennedy is frozen in our memory at age 46,\" says \nhistorian Robert Dallek,\u0014\n                   author of An Unfinished Life: John F.

He and his advisers quickly \ngrasped the power of the new\u0014\n                   medium of television, and the handsome, eloquent \nyoung leader quickly\u0014\n                   mastered it and went on to convey an image of \noptimism and charm that still\u0014\n                   surrounds him today. His performances at live \npress conferences are\u0014\n                   remembered as tours de force. His speeches are \nused as brilliant examples\u0014\n                   of political communication. And if his legislative \nrecord fell short, his ideas\u0014\n                   about ending the Cold War and achieving racial \nequality at home, at least\u0014\n                   under the law, eventually took root and became \nreality.\u0014\n\u0014\n                   Further, his glamorous wife, Jacqueline, \nreinforced the exciting image of\u0014\n                   Camelot, especially in contrast to his solid but \ndull predecessor, Dwight\u0014\n                   Eisenhower.

    "words": "November 10, 1871 \u0014\nDr. Livingstone, I Presume?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years, no one had heard from the Scottish missionary explorer, \nDavid Livingstone. In l866, he had disappeared into the East African \ninterior, searching for the source of the River Nile. Livingstone's \nreports of his earlier explorations in Africa had fascinated \nmultitudes of readers at home. Once asked why he decided to be a \nmissionary, Livingstone replied: \"I was compelled by the love of \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa, published in \n1857, told of treks totaling more than 20,000 miles back and forth \nacross the African continent. His explorations provided valuable \ninformation about the people and geography of Africa's interior. \nHowever, when he didn't know, he guessed; and his dreams were often \nbigger than the facts; this cost a number of missionary their lives \nbecause they relied on his accounts. James Stewart (founder of \nLovedale mission) was so disgusted with Livingstone's personal life \nand misinformation that he threw one of his books into an African \nriver.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the same, Livingstone awakened the world to the horror of the \nArab slave trade, which he called a \"monster of iniquity brooding \nover Africa.\" By publicizing the evil of slavery, Livingstone worked \neffectively to see it abolished. For every 20,000 slaves captured and \nexported, he estimated 100,000 Africans were killed, wounded, or died \nof disease on the slave trails. He wrote: \"The many skeletons we have \nseen along the paths of the wilderness attest the awful sacrifice of \nhuman life that must be attributed to this trade in hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1871, concerned that for five years no one had heard from \nLivingstone and eager to obtain a \"scoop,\" the New York Herald sent \njournalist Henry Stanley to find him. Landing in Zanzibar, Stanley \ntraced Livingstone's steps into the interior. To do so, he had to \nfind his way (sometimes fighting) through hostile territory and \novercome attacks of malaria, the jaws of crocodiles, mutiny and \ndesertion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter months of misery, learning that Livingstone was close, Stanley \nand his porters donned their best clothes. At last, on this day, \nNovember 10, 1871, they saw an old white man by the shores of Lake \nTanganyika. Knowing this could be only one person, Stanley greeted \nhim with his now world-famous comment: \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foods Henry brought with him saved Livingstone's life, for he was \ndesperately ill and able to eat only African porridge. \"You have \nbrought me new life,\" said the missionary over and over. Unable to \npersuade Livingstone to leave Africa, Stanley joined him in exploring \npart of Lake Tanganyika and then returned to England. Unlike James \nStewart, Stanley was impressed with Livingstone's Christianity, and \nwrote: \"It is not of the theoretical kind, but it is a constant, \nearnest, sincere practice...and it is always at work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nAllen, John.

    "title": "DORT PITTED CALVINISTS VS. ARMINIANS",
    "words": "November 13, 1618 \u0014\nDort Pitted Calvinists vs. Arminians\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nJames (Jacob) Arminius was uneasy with some of the teachings that had \ncome to be identified with Calvinism. Did God really choose some men \nto be damned before he created them? Was Christ's death only intended \nfor those who would finally be saved? Does God exercise his \nsovereignty so fully that man has no choice in his own salvation? \nDoes regeneration come first and then repentance? As the professor of \ntheology at Leyden, James had promised to teach only those things \nwhich conformed to the confessions of faith of the state church of \nthe Netherlands. These were Calvinist. In his public teaching, \nArminius kept his word, but he laid out Scripture readings in such a \nway as to cast doubt on Calvin's theology (which was heavily indebted \nto Augustine of Hippo).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn private, James offered a different interpretation of Scripture to \ninterested students. While not varying from a single doctrine of the \nearly church creeds and accepting much that Calvin taught, he \nmodified his theology to say that man (through ordinary grace) can \nrespond to the gospel and has real choice in his ultimate destiny. \nStrict Calvinists, such as Dr. Franciscus Gomarus, objected strongly. \nHowever, a number of pastors of state churches adopted Arminian \nviews. Arminius himself downplayed differences for the sake of peace \nand because of his promises, although he tried to get the Heidelberg \nCatechism and another Dutch confession amended.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter his death, his followers issued a document called a \nRemonstrance. In it they set out five points in which they differed \nfrom Calvin. Inevitably the issue got mixed up with politics too \ncomplex to go into in this short article. The Remonstrants (as \nArminians were called) were on the side of those who wanted \ndecentralized government or \"states rights.\" The Calvinists were on \nthe same side as Maurice, who was attempting to reduce \"states \nrights\" and create a stronger central government.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe central government called a synod (council of churchmen) to weigh \nthe issues. On this day, November 13, 1618, the Synod of Dort \nconvened. It was controlled by Calvinists who invited other \nCalvinists from neighboring countries. The assembly existed for one \npurpose only: to condemn the Remonstrants. Naturally, the \nRemonstrants considered this unfair.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the proceedings were biased. The Calvinists met alone until the \nsixth of December. Meanwhile, Remonstrants around the country were \nthrown out of their pulpits. Those Remonstrants who were summoned to \nthe assembly found their movements restricted. They were not allowed \nto have their strongest speakers represent them. Many other \ninjustices occurred.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeedless to say, with matters so stacked against them, the \nRemonstrant cause was condemned. One of their supporters, the \nstatesman, John Oldenbarneveld, was invited to a meeting with Maurice \nand arrested. Falsely charged with treason, he was beheaded. Another \nsupporter, Hugo Grotius (who became the father of international law), \nwas sentenced to life in prison but managed to escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nArminian ideas are found among Wesleyans, Methodists, Nazarenes, Free \nWill Baptists and in similar traditions, while variations of \nCalvinism can be detected in the theologies of Reformed, \nPresbyterian, Calvinist Methodist and some Baptist groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Arminianism,\" and \"Dort, Synod of,\" in The Oxford Dictionary of the \nChristian Church,\" edited by F.

    "title": "DEMONS AS SEEN IN JUDAISM",
    "words": "Demons\u0014\n\u0014\nBelief in demons is of ancient origin. In the very early books of the \nJewish scriptures the idea was widely presented as fact. Rather \nlogically, they were believed to be the evil spirits emanating from \nSatan, just as the angels were good spirits who spent their time \nserving God. While they roamed everywhere, it was believed that \ncemeteries were their central dwelling places. Among the rituals of \nthe ancient Jewish church were rites for exorcising demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly Hebrews probably inherited their belief in demons from their \nSemitic ancestors. Also, their contact with the Babylonians and \nPersians would bring this influence to them. The polytheism that was \nwidespread at that time was fertile ground for adoption of the belief \nthat demons held power over human beings. So the Jews of that day \nbelieved, without reservation, that human beings could be possessed \nby demons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rite of exorcism is still practiced in our day, though very \nseldom. There is a church ritual for it among both Jews and \nChristians. However, in this account by Mark, Jesus did not use any \nspecial rite. It was by a simple command from him that the possessed \nman was freed of his terrible addiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs has been stated, in Christ's day, there was universal belief in \ndemons. In many areas of human ailments, where ignorance prevailed, \ndemons were given the blame. There was a demon for every illness. One \ncan understand why. Illness was certainly not good, but could be \nbranded as evil, and demons supposedly caused the evil that roamed \nthe earth. Because of the crudeness of medical knowledge at that \ntime, a hole was often bored in the skull of one so possessed, in the \nbelief that this would permit the demon to escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is much to be pondered in the truth that Jesus possesses power \nover all negative things. Many clinical psychologists have eliminated \nthe spiritual dimension in their attempts to heal, even deriding the \nidea that faith can play an important part in healing. But currently \nthe tide is turning. A growing number of clinical psychologists \nbelieve that the use of spiritual resources can be a tremendous boon \nin the cure of depression, anxieties, the fear of death, and the fear \nof the future. This is the cause for the spread of holistic medicine.\u0014",

He died in 1747 when he was only 29 years old, but his \njournal has inspired Christians in every generation since. One day in \nDecember, 1742, he made an entry that gave later generations a peek \nat the experience of a believer who has diligently pursued the \npresence of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrainerd wrote that on that date he \"had a sweet melting sense of \ndivine things, of the pure spirituality of the religion of Christ \nJesus . . . Oh, the sweetness, the tenderness I felt in my soul! If \never I felt the temper of Christ, I had some sense of it now. Blessed \nbe my God, I have seldom enjoyed a more comfortable and profitable \nday than this. Oh, that I could spend all my time for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Brainerd's diary writings take us to the pits as well as to the \nmountain tops. They candidly reveal the times of the \"dark night of \nthe soul,\" as John of the Cross called them. A little more than two \nweeks after Brainerd wrote the jubilant words quoted above, he walked \nthrough spiritual torment.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, January 14, 1743, he wrote: \"My spiritual conflicts \ntoday were unspeakably dreadful, heavier than the mountains and \noverflowing floods. I seemed enclosed, as it were, in Hell itself; I \nwas deprived of all sense of God, even of the being of a God; and \nthat was my misery. I had no awful apprehensions of God as angry. \nThis was distress, the nearest akin to the damned's torments, that I \never endured; their torment, I am sure, will consist much in a \nprivation (lack) of God, and consequently of all good. This taught me \nthe absolute dependence of a creature upon God the Creator, for every \ncrumb of happiness it enjoys. Oh I feel that, if there is no God, \nthough I might live for ever here, and enjoy not only this but all \nother worlds, I should be ten thousand times more miserable than a \nreptile. My soul was in such anguish I could not eat; but felt as I \nsuppose a poor wretch would that is just going to the place of \nexecution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid's journal reminds us that following God isn't all peaches and \ncream. There were times when he knew God was wonderfully close but \nother times when he couldn't find him at all. He came to realize what \nmany spiritual giants have also discovered, that even in the dark \nnights God is still with us regardless of inner fluctuations. God is \nmore faithful than our emotions. We can trust Him at all times.\u0014\n\u0014\nResources:\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014",

    "words": "August 18, 328 \u0014\nDeath of Helena, 1st Christian Archaeologist\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nA character in a nursery rhyme may be closely connected with Church \nhistory and Christian archaeology. Probably you have sung \"Old King \nCole was a merry old soul.\" But did you know that the British have an \nancient tradition that Helena, the fourth-century Christian \narchaeologist was the daughter of King Coel of Colchester, \nimmortalized in this Mother Goose rhyme?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf this story is true, another interesting fact follows from it. \nHelena was the mother of Constantine, the first christianized Emperor \nof the Roman Empire. This means Emperor Constantine was the grandson \nof a Mother Goose hero! Since there actually was a Christian church \nat Colchester in 250 A.D.--about the time that Helena was born--it is \npossible that she become a Christian as a young person which would \nexplain Constantine's interest in the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, so much of Helena's life is obscure or unknown, including \nthe date and place of her birth, that we cannot make the connection \nwith any certainty. Some historians theorize that since the emperor \nConstantine later named a town in Asia Minor Helenopolis in her \nhonor, she was born there, not in Britain, and was the daughter of an \ninnkeeper.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnclear too is when and where Helena met the Roman soldier \nConstantius Chlorus, or even if the two were ever officially married. \nWhat is certain is that Constantius and Helena were Constantine's \nparents. When Constantius became Caesar of Gaul, Spain, and Britain \nin 292, he dumped Helena in order to marry Theodora, daughter of his \npatron, the emperor Maximian. It was a cold-blooded political move \ndesigned to advance Constantius' career.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelena's son Constantine spent much time at the court of the emperor \nDiocletian and became a soldier like his father. When his troops \nlater proclaimed Constantine emperor in 306, one of his first acts \nwas to recall his mother from the political exile she had been in \never since her divorce and give her honors befitting the mother of a \nRoman Emperor. When Constantine embraced Christianity, Helena gave \nhim her strong support and encouragement. \u0014\n\u0014\nEighty year old Helena became so enthusiastic about the faith that \nshe traveled to the Holy Land. Her mission was about more than mere \ncuriosity, for as she traveled through the eastern imperial \nprovinces, she encouraged the establishment of the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce in Palestine she sought out the original locations associated \nwith the life of Jesus, becoming the first known Christian \narchaeologist. Helena then oversaw the construction of several \nchurches Constantine had ordered built in Bethlehem, Calvary, Olivet, \nand Bethany at sites associated with Christ's life. A pagan temple to \nAphrodite had been built on the tomb site of Jesus' resurrection; it \nwas torn down and replaced by the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Later \nlegends arose that Helena also discovered the actual cross of Christ \nin the tomb beneath the church. In paintings she is often shown as a \nyoung and beautiful woman holding this cross. \u0014\n\u0014\nHelena's tour became a pattern for Christian pilgrims throughout the \nMiddle Ages. Even today, at Christmas time \"Manger Square\" in \nBethlehem is thronged with pilgrims coming to worship at the Church \nof the Nativity and at Easter, Christians follow the Via Dolorosa \n(Way of Sorrow) to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. \nBoth of these ancient churches in the Holy Land are connected with \nEmpress Helena.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Helena died on this day, August 18, 328, she was buried in the \nChurch of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S.

Pastor Anthony Evans tells an \nunusual story about a man who took his girlfriend out for dinner and \nwhen they sat down, he laid an elaborate box on the table for her \nbirthday. All the while they were eating dinner, she just kept \nthinking about this box, because it was a big box, and she wanted to \nknow what was inside. She could hardly eat. The waiting to open the \ngift was killing her, but her boyfriend told her to open the gift \nafter dinner. All she could think about was what was in the box. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally dinner was over. Can I open the box now? she asked.\u0014\n\u0014\nYeah, he replied, you can open the box.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe opened the box and pulled out . . . a pillow. Oh, wow, I mean, \nthis is a nice pillow, she said, but it's a pillow. She turned the \npillow over, thinking that something was taped to the backside. There \nwas nothing. Well, thank you. It was obvious she was disappointed \nthat she got a pillow.\u0014\n\u0014\nHer boyfriend got up, took the pillow from her, and laid the pillow \non the floor. He got down on one knee, took her by the hand, and \nsaid, Will you marry me?\u0014\n\u0014\nImmediately she forgot about the pillow. The one who gave her the \npillow now became a lot more important. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Lord of all the universe has come to us on bended knee, as it \nwere, to let us know how much we are loved, how much we are \ntreasured. That's grace. He humbled himself, says St. Paul. That's \ngrace. However, he did not come on bended knee so that so that we \ncould spend our lives just getting by.

He did it so that we might become \nworld-class parents, world-class spouses, world-class employees and \nemployers, world-class servants of God.\u0014",

    "words": "In a recent book author Max Lucado tells a wonderful story about a \nship that is blown off course. It quickly comes across a group of \nuncharted islands. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe ship's captain orders the boat's anchor dropped at the first \nisland and sets foot on it. What he discovers is a scene of total \ndespair. Poverty and discord abound on this island. The people are \ndispirited and demoralized. The Captain and his crew move on to other \nnearby islands and they, too, reveal villages in the midst of blight, \nsuffering from conflict, lack of food and illness. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the Captain enters the largest island of the chain and \ndiscovers a totally different world than he had encountered on the \nother islands. This island has plush irrigation systems, strong able \nbodied citizens and a bright outlook. When the Captain asks a local \nwhy this island is so far ahead of its neighbors, he is told that a \nFather Benjamin has educated the people of the island in everything \nfrom agriculture to health. The Father also assisted the town in \nbuilding schools, roads, hospitals and irrigation systems. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeeing such an amazing community led by one man, the captain asks to \nmeet Father Benjamin in person. Show me where he lives, he says. At \nfirst, the Captain is guided to various buildings that the Father was \nresponsible for building. But the Father is not there. Then the \nlocals bring him to a fishpond that Father Benjamin had constructed \nthat helps to feed the community. Again, however, there is no sign of \nFather Benjamin. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Captain is finally led up a mountain. Aha, he thought, Finally \nI will meet the amazing Father Benjamin. Once again, there is no \nsign of this good Father and the Captain grows frustrated. He asks \nthe townsfolk why they have led him to many places which Father \nBenjamin made possible, but not to the gentleman himself. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the Captain is told that Father Benjamin has died. The \nCaptain asks why they did not tell him up front that the priest was \ndead.  You didn't ask about his death, the chief explains. You \nasked to see where he lives. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou want to know where Christ lives? He lives within each person who \nis willing to open himself or herself to become the handiwork of God. \nHe lives wherever a hospital has been built in Christ's name, or a \nhomeless shelter, or a soup kitchen. Christ lives wherever anyone has \ngiven sacrificially to minister to any of the least of these. Being \nthe handiwork of God is not for the fainthearted. It is not for \nthose who are content to just get by in life.\u0014",

Rich people have a \nharder time connecting with others, showing less empathy to the \nextent of dehumanizing those who are different from them. They are \nless charitable and generous. They are less likely to help someone in \ntrouble. And they are more likely to defend an unfair status quo.

    "words": "In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first \npeople to ascend the 29,035-foot peak of Mount Everest. They were not \nthe last. In the 1990s, Nepal lifted its once tight restrictions on \nclimbing the legendary mountain in order to boost tourist dollars. As \nof 2006, more than 2,700 people have reached the summit of the \nworld's tallest mountain, many paying over $60,000 for the experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne result of this commercial influx has been the erosion of the \ntraditional moral code of mountaineering. In the rush to the top, \namateurs who have paid a fortune for the bragging rights will do \nanything it takes to get to the summit, including abandoning other \nclimbers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Sharp became a casualty of this modern mentality in March of \n2006. The 34-year-old engineer from Cleveland did manage to reach the \nsummit on his own. However, he ran out of oxygen on the way back \ndown984 feet from the top. As he lay dying, 40 climbers passed him \nby, too eager to achieve their own goals to take a chance on using up \ntheir oxygen on someone else. As a result, David Sharp froze to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Ed Viestrus, who has scaled all 14 of the world's 8,000 \nmeter peaks, Sharp's death is not unique. \"Passing people who are \ndying is not uncommon. Unfortunately, there are those who say: 'It's \nnot my problem. I've spent all this money, and I'm going to the \nsummit.'\" This attitude has produced disgust in many climbers, \nincluding Sir Edmund Hillary. \"On my expedition,\" he said, \"there was \nno way you'd have left a man under a rock to die.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Crowd on Mount Everest,\" The Week (6-30-06), p. 13; submitted by \nTed De Haas, Bedford, Iowa\u0014",

    "title": "DAVID BARTON'S JEFFERSON PORTRAYAL LESS THAN HONEST",
    "words": "David Barton's Jefferson Portrayal Less Than Honest \u0014\nMartin Marty\u0014\nPosted: Friday, May 4, 2012 6:20 am\u0014\n\u0014\nOur premier historian of late colonial and early republican America, \nGordon Wood, while reviewing a book on Roger Williams, warms up \nreaders with references to Thomas Jefferson: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's easy to believe in the separation of church and state when one \nhas nothing but scorn for all organized religion. That was the \nposition of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson's hatred of the clergy and \nestablished churches knew no bounds. He thought that members of the \n'priestcraft' were always in alliance with despots against liberty. \nFor him the divine Trinity \"was nothing but 'Abracadabra' and \n'hocus-pocus'  Ridicule, he said, was the only weapon to be used \nagainst it.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you wanted to promote the idea of \"a Christian America,\" one which \nwould privilege one religion, a version of Christianity, and \nde-privilege all others, and if you want to get back to roots and \norigins, the last of the \"founding fathers\" on whom you'd concentrate \nwould be Jefferson.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the most ardent public and pop advocate of privilege and virtual \nestablishment, David Barton, cites Jefferson for Bartonian positions \nthat are directly opposite of Jefferson's.\u0014\n\u0014\nNever heard of David Barton? Most of the historians you would ever \nmeet never heard of him, and if you told them about him and his \npositions, they would yawn or rage about listing him among those who \ndeal honestly with Jefferson.\u0014\n\u0014\nSightings does not over-do ad hominem and sneering references, so we \nleave to others all the disdaining that Barton so richly merits.\u0014\n\u0014\nDo note, however, that he has invented a case and product that serve \nhis viewpoint and draw him enormous followings among \"conservative\" \nfactions, which oppose separation of church and state in most cases \nexcept those they choose.\u0014\n\u0014\nListen to Mike Huckabee or Glenn Beck or rightist cable TV, and you \nwill find Barton showing up everywhere.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis favorite founder seems to be Jefferson, of all people. How does \nhe work his way around to the prime builder of \"a wall of separation \nbetween church and state,\" in the metaphor that would not be my \nfavorite.\u0014\n\u0014\nSample: Thomas Jefferson, razor in hand snipped all supernatural \nreferences out of his copies of the Gospels (in the four languages he \nread in White House evenings), to keep Jesus as a pure ethical \nhumanist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis spring Barton is publishing \"The Jefferson Lies,\" which most \nhistorians would title \"Barton's Lies about Jefferson.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAstonishingly, he twists a slight reference to Jefferson's book on \nJesus and turns it into a tract which, Barton says, Jefferson would \nuse in order to convert the Indians to Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\nReviewer Craig Ferhman in the Los Angeles Times found all that Barton \nfound to be \"outrageous fabrication.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn TV, Barton even said, with no evidence, that Jefferson gave a copy \nof his Jesus book to a missionary, to use \"as you evangelize the \nIndians.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHad the Indians been converted with that text, their heirs would have \nhad no place to go but to what became the humanist wing of the \nUnitarian-Universalist church.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy does any of this matter?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne, basic honesty is at issue; do American religionists need to \ninvent such stories in order to prevail?\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo, what if they did prevail? Most of the founders thought that \nreligion was most honest and compelling when its leaders and \ngatherings did not depend upon lies about the state and, of course, \nupon the state itself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Separation of church and state\" is admittedly a complex issue, \ndealing as it does with inevitable conflict and messiness in a free \nand lively republic.\u0014\n\u0014\nMay debates over it go on, but with honest references to Jefferson \nand his colleagues and not on the grounds David Barton proposes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin E. Marty is the Fairfax M. Cone Distinguished Service \nProfessor Emeritus at the University of Chicago.\u0014",

    "title": "DERBY WIN JUST MIGHT BE HORSE'S LAST",
    "words": "Derby win just might be horse's last\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the 138th running of the Kentucky Derby, you might want to hold \noff tearing up your tickets or counting your money for just a second. \nTake a moment and watch the winner as he gallops back to the winner's \ncircle.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt just might be the last time you see him there.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor all the money spent in breeding sheds and auction rings as owners \ntry to find their Derby horse, for all the strategy and hard work \ntrainers put in trying to develop a talented young horse to peak in \nthe late spring of its 3-year-old season, for all the media coverage \nand hype of the Derby trail, the race is supposed to be a coronation. \nThe Derby winner is supposed to be the next super horse, the one to \nboost a sport in desperate need of star power.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore often, however, the coronation is really a going-away party. \nInstead of marking the coming of a champion, a Kentucky Derby win \noften marks the beginning of the end for the winner. In recent years, \nwinner after winner has been unable to duplicate the peak performance \nshown on the first Saturday of May.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen 2011 Derby winner Animal Kingdom beat five horses in a $60,000 \nallowance race on the Gulfstream Park turf course in February, he \nbecame the first Kentucky Derby winner to win a subsequent race since \nBig Brown ended his career with a victory in the Monmouth Stakes in \nSeptember 2008. Moreover, Animal Kingdom was the first Derby champion \nto win a race in his 4-year-old season since Giacomo won the San \nDiego Handicap at Del Mar in 2006.\u0014\n\u0014\nThree of the past six Derby winners  Super Saver (2010), Mine That \nBird (2009) and Barbaro (2006)  never won again. Only two of the \npast eight winners  Big Brown (2008) and Street Sense (2007)  won \nmore than once after the big score at Churchill Downs.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat gives?\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are a number of factors in play:\u0014\n\u0014\n The fluke factor: Long shots win more often. Five bombs at 20-1 or \ngreater have won in the past 13 years. With the field usually at the \nlimit of 20, trips and racing luck become a greater factor. Horses \nenter the Derby these days having been lightly raced, rather than \nhaving a long record of established form. The influx of artificial \nsurfaces such as Polytrack and Tapeta make handicapping the Derby \nmore of a guessing game than ever. When Mine That Bird leaves \neveryone scratching their heads at 50-1, is it any great surprise he \nnever duplicated that Derby effort?\u0014\n\u0014\n The breeding factor: This one's not new, but it's as true as ever. \nThe instant a horse wins the Derby, his  assuming it's a colt  \nbreeding value skyrockets. At that moment, every subsequent race \nbecomes riskier. The prestige and possible purses must be weighed \nagainst the possibility of injury and wiping out two decades of \nbreeding revenue. That's why Animal Kingdom's win as a 4-year-old is \nthe exception, not the rule.\u0014\n\u0014\n The distance factor: The Derby is 1-1/4 miles, which is a great \nchallenge for still-developing horses going that far for the first \ntime. Truth is, many of them never will run that far again. The \nso-called classic distance is now an aberration in US racing. That \nmeans the winner might never again see the conditions that allowed \nhim to turn in that peak performance.\u0014\n\u0014\n The drugs factor: US horses race doped up. Legal medications, and \nperhaps illegal ones, have allowed horses to run when their bodies \ntell them to rest. Some argue the cumulative effort over generations \nhas weakened the breed. Surely, post-Derby injuries have shortened \nsome champions' careers. That's not to say the tragic, traumatic \ninjury of Barbaro in the 2006 Preakness is a result of the \nwatering-down of thoroughbreds. But Animal Kingdom, Super Saver and \nBig Brown certainly have had soundness issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong gone are the days when we saw great showdowns between Derby \nwinners, such as Alysheba vs. Ferdinand in the 1980s or Affirmed vs. \nSeattle Slew a decade earlier. We're fortunate every time a Derby \nwinner steps back on the track at all.\u0014",

    "title": "DEATH OF HELENA, 1ST CHRISTIAN ARCHAEOLOGIST",
    "words": "August 18, 328 \u0014\nDeath of Helena, 1st Christian Archaeologist\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nA character in a nursery rhyme may be closely connected with Church \nhistory and Christian archaeology. Probably you have sung \"Old King \nCole was a merry old soul.\" But did you know that the British have an \nancient tradition that Helena, the fourth-century Christian \narchaeologist was the daughter of King Coel of Colchester, \nimmortalized in this Mother Goose rhyme?\u0014\n\u0014\nIf this story is true, another interesting fact follows from it. \nHelena was the mother of Constantine, the first christianized Emperor \nof the Roman Empire. This means Emperor Constantine was the grandson \nof a Mother Goose hero! Since there actually was a Christian church \nat Colchester in 250 A.D.--about the time that Helena was born--it is \npossible that she become a Christian as a young person which would \nexplain Constantine's interest in the faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, so much of Helena's life is obscure or unknown, including \nthe date and place of her birth, that we cannot make the connection \nwith any certainty. Some historians theorize that since the emperor \nConstantine later named a town in Asia Minor Helenopolis in her \nhonor, she was born there, not in Britain, and was the daughter of an \ninnkeeper.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnclear too is when and where Helena met the Roman soldier \nConstantius Chlorus, or even if the two were ever officially married. \nWhat is certain is that Constantius and Helena were Constantine's \nparents. When Constantius became Caesar of Gaul, Spain, and Britain \nin 292, he dumped Helena in order to marry Theodora, daughter of his \npatron, the emperor Maximian. It was a cold-blooded political move \ndesigned to advance Constantius' career.\u0014\n\u0014\nHelena's son Constantine spent much time at the court of the emperor \nDiocletian and became a soldier like his father. When his troops \nlater proclaimed Constantine emperor in 306, one of his first acts \nwas to recall his mother from the political exile she had been in \never since her divorce and give her honors befitting the mother of a \nRoman Emperor. When Constantine embraced Christianity, Helena gave \nhim her strong support and encouragement. \u0014\n\u0014\nEighty year old Helena became so enthusiastic about the faith that \nshe traveled to the Holy Land. Her mission was about more than mere \ncuriosity, for as she traveled through the eastern imperial \nprovinces, she encouraged the establishment of the Christian faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nOnce in Palestine she sought out the original locations associated \nwith the life of Jesus, becoming the first known Christian \narchaeologist. Helena then oversaw the construction of several \nchurches Constantine had ordered built in Bethlehem, Calvary, Olivet, \nand Bethany at sites associated with Christ's life. A pagan temple to \nAphrodite had been built on the tomb site of Jesus' resurrection; it \nwas torn down and replaced by the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Later \nlegends arose that Helena also discovered the actual cross of Christ \nin the tomb beneath the church. In paintings she is often shown as a \nyoung and beautiful woman holding this cross. \u0014\n\u0014\nHelena's tour became a pattern for Christian pilgrims throughout the \nMiddle Ages. Even today, at Christmas time \"Manger Square\" in \nBethlehem is thronged with pilgrims coming to worship at the Church \nof the Nativity and at Easter, Christians follow the Via Dolorosa \n(Way of Sorrow) to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. \nBoth of these ancient churches in the Holy Land are connected with \nEmpress Helena.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Helena died on this day, August 18, 328, she was buried in the \nChurch of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBaring-Gould, S.

    "words": "Defective Fathers\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the criticisms of Christianity is that it is a crutch for the \nweak. Belief in God is considered by some to be nothing more than an \nillusion to satisfy unconscious needs. But Dr. Paul Vitz, Professor \nof Psychology at New York University, wondered the opposite: suppose \nit's the atheists who are engaging in unconscious wish fulfillment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo find the answer, Vitz scanned the last four centuries for patterns \nthat distinguish the lives of atheists from the lives of theists. \nAfter studying the lives of more than a dozen of the world's most \ninfluential atheists, Vitz discovered they all had one thing in \ncommon: defective relationships with their fathers. Vitz defines \n\"defective\" fathers as those who were dead, abusive, weak, or who \nabandoned their children. \u0014\n\u0014\nSigmund Freud wrote that his father was a sexual pervert. Thomas \nHobbes's father was an Anglican clergyman who got into a fight with \nanother man in the churchyard and, subsequently, abandoned his \nfamily. Ludwig Feuerbach, at age 13, was abandoned by his father, who \nopenly took up living with another woman in a different town. \nVoltaire fought constantly with his father, causing him later to \nreject his surname. \u0014\n\u0014\nSchopenhauer's father committed suicide when he was 16. Both Bertrand \nRussell and Nietzsche lost their fathers at the age of four. Sartre's \nfather died before Sartre was born, and Camus was a year old when he \nlost his father. Hume also lost his father in early childhood. \nHitler's father was a violent man who unmercifully beat Adolf, his \nmother, and even the family dog; he died when Adolf was 14. Stalin's \nfather also administered brutal beatings to his son.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, much more evidence needs to be obtained on the \"defective \nfather\" hypothesis. But the information already available is \nsubstantial; it is unlikely to be an accident.\u0014",

    "title": "DOES OSTEEN'S BOOK FIT WITH JESUS' SCANDALOUS GOSPEL",
    "words": "Does Osteen's Book Fit with Jesus' Scandalous Gospel?\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Chuck Queen\u0014\n June 21, 2012 \u0014\n\u0014\nJoel Osteen has been deemed by many as America's Pastor. He is the \npastor of the largest church in America and his books have sold in \nthe millions. \u0014\n\u0014\nI recently scanned Osteen's book, \"Your Best Life Now,\" in search of \nany serious reflection or teaching on the life, teaching and death of \nJesus and Jesus' call to discipleship presented in the Gospels\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's not to say that Osteen doesn't have some good things to say. \nHe talks about developing a healthy self-image, cultivating a \npositive outlook and claiming one's worth and value as a child of God \n all very good things.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut his emphasis on personal success seems to fly in the face of the \ngospel of Jesus in the Gospels.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe writes: \"If you will keep the right attitude, God will take all \nyour disappointments, broken dreams, the hurts and pains, and He'll \nadd up all the trouble and sorrow that's been inflicted upon you, and \nHe will pay you back with twice as much peace, joy, happiness and \nsuccess ... If you just believe, if you'll put your trust and \nconfidence in God, He will give you double for your trouble.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReally, Brother Joel, double for my trouble? Is that what Jesus says?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples that because he was \npersecuted, they can expect to be persecuted, too, since the servant \nis not greater than the master (John 15:20).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus turns the values of the world on their head when he says, \n\"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for \ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:11).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus rebukes his disciples for desiring upward mobility and worldly \nversions of success: \"You know that among the Gentiles those whom \nthey recognize as their rulers lord it over them. But it is not so \namong you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your \nservant ... For the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve\" \n(Mark 10:42-44).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus tells his disciples: \"In the world you face persecution. But \ntake courage: I have conquered the world!\" (John 16:33).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus overcomes the world, not through worldly success, but through \nworldly defeat, through the suffering love endured on the cross, \nthrough bearing the hate and violence of the world without returning \nthe hate and violence.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Luke's Gospel, Jesus says: \"Woe to you who are rich, for you have \nalready received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for \nyou will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and \nweep. Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how \ntheir ancestors treated the false prophets\" (Luke 6:24-26).\u0014\n\u0014\nHow do these words fit a gospel of success?\u0014\n\u0014\nPlease don't misunderstand me: I am not knocking anyone's desire to \nbe successful in work, career, education or in any other endeavor one \nundertakes.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs far as I am concerned, the desire to be successful within the \nboundaries of an honest, humble, caring, compassionate and generous \nlife is a noble aspiration. But let's be clear: It is not the gospel \nof Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nOsteen says: \"Think big. Think increase. Think abundance. Think more \nthan enough.\" After he makes that statement, he tells the following \nstory.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears ago, a famous golfer was invited by the king of Saudi Arabia to \nplay in a golf tournament. He accepted the invitation, and the king \nflew his private jet in to pick him up.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the event, as the golfer was getting on the plane to return to \nthe United States, the king told him that he would like to give him a \ngift for making this time so special. The golfer told the king that a \ngift was not necessary, but the king insisted.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo the golfer said, \"Well, I collect golf clubs. Why don't you get me \na golf club?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn his flight back, the golfer wondered what sort of golf club the \nking might get him. A few weeks later a certified letter came in the \nmail from the king of Saudi Arabia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe golfer, at first, wondered what this had to do with a golf club. \nWhen he opened the envelope, to his great surprise, inside he \ndiscovered a deed to a 500-acre golf course in America. Pretty nice \ngolf club, don't you think?\u0014\n\u0014\nOsteen writes, \"We serve the Most High God, and His dream for your \nlife is so much bigger and better than you can even imagine. It's \ntime to enlarge your vision!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCertainly, Jesus challenges us to enlarge our vision, but is that \nJesus' vision? A 500-acre golf course? Personal success and \nfulfillment? Is that the greater story and larger vision Jesus \nintended through his proclamation of the \"the kingdom of God\"?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples on three different \noccasions that he, the Son of Man, is going to be rejected, suffer \nmany things and be killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the first occasion when Jesus breaks the news, he then tells them: \n\"If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and \ntake up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their \nlife will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for \nthe sake of the gospel will save it\" (Mark 8:34-35).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis call to discipleship comes at a critical juncture in the story \nand sets the pattern for a life of discipleship to Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nI don't believe God calls us to be poor, though Luke's version of the \nGospel could be read that way. Some individuals and communities, like \nthe Franciscans, are called to such a lifestyle.\u0014\n\u0014\nGenerally speaking though, I believe God wants all of God's children \nall across the world to have enough, not just to survive, but to \nthrive, to live a flourishing life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat will never happen by following Osteen's teaching of pursuing \nyour personal best.\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' call to discipleship is a call to pursue the way of the cross. \nIt's not about gain and glory; it's not about acquisition and \nacclamation; it's not about self-fulfillment and success. It's about \nself-denial and taking up one's cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat doesn't mean there is no joy. There's plenty of joy, real joy, \nnot the kind of joy that money and power can buy, not the kind of joy \nthat comes by being successful and happy by U.S. standards.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's the paradox of the gospel; there is joy and peace and inner \ncontentment in the way of the cross, but it is not found on the path \nto personal success.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is found on the path of self-surrender, self-sacrifice and service \nto others.\u0014\n\u0014\nChuck Queen is pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Frankfort, Ky.\u0014",

    "words": "The Millennium, with a capital M, usually refers to the belief that \nJesus Christ will literally return to Earth and establish a \nvictorious thousand-year reign on Earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat belief is based on a literal interpretation of Revelation \n20:1-6, the only place such an idea is mentioned in the New \nTestament. Literal belief in that passage is called millennialism.\u0014\n\u0014\nProphecies about when the Millennium will begin have been many. One \nof the best known in recent years was Harold Camping's prophecy that \nthe End Times would begin on May 21, 2011.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs some of you will remember, I prophesied that Camping's prophecy \nwas wrong  and I was right.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot nearly as well known are the declarations of Ronald Weinland, who \nidentifies himself as \"a minister in the Church of God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nEarlier this year, he prophesied that the world as we know it would \nend on May 27. Now, he is saying that \"Jesus Christ will return on \nthe final day of Pentecost 2013.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAn outrageous website with the address NowTheEndBegins.com doesn't \ngive an exact date, but links the End Times to the U.S. presidential \nelection this year, the election that, according to that site, pits \n\"the Mormon vs. the Muslim.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere has been talk about the beginning of the Millennium for a long \ntime now. From soon after the death and resurrection of Jesus, some \n(most?) Christians seem to have believed that Jesus' return to earth \nwas imminent.\u0014\n\u0014\n(What they actually believed may have been distorted by later \ninterpretation, though.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter Revelation was written, belief spread that Jesus would soon \nestablish a victorious thousand-year reign on Earth.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome theologians in the early centuries of Christianity espoused \nmillennialism, although it was also declared heretical by some church \ngroups.\u0014\n\u0014\nAround the year 1000, there was a flurry of millennialist ideas, as \nthere was again in the first half of the 16th century in connection \nwith the new emphasis on the Bible by the Reformers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The Tailor-King: The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptist Kingdom of \nMnster\" (1999), a book I recently read, tells about the tragic and \nembarrassing (especially for those of us who identify with the \nAnabaptist tradition) story of misguided millennialism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAuthor Anthony Arthur (1937-2009) tells how some German Anabaptists \ncame to believe strongly that \"the time was imminent for the \napocalyptic final battle between God and Satan. It would occur in the \nyears 1534-1535: the place would be in northern Germany, in the small \nWestphalian city of Mnster,\" which is about 125 miles southeast of \nAmsterdam.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough Arthur's date is slightly different, most historians give \nJune 25, 1535, as the final battle at Mnster and the capture of Jan \nvan Leyden, a tailor who had become \"King of the Anabaptists\" in \nSeptember of the previous year.\u0014\n\u0014\nVan Leyden was executed in January 1536, and the misguided ordeal was \nover.\u0014\n\u0014\nMillennial fever was largely the cause of the debacle in Mnster. But \nthe Christians infected with that fever then misread the signs of the \ntimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nSimilarly, some Christians, who now talk about us living in the End \nTimes  on the cusp of the Millennium  based on what is happening in \nthe Near East (in Israel and in Iran) and in the United States, are \nprobably mistaken also.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, the whole idea of a literal Millennium is most likely an \nerroneous one.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeroy Seat was a missionary to Japan from 1966-2004 and is both \nprofessor emeritus of Seinan Gakuin University and pastor emeritus of \nFukuoka International Church\u0014",

    "words": "Do horses grieve?\u0014\nPosted: Monday, October 02, 2006 Thoroughbred Times\u0014\n\u0014\nEmotions long thought to exist only in humans actually may influence \nunusual behavior in horses\u0014\n\u0014\nby Kenneth L. Marcella, D.V.M.\u0014\n\u0014\nTony and Pops were the best of friends and had known each other for \nyears. They had worked together long ago and had since moved to the \nsame place together. Their days now were the slow and easy routine of \nretirement, and neighbors often remarked that you would never see \nPops out walking or perhaps eating without Tony right there with him. \u0014\n\u0014\nBut recently, Pops had begun to feel poorly, and the news from his \ndoctor was not good. Pops continued to decline. Then one day, with \nTony still by his side, he passed away.\u0014\n\u0014\nTony was devastated. He became uninterested in food and began to lose \nweight. He stopped interacting with those around him and became \nseverely withdrawn. Without Pops there, Tony quit going for walks or \nmoving around much. Lack of activity began to affect his body, and he \nlost muscle and conditioning. His arthritis, which until the death of \nhis friend had been fairly well controlled, became worse. Losing \nweight sapped his energy and weakened his immune system. He developed \nsome respiratory problems, started to become anemic, and was rapidly \ngoing downhill. \u0014\n\u0014\nTony was showing all the signs of physical and psychological \ndepression.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is a very common scenario; the loss of a family member, loved \none, or close friend can be a significantly stressful event for \npeople, especially the elderly. But Tony and Pops were equine \nbuddies, and the increasing longevity of horses seen over the past \ndecade is making situations like this even more common. More horses \nare spending significant time together, sometimes ten years or more, \nmaking the death of a herd mate a significant event for the surviving \nhorse. \u0014\n\u0014\nClaudia Barton, D.V.M., a cancer specialist at Texas A&M University, \ndeals with death, loss, and grieving in the course of her daily work. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Outside of some anecdotal and observational information concerning \nelephants, there is almost nothing written on the subject of \nanimal-animal loss,\" Barton said. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lack of documentation on grief in animals may be because grief is \nexceptionally difficult to quantify and therefore difficult to study. \n\"Environmental and habitual changes that occur routinely in animals' \nlives may alter their behaviors and make the evaluation of true grief \neven more difficult,\" Barton said.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrief in human terms\u0014\n\u0014\nVeterinarians have come to see the effects of a pet's passing as so \npotentially important to their clients that numerous veterinary \nschools and private practices now employ grief counselors. Still, the \nissue of loss receives little scientific attention when it concerns a \nhorse reacting to the death of a close partner or herd mate. Some \nresearchers imply that imparting human feelings and emotions to \nanimals (anthropomorphism) is inappropriate. But owners, trainers, \nand others who spend considerable time with horses disagree. They \nfeel they can recognize in horses emotions usually reserved for \nhumans. Most veterinarians also recognize these behavioral \nexpressions in animals. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn our example of Pops and Tony, most veterinarians would recognize \nTony's behavior as the classic presentation of depression, and most \nhorse owners would say he acts sad. Some scientists and behaviorists \nagree, and they feel there is more science to the way animals act.\u0014\nIdentifying emotions\u0014\n\u0014\nSharon Crowell-Davis, D.V.M., Ph.D., a board-certified animal \nbehaviorist at the University of Georgia, is certain these \ninterpretive evaluations of how animals feel in response to specific \nsituations are fairly accurate. She also has the science to prove it. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"The use of PET [positron emission tomography] scans provides \nresearchers with an evaluation of mental states based on brain \nactivity and neurochemical changes noted in response to specific \nstimuli,\" she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen undergoing a PET scan, a person is presented with a stimulus \nthat causes a particular emotion. Pictures, smells, and sounds can be \nused as stimuli. If a person is shown a picture that incites anger, \nfor instance, the PET scan records the person's brain activity and \nthe chemical changes that occur following that stimulus. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"When animals are recorded showing the same patterns of brain \nactivity and the same brain chemical changes that correspond to a \nparticular human emotion or mood state, it would not be logical for \nus to assume that they are not experiencing similar feelings,\" \nCrowell-Davis said. Based on this thinking and on how closely the \nreactions of some horses correspond to the classical signs of \nclinical depression with very intense individual responses, the loss \nof a close companion is now believed to be felt as sadness by some \nhorses and recognized as an expression of grief.\u0014",

    "words": "October 8, 2012, 7:14 am  New York Times\u0014\n\u0014\nDebating the Death Sentence for Honor Killings In India\u0014\nBy NIHARIKA MANDHANA\u0014\n\u0014\nFive people from Delhi were sentenced to death on Friday for the \n\"honor killing\" of a couple, the latest in a series of death penalty \njudgments in India for the murder of young people who wish to marry \noutside their caste or religious group.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe victims, who belonged to different castes and hoped to get \nmarried, were reportedly tied with ropes and beaten with sticks and \npipes before being electrocuted to death in 2010.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Such cruel and barbaric acts cannot be allowed to take place in \ndeveloped metropolitan cities,\" the sessions judge, Ramesh Kumar \nSinghal, said while sentencing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo-called honor killings take place in many parts of India, \nparticularly in the northern states of Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan and \nUttar Pradesh, where caste continues to be a decisive factor in \nmarriage. Young men and women who violate the traditional rules that \nprohibit marriage outside their own castes and religious communities \nare regularly ostracized, tortured and sometimes even murdered by \nmembers of their family, village or community. On some occasions, \nself-appointed caste councils, called khap panchayats, pass diktats \nordering such attacks, claiming they hope to protect the honor of \ntheir communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn recent years, India's highest court has taken a strong position \nagainst this practice. \"There is nothing honorable in such killings,\" \nthe Supreme Court said in 2006, \"and in fact they are nothing but \nbarbaric and shameful acts of murder committed by brutal, feudal \nminded persons who deserve harsh punishment.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, the court went one step further and prescribed the death \nsentence to punish those guilty of honor killings, saying it was time \nto \"stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on \nour nation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"All persons who are planning to perpetrate honor killings should \nknow that the gallows await them,\" the court said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut not all institutions in India agree with the court's stance. In a \nreport released in August this year, India's Law Commission, an \nadvisory body of legal experts, criticized the court's directive, \nsaying that the death sentence in India is to be used \"only in very \nexceptional and rare cases,\" when \"aggravating and mitigating \ncircumstances\" are found.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commission found that since the decision was given, the lower \ncourts of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi had sentenced almost all accused in \ncases of honor killings to death. Disapproving of this trend, the \ncommission said that each case needed to be judged on its own facts \nand circumstances and criticized what it called the Supreme Court's \n\"blanket direction\" to give the death penalty in all instances of \nhonor killings.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No hard and fast rule can be laid down,\" the report said, in sharp \ncontrast to the court's decision prescribing the death penalty for \nhonor killings committed \"for whatever reason.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the 2011 case decided by the Supreme Court, a man strangled his \ndaughter to death for having a relationship against his will. The \ncourt said that if a person is unhappy with the behavior of a \nrelative or a member of his caste, \"the maximum he can do is to cut \noff social relations,\" but he \"cannot take the law into his own hands \nby committing violence or giving threats of violence.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIndia has retained the death penalty, but since the 1980s this \nextreme form of punishment has been used only in the \"rarest of rare\" \ncases. Statistics show that even where the death penalty is given, \nexecution is uncommon. According to Amnesty International's recent \ndata, 435 people were sentenced to death in India between 2007 and \n2011, but none have been hanged.\u0014\n\u0014\nHonor killings, which have been under intense media scrutiny, now \nfall within the \"rarest of rare\" category. In a bid to combat the \npractice more effectively, the government began considering various \nlegal proposals in 2009, including an amendment to the country's \npenal code to explicitly mention honor killings. The Law Commission, \ntasked with evaluating this proposal, advised against it, saying the \namendment would cause \"interpretational difficulties.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, the Law Commission proposed a law to ban the now infamous \n\"khap panchayats,\" which are different from the country's gram \npanchayats, or local self-governments. The bodies of community elders \nhave been called \"undemocratic\" by the government, and the report \nlabels them a \"pernicious practice.\" \"Often young couples who fall in \nlove have to seek shelter in the police lines or protection homes to \navoid the wrath of kangaroo courts,\" the report said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe proposed law seeks to prohibit any group from gathering \"to \ndeliberate on, or condemn\" any legal marriage, \"on the basis that the \nmarriage has dishonored the caste or community tradition or brought \ndisrepute to the family, village or locality.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe intention of the law, the report said, is to \"curb the social \nevil of caste councils or panchayats\" that endanger the \"life and \nliberty of young persons.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\t\tCopyright 2012 \tThe New York Times Company\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, at least 869 women were killedby their families in \nPakistan after marrying or dating unapproved men, or being raped. \nThat's the number reported.

    "words": "Does It Matter that Evangelicals Became Prolife Recently?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne pundit says it proves our biblical views are driven by politics. \nNot quite. \u0014\n\u0014\nMark Galli, 11/7/2012  Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTo call early evangelicals \"pro-choice\" in today's context implies \nthat they held pro-choice views in the same spirit as many pro-choice \nadvocates do today. Dudley is correct is suggesting that some \npro-choice advocates do indeed believe that the fetus has moral \nvalue, and that they don't necessarily think abortion is the \nprincipal answer to the control of human reproductionmy apologies if \nI implied otherwise. The problem is that a large part of the \npro-choice communitywhich includes millions beyond the U.S.do \nindeed fail to see that the fetus has moral value, and do indeed \nchampion abortion as just another method of birth control. This must \nbe the subject of another essay, but the astonishing rate at which \ngirls are aborted merely because of their gender (the United Nations \nestimates that as many as 200 million girls are missing because of \nthis) suggests that entire nations are turning a blind eye to moral \nvalue of these lives. 1960s evangelicals were often pro-choice, yes, \nbut the framework in which they held that positionwhen abortion was \nrare and exceptionalno longer pertains. Today pro-choice advocates \nstubbornly hold on to their views when abortion is no longer rare \n(over a million children are aborted every year in the U.S. alone) or \nexceptional (and practically government policy in some places), and \nthe practice has led to a brutal gendercide.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs I noted in my last essay, only when Northern Christians discovered \nhow absolutely horrific slavery was did they change or harden their \nviews about slavery. Likewise to say evangelicals were pro-choice at \na different time and different historical setting, while true, does \nnot convey accurately the context in which those beliefs were held. \nOne reason many evangelicals converted to the pro-life camp is \nbecause they finally recognized the terrible and inevitable \nconsequences of pro-choice policy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat being said, one part of Dudley's argument feels \"fake,\" to me \nbecause, as a fully accurate title would have it, \"it is incomplete \nto such a degree as to seriously misunderstand the reality.\" (But \nthat makes for very bad title copy, no?). Seriously: Dudley's \nargument is grounded in a worldview that is reductionisticthat is, \nhe argues that it was politics and really nothing else that tipped \nthe scales for evangelical beliefs about abortion, and for their \ninterpretation of Scripture. As I've suggested: Who can quarrel with \nthe simple fact that abortion politics helped shape evangelical \nopinion and biblical exegesis?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut after noting how hard it was for early evangelical abortion foes \nto get their fellow evangelicals to take abortion more seriously, \nDudley says, \"In 1980, Falwell used his unparalleled platform to \nchange all that\" [italics added]. He went on:\u0014\n\u0014\nDeclaring that \"[t]he Bible clearly teaches that life begins at \nconception,\" he allied with like-minded evangelicals to disseminate \nthat interpretation across America. Falwell's assertion that this \nposition was the obvious one in Scripture necessarily implied that \nthe host of intelligent, pious evangelicals who came before him just \ndidn't read their Bibles closely enough. It also made the Bible say \nthe same thing his Catholic political allies believed (though \nCatholics believed it for other reasons).Although this was \npolitically convenient, Falwell's interpretations were just as much a \nproduct of his time as those of his evangelical predecessors.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo begin with, this paragraph imagines that evangelicals are mindless \ndrones who blindly follow the lead of any charismatic figure in our \nmidst: Falwell asserts that the Bible says X about abortion, and \nevery evangelical falls into line. The assumption is laughable. If \nanything, if a charismatic leader declares the Bible says X, two new \nevangelical movements and four new denominations will form to refute \nthat interpretation! In other words, to use an old analogy, it's as \neasy to get evangelicals to rally around a common biblical \ninterpretation as it is to herd cats. When it happens, it's pretty \nmuch a miracle.\u0014\n\u0014\nI can speak with personal knowledge of large swaths of evangelical \nleaders and groups who had little-to-no sympathy for Jerry \nFalwellsome of us were deeply hostile to him and his politics and \nmany of his biblical views. Many of us were living in a parallel \nuniverse, coming to see the evils of abortion in our way.\u0014\n\u0014\nTake the previous editor in chief of Christianity Today, David Neff. \nIn an email, he writes,\u0014\n\u0014\nI know that my own conversion on the abortion issue was not at all \ninfluenced by Jerry Falwell or by Franky Schaeffer. It was influenced \nby C. Everett Koop and by Michael Gorman's InterVarsity Press book, \nAbortion and the Early Church. Koop provided a cultural argument and \nGorman grounded it firmly in the Christian tradition.\u0014\n\u0014\nDudley fails to realize how many key evangelical leaders were going \nthrough this same process of conversion as was Neff. It was not \npolitics but ethics, history, and a fresh look at Scripture that \ntipped the scales.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/Does It Matter that \nEvangelicals Became Prolife Recently?\u0014",

    "words": "Deaths in dumpster expose plight of China's street kids \u0014\n\u0014\nBy Hilary Whiteman, CNN\u0014\n\u0014\nupdated November 21, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nHong Kong (CNN) -- Eight Chinese officials have been fired or \nsuspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on \nfumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm, according to state-run \nmedia.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bodies of the boys, aged between 9 and 13, were found by a trash \ncollector on Friday in Bijie in China's southwestern Guizhou \nprovince, Xinhua reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are believed to have died the night before, as rain fell and \ntemperatures plunged to as low as six degrees Celsius (43 degrees \nFahrenheit).\u0014\n\u0014\nSix officials have lost their jobs, including the principals of two \nlocal schools and four government officials in charge of education \nand civil affairs in Qixingguan district where Bijie is located. Two \ndeputy heads from the same departments were also suspended pending an \ninvestigation.\u0014\n\u0014\nUsers on China's social media platforms expressed shock and disgust, \nwith some questioning how society could have allowed such young \nchildren to fall through the cracks.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's not uncommon to see several children living in a household with \nan elderly couple in rural China. These are the left behind children.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: \"China is \nsupposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect \nits own children. At the age when they should be enjoying a happy \nchildhood these poor kids are wandering and dying on the streets.\" \n(@Datounaonao)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnother said: \"I just can't believe this is a story happening in my \ncountry today...where are the \"relevant departments\" doing on this? \nAnd \"where are the kids' parents? Why give birth to children and then \nabandon them?\" (@Dongsir)\u0014\n\u0014\nDays after their deaths, details of the boys' lives emerged in local \npress. They all belonged to the same extended family, the sons of \nthree brothers.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo of the fathers, Tao Yuanwu and Tao Xueyuan, were rural migrants, \nwho had moved from Guizhou to the special economic zone of Shenzhen \nnear the Hong Kong border, where they worked as rubbish collectors.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other father, Tao Jinyou, a poor man who was said to work long \nhours tending fields, told Xinhua that he and his wife paid little \nattention to their own son, let alone their nephews.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sometimes they didn't even come home at night,\" he said. Persistent \ntruants, the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks \nbefore they were found dead. \"At first, I sent (my son) back to \nschool by force,\" Tao said. \"But every time he'd run away again, so I \nknew it was hopeless.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere are estimated to be more than 150,000 street children in China, \naccording to official figures quoted by Xinhua. However, Dale \nRutstein of UNICEF China said up to 1.5 million children were thought \nto be fending for themselves across the country but, given the fluid \nnature of homelessness, it was hard to keep track.\u0014\n\u0014\nRutstein says the presence of street children is obvious in some \ncities, but it's safe to assume that many remain in rural towns, the \nbyproduct of a huge demographic shift in China, as parents move to \nbooming cities for work.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"It's not uncommon to see several children living in a household with \nan elderly couple in rural China. These are the left behind children. \nRight now people are coping the best they can,\" Rutstein said.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's estimated there are 55 million \"left behind\" children in China, \nthe sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved \nto the cities for a better life.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"We would say in UNICEF that that's one of the most significant \nchallenges for China right now, because all the data shows these \nchildren have lower nutrition, suffer a higher rate of accidents and \ninjuries and are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation,\" Rutstein \nsaid.\u0014\n\u0014\nState media reported that four of the five boys found dead in the \ndumpster were being cared for by their aging, blind grandmother who \nhad difficulty caring for herself.\u0014\n\u0014\nA local resident told CCTV that neighbors had noticed the boys \nwandering the streets. \"They took a shabby shed in a construction \nsite near the dumpster and ate some discarded vegetables in the \nmarket and played football that they had picked up,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nLast year, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs launched a nationwide \ncampaign to return \"vagrant\" children to their homes. Once sent back, \nthe children would be placed in government-run shelters, according to \nXinhua.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis tragedy is a wake-up call that something needs to be done to \nimprove the working and living conditions of migrant workers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Street orphans should be placed in the care of welfare institutions \nor foster families if their guardians cannot be found,\" the article \nsaid, quoting the vice minister of civil affairs.\u0014\n\u0014\nDespite efforts to pull millions out of poverty in China over recent \ndecades, the country still lacks modern child welfare systems seen in \nthe West, Rutstein said.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The concept of social workers, for instance, which is quite well \nknown in Europe and North America, is very, very new in China. \nChina's aware of this and there are many efforts in place right now \nto professionalize the whole system of social workers, to introduce \nalternatives to institutionalization, or just sending children to a \nstate orphanage, which traditionally has been the main response to \nthese kinds of situations,\" he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn opinion piece published Wednesday in China Daily asked whether \nauthorities were too quick to lay the blame on local officials and \nsuggested that major changes were needed to reduce the number of \n\"left behind children.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"This tragedy is a wake-up call that something needs to be done to \nimprove the working and living conditions of migrant workers, so they \ncan settle in the cities where they work and enjoy the same rights as \ntheir urban counterparts. This would enable them to have their \nchildren live with them,\" it said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe plight of the dead children in Guizhou has been compared on \nsocial media to the tale of the Little Match Girl, a Hans Christian \nAnderson story of a girl ignored by the rich who froze to death after \ntrying to warm herself with a lit match.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Wednesday, messages of condolences for the five boys were still \nbeing posted on Weibo.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Hope they won't feel cold anymore in heaven,\" @Qingyu_aneya said.\u0014\n\u0014\n@KongXia added: \"Rest in peace, don't reincarnate in China...\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReferring to Beijing's decision to turn on the city's heating system \ntwo weeks early this year due to colder temperatures, one of China's \nmost popular fairy tale writers, Zheng Yuanjie, posted: \"Beijing \nspent 800 million [yuan] to start the heating system 15 days ahead of \ntime, but you're out of the reach. Hope the 'The Little Match Boys' \ncan forgive us in heaven.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Dying teacher battled son after attack in classroom, \nsaving students\u0014\n\u0014\nBy NBC News staff   Dec. 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice say a Wyoming community college teacher James Krumm was a hero \nfor fighting off his son on Friday, potentially saving the lives of \nsix of his computer science students.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I can tell you the courage that was demonstrated by Mr. Krumm was \nabsolutely without equal,\" Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said, \naccording to The Associated Press.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn Friday, Christopher Krumm, 25, stabbed his fathers girlfriend to \ndeath before driving to Casper College, where his father was teaching \na class. He was equipped with a compound bow and arrow and two \nknives, which he carried into the building under a blanket.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen he entered the classroom, Christopher Krumm stood about four \nfeet from his father, pulled back the bowstring and shot an arrow \nthrough his fathers head, the Casper Tribune reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis father, James Krumm, 56, fell but got back up and struggled with \nhis son, the Tribune reported.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats when Christopher Krumm stabbed himself, then plunged the knife \ninto his fathers chest, killing him, Walsh said.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen police arrived, the elder Krumm had died and the younger was \ntaking his final breaths.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack at his home, girlfriend Heidi Arnolds body lay in front of the \nhouse for 11 hours, neighbor Heather Meier told the Tribune. Arnold, \n42, was barefoot and her midriff was visible, Meier said. Authorities \ndidnt cover her body.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I cant keep it out of my head,\" Meier told the Tribune.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice believe that Christopher Krumm drove from Vernon, Conn., where \nhe was living, and booked into a motel on the outskirts of town on \nThursday, the day before the killings.\u0014\n\u0014\nMatt DiPinto, a neighbor in his apartment building in Vernon, \ndescribed an interaction he had with Krumm to the Hartford Courant \nnewspaper. Krumm was giving him a ride back from McDonalds.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He told me his dad gave him Asperger's (syndrome), that his dad \nshouldn't have passed it on,\" DiPinto said. \"He said his dad should \nbe castrated. I didn't know him that well, he just kind of said it \nout of nowhere, so that kind of threw me off a little.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the Casper College website, James Krumm described himself as a \nteacher born in London, England and partly raised in Germany. He \nstarted teaching at Casper College in 2002.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\u0014",

    "title": "DAVID LIVINGSTONE KEPT A DIARY",
    "words": "One morning in 1872, David Livingstone wrote this in his diary: \n\"March 19, my birthday. My Jesus, my King, my Life, my All, I again \ndedicate my whole self to Thee. Accept me, and grant, O gracious \nFather, that ere the year is gone I may finish my work. In Jesus' \nname I ask it. Amen.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n Just one year later, servants came to check on their master's delay. \nThey found him on his knees in prayer. He was dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nLivingstones testimony is powerful on many levels. But the one that \nis most striking is his claim upon Jesus as my king. This has been \na common declaration of the church throughout the ages. Even in our \nera, when democratic social movements topple kings and weigh in \nagainst tyrannical regimes, the largest social organization in the \nentire human race, the Church of Jesus Christ, holds as one of its \ncore tenets of belief that Jesus is King.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarys beautiful song is one of the key passages undergirding all New \nTestament theological testimonies that declare Jesus to be King. Why \nshould Jesus be a king? He was born into a poor family during a time \nof foreign occupation of their country. He was never trained in \nschools of leadership, and had no desire to claim any throne. He \nseemed to alienate the rich and powerful, rebuffed the efforts of his \ndisciples to start an armed rebellion, hushed the adulation of those \nwho were the recipients of his mighty power, told the existing rulers \nthat if he had a kingdom it was not in direct competition with theirs \non their terms, and died an ignoble death meant for the worst of \nsocietys scalawags.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet from the first connections people made with Jesus, he was often \nidentified as king. Foreigners traveled hundreds of miles to Judea \nwhen he was born, telling folks along the way of their astrological \nreadings and projections: a truly great international king had been \nborn! Palestines powerful King Herod was afraid of Jesus, and felt \nhe might be competing for the throne Herod had worked so hard to \ncontrol. Jesus own words, while never clearly self-identifying him \nas a king, were constantly filled with language about the Kingdom of \nHeaven or the Kingdom of God, of which he seemed to know a great deal \nmore than anyone who was not directly connected with the key \ngoverning authority. And then, a Roman centurion assigned to Jesus \nexecution squad, made the remarkable testimony, using language \notherwise reserved only for the Emperor himself, that surely this \nman was the Son of God. Somehow people kept viewing Jesus as a king.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the affirmations only continued after Jesus disappeared from the \nscene. He is above all principalities and powers, Paul wrote, and \nsaid that every knee in heaven and on earth would bow to him. John \nsaw him as an all-powerful ruler (Revelation 1), and had a vision of \nhim as conquering king (19). Even in their prayers, members of the \nearly church addressed Jesus as Sovereign Lord, a term that could \nhardly be less than royal acknowledgement (Acts 5).\u0014",

    "title": "DEATH THREATS FOR MORMON WOMEN WEARING PANTS",
    "words": "Mormon Women Set Out \nto Take a Stand, in Pants\u0014\n\u0014\nBy TIMOTHY PRATT    New York Times  December 19, 2012\u0014\n\u0014\nLAS VEGAS  A call for Mormon women to wear pants to church, begun \nthis month by a small group of women, has stretched across the globe, \nbut not before creating a backlash and even generating death threats. \u0014\n\u0014\nWear Pants to Church, an event on Sunday, was meant to draw \nattention to the role of women in the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints, using attire as a symbolic first salvo in a larger \nstruggle over gender inequalities. \u0014\n\u0014\nThough the Mormon Church has no official policy against women wearing \npants to church, many say they feel peer pressure to wear a dress, \nparticularly in the Western United States, organizers said. So on \nSunday, thousands of Mormon women arrived at church in pants in \nplaces like Cambridge, England; Heidelberg, Germany; Austin, Tex.; \nthe Marshall Islands; and Kotzebue, Alaska. A number of the women \nposted their photos on Facebook and other Web sites. Others said they \ncould not participate because they were fearful of ridicule or \nreprimand. \u0014\n\u0014\nA Google map, begun so women could show they participated, included \nposts like this one, from Kari White, in Sheboygan, Wis.: felt free \nto be an authentic me for the first time in my nearly 5 years of \nmembership in the church. \u0014\n\u0014\nJoanna Brooks, a professor at San Diego State University and the \nauthor of The Book of Mormon Girl: A Memoir of an American Faith, \ncalled it the largest concerted Mormon feminist effort in history. \u0014\n\u0014\nA church spokesman, Eric Hawkins, declined to comment on the event. \u0014\n\u0014\nOrganizers hope the dialogue will now expand to include issues like \nthe ordination of women, or women taking on more responsibilities at \nchurch events. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey also cited the pronounced role of the Boy Scouts in the church  \nboys routinely become troop leaders in the organization, but girls \nhave no similar outlet with the Girl Scouts  and the fact that young \nmen are required to go on two-year missions to spread the faith, but \nyoung women are not. The result: the vast majority of Mormon \nmissionaries are men. \u0014\n\u0014\nWear Pants to Church was the idea of Stephanie Lauritzen of Salt \nLake City. She and some fellow Mormon women who belonged to a group \ncalled All Enlisted posted an events page on Facebook on Dec. 9. \nWithin days, thousands had pledged their support, but one person \nthreatened to shoot women who showed up in pants. Ms. Lauritzen, 26, \nalso received threats on her own Facebook page that are being \ninvestigated by Facebook and the local authorities, she said. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Dec. 11, the Salt Lake City-based church leadership issued a \nstatement: Generally church members are encouraged to wear their \nbest clothing as a sign of respect for the Savior, but we dont \ncounsel people beyond that. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe All Enlisted friends page has drawn hundreds of posts, both for \nand against the idea. JoEllen Swarts of Las Vegas wrote: What is \nwrong with all you women??? If youre not happy with the LDS church, \nmove on, find another place of worship. You will not change Mormon \nDoctrine. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt a suburban church in Green Valley, Nev., less than 10 miles from \nthe Las Vegas Strip, women filed into church on Sunday morning, most \nwearing dresses (most men wore coats and ties). Bishop Michael Durham \nwas somewhat dismissive of the pants idea. I think wearing pants is \nnot liberating, he said. Liberation comes from inside. Im not sure \nthey have a clear understanding of the churchs position on gender. \u0014\n\u0014\nSoraya Cordeiro said she wore pants because she had to take a long \nbus ride to her job at the Venetian hotel after church and found \nwearing a dress to be a hassle. She said she had never faced rebuke \nfor her choice of attire. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn Monday, a private All Enlisted Facebook page had collected about \nthe same number of negative experiences as positive experiences \nfrom women across the country. Julie Tuovi Baker Hansen, a lawyer in \nBurbank, Calif., who participated while visiting a Salt Lake City \nsuburb, said she was surprised to see a man raise his hand and say, \nWomen who want to wear pants, they just dont know how to follow the \nLord. \u0014\n\u0014\nMs. Hansen, the only woman wearing pants in a room of about 50 \npeople, said she felt pretty irritated. \u0014\n\u0014\nAimee Hickman, the editor of a Mormon feminist magazine called \nExponent II, said she originally had reservations about the event. \nBut then she saw the negative reaction by church members online. \nThis made me rethink my original position, Ms. Hickman said. The \nattention drawn to the effort, she added, has people talking about \nMormon gender roles more than anything Ive seen.\u0014",

(AP)  The father of a 7-year-old girl police say was \ngang-raped is defending three of the men accused.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe father said Thursday that the three men tried to get his daughter \nout of the apartment where she was attacked. He says they were kept \nfrom helping by others who held them at gunpoint.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Associated Press does not identify sex crime victims and is not \nnaming the father so as not to identify his daughter.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice say the girl was prostituted out by her 15-year-old \nstepsister, who watched as she was raped by as many as seven men and \nboys at a party March 28.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fathers comments came after 20-year-old Gregory Leary was \nordered held on $500,000 bail. He is among those the father is \ndefending.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe lawyer for one of five suspects accused of gang-raping a \n7-year-old New Jersey girl who prosecutors say was sold for sex by \nher stepsister suggested Thursday in court that the child had been \npressured to make up the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe was not raped, was not gang-raped, Robin Lord, attorney for \nsuspect Gregory Leary, said. Im 100 percent certain that the \n7-year-old was not sexually assaulted. The allegations will not be \nsubstantiated by any forensic evidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nLeary, accused of participating in the rape and endangering the \nwelfare of a child, was ordered held on $500,000 bail. He is also \naccused of statutory rape; Trenton police say he also had sex with \nthe girls 15-year-old stepsister.\u0014\n\u0014\nMy son didnt rape anyone, Learys mother, Robin David, said \noutside the courthouse. My son is a loving child and could never \nhurt anyone. I feel terrible about my child and anyone elses who is \ninvolved in this. \u0014\n\u0014\nPolice have said that the stepsister was paid for sex at a party in a \nvacant apartment, then gave the younger girl money and encouraged the \nmen to let them touch her. Police say it then progressed to rape by \nas many as seven men and boys. The stepsister has also been arrested.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe child was treated at a hospital, and police say there is DNA \nevidence of the crime.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn all, five men and boys have been charged with raping the \n7-year-old. Besides Leary, they are 19-year-old Timear Lewis and \nthree boys ages 13, 14 and 17.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese boys are victims of their own hormones, Lord said.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice have said they expect additional arrests.\u0014\n\u0014\n___\u0014\nAssociated Press writer Aaron Morrison contributed to this report.\u0014\nCopyright 2010 The Associated Press.\u0014",

    "title": "DEATH IN LITTLE ROCK-CHALLENGING THE DEATH PENALTY",
    "words": "Death in Little Rock\u0014\nPoliticians with national ambitions are suddenly willing to challenge \nthe death penalty\u0014\n\u0014\nFeb 9th 2013 |From the print edition \u0014\n\u0014\nTHANKS to a botched suicide bid that blew away part of his brain, the \nArkansas murderer Ricky Ray Rector had no inkling of the link between \nhis execution and the presidential ambitions of his states governor, \nBill Clinton. Indeed, as he was taken to die by lethal injection (it \ntook 50 minutes of jabbing to find a suitable vein), Rector saved the \npecan pie from his last meal for later. It did not matter. Mr \nClinton, who flew home to Arkansas from the 1992 campaign trail to \noversee Rectors death, had proved he was as tough on crime as any \nRepublican.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was thus quite a moment when the present governor of Arkansas, \nMike Beebe, said on January 16th that he would sign a bill repealing \nthe death penalty if legislators sent him one. Deciding which \nprisoners deserved death had proved agonising and had changed his \nview of capital punishment, he explained. His reversal is largely \nsymbolic: Mr Beebe, a conservative Democrat in a deeply conservative \nstate, is not about to be sent an abolition bill. Nor is he seeking \nre-election. Yet his conversion is more than a curiosity. A growing \nband of governors is defying public sentiment on capital punishment, \neven though polls show almost two-thirds of Americans back the death \npenalty for murder.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin OMalley, Marylands Democratic governor, has plausible claims \nto presidential or vice-presidential ambitions in 2016. Still, he has \nlaunched a push to abolish his states death penalty this year, after \na 2009 bid narrowly failed. If he succeeds, Maryland would be the \nsixth state in recent years to scrap capital punishment, after New \nYork, New Jersey, New Mexico, Illinois and Connecticut. Another \nDemocrat prompting 2016 talk, Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado, \nis reconsidering his support for capital punishment, as state \nlegislators launch a bid for abolition. In libertarian-minded New \nHampshire, where courts are agonising over their first death-penalty \ncase in 50 years, the Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, is expected \nto sign any repeal bill that reaches her, after two predecessors \nvetoed such bills. Oregons John Kitzhaber, a Democrat who oversaw \nexecutions during an earlier stint as governor, has suspended them \nand asked legislators to review a state death penalty he calls \nneither fair nor just. Ohios Republican governor, John Kasich, has \nrisked the wrath of voters by commuting four death sentences (while \noverseeing eight executions), citing the right of even awful \ncriminals to fair trials and an effective defence. Governor Sam \nBrownback of Kansas, a Republican and devout Catholic, won office \ndespite declaring that execution should be reserved for figures such \nas Osama bin Laden who might inspire fresh killings from a prison \ncell.\u0014\n\u0014\nA previous generation mostly kept such pangs of conscience to \nthemselves. A single, doleful nameMichael Dukakisexplained their \ncaution. Mr Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts, saw his \npresidential run in 1988 ended by a televised debacle, when he was \nasked whether he would want the death penalty if his wife, Kitty, \nwere raped and murdered. Rather than embrace the moments populism \n(or denounce a vile question) Mr Dukakis offered an owlish reply \nabout deterrence and murder rates. A lesson was absorbed by ambitious \npoliticians: opposition to the death penalty looked bloodless and \nout-of-touch. Even presidential candidates with doubts, such as John \nKerry or Barack Obama, stated that some crimes might merit death, \nciting societys need to see justice done. The younger George Bush, \nwho oversaw 152 executions as Texas governor, trumpeted his zeal.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe politics of death have changed because the country has changed. \nThe Rector execution followed years of rising crime. Starting in \n1976, when a brief period of abolition by the Supreme Court ended, \ndeath sentences climbed to a high point in 1996, with executions \npeaking three years later. Since then both violent crime and recourse \nto the death penalty have declined sharply. In 2012 America saw 77 \nnew inmates under sentence of death and 43 executions, a fraction of \nthe levels seen a generation ago. The first prisoner was freed from \ndeath row by DNA evidence in 1993, other high-profile exonerations \nfollowed. Studies show that killers of whites have a far higher \nchance of being sentenced to death than those who kill blacks. \nShrewdly, abolitionists promoted life imprisonment without parole as \nan alternative to execution, noting that it costs less than years of \ndeath-row appeals. When polls offer life without parole as an \nalternative punishment for murder, Americans divide evenly.\u0014\n\u0014\nBraving the curse of Dukakis\u0014\n\u0014\nAs it happens, Mr OMalley of Maryland thinks executions incompatible \nwith Americas civic values. But more practical arguments work best, \nhe says: the key is to talk about techniques that cut crime, to \nstrip away the myth that the death penalty works. If he prevails \nthat would leave 18 states with no death penalty, plus the District \nof Columbia.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, opposing forces also operate. Some states, such as Ohio, \nwant to fix the death penalty, not abolish it. A ballot measure on \nrepeal in California narrowly failed last November. Connecticuts \nrecent school shooting may skew Marylands debate. A 2012 cinema \nmassacre in Aurora, Colorado is weighing on abolition there. \nLegislators pushing repeal include a state senator from Aurora, \nMorgan Carroll, who notes that the death penalty did not deter the \nkiller, instead draining funds from more useful mental health and \nother services. Meanwhile an Aurora Democrat who backs capital \npunishment wants a statewide referendum.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet the death-penalty debate has changed in ways that go beyond \nday-to-day politics. It is less loud and more sceptical, giving \nthoughtful governors room to question a policy that causes them \nanguishbecause they think it arbitrary, ineffective and costly, and \nbecause they impose it. That grim duty does not trouble all \npoliticians: ask Mr Clinton and Mr Bush. But it should\u0014",

    "words": "Donatus was consecrated in 313 AD as Bishop of Carthage and Primate \nof North Africa, the leader of the Christian sect which came to be \nknown as the Donatist sect, even though Donatus was not the founding \nleader, but rather followed the founding leader Majorinus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe background to the controversy was the wave of persecutions of \nChristians by the Roman Emperor Diocletian. At that time some Church \nleaders - unwilling to endure torture or death and become martyrs - \nhad been ready to take such acts as worshipping the gods of the old \npantheon, considered idols by Christians, or surrendering church \nbooks and property to the imperial authorities. Such people became \nknown as traditors (\"surrenderers\"). One of these \"traditors\", \nnamed Caecilian, had returned to the fold of the Church once the \npersecutions ended, and was consecrated Bishop of Carthage and \nPrimate of North Africa. Those of the faithful who refused to accept \nthe authority of such a spiritual leader raised Majorinus as a rival \nbishop; however, Majorinus died shortly after being consecrated, and \nit fell to Donatus to take his place and continue the struggle.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe schism between the two Christian wings centered on the status of \ntraditore clergy. The Donatists contended that traditores could not \nbe reinstated without being re-baptized and re-ordained to take \noffice. They also contended that church rituals performed by \ntraditores were invalid. Therefore persons who were baptized, \nordained or consecrated should not be recognized by the Church.\u0014\n\u0014\nDonatist thinking was relatively consistent with that of Saint \nCyprian, who died a martyr during an earlier wave of persecutions, \nover half a century earlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nEffectively, the Roman Church believed that lapsed clergy could \nperform rituals such as baptism as long as they followed church \nritual.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring his tenure of some 40 years Donatus oversaw the expansion of \nthe Donatist Christian sect but struggled unsuccessfully against the \nRoman Christian wing to obtain Church recognition as the legitimate \nPrimate of North Africa.\u0014",

    "words": "Did Black People Own Slaves?\u0014\n100 Amazing Facts About the Negro: Yes -- but why they did and how \nmany they owned will surprise you. \u0014\n\tBy: Henry Louis Gates Jr.|Posted: March 4, 2013\u0014\n\u0014\n\nPrFOnt34BiN0BInSub0Frac0Def1MarGin0margin0jc1indent1440lim0lim1nicolas \nAugustin Metoyer of Louisiana owned 13 slaves in 1830. He and his 12 \nfamily members collectively owned 215 slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the most vexing questions in African-American history is \nwhether free African Americans themselves owned slaves. The short \nanswer to this question, as you might suspect, is yes, of course; \nsome free black people in this country bought and sold other black \npeople, and did so at least since 1654, continuing to do so right \nthrough the Civil War. For me, the really fascinating questions about \nblack slave-owning are how many black \"masters\" were involved, how \nmany slaves did they own and why did they own slaves?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answers to these questions are complex, and historians have been \narguing for some time over whether free blacks purchased family \nmembers as slaves in order to protect them -- motivated, on the one \nhand, by benevolence and philanthropy, as historian Carter G. Woodson \nput it, or whether, on the other hand, they purchased other black \npeople \"as an act of exploitation,\" primarily to exploit their free \nlabor for profit, just as white slave owners did. The evidence shows \nthat, unfortunately, both things are true. The great African-American \nhistorian, John Hope Franklin, states this clearly: \"The majority of \nNegro owners of slaves had some personal interest in their property.\" \nBut, he admits, \"There were instances, however, in which free Negroes \nhad a real economic interest in the institution of slavery and held \nslaves in order to improve their economic status.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIn \\a fascinating essay reviewing this controversy, R. Halliburton \nshows that free black people have owned slaves \"in each of the \nthirteen original states and later in every state that countenanced \nslavery,\" at least since Anthony Johnson and his wife Mary went to \ncourt in Virginia in 1654 to obtain the services of their indentured \nservant, a black man, John Castor, for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd for a time, free black people could even \"own\" the services of \nwhite indentured servants in Virginia as well. Free blacks owned \nslaves in Boston by 1724 and in Connecticut by 1783; by 1790, 48 \nblack people in Maryland owned 143 slaves. One particularly notorious \nblack Maryland farmer named Nat Butler \"regularly purchased and sold \nNegroes for the Southern trade,\" Halliburton wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nPerhaps the most insidious or desperate attempt to defend the right \nof black people to own slaves was the statement made on the eve of \nthe Civil War by a group of free people of color in New Orleans, \noffering their services to the Confederacy, in part because they were \nfearful for their own enslavement: \"The free colored population \n[native] of Louisiana  own slaves, and they are dearly attached to \ntheir native land  and they are ready to shed their blood for her \ndefense. They have no sympathy for abolitionism; no love for the \nNorth, but they have plenty for Louisiana  They will fight for her \nin 1861 as they fought [to defend New Orleans from the British] in \n1814-1815.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThese guys were, to put it bluntly, opportunists par excellence: As \nNoah Andre Trudeau and James G. Hollandsworth Jr. explain, once the \nwar broke out, some of these same black men formed 14 companies of a \nmilitia composed of 440 men and were organized by the governor in May \n1861 into \"the Native Guards, Louisiana,\" swearing to fight to defend \nthe Confederacy. Although given no combat role, the Guards -- \nreaching a peak of 1,000 volunteers -- became the first Civil War \nunit to appoint black officers.\u0014",

    "words": "Luke 19:28-40\u0014\n\u0014\nComparison of the entry into Jerusalem accounts in the Four Gospels \nindicates that only in the latter two (Luke and John) is Jesus \nacclaimed as the King of Israel. Apparently the oppressive Roman \nmilitary forces who occupied and controlled the region during the \nfirst century perceived Jesus to be a political leader who, with the \nsupport of crowds of his fellow oppressed Jews, was a serious \npotential threat to their own security. They did, therefore, what \nthey always did in such situations. They seized the leader of the \noppressed, tortured him privately, and then publicly crucified him to \nshow what they would do to anyone who would be acclaimed as King of \nthe Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nGiven the political situation in Galilee and Judea at the time of the \ncrucifixion of Jesus, if some of the Pharisees in the crowd urged \nJesus to restrain the members of the crowd from shouting political \nslogans, they were doing so in order to try to protect Jesus himself \nand the other Jewish people from Roman retaliation. Jesus, however, \nis depicted as refusing to restrain the crowd.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong the most significant redactions of the Markan account by the \nLukan writer in this instance is the addition of the Lukan motif of \nPeace in heaven and glory in the highest places. Also this Lukan \nmotif should ultimately be our focus as we proclaim this text and our \nfaith. The Jesus of history lived this motif. Jesus as the Christ of \nfaith expresses this motif. The Church of Jesus Christ is called to \ndo everything that it can so that there will be peace on earth as \nthere is peace in heaven, to the glory of God. Since only the Lukan \nentry account expresses this motif, it is especially important for us \nto focus on this motif during the years that we use Lukes entry into \nJerusalem account.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor those who wrote the Four Gospels, Jesus as the Risen Christ was \nindeed Lord. In the words of Zechariah 9:9 that they applied to \nJesus, he was in every way triumphant and victorious, subduing and \nriding a young, unbroken colt, and at the same time humble, riding on \na lowly beast of burden. He was their Lord, coming in the name of the \nLord.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the standpoint of the inspired writers of the Newer Testament \ndocuments, what Jesus followers did proleptically as he entered with \nother pilgrims into Jerusalem to observe the Passover, God did \nactually a few days later by raising Jesus from the dead, highly \nexalting him, and giving him the name that is above every other name. \nGod did this, Paul wrote, so that eventually every knee (including \nthe knee of Caesar) will bend at the name of Jesus, and every tongue \n(including the tongue of Caesar) will confess that Jesus (not Caesar) \nis Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\u0014",

    "words": "\"On the 21st of the month, the best man I know will do what he always \ndoes on the 21st of the month. He'll sit down and pen a love letter \nto his best girl. He'll say how much he misses her and loves her and \ncan't wait to see her again. Then he'll fold it once, slide it in a \nlittle envelope and walk into his bedroom. He'll go to the stack of \nlove letters sitting there on her pillow, untie the yellow ribbon, \nplace the new one on top and tie the ribbon again.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The stack will be 180 letters high then, because the 21st will be 15 \nyears to the day since Nellie, his beloved wife of 53 years, died. In \nher memory, he sleeps only on his half of the bed, only on his \npillow, only on top of the sheets, never betweenwith just the old \nbedspread they shared to keep him warm.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There's never been a finer man in American sports than John Wooden \nor a finer coach. He won 10 NCAA basketball championships at UCLA, \nthe last in 1975. Nobody has ever come within six of him. He won 88 \nstraight games between Jan. 30, 1971, and Jan. 17, 1974. Nobody has \ncome within 42 since.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"There never has been another coach like Wooden, quiet as an April \nsnow and square as a game of checkers; loyal to one woman, one \nschool, one way; walking around campus in his sensible shoes and \nJimmy Stewart morals. He'd spend a half hour the first day of \npractice teaching his men how to put on a sock. 'Wrinkles can lead to \nblisters,' he'd warn. These huge players would sneak looks at one \nanother and roll their eyes. Eventually, they'd do it right. 'Good,' \nhe'd say. 'Now for the other foot.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Of the 180 players who played for him, Wooden knows the whereabouts \nof 172. Of course, it's not hard when most of them call, checking on \nhis health, secretly hoping to hear some of his simple life lessons \nso they can write them on the lunch bags of their kids, who will roll \ntheir eyes.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"'Discipline yourself, and others won't need to,' Coach would say. \n'Never lie, never cheat, never steal,' and, 'Earn the right to be \nproud and confident.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\"If you played for him, you played by his rules: Never score without \nacknowledging a teammate. One word of profanity and you're done for \nthe day. Treat your opponent with respect. He believed in hopelessly \nout-of-date stuff that never did anything but win championships. No \ndribbling behind the back or through the legs. 'There's no need,' \nhe'd say.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"No UCLA basketball number was retired under his watch. 'What about \nthe fellows who wore that number before? Didn't they contribute to \nthe team?' he'd say. No long hair, no facial hair. 'They take too \nlong to dry, and you could catch cold leaving the gym,' he'd say. \nThat one drove his players bonkers. One day, All-America center Bill \nWalton showed up with a full beard. 'It's my right,' he insisted. \nWooden asked if he believed that strongly. Walton said he did. \n'That's good, Bill,' Coach said. 'I admire people who have strong \nbeliefs and stick by them, I really do. We're going to miss you.' \nWalton shaved it right then and there. Now Walton calls once a week \nto tell Coach he loves him.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"He's almost 90 now. You think a little more hunched over than last \ntime. Steps a little smaller. You hope it's not the last time you see \nhim. He smiles. 'I'm not afraid to die,' he says. 'Death is my only \nchance to be with her again.'\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Problem is, we still need him here.\"\u0014\n[Editor's note: Coach Wooden passed away June 4, 2010]\u0014",

    "words": "Dear Dr. Laura: \u0014\n\u0014\nThank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I \nhave \u0014\nlearned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with \nas many \u0014\npeople as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual \nlifestyle, for \u0014\nexample, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it \nto be an \u0014\nabomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, \u0014\nregarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a \npleasing odor for \u0014\nthe Lord (Lev. 1 :9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the \nodor is not \u0014\npleasing to them. How should I deal with this? \u0014\n\u0014\nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in \nExodus 21 :7. In this \u0014\nday and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? \u0014\n\u0014\nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her \nperiod of \u0014\nmenstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I \ntell? I have \u0014\ntried asking, but most women take offense. \u0014\n\u0014\nLev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are \naround us. A \u0014\nfriend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not \nCanadians. Can you \u0014\nclarify? \u0014\n\u0014\nI have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 \nclearly \u0014\nstates he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him \nmyself? \u0014\n\u0014\nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an \nabomination (Lev. \u0014\n10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. \nCan you \u0014\nsettle this? \u0014\n\u0014\nLev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have \na defect in my \u0014\nsight. I have to admit that I wear prescription glasses. Does my \nvision have to \u0014\nbe 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, my bank charges interest for loans I have with it. This \nusury is also \u0014\nproscribed many times in holy scripture, in fact, more times than \nhomosexual \u0014\nlifestyles. Should I change my protest tactics and target my bank \ninstead of gay \u0014\npride Sunday activities, which is later this month? I have only so \nmuch time to \u0014\nprotest, and I wonder which is the best place to spend my time. \u0014\n\u0014\nI know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident \nyou can \u0014\nhelp. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and \u0014\nunchanging.\u0014",

    "words": "Max Lucado compares the role of the Spirit in our lives to a guy who \nwants to learn to dance. He's a rational, intelligent sort of guy, so \nhe goes to the bookstore and buys a how-to book. He takes it home and \nbegins studying. He does everything it says with meticulous care. \nWhen the instructions say sway, he sways. When the instructions say \nlean, he leans. When the instructions say spin, he spins. He even \ncuts out paper footprints and arranges them on the family room floor \nso he will know exactly where to step.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, he thinks he's got it down pat. He calls his wife in and \nsays, \"Honey, watch!\" With book in hand and reading aloud so she'll \nknow he's done his homework, he follows the instructions, step by \nstep. It says, \"Take one step with your right foot.\" So he takes one \nstep with his right foot. Then it says, \"Turn slowly to the left.\" He \nturns slowly to the left. He keeps it up, reading and then moving, \nreading and dancing, through the whole thing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he collapses exhausted on the sofa and says to his wife, \"What \ndo you think? I executed it perfectly!\" To which she replies, \"You \nexecuted it all right. You killed it!\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bumfuzzled husband says, \"But I followed the rules, I laid out \nthe pattern, I did everything the book said ...\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"But,\" she sighs, \"you forgot the most important part. Where was the \nmusic?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWith that, she puts on a CD. \"Try it again. Quit worrying about the \nsteps and just follow the music.\" She holds out her hand, and he gets \nup and takes it. The music starts, and the next thing the guy knows \nhe's dancing -- without the book!\u0014\n\u0014\nMax closes the story with this: \"We Christians are prone to follow \nthe book while ignoring the music. We master the doctrine, outline \nthe chapters, memorize the dispensations, debate the rules and \nstiffly step down the dance floor of life with no music in our \nhearts. Dancing with no music is tough stuff. Jesus knew that. For \nthat reason, on the night before his death he introduced the \ndisciples to the song maker of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n--Rubel Shelly, \"Great themes of the Bible: Spirit's indwelling,\"\u0014",

Children's sports.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a new study published in the Review of Religious \nResearch, an examination of declining attendance at 16 congregations \nrevealed that many pastors place the most blame on children's sports \nactivities, since both practices and competitions are increasingly \n\"scheduled on Sunday mornings at the very time when many churches \ntraditionally have provided religious education.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut that doesn't mean that families whose kids are highly involved in \nathletics will stop attending church (though that does seem to be the \ncase among churches that stigmatize parents who miss church for \nsports, as the Association of Religion Data Archives's David Briggs \npoints out). \u0014\n\u0014\nInstead, more Protestant churches are offering alternate service \ntimes to accommodate members with Sunday morning commitments. They're \nalso increasing their emphasis on physical fitness programs or sports \nministries.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to Briggs (whose ARDA research roundup is worth reading), \n\"More than two-thirds of congregations who said sports and fitness \nprograms were a specialty of the congregation reported more than a 10 \npercent growth in attendance from 2000 to 2010. In contrast, only a \nthird of churches with no athletic programs reported such growth.\"\u0014",

    "title": "DOROTHY DAY TRIED TO REACH EUGENE O'NEILL IN FAITH",
    "words": "It was 1917, on a piercing winter night in Greenwich Village. Huddled \nin the back room of a bar, known as the Hell Hole, was a Bohemian \ngathering of artists, intellectuals, and misfits. Among them were the \ncountry's premiere playwright, Eugene O'Neill, and the left-wing \njournalist Dorothy Day, his close friend, confidante, and drinking \nbuddy. Maybe it was the booze, maybe because the hour was way past \nclosing time, but O'Neill seemed unusually melancholy.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe started quoting from memory the Francis Thompson poem \"The Hound \nof Heaven,\" which describes our common flight from the God who \nlovingly pursues us:\u0014\n\u0014\nI fled Him, down the nights and down the days;\u0014\nI fled Him, down the arches of the years \u0014\nI fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways\u0014\nOf my own mind; and in the mist of tears\u0014\nI hid from Him \u0014\n\u0014\nDorothy Day had never heard O'Neill speak of this poem before, and it \nsobered her, sobered everyone. Cigarette smoke curled upward and hung \nin the air like wispy apparitions . Everyone was hushed and still.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after leaving the Hell Hole, Day and O'Neill parted company, \nnot to see each other again for a decade. He wrote of a God who \nfailed to make good on his promises, of sin and shame and the terror \nof death. He won four Pulitzers and the Nobel Prize in Literature, \nbut happiness eluded him.\u0014\n\u0014\nShe married twice, conceived twice, aborted twice, and finally bore a \ndaughter by a man she never married. In December 1927, she \nsurrendered to the relentless pursuit of heaven's Hound and entered \nthe Catholic Church. She lived a life of poverty, with no income and \nno security, caring for the homeless on the streets not far from the \nHell Hole. She wrote of a merciful God.\u0014\n\u0014\nDorothy Day never stopped praying for her friend, who had opened her \neyes with the words he spoke. \"It is one of those poems,\" she wrote \nin her autobiography, \"that awakens the soul, recalls to it the fact \nthat God is its destiny.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWe don't know if Eugene O'Neill's soul was ever so awakened. We do \nknow that while he lay on his deathbed in Boston in 1953, Dorothy Day \nwas with him. She summoned a priest to his side. Keeping vigil, she \nprayed. She prayed he would at last unclench his fist and grasp the \nhand that had been reaching out to him for so many years, hoping to \nhear the words he recited in a barroom on that blustery winter night: \u0014\n\u0014\n\"Rise, clasp My hand, and come!\"\u0014",

These trends surprised demographers since they were not \nanticipated until 2020.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeil Shah, in the Wall Street Journal, says that his paper's headline \nrefers to something that has occurred \"for the first time in modern \nhistory.\" That suggests noteworthiness.\u0014\n\u0014\nSam Roberts, in the New York Times, observes that the slight edge of \nnon-Hispanic whites is simply the result of immigration and cannot \nhelp the old majority hang on any longer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe pay attention to this because ethnic shifts are portentous for \nreligious institutions, communities, loyalties and identities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1975, Yale's Harry S. Stout, in a major article called \"Ethnicity: \nThe Vital Center of Religion in America,\" and in 1972, University of \nChicago's Martin E. Marty in a \"presidential address\" spoke and wrote \nof \"Ethnicity: The Skeleton of Religion in America.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThese statements, and others dating from the 1970s, proposed that \nethnic trends would have very, very much to do with the American \nreligious future. And this has, indeed, turned out to be the case.\u0014\n\u0014\nRacists, tribalists and the nostalgic can counteract, sound alarms, \nscreech or merely panic, but they are not going to alter the \ndemographic momentum.\u0014\n\u0014\nLook at denominational records: ethnic trends in \"Non-Hispanic\" \nCatholicism match those among \"Mainline Protestants\" and are \nobservable in some sectors in evangelicalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nSay \"Irish\" or \"Polish\" and you think \"Catholic.\" Say \"Scottish\" and \nyou can count Presbyterian heads or \"Scandinavian\" and expect that at \nleast nominal Lutherans would make their appearance known.\u0014\n\u0014\nOr so it had been. Much of the sometimes-lamented, religious boom \nfrom the end of World War II into the 1960s was related to the \nsuburbanization of whites who had large families.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, census data reveals fewer lasting marriages, fewer marriages, \nmore interfaith (and, often, religiously \"diluting\") families, women \nadding work outside of the home to their work in the home, the \nmobility and the rootlessness that goes with this  all of these \nfactors at odds with the traditional, habitual, reflexive \nidentification of a people with a religious membership or involvement.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe heirs of the dwindling white majority can complain or explain, or \nthey can accept the changes and help reconceive religious commitment.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe trends suggest opportunities for Hispanic Catholicism, Black \nProtestantism and Asian faith with whatever affiliation. As for \nnon-Hispanic whites, the trends are a wakeup call, occasions to \ndiscern opportunities, and to pursue the paths of God, as they see \nthese, in an ever-changing America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe response begins with showing awareness, but that's not all. We'll \ncontinue to document changes.\u0014\n\u0014\nMartin E. Marty is the Fairfax M. Cone Distinguished Service \nProfessor Emeritus at the University of Chicago.\u0014",

    "words": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (Open Doors USA)  On May 14, in plain view of his \nwife and one daughter, suspected Boko Haram Islamic terrorist members \ngunned down Rev. Faye Pama Musa, general overseer of the Rhema \nAssembly International Church and secretary of the Christian \nAssociation of Nigeria (CAN) in Borno state.\u0014\n\u0014\nA month later Open Doors workers visited his widow Mercy at her home \nin Maiduguri. The widow and mother of four warmly received the \nvisitors into her house.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen she sat down to speak to Open Doors workers, she burst into \ntears. True friendship is what I am seeing today, she said. How \ndid you manage to come to Maiduguri at this dangerous time when \npeople are vacating the city? You are most welcome here in Jesus \nname. I am so happy to see you again.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe events of the evening of May 14 will never be forgotten. Musa, \nMercy and some of their children were home. While Mercy was preparing \nsupper, Zion, a daughter who was sitting outside, noticed three armed \nmen jumping the fence. She ran into the living room to alert her \nfather. Musa glanced through the window and saw the intruders by the \nfront door. The next moment they forced their way into the house \nshouting, Everybody on the floor!\u0014\n\u0014\nMusa instantly knew why the men had come and tried to escape through \nthe back door and over the fence. But they caught up with him and \ndragged him to the porch. Today you are a dead man. Call your Jesus \nto help you, Mr. CAN man, one of the terrorists shouted.\u0014\n\u0014\nMusa did not give up without a fight. While wrestling with the three \nmen, he continually called upon Jesus. For Zion, her fathers \ndesperate battle was too much to bear. She got off the floor and ran \nto the porch to where her father was struggling. She begged the \nattackers to spare his life. They fired a shot at her and missed. But \nthe shock was too much for her and she fainted.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe struggle continued. Mercy heard her husband say, I will never \ndeny my Savior. As she crawled to the door, she saw the attackers \nshoot him three times in the head. Musa died on the spot. The \nattackers left in a car.\u0014\n\u0014\nPastor Musa will be remembered as a father, a friend and as a role \nmodel. It will take the church in Borno a long time to cope with the \nenormous loss of this bold yet graceful leader and mentor, said an \nOpen Doors spokesman. His deepest desire was to see a strong church \npressing forward despite perpetual harassment and killings at the \nhands of extremists.\u0014\n\u0014\nMusa not only had friends among Christians. Many Muslims expressed \nshock at his death. A prominent Muslim security official strongly \ncondemned the murder, saying, Rev. Faye Pama Musa was an ambassador \nof peace. I will miss this Christian man who was a blessing and a \nhuge asset for this society.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion Today 8/1/13\u0014",

Are they identical? Even if the Israeli \npopulation is atheistic or anti-Christian?

    "title": "DECLINE IN PASTORAL RESPECT",
    "words": "A recent Pew Research poll found that the favorable view of clergy \nhad declined to 37 percent of those surveyed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy are pastors no longer held in high esteem? What is behind the \nprecipitous drop in favorable ratings almost every year? Allow me to \noffer eleven possible reasons. As you will see, they are not mutually \nexclusive.\u0014\n\u0014\n1. The moral failures of a minority of pastors receive widespread \ncoverage. The media loves the sensational stories behind clergy \nfailure. For sure, some stories such as sex abuse should be brought \nto the public eye. But many people now believe the bad behavior of a \nfew is normative for all pastors. \u0014\n\u0014\n2. Our nation has marginalized the Christian faith. So it should not \nbe unexpected that leaders in the Christian world are viewed more \nnegatively. \u0014\n\u0014\n3. Pastoral tenure has dropped significantly over the past few \ndecades. Tenure is up slightly the past few years, but the longer \ntrend is down. Trust is built over several years, not two or three \nyears. Fewer pastors have made it to the point of several years. \u0014\n\u0014\n4. Some church members have a strong entitlement mentality. They see \nthe local congregation as a place largely to meet their needs and \ndesires, rather than to serve and give. If those needs and desires \nare not met, the pastor is often the locus of blame. \u0014\n\u0014\n5. Social media encourages criticism from a distance. There is much \ncommendable about social media. Indeed, I am heavy user of it. But it \nalso is a means for critics to sound off about pastors (and others) \nwithout forethought or consequences. \u0014\n\u0014\n6. A few pastors have poor work ethics. More pastors are just the \nopposite; they fight workaholism. But the few pastors who are lazy \nand have little accountability hurt the perceptions people have of \nother pastors. \u0014\n\u0014\n7. Pastors are often the scapegoats for fear and change. It is clich \nto say the world is changing rapidly. Many church members would like \ntheir churches to remain the same every year. Such a reality is not \npossible, and the pastor is often the scapegoat for the discomfort \nthat comes with change.\u0014\n \u0014\n8. There is a pervasive cynicism in our society. The reasons behind \nthat reality are many. But congregations and their leaders are not \nimmune from this widespread and pervasive cynicism on society that \nseems to be growing. \u0014\n\u0014\n9. There is a failure of some pastors in two key areas: leadership \nand emotional intelligence. Some pastors are well prepared biblically \nand theologically. But some have not been taught leadership and \nhealthy interpersonal skills. \u0014\n\u0014\n10. There are higher expectations today for pastors to be competent, \neven dynamic, leaders. But, as I noted in the previous point, some \npastors have no preparation to be leaders of churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n11. More churches are dying in America today. I estimate as many as \n100,000 churches in America are dying. Many will close their doors in \nthe next few years. Many of the pastors of these churches are blamed \nfor this malady. \u0014\n\u0014\nTom Rainer\u0014",

He doesnt even care if it is \nhis therapist; he just has to see somebodys therapist. [It would be \nfun to slip in an albino therapist on him.] So he asked for an \nexplanation of the tag line of these CIW mutterings: where life is \ndefined by winter even in the summer. He says he thinks others might \nlike to know, too. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you retire, you can live any place you wish, and grandchildren \nare more important than anything else in your life, and if only one \nof your children has produced grandchildren, you can just trail them \naround. To Mason City, IA, the River City of Meredith Willsons \nThe Music Man. To Sterling, IL. Finally, the coup de grace, to Iron \nMountain, MI. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe moved to Iron Mountain on July 11. It was a warm and lovely day, \ntypical of Iron Mountain summers, high in the 70s, low in the 50s. We \ndid not know that on July 10 the last of the snow had melted because \nthe temperature finally got above freezing. Nor did we know that the \nsnow and cold would return on July 12. \u0014\n\u0014\nI should have known. I read Sports Illustrated. There had been an \ninterview in SI with NFL coach, Steve Mariucci, who grew up in Iron \nMountain. [1] They asked him what folks in Iron Mountain did in \nsummer. He said, If it doesnt snow that day, we have a picnic. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on July 11, there were bright flowing hanging baskets of summer \nflowers on every porch, and people had turned their garages into \nsummer homes, complete with sofas and TV sets. They just leave the \ndoors up, for, unlike the rest of the UP, where people are called \nYoopers [UPers], Iron Mountain has no problem with mosquitoes or \nother bitey bugs. We have about 50 thousand bats that live in an old \nmine shaft. At dusk they come out and fan out across the town. A bat \ncan eat up to one thousand mosquitoes in an hour. Our bats have a \ncomity agreement, assigning specific bats to specific yards. Ours is \nWalter. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe learned that the flowers were all in hanging baskets to keep the \ndeer and rabbits from getting at them. We have as many deer as \nmosquitoes, but they are too big for the bats to eat. That first \nsummer, our daughter planted a rose bush. She went around the corner \nof her house to get the hose to water it. By the time she got back \naround the corner, the rose bush was gone. [As Dave Barry would say, \nI am not making this up.]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hanging baskets come from about two dozen temporary summer \ngreenhouses that are set up in tents or parking lots, so folks can do \ndrive-by planting. UP here you dont have enough summer to plant \nseeds and wait for flowers to grow. They would be eaten by the deer, \nanyway. You just buy a hanging pot with the flowers already blooming \nand put it up and stare at it. \u0014\n\u0014\nSummer is so short here, and beautiful, that you dont want to waste \na single precious minute of it. The first day above freezing, you get \nthe lawn chairs, shovel off the deck, and start summering. You know \nthat winter is looking over your shoulder. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on this first day of spring, where March is just February under \nan assumed name, and our average temperature the February just past \nwas 5.4 degrees [F], and the city snow plow truck just went by, and \nwere slated for below zero temperatures again this weekend, when \nwell celebrate Helens March 6 birthday because weve waited until \nthe weather was better for our Chicago daughter to come, Ill remind \nyou that Iron Mountain is where Life is defined by winter, even in \nthe summer. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland \u0014\njmcfarland1721@charter.net\u0014",

This 1744 passage by Benjamin Franklin describes this \nivory tower approach to an education:\u0014\n\u0014\n\"After the principal Business was settled, the Commissioners from \nVirginia acquainted the Indians by a Speech, that there was at \nWilliamsburg a College, with a Fund for Educating Indian youth; and \nthat if the Six Nations would send down' half a dozen of their young \nLads to that College, the Government would take Care that they should \nbe well provided for, and instructed in all the Learning of the White \nPeople. Their Speaker began by expressing their deep Sense of the \nKindness of the Virginia Government in making them that Offer, for we \nknow, says he, that you highly esteem the kind of Learning taught in \nthose Colleges, and that the Maintenance of our young Men while with \nyou would be very expensive to you. We are convinced therefore that \nyou mean to do us Good by your Proposal, and we thank you heartily. \nBut you who are wise must know, that different Nations have different \nConceptions of Things, and you will therefore not take it amiss if \nour Ideas of this kind of Education happen not to be the\u0014\nsame with yours. We have had some Experience of it: Several of our \nyoung People were formerly brought up at the Colleges of the Northern \nProvinces; they were instructed in all your Sciences; but when they \ncame back to us they were bad Runners ignorant of every means of \nliving in the Woods, unable to bear either Cold or Hunger, knew \nneither how to build a Cabin, take a Deer or kill an Enemy, spoke our \nLanguage imperfectly, were therefore neither fit for Hunters \nWarriors, or Counsellors, they were totally good for nothing. We are \nhowever not the less obliged by your kind Offer tho' we \u0014\ndecline accepting it; and to show our grateful Sense of it, if the \nGentlemen of Virginia will send us a Dozen of their Sons, we will \ntake great Care of, their Education, instruct them in all we \u0014\nknow, and make Men of them.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Old Testament's Deuteronomy Puts Women on Equal Footing \u0014\n\u0014\nClaude Mariottini       May 13, 2014   EthicsDaily.com\u0014\n\u0014\nMost scholars believe that Deuteronomy was the book of the law found \nduring the reparations of the temple at the time Josiah was king of \nJudah (2 Kings 22). \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the prophetess, Huldah, confirmed the book's authenticity, \nJosiah enacted reforms to address the religious and social problems \nin the Judean society.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe sought to ameliorate the plight of orphans, widows, sojourners and \npoor people.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the problems addressed was the status of women. In addressing \nproblems women faced, some of Exodus' laws were revised to change and \nimprove the way women were treated.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy's laws emphasize human dignity and the value of human \nlife. Their concern is the protection of individuals, primarily those \nwhose means of subsistence were limited.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany of the ethical and social laws are unique, reflecting the \nhumanitarian concern of the Deuteronomic reform.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn some Old Testament texts, women are presented as property of their \nfathers and husbands. The husband was a woman's \"baal,\" translated as \n\"husband,\" \"owner\" or \"master.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFew women were independent, for they needed their fathers and \nhusbands to provide for them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWomen are also portrayed as victims of men's brutality and \ninhumanity: Women were bought and sold, raped, enslaved, murdered and \nabandoned. Daughters were sold as slaves by their fathers (Exodus \n21:7-11), indicating that some had no reservations when forced by \npoverty or compelled by greed.\u0014\n\u0014\nElsewhere women are portrayed as persons with dignity.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Genesis 1:26-27, the woman was created in the image of God, which \nreflects a mature theology with women equal to men that developed \ngradually in Israel and finds full expression in the post-exilic time.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Genesis 2:18, the woman is a companion to her husband, a helper to \nthe man. The Hebrew word does not carry the connotation of \ninferiority or subordination.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe creation of the woman is the climax of the creation story in \nGenesis 2, who is a companion to a lonely man, giving both the \npossibility of community, commonality and wholeness.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese theological views of women as persons of worth and dignity are \nbetrayed by the social realities present in Israelite society.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe status of women probably became more difficult as a result of a \nmisinterpretation of Genesis 3:16, a text in which God says that the \nman is to rule over his wife as a consequence of her disobedience.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the social limitations imposed upon women, most women in \nIsrael found their sense of worth, fulfillment and personhood in \nbeing a mother and a wife.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn spite of the limitations imposed upon them, women forged important \nplaces in society.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeborah served as a judge, and Huldah as a prophetess. Others served \nas queens and queen-mothers, thus exercising much power and authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nCentralization of wealth in the hands of some families elevated the \nstatus of a few women and enabled them to exert power over men.\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the centuries, Israelite society suffered many transformations. \nFrom a tribal community in which few inequalities existed, Israel \nbecame a state with a monarchy and a royal family.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese social, economic and political changes served as a catalyst to \nimpact the status of women and greatly affect their lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsraelite laws provided relief to the plight of women and developed a \nspecial sense of social responsibility for the poor and \nunderprivileged. The book of Deuteronomy reflects the rise of \nhumanism in Israel.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy contains new laws and revisions of old ones dealing with \nthe oppressed.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral aspects of Josiah's reform affected women for the better. \nThese laws became necessary because of the changes brought by the \nmonarchy and the deterioration of the social structures in Israelite \nsociety.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe demands of the covenant required personal integrity and social \njustice for each Israelite.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe poor, slaves, orphans, widows and other destitute persons in \nIsrael became the beneficiaries of the changes introduced by the laws \nof Deuteronomy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reform made a real effort to improve the status of women by \nmaking them an equal partner in the covenant.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is seen in the statement of Deuteronomy 10:16: \"Circumcise, \nthen, the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn any longer.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rite of circumcision was performed upon every male child, giving \nthem the right of full membership in the covenant community.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy transformed the physical act of circumcision, available \nonly to males, into a spiritual right, available to all individuals.\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy changed the sign of the covenant partnership from one in \nwhich only men could participate to one open to both men and women.\u0014\n\u0014\nParticipation in the covenant community was not dependent on a \nphysical act or on the gender of an individual because the inward \nattitude of a person toward God determined that person's relationship \nwith God.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Israel, men and women are commanded to learn to fear the Lord and \nfaithfully follow his law (Deuteronomy 31:12).\u0014\n\u0014\nClaude Mariottini is professor of Old Testament at Northern Baptist \nSeminary in Lombard, Illinois.\u0014",

    "words": "Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You Know? \u0014\nLittle-known or remarkable facts about Dietrich Bonhoeffer \n(19061945) \u0014\n\u0014\nMark and Barbara Galli live in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. \u0014\n\u0014\nDietrich Bonhoeffer was a twin. (He was born just before his twin \nsister, Sabine.)\u0014\n\u0014\nDietrichs father, Karl, was Berlins leading psychiatrist and \nneurologist from 1912 until his death in 1948.\u0014\n\u0014\nDietrich was so skilled at playing the piano that for a time he and \nhis parents thought he might become a professional musician.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt 14, Bonhoeffer announced matter-of-factly that he was going to \nbecome a theologian.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer earned his doctorate in theology when he was only 21.\u0014\n\u0014\nThough later he was an outspoken advocate of pacifism, Bonhoeffer was \nan enthusiastic fan of bullfighting. He developed the passion while \nserving as assistant pastor of a German-speaking congregation in \nBarcelona, Spain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy the end of 1930, the year before Bonhoeffer was ordained, church \nseminaries were complaining that over half the candidates for \nordination were followers of Hitler.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1933, when the government instigated a one-day boycott of \nJewish-owned businesses, Bonhoeffers grandmother broke through a \ncordon of SS officers to buy strawberries from a Jewish store.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his short lifetime, Bonhoeffer traveled widely. He visited Cuba, \nMexico, Italy, Libya, Denmark, and Sweden, among other countries, and \nhe lived for a time in Spain, in England, and in the United States.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer taught a confirmation class in what he described as about \nthe worst area of Berlin, yet he moved into that neighborhood so he \ncould spend more time with the boys.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer was fascinated by Gandhis methods of nonviolent \nresistance. He asked forand receivedpermission to visit Gandhi and \nlive at his ashram. The two never met, however, because the crisis in \nGermany demanded Bonhoeffers attention.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer served as a member of the Abwehr, the \nmilitary-intelligence organization under Hitler. (He was actually a \ndouble agent. While ostensibly working for the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer \nhelped to smuggle Jews into Switzerlandand do other underground \ntasks.)\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer studied for a year in New York City. He was uniformly \ndisappointed with the preaching he heard there: One may hear sermons \nin New York upon almost any subject; one only is never handled,  \nnamely, the gospel of Jesus Christ, of the cross, of sin and \nforgiveness. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile a student at Union Theological Seminary in New York, Bonhoeffer \nregularly attended the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. He taught \none youth Sunday school class and one womens Bible study; he also \nhelped weekly in Sunday school.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer learned to drive a car while in the United Statesyet he \nfailed his American drivers-license examination three times.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer directed an illegal seminary for two and a half years \nuntil it was closed by the Gestapo. The seminary trained pastors for \nthe Confessing Church, a group Bonhoeffer and others had formed as \nan alternative to the Nazi-influenced German Reich Church. It was at \nthis seminary that he developed his classic work The Cost of \nDiscipleship.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust before World War II, Bonhoeffer was invited to lecture in the \nUnited States. This allowed him to escape increasing persecution and \nthe impending draft. But Bonhoeffer decided he must share the fate of \nthose suffering in Germany. In less than a month, he returned home.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1936, because of his anti-Nazi views, Bonhoeffer was no longer \npermitted to teach at the University of Berlin. Two years later, he \nwas forbidden to live in Berlin. In 1940, the German authorities \nforbade him to speak in public, and he had to report regularly to the \npolice.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer was engaged to be married, but he was arrested and \neventually killed before he and his fiancee could be married.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring Allied bombing raids over Berlin, Bonhoeffers calm deeply \nimpressed his fellow prisoners at Tegel Prison. Prisoners and even \nguards used all kinds of tricks to get near him and find the comfort \nof exchanging a few words with him.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe majority of Bonhoeffers classic Letters and Papers from Prison \nwas smuggled out by guards who chose to assist Bonhoeffer.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffer could have escaped from prison but chose not to for the \nsake of others. He had prepared to escape with one of the guards when \nhe learned that his brother Klaus had been arrested. Fearing \nreprisals against his brother and his family if he escaped, \nBonhoeffer stayed in prison.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe German underground failed on numerous occasions to assassinate \nHitler. Had they succeeded, Bonhoeffer probably would not have been \nexecuted.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdolf Hitler was directly involved in the decision to execute \nBonhoeffer and his co-conspirators.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffers brother Klaus and two of his brothers-in-law were also \nexecuted for their roles in the resistance movement against Hitler.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome of Bonhoeffers best-known works, such as Ethics and Letters and \nPapers from Prison were not published until after his death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBonhoeffers parents did not learn of his death until three and a \nhalf months afterward, when they tuned into a radio broadcast of a \nLondon memorial service for their son.\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  1991 by the author or Christianity Today/Christian \nHistory magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\nXXXXX     Further reference: see Word/My Documents/ Was Dietrich \nBonhoeffer gay?\u0014",

    "title": "DROP OUT OR HIATUS?",
    "words": "Dropout is a key word in today's evangelical churches concerning \nteenagers and young adults. The quote often sounds like this: \"86% of \nevangelical youth drop out of church after graduation, never to \nreturn.\" The problem with that statement (and others around that \nnumber) is that it's not true. But that doesn't mean there is no \nreason for concern.\u0014\n\u0014\nLifeWay Research data shows that about 70% of young adults who \nindicated they attended church regularly for at least one year in \nhigh school do, in fact, drop outbut don't miss the details. Of \nthose who left, almost two-thirds return and currently attend church \n(in the timeframe of our study). Also, that dropout rate is from all \nProtestant churchesevangelical and mainline.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen?\u0014\n\u0014\nChurch attendance among teens and young adults follows some important \npatterns. There are always some coming and some going. Yet something \nsignificant happens between the ages of 17 and 19 that accounts for \nthe vast majority of those who leave. At age 17, the twice- monthly \nattendance of our study sample drops as follows:\u0014\n\u0014\n\t1617, drop 10%\u0014\n\u0014\n\t1718, drop 14%\u0014\n\u0014\n\t1819, drop 13%\u0014\n\u0014\nBetween 17 and 19 is where the drop takes place. Our study was of \nthose who attended regularly for at least a year in high schoolso \nour sample is not representative of all teens and young adults, but \nclearly something is happening in that age range.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn most cases, our surveys show a lack of intentionality in dropping \nout. Eighty percent of young people who dropped out of church said \nthey did not plan to do so during high school. It's not that most \nrejected the church. Our teenagers aren't primarily leaving because \nthey have significant disagreements with their theological upbringing \nor out of some sense of rebellion. For the most part, they simply \nlose track of the church and stop seeing it as important to their \nlife.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Works?\u0014\n\u0014\nStatistically, we found four factors that were the most predictive in \ndetermining which teenagers stayed in church:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tI wanted the church to help guide my decisions in everyday life \n(prior to 18).\u0014\n\tMy parents were still married to each other and both attended \nchurch (prior to 18).\u0014\n\tThe pastor's sermons were relevant to my life (prior to 18).\u0014\n\tAt least one adult from church made a significant investment in me \npersonally and spiritually                         (between 15 and \n18).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat Now?\u0014\n\u0014\nDropout doesn't have to be a key word. We can replace it with \nsomething far better. When teenagers see an active, practiced faith \nin their parents and other positive examples at church, they will \nstop being dropouts and start being disciples.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf your student ministry is a four-year holding tank with pizza, \ndon't expect young adults to stick around. \u0014\n1. Disciple, disciple, disciple. If your student ministry is a \nfour-year holding tank with pizza, don't expect young adults to stick \naround. If, however, they see biblical teaching as relevant and see \nthe church as essential to their decisions, they stay.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. Have a home with committed Christian parents. According to the USC \nstudy I referenced earlier, 74% of married couples who were both \nevangelicals also had kids who were evangelical. I was raised by a \nsingle mom who loved the Lord and I'm so thankful for those who do, \nbut parents (together) make a significant statistical impact.\u0014\n\u0014\n3. Recognize that it takes a church to raise a committed young \nadultinvolve other adults in the discipleship process. This is where \nstudent pastors, volunteers, and other adults being invested in the \nlives of teenagers can be so important.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo, the dropout numbers are not nearly as bad as many would have you \nthink, but there are still way too many students who fail to see the \nsignificance of the church moving forward into early adulthood. But \nthere are things we can do to change that.\u0014",

    "title": "DID JESUS MAKE MISTAKES?",
    "words": "n May 4, 2014 Mark Driscoll preached at Mars Hill Church in Seattle \non Acts 6:17. As usual, the video of the sermon was not posted on \nthe church's website until two weeks later. However, Mars Hill Church \ndeleted a section from the video of Driscoll's original message. In \nthat deleted section, Driscoll distinguished between sin and \nmistakes, claiming that Jesus never sinned but that he did make \nmistakes. Driscoll was referencing Luke 2:52, where Jesus is said to \nhave grown in \"wisdom and stature.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCT asked experts, \"Did Jesus make mistakes?\" Answers to the question \nare arranged below on a spectrum from \"yes\" at the top to \"no\" at the \nbottom.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Driscoll's point is prosaic and uncontroversial. Jesus learned to do \nthings as a child through trial and error like reading and writing. \nThat's obvious if we take the humanity of Jesus seriously. It's in \nGnostic writings like the Infancy Gospel of Thomas where the child \nJesus is a supernatural prodigy, incapable of error though prone to \nfits of vengeance against adults and other children. While critical \nscholars have argued that Jesus made factual, theological, and even \nmoral errors during his ministry, traditional Christians have never \nagreed, and neither would Driscoll, I suspect. Driscoll's point about \nJesus making mistakes, while needing qualification, is theologically \nsound.\"\u0014\n~ Michael Bird, lecturer in theology, Ridley Melbourne Mission and \nMinistry College\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Who knows what Jesus was capable or incapable of doing as a boy? The \nfact that many apocryphal stories of Jesus doing miraculous acts as a \nboy were rejected by the church shows that for early Christians it \nwas perhaps more important to affirm the true humanity of Jesus. If \nby mistake Driscoll means that as a boy Jesus could have 'missed the \nball' and lost the game to his cousin John, I have no problem.\"\u0014\n~ Simon Chan, professor of systematic theology, Trinity Theological \nCollege, Singapore\u0014\n\u0014\n\"The problem is we have so little direct information. The Gospels do \nnot record any 'Jesus mistakes.' From that, we could assume he made \nnone. Also, many people assume Jesus couldn't make mistakes because \nhe was God, and God is infallible. However, Jesus was also human, and \n'to err is human.' Could he have been truly human and never made \nmistakes? Luke 2:52 says Jesus grew in 'wisdom.' Is it possible to \ngrow in wisdom without any lacking wisdom, even as a child? This \nquestion simply can't be answered definitively.\"\u0014\n~ Roger Olson, professor of theology and ethics, George W. Truett \nTheological Seminary\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Jesus didn't make any moral mistakes. But in his humanity, he \nnecessarily had incomplete knowledge. Certainly as a child, Jesus had \nto 'learn how to do things' (Driscoll). Luke says, 'Jesus increased \nin wisdom.' Even as an adult, Jesus in his humanity had incomplete \nknowledge. Sometimes he seemed unaware of things until informed by \nothers. But he was led by the Spirit, resisted temptation, and never \nsinned. Still, it's misleading to call any behaviors of Jesus that \nreflected incomplete human knowledge mistakes. Since mistake commonly \nmeans 'misguided' or 'wrong,' it is better to avoid the term with \nregard to Jesus.\"\u0014\n~ Howard Snyder, former professor, United Theological Seminary, \nAsbury Seminary, and Tyndale Seminary\u0014",

    "title": "DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FAITH",
    "words": "By Mike Poteet, Ministry Matters\u0014\n\u0014\nStaring into the dark hole\u0014\n\u0014\nSince 1987, October has been designated Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth in the United States. This October, domestic violence was \nalready in the public eye due to a series of incidents involving \nprofessional football players.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most publicized incident centered around two videos showing Ray \nRice, at the time a Baltimore Ravens running back, assaulting his \nthen fiance, now wife, Janay. In the first video, which surfaced in \nFebruary, Rice drags an unconscious Janay from a hotel elevator. The \nsecond, which emerged in early September, shows what happened inside \nthat elevator: Rice punched her in the face. Five months after the \nfirst videos release, the National Football League (NFL) suspended \nRice for two games, a disciplinary action roundly criticized as too \nlightmore farce than punishment, comments novelist and essayist \nRoxane Gay. Soon after the second video became public, the Ravens cut \nRice from the team, and the NFL suspended Rice indefinitely. NFL \ncommissioner Roger Goodell calls the second video extremely clear, \nextremely graphic, and . . . sickening.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what did Goodell or anyone else expect the video to show? asks \nsportswriter Mike Florio. Whats not clear, graphic, or sickening \nabout a criminal complaint signed by a police officer that accuses \nRice of doing precisely what the video showed him doing?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe shouldnt have to see such abuse to believe it happens, but the \nRice videos are, as journalist Ian Brown calls them, our latest \nchance to stare into the dark hole of domestic violence. Our \nreactions to what we see can show both how our awareness of the \nproblem has increased and what we must still do to address it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe scope of domestic violence\u0014\n\u0014\nDomestic violence doesnt usually make headlines, but sadly its a \ncommon occurrence in the United States. According to statistics \ncompiled by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), \none in three women has experienced physical violence at the hands of \nan intimate partner. For 3.2 million women, that violence is \nsevere. Less frequently, but no less seriously, men are victims: \nOne in ten has been stalked, physically harmed, or raped by an \nintimate partner. Domestic violence constitutes 15 percent of all \nviolent crimes.\u0014\n\u0014\nIncidents involving celebrities should remind us that anyone can be a \nvictim of domestic violence. Its important to note, says Nanci \nKreidman of the Domestic Violence Action Center in Hawaii, that \ndomestic violence crosses all socioeconomic classes, professions, \neducation levels, religious and ethnic groups. Its not just the poor \nand uneducated. In fact, educated and professional victims may feel \nmore shame, from others and themselves, because they think, These \nthings shouldnt be happening to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nDomestic violence does, however, disproportionately affect some \npopulations. Women living in poverty, for example, have fewer \noptions for economic self-sufficiency and social support systems with \nlittle ability to offer financial help, explain researchers Andrea \nHetling and Haiyan Zhang. These women feel more trapped in unhealthy \nrelationships in which they are at risk. Black women, too, face \ngreater risk: According to The Dallas Morning News, they are about \nthree times more likely to die at the hands of a partner or \nex-partner than members of other racial groups.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the Rice story unfolded, TV journalist and talk show host Meredith \nVieira told viewers about her own experience in an abusive \nrelationship. I know its rampant in this country, Vieira said, \nand we all have to accept the fact that its not just an issue with \nthe NFLits an issue with all of our lives, and until we take it \nseriously, more and more women are going to get abused.\u0014\n\u0014\nAsking the wrong question?\u0014\n\u0014\nOne question that commonly arises in discussions of domestic violence \nis, Why doesnt she just leave? It has been asked about Janay \nRiceeven during last months Miss America pageant, when host Kathy \nIreland asked contestant Victoria Cowen (Miss Florida), As a woman, \nwhat do you think of her decision?\u0014\n\u0014\nSocial media is giving victims a chance to answer that question and \nbe heard. Shortly after the second Rice video gained attention, \nauthor Beverly Gooden, who herself survived over a year of physical \nabuse from her former husband, started posting to Twitter statements \nillustrating the complexity of domestic violencefor example, I \nstayed because I was halfway across the country, isolated from my \nfriends and family. And there was no one to help me. The hashtag \nGooden used, #WhyIStayed, quickly went viral, attracting tens of \nthousands of responses. A companion hashtag, #WhyILeft, also trended \nrapidly as victims told their stories of escape.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese social media streams are providing much-needed understanding to \nand support for victims of domestic violence. But another question \ndemands attention. After #WhyIStayed started trending, counselor Noa \nAshkenazi told The Globe and Mail, In the past 24 hours, I have been \nasked 100 times, Why do women stay? None of you ask, Why do men \nhit? Why do men abuse the women they love? \u0014\n\u0014\nNo single answer addresses all situations. Many frequently offered \nones are wrong. For instance, alcohol does not cause domestic \nviolence, though excessive drinking may increase the risk it will \noccur. Nor does a perpetrators supposed inability to control anger \ncause the problem; abusers dont lash out at people in general, but \nonly at certain people under certain conditions.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo why do men hit? Its an ideological problem, states Dr. Jackson \nKatz, leading antisexism educator and activist. Its an attitude \nabout entitlement, about power, about who has the right to control \nthe system. . . . [Its] a choice about your emotions, and not a big \nmysterious thing . . . beyond our understanding.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeople choose to commit domestic violence, meaning they can sometimes \nlearn to make different choices. Treatment groups can hold men who \nabuse accountable for their behavior, teaching them to recognize and \ntake responsibility for their actions, and helping them find new, \nnonviolent ways to respond to their emotions and interact with their \npartners.\u0014\n\u0014\nDomestic violence and the church\u0014\n\u0014\nThe NFLs reaction to domestic violence has drawn some sharp \ncriticism. Even as Goodell announced that the league will get our \nhouse in order when handling the issue going forward, many observers \nremained skeptical. Nita Chaudhary, cofounder of the womens advocacy \ngroup UltraViolet, claims Goodell is responding to public outcry. \nHes already proven that if the public spotlight isnt on him..., \nhes more than willing to sweep domestic violence under the rug.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times the church, too, has failed to address domestic violence in \nhonest, healing ways. Whether by interpreting difficult biblical \ntexts in ways that undercut rather than support victims or by staying \nsilent on the subject altogether, we have been complicit in domestic \nviolence. I think many pastors still dont think it exists in their \ncongregation, says Yvonne DeVaughn, director of Advocacy for Victims \nof Abuse.\u0014\nAt other times, however, the church does rise to the challenge of \nspeaking and embodying Gods good news of freedom and new beginnings \nin situations of domestic violence. Some examples:\u0014\n Black Mountain (North Carolina) Presbyterian Church trained its \nstaff and volunteer leaders in responding to victims of domestic \nviolence; educated its whole membership, young and old, on the issue \nwith age-appropriate curricula; and committed to regularly lifting \nup the issue in worship and once a year in sermons. \u0014\n The Indianapolis faith-based organization Not to Believers Like Us, \nInc., sponsored a conference in October 2013 at St. Lukes United \nMethodist Church to raise awareness of domestic violence among faith \ncommunities. The conference urged every congregation to develop a \nsafety team and safety plan for victims of domestic abuse. \u0014\n To address a shortage of space in local shelters, King of Kings \nLutheran Church (Milwaukie, Oregon) worked with other congregations \nand community groups to create a housing project for women and \nchildren fleeing domestic violence. \u0014\n United Methodist Men is collaborating with United Methodist Women \nto increase efforts to end domestic violence. Domestic violence \noccurs in lots of homes, says Gilbert Hanke, top staff executive, \nincluding parsonages. He believes being a real man means not \ntolerating attitudes that assume women occupy a lower status.\u0014\nWhen we as Christians take such concrete actions to educate people, \nwithin and beyond the congregation, about domestic violence and to \nadvocate for those affected by it, we follow Jesus, who came to free \ncaptives and proclaim good news to the oppressed (Luke 4:18) so that \nthey could have lifeindeed, so that they could live life to the \nfullest (John 10:10).\u0014",

    "title": "DOES RELIGION POISON EVERYTHING?",
    "words": "Does Religion  Poison Everything?\u0014\n\u0014\nPublished in the January/February 2014   Liberty Magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nby Clifford R. Goldstein\u0014\n\u0014\nThe headline read Suicide Attack at Christian Church in Pakistan \nKills Dozens. Another headline read Jews Challenge Rules to Claim \nHeart of Jerusalem. Another Gunmen Kill Dozens in Terror Attack at \nKenyan Mall. \u0014\n\u0014\nDespite the obvious commonalities, these headlines share three more: \nall were in the same newspaper, on the same day, same page (New York \nTimes, September 22, 2013, page 1. Online edition). And though Jews \nwanting access to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem might hardly seem in \nthe same category as Muslim terrorists shooting up a church, it's \njournalistic spreads such as this, and more, that have helped spur \nthe publication of books such as the late Christopher Hitchens' God \nIs Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. \u0014\n\u0014\nHow fair, though, is that charge? Does religion poison everything? Or \njust some things? \u0014\n\u0014\nSeptember 11 and Afterward\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Muslims happily blowing up themselves, and others, on an almost \ndaily basis, to Westboro Baptist Church pastor Fred Phelps and \ncompany picketing (Thank God for Dead Soldiers) military funerals, \nto the Jewish extremists among West Bank settlers, to pedophile \nCatholic priests, to violent Hindu nationalists in Indiaand more, \nfaith in God above can at times seem to help breed nastiness here \nbelow. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis is nothing new. A century before Christ, Roman poet Lucretius \nwrote: To such heights of evil are men driven by religion. In the \n1600s French mystic Blaise Pascal famously warned that men never do \nevil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious \nconviction, an inconvenient truth that's been confirmed ad nauseam \nthrough the millennia. And before we were one percent through the new \nmillennium, the September 11 terroristsno doubt screaming about how \ngreat God was as they vanished into obliviongave those who didn't \nlike religion to begin with all the ammo that they needed to dislike \nit even more. In fact, the impetus for the so-called New Atheists \nwas, they themselves say, September 11, which is why it's no \ncoincidence that many of their books (The God Delusion, God Is Not \nGreat, The End of Faith, for example) were published after the twin \ntowers went down. \u0014\n\u0014\nMy respect for the Abrahamic religions went up in the smoke and \nchoking dust of September 11, said Richard Dawkins, the grand \npooh-bah of the New Atheists. The last vestige of respect for the \ntaboo disappeared as I watched the 'Day of Prayer' in the Washington \nCathedral, where people of mutually incompatible faiths united in \nhomage to the very force that caused the problem in the first place: \nreligion. \u0014\n\u0014\nDawkins has a point, but only to a point. No question, religion \nplayed a key role in the September 11 attacks. Atheists generally \ndon't, as a rule, fly jetliners filled with people into buildings or \nstrap explosives to their bodies and walk into mosques and blow up \nthemselves and others. Atheists and agnostics will, though, cram men, \nwomen, and children into gas chambers, or purposely starve to death \nentire populations. One doesn't need religion to commit atrocities, \nthough, no question, it helps. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Perversion of Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever much the faithful are loath to admit it, religion has been \nand still is a source of evil. Whether this evil is a direct result \nof religions themselves or a human perversion of faith is a \ncomplicated question whose answer depends upon a host of other \nquestions, the most relevant being What exactly does the religion \nteach? \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen, for instance, members of the Russian Orthodox Church, in the \nname of Jesus, massacred Jews in Czarist Russia, it was hardly \nrelevant to those Jews being tortured, raped, and murdered whether or \nnot Jesus or Christianity as a whole condoned such horrific actions. \nIt mattered to the name of the Russian Orthodox Church, or to \nChristianity, or to the vast majority of Russian Orthodox who never \nwould have partaken in such things and who found them abhorrent. But \nto the Jews themselves, the victims, that was distinction without a \ndifference, to be sure. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt's the same with Islam, unquestionably the center of so much of the \nviolence associated with religion today. Even if one doesn't believe \n(to quote President George W. Bush) that Islam is peace and that \nIslam is a faith based upon love, not hate, the vast majority of \nMuslims aren't involved in the violence, and large numbers certainly \ndon't condone it either. More Muslims are the victims of violence \ndone in the name of Islam than are, it seems, directly involved in \nperpetrating that violence. \u0014\n\u0014\nAlso, despite such New Testament texts as Let nothing be done \nthrough selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let \neach esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not \nonly for his own interests, but also for the interests of others \n(Philippians 2:3, 4) or Therefore, whatever you want men to do to \nyou, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets(Matthew \n7:12), history reeks with examples of how that same book has been \ntwisted and perverted by malevolent forces. Whether prelates in Rome \nusing the Bible to incite crusades in the Middle Ages, to \nnineteenth-century British industrialists citing Scripture's promises \nof a better afterlife in order to justify starvation wages now, \nChristianity has been a fertile source for what Frenchman Michel \nFoucault called regimes of truth, the discourse used by those in \npower to control the masses. Also, one doesn't have to be an expert \non the Koran or Islam in order to suspect that Muslims who use their \nfaith to justify blowing up other Muslims in mosques have distorted \nthe writings of Muhammad. \u0014\n\u0014\nBad Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if one could justifiably argue that these are perversions of the \nfaith, with thousands of sects and cults in existence it's not \nunreasonable to think that some might be bad, in that they advocate \nviolence and hatred as doctrine. The Charles Manson cult, for \ninstance, committed horrific crimes in hopes of starting a race war \nbetween Whites and Blacks in the United States that would usher in \nArmageddon and in which Manson, the self-proclaimed reincarnation of \nJesus, would reign supreme. \u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, bad faith doesn't always require such aberrant and \nabhorrent theology. Religion, particularly the Abrahamic faiths, in \nwhich a sovereign God reigns supreme over all, can easily be \nexploited. When a person believes that he or she is doing God's \nwillbe it liberating the Holy Land from the Turks, to forcing Jews \nto convert, to flying jetliners into buildingsthen what other choice \ndo they have but to obey? As the New Testament says: We ought to \nobey God rather than men (Acts 5:29), an idea that in and of itself \nis fine but has proven exceedingly problematic, the biggest one \nperhaps being How do people know for sure what obeying God entails? \nThis is not just subtle theology, not considering all the evil done \nby those certain that they were doing God's will. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter burning down a Pequot Indian village and massacring its men, \nwomen, and children, American colonist Captain John Mason exulted: \nWe were like men in a dream; then was our mouth filled with \nlaughter, and our tongues with singing; thus we may say that the Lord \nhath done great things for us among the heathen, whereof we are glad. \nPraise ye the Lord! This was, one assumes Mason believed, the same \nLord who commanded that you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I \nam the Lord (Leviticus 19:18). \u0014\n\u0014\nClearly something crucial had gotten lost along the way.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/My Documents/Does Religion Poison \nEverything?\u0014",

Henry James \u0014\nwas a distinguished American writer. William James, the father \u0014\nof American pragmatic philosophy, was also well known. \u0014\n\u0014\nSister Alice was never as well known as her two brothers, but \u0014\nshe was a sensitive and caring person. \u0014\n\u0014\nAn invalid from the age of eighteen until she died at forty, \u0014\nAlice James possessed a radiant spirit. Reading through her \u0014\njournal, one would never guess she was an invalid. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile reading George Eliot's letters in which Eliot (pseudo- \u0014\nnym of Mary Ann Evans) frequently complained of her aches \u0014\nand pains, Alice once asked, \"Where was the creature's pride?\" \u0014\nAnd her biographer writes about Alice: \"She never accepted \u0014\nthe horizons of invalidism.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAlice James had a problem, to be sure. But she didn't com- \u0014\npound her physical problems with the added problem of a poor \u0014\nattitude. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe lesson she has taught us ought to be remembered.\u0014",

About 99 percent of Denmark's Jews \u0014\nsurvived the Holocaust. Denmark did not produce a Quisling; it \u0014\ndid not resemble Vichy France.

An autopsy will determine how they died.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolice initially reported a woman's body was found in the freezer, \nbut later said it was actually the bodies of the two children in a \nplastic bag.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe boy was about 11 and the girl was 14, said police Chief James \nCraig who called it a \"terrible find.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe woman was not in the apartment when the court officers or police \narrived. \"One of the community members here ... approached our \nofficers and advised that they knew where the parent was located,\" \nCraig said.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe children's mother was found in a nearby apartment and questioned. \nShe was arrested later Tuesday. Her name has not been released.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo of the woman's other children, ages 11 and 17, were found at a \nneighbor's home and placed in protective custody.\u0014\n\u0014\nNeighbor and friend Tori Childs said she hadn't seen the two dead \nchildren in about a year.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"I haven't seen them since they were playing with my step-kids,\" \nChilds said.\u0014\n\u0014\nChilds' mother, Carrie McDonald, also lives in the low-income housing \ncomplex.

Raised in the south during the \nCivil War, Isidor would go on to New York where he would jointly \nfound a store that sold crockery and glassware with his brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter becoming extremely wealthy, Isidor married Rosalie Ida Blun, \nand by all accounts the two were inseparable.

Although Isidor \nwas offered a seat in a lifeboar to accompany Ida, he refused seating \nwhile there were still women and children aboard and refused to be \nmade an exception. According to friend and Titanic survivor Colonel \nArchibald Gracie IV, upon seeing that Ida was refusing to leave her \nhusband, offered to ask a deck officer if Isidor and Ida would both \nenter a lifeboat together. Isidor was reported to have told Colonel \nGracie in a firm tone: I will not go before the other men. Ida \ninsisted her newly hired English maid, Ellen Bird, get into lifeboat \n#8. She gave Ellen her fur coat stating she would not be needing it. \nIda is reported to have said, I will not be separated from my \nhusband. As we have lived, so will we die, together.

Eyewitnesses described the scene \nas a most remarkable exhibition of love and devotion.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe couple then proceeded to the back of the panicking crowd and were \nlast seen sitting together in chairs on the deck of the ship, calmly \nholding hands until a massive wave washed them into the sea.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday a memorial for Ida and Isidor can be seen on the main floor of \nMacys Department Store in Manhattan.\u0014",

But there's more--when he was 12. At his home he \nhad a pet duck. His duck was named Amos. One day Jesus saw Amos on \nthe ground, and he wasn't moving. His wings weren't moving. Jesus \nsaid, 'Amos is dead.' He called a bunch of his friends around the \nduck and said, 'We need to pray,' and he did. When he got through \npraying, Amos got up and walked off. That happened when he was 12 \nyears old. Isn't that a beautiful story?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, I liked to have gone ballistic. I was furious. Of course, that \nnever happened, but I guarantee you that those children will remember \nthat story the rest of their lives. I was so furious that I thought I \ncouldn't preach, but I finally gathered myself enough to do that in \nsome fashion, but when I had the benediction, I walked straight out \nof the church. I had a bunch of my family there (John, Randy, Cathie, \nCindy, Rob, Sara and Kevin).

Mention of \"theistic \nevolution\" provokes suspicious stares.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopularizers of modern science bear much of the responsibility for \nthe tense situation that exists and strenuous opposition to science \nitself because they often smuggle naturalism into their explications \nof modern science.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere's one example. Every semester I teach a course on modern \nChristian theology and begin with the Enlightenment and scientific \nrevolutions of the 17th and 18th centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nI show the tail end (last chapter) of a documentary called \n\"Infinitely Reasonable: Science Revises the Heavens.\" It's part of a \n10-part series with the overarching title \"The Day the Universe \nChanged.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe host, narrator and author of the book the series is based on is \nBritish journalist James Burke.\u0014\n\u0014\nMuch of the episode deals with \"the Galileo affair\" between Galileo's \nproof of Copernicus' belief in a sun-centered solar system and the \nCatholic Church's traditional belief in an earth-centered system of \nsun and planets.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Burke talks about post-Galileo scientific discoveries about \nnature ending with Isaac Newton.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe never mentions, of course, that Newton was a strong believer in \nGod who was obsessed with discovering the date of the return of \nChrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt the very end of the episode, Burke is standing in the library of \nEmpress Maria Teresa's palace in Vienna talking about Roger \nBoscovitch and how he brought about the pope's lifting of the ban on \nCopernicus' book about the solar system.\u0014\n\u0014\nJust before that he was on a roller coaster and another carnival ride \ntalking about Newton's laws of nature - especially gravity - and how \ntheir discovery made possible the exact prediction of the late return \nof Halley's Comet.\u0014\n\u0014\nBurke stands at a window looking out over the city of Vienna and says \n(paraphrasing) that all this modern science stuff leading up to the \nconclusion that the universe is a clock-like machine that works by \nmathematics is wonderful if you have the \"confidence\" to realize that \nwhat it means - that man is alone in the universe, that there is \nnobody \"out there\" who cares.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, I lead the students in a discussion of what a non sequitur \nthat is. Newton, I tell them, thought that physics was \"thinking \nGod's thoughts after him.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHardly anyone in Newton's time would have drawn the conclusion that \nNewton's discoveries of natural laws like gravity require atheism.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Christians actually used his discoveries as part of a project of \nnatural religion to form a basis for Christian apologetics - arguing \n(like contemporary believers in \"intelligent design\") that the \nscientific revolution supported belief in God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I wonder, though, is how many school children and young people \nviewing that film in a secular education setting, without guidance \nfrom a Christian professor, realize how idiotic Burke's conclusion is \n- based on what went before it in the film?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe film illustrates a very common problem contributing to the \ntension between conservative (traditional) Christianity and modern \nscience - popularizers of modern science smuggling naturalism and \neven atheism into modern science as its logical concomitant.\u0014\n\u0014\nI could mention more examples, such as documentary series \"The \nCosmos,\" which was re-released (with some updating) recently.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt begins with popularizer (a scientist in his own right) Carl Sagan \nsaying, \"The cosmos is all there is, all there ever was, and all \nthere ever will be.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nTalk about a presupposition that science itself cannot prove. And \nyet, how many school students have been swayed by such \npopularizations of science that smuggle naturalism into it?\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other side, of course, are the many anti-modern science books, \nfilms, podcast lectures and so on produced by conservative Christians.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese publications bash modern science using flimsy evidence and \narguments to attempt to prove that the Bible teaches and \"real \nscience\" supports that the earth was created in six days of 24 hours \neach about 10,000 years ago.\u0014\n\u0014\nI have yet to meet a deeply committed Christian scientist with strong \ncredentials in scientific research (biology, geology, anthropology \nand so on) who agrees with that.\u0014\n\\\u0002Roger Olson is the Foy Valentine professor of Christian theology \nand ethics at George W.

    "words": "Do Christianity and Science Oppose Each Other?: Part 2 \u0014\nRoger Olson\u0014\nWednesday, September 9, 2015 \u0014\n\u0014\nIn my experience, very few actual scientists believe in or promote \n\"scientific monism,\" but many popularizers of modern science do just \nthat, Olson says. (Image courtesy of Areeya/FreeDigitalPhotos.net) \u0014\n\u0014\nOne of my favorite theologians is the late Emil Brunner, Karl Barth's \nnemesis and counterpart in the dialectical theology movement in \nSwitzerland in the 1920s through the 1950s.\u0014\n\u0014\nI say \"nemesis\" because they had a very famous and unfortunate, \nlengthy and complicated argument about \"natural theology\" in which \nBarth used very strong language against Brunner and Brunner responded \nby attacking Barth's views on a number of issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nI say \"counterpart\" because they were, in so many ways, very close in \ntheir thinking - for example, about Christ as the center of Christian \ntheology and the Bible as a witness to revelation not verbally \ninspired.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot long ago, I read for the first time Brunner's excellent little \nbook, \"Philosophy of Religion from the Standpoint of Protestant \nTheology.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThere, beginning on page 171, he dived \"head first\" into this whole \ncontroversy with a section on \"The Bible and the Scientific View of \nthe World.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe starts out admitting that \"By its undreamed of progress science \nhas forced faith to disencumber itself of certain relics of \n(primitive) science.\" That seems beyond debate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen he continued by arguing that theology has no business \nintervening in the framing of scientific hypotheses. \"It should never \nhave entered the head of Christian theologians to intervene in the \ncontroversy over Darwinism, so long as the framing of evolutionary \ntheories was confined in a strictly scientific manner to the domain \nof what is open to observation.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's a particularly pithy and insightful statement that takes a lot \nof unpacking only because of the complicated tensions that exist \nbetween \"religion\" and \"science.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBasically Brunner was challenging both Christian theology and science \nto respect their boundaries and limits. In essence, he was slapping \nJames Burke's wrist (anachronistically, of course).\u0014\n\u0014\nThen Brunner makes an astounding statement. \"Impossible it is that \nany essential position of Christian faith should be affected ... by \nchanges in the scientific view of the world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne must pay attention to every word in that statement to avoid \nconfusion and wrongheaded objection.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Essential position\" means something different to Brunner than to \nmany conservative evangelical Christians who have elevated the age of \nthe earth to a dogma.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd \"scientific view of the world\" means something different to \nBrunner than to many secular popularizers of science who present it \nas including naturalism - the belief that nature is all there is.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrunner then explains how necessary it always is to free \"the \nsubstance of the Bible\" from its temporary forms.\u0014\n\u0014\nEveryone does that whether they realize or admit it or not. The only \nquestion is what is included in \"the substance of the Bible.\" For \nBrunner, it is Christ and the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Brunner stated that the real conflict between \"faith\" and \n\"science\" appears especially when modern scientists (or, I would say, \npopularizers of science) smuggle \"scientific monism\" into \"science.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBrunner labels \"scientific monism\" (which many since him have called \n\"scientism\") \"superstition.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy \"scientific monism\" he meant the belief that all of life's \nquestions can be answered by science and that by its own methods \nscience is capable (eventually) of providing a comprehensive \nunderstanding of all of reality.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn my experience, very few actual scientists believe in or promote \n\"scientific monism,\" but many popularizers of modern science do just \nthat - by implication (for example, James Burke).\u0014\n\u0014\nBrunner rightly noted, \"It is with philosophy that the serious \nconflict of faith is fought out.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem is that philosophy is often smuggled into the teaching of \nscience - especially by popularizers who either don't understand \nscience's limitations or misuse science, misunderstood or \nmisrepresented, to promote their philosophy (that is, naturalism).\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, Brunner ends the discussion of \"The Bible and the Scientific \nView of the World\" with this astounding conclusion: \"Opposition to \nfaith in revelation does not grow out of science, philosophy or \nculture, but out of false thinking about science, philosophy and \nculture.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, there is no necessary conflict between faith and \nphilosophy either. That conflict also arises only when philosophy \nbegins with certain presuppositions that rule out faith from the \nbeginning.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortunately, postmodern philosophy is beginning to reverse that trend \nand re-open philosophy's door to taking religion seriously (as more \nthan myth).\u0014\n\u0014\nRoger Olson is the Foy Valentine professor of Christian theology and \nethics at George W. Truett Theological Seminary in Waco, Texas. He is \nthe author of numerous books, including \"Against Calvinism\" and \"The \nStory of Christian Theology.\"\u0014",

    "title": "DIS MATTHEW THINK PETER WAS A FALSE DISCIPLE?",
    "words": "Did Matthew Think Peter Was a False Disciple?\u0014\nA new book from a top evangelical scholar makes the case. \u0014\n\u0014\nKevin P. Emmert/ October 30, 2015 \u0014\nA leading evangelical scholar says Matthew t\u0014\nhought Peter was as bad as Judas.\u0014\nRobert Gundry, scholar-in-residence and professor emeritus of New \nTestament and Greek at Westmont College, argues in his most recent \nbook, Peter  False Disciple and Apostate according to Saint Matthew \n(Eerdmans), that Matthew portrays Peter as a false disciple of \nJesus, a disciple who went so far as to apostatize. He believes \nMatthew does so to warn Christians against the loss of salvation \nthrough falsity-exposing apostasy and against the ongoing presence \nof false disciples in the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe good news about Christ needed to be tailored to Matthews, \nMarks, Lukes, and Johns [respective] audiences, Gundry told CT. \nHence the differences between the four Gospels. We have the good \nnews according to Matthew, and so on. We have different versions of \nthe good news suited to different needs and circumstances.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the case of Matthews portrayal of Peter, Gundry believes Matthew \nrevised, added to, and subtracted from Marks narrative in order to \npresent Peter unfavorably. Matthews audience, he says, faced a more \nsignificant threat of persecution and needed warning against apostasy.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnlike the other Gospels, Matthew does not include an account of \nPeters restoration. After denying Jesus, Peter simply went outside \nand wept bitterly (Matt. 26:75). And his weeping looks more like \ndespair than repentance, said Gundry. Thus, Peter fits Matthews \ncriteria of false disciples and apostates, and shares the same status \nof that of Judas.\u0014\n\u0014\nGundry believes that Matthews omission of Peters rehabilitation \nwarns readers that even the most committed disciples can fall away, \nwhereas Lukes and Johns accounts stress that even cowardly deniers \ncan be restored.\u0014\n\u0014\nGundry does not believe that conflicting portraits force readers to \naccept one instead of another. No, he writes in the book, a choice \nof one portrayal over the other undermines the canonical authority of \nall Scripture; and systematization in the form of harmonization \ndamages one or another, or both, of the portrayals and in the process \nmakes one or both of them mean less than they naturally and even \nobviously mean.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a response to a lecture Gundry gave that preceded the book, \nWestmont provost Mark Sargent praised Gundrys close textual \nanalysis and said his argument succeeds best in demonstrating that \nMatthew amplifies the false discipleship theme in his own \nself-contained narrative. But he was unconvinced that Peters \ndenial of Christ in Matthew brands him once and for all as a false \ndisciple destined for eternal damnation. Sargent believes placing \nPeter alongside Judas is an interpretive misstep. Judass lapse is \nforecast right from the get-go, he said. But why not Peter also if \nMatthew is intent on the parallel?\u0014\n\u0014\nGundry believes that Matthew identifies Judas as the betrayer of \nJesus from the very start because Matthew is simply copying Mark at \nthat point. But Matthew has no precedent for describing Peter in \nsuch a way as to imply false discipleship. Literarily speaking, \n[Matthew] creates a certain amount of suspense for the reader to see \nthe progressive denigration of Peter.\u0014\n\u0014\nSargent also said Peters inclusion among the 11 disciples at the \nGreat Commission (Matt. 28) makes no sense if he was eternally \noutside of Gods grace. But Gundry says this doesnt suggest Peter \nwas restored in Matthews account. Rather, it reinforces Matthews \nwarning against false disciples, he said. He notes that the parables \nof the tares among the wheat and the inedible fish among the edible \nfish in chapter 13 exist only in Matthew. The whole point of those \nparables is that false disciples continue in the church right up to \nthe eschaton, he said.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Peters denial shouldnt necessarily be singled out from the \nother disciples actions, said Michael Bird, lecturer in theology at \nRidley College in Melbourne, Australia. The fact that all of the \ndisciples fled from Jesus in Gethsemane suggests that they all were \nashamed of him and in some sense proved false by abandoning him, \nhe said. Peters failure is indeed exacerbated, but essentially \nrepresentative of the failure of the wider circle.\u0014\n\u0014\nGundry is hesitant, however, to equate the disciples flight with \nPeters denial. In Matthew there is a strong emphasis on the need \nfor disciples to flee persecution, he said. Jesus said, When you \nare persecuted in one place, flee to another (Matt. 10:23). And he \nhimself is said to have moved from one place to another in order to \nescape danger.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe novelty of Gundrys novelty is troubling, said David Farnell of \nThe Masters Seminary. Never in the history of the church has Peter \never been regarded in the sense in which Gundry says Matthew \nportrays him, he wrote in response to Gundrys lecture. A close \nlook at the other Gospel writers as well as other books of the New \nTestament reveal quite a different picture of Peter.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Gundry says he is not interested in subverting traditional \nviews about Peter. Nor is he concerned with constructing the identity \nand life of Peter. Rather, he is interested in what he believes is \nMatthews distinctive account of the apostle, and the implications it \nmight have for theology and pastoral care.\u0014\n\u0014\nCraig Keener of Asbury Theological Seminary isnt so sure that \nMatthewss account of Peter is so distinctive. If Matthew was meant \nto be interpreted in a different way than the rest of the [New \nTestament], he would have had to be much more explicit, he said. \nMatthews audience presumably knew Marks Gospel and other stories \nabout Peter, who was mentioned in Pauls letters, he said.\u0014\nSimilarly, Bird said readers in the early church would not have \ntreated Matthew as a free-standing narrative. Matthew may have fully \nintended his Gospel to be read amidst a wider body of tradition where \nknowledge of Peters restoration and subsequent ministry was fully \nknown. And that, he noted, is what modern readers have as well.\u0014",

    "title": "DO BABIES GO TO HEAVEN?",
    "words": "Do babies go to heaven? I cannot think of a theological question I am \nasked more often. \u0014\nAlthough infant mortality rates in the West have decreased over the \npast few centuries, the eternal destiny of deceased babies remains a \npoint of concern for many Christians. The question is easy to ask, \nbut difficult to answer. And it has significant implications for the \nway we think abou t God, let alone children.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe emotional urgency of the question demands a response. Few pastors \nor ends want to say, \"I don't know.\" As a result, many of us are \ntempted to proof-text-to use isolated, out-of-context quotations from \nScripture to establish a position. So we come up with answers like: \nYes. Jesus let the little children come to him (Luke 18:15-16).\u0014\n \u0014\nNo. All humans are sinners in Adam until they believe in Christ (Rom. \n5:12-21).\u0014\n \u0014\nYes. David knew that he would see his son in the afterlife (2 Sam. \n12:15-23).\u0014\n \u0014\nNo. Not unless they have been baptized: \"No one can enter the kingdom \nof God unless they are born of water and the Spirit\" (John 3:5). \u0014\n\u0014\nYes. If their parents are believers: A child is sanctified by a \nChristian parent (1 Cor. 7:14).\u0014\n \u0014\nAnd so on. Even if none of these pasages, when read in context, \nactually tells us whether babies go to heaven, our desire for a solid \nanswer drives us to find one.\u0014\n \u0014\nA number of theologians have tried to answer the question in a \nbroader way. The Westminster Confession of Faith affirms that some \ninfants are elect, bur it does not tell how to discriminate an \u0014\nelect baby from a non-elect one. The Catholic Catechism says infants \nmight be saved without baptism, but stops short of affirming that all \nwill be-though John Paul II, in his Evangelium Vitae, implies that \nunborn children would be. \u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral leading evangelicals, like Albert Mohler and John Piper, \nbelieve that all infants will be saved. Infants, they claim, cannot \nmentally understand the nature of God and therefore are not \"without \nexcuse\" like the rest of humanity (Rom. 1:20). Meanwhile, Orthodox \ntheologians shake their heads in disdain, believing that if it \nweren't for Augustine's influence on Western Christianity, we \nwouldn't even be asking \u0014\nsuch a question. (The Eastern Church as a whole has rejected \nAugustine's view that Adam's sin is imputed to all humans, babies \nincluded.)\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years I wondered why the Bible was silent on this issue. \nTheologically, I found the \"yes\" argument-especially when considering \nthe mental ability of cildren, and therefore their accountability \nbefore God-persuasive. I still do. Personally, I never worried that \nmy hildren would go to hell if they suddenly died. I still don't. \nPastorally, I was happy to reassure people in my congregation that \ntheir deceased infants were with Jesus. I still am happy to reassure \nthem. Yet it still bothered me that Scripture was not clear on the \nmatter. I have two children with special needs who may not be able to \nfully understand the gospel. If the Bible was given to make us wise \nconcerning salvation (2 Tim. 3:15), I wondered, why is it so \nopen-ended on this?\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, a few years ago, I was on a conference panel with two friends, \nfielding questions from teenagers. Someone asked this question, and \none of my friends suggested a thought experiment. \"Imagine,\"he said, \n\"that one passage in Scripture gave a clear answer. Let's say this \ntext undoubtedly affirmed that all infants who died before age, say, \n5 would be  saved. If that were the case, some sick cult would have \nemerged that killed children before they reached age 5, in order to \nsend them to heaven. Cults have been founded on much less.\"\u0014\n \u0014\nSuddenly, I saw that there are some subjects on which Scripture is \nunclear for our good. Some questions are better answered with \ntentativeness rather than certainty. Clarity can bring security, \nbutit can also breed presumption. Some guarantees can lead to joy, \nbut in the wrong hands, they can lead to genocide.\u0014\n \u0014\nSo I have come to believe that it is enough to know and, when asked \nabout such matters, to say: We can trust the character of God-the one \nwho loves us so much that he came and gave himself for us. We can be \nconfident that his judgments are always right, his nature is always \ngood, his mercy is always wide, and his desire for people to be saved \nis greater still than ours.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nEldred Wilson, Christianity Today, November 2015\u0014",

    "words": "Divorce is a Death\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce hurts like death. It leaves an empty place in your heart, \nyour dreams, your hopes, your feeling of security; leaves a hole in \nyour life. You have lost the dream of having that one constant, \nconsistent person to get through life with. If you have children, \nyour heart breaks because they have lost that too. \u0014\nDivorce is Betrayal at a Soul Level\u0014\n\u0014\nYou do feel betrayed at a deep level because the other person, \nwhatever they are choosing (whether it be another partner, drugs, \nbeing single), is more important than you are. It clearly and loudly \nsays, You are not my priority, not my desire, not my choice. It \nhurts to the core.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a Soul Deep Accuser \u0014\n\u0014\nOne does begin to doubt themselves; what could I have done \ndifferently. What is wrong with me? \u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Becomes an Identity\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is embarrassing to say you are divorced. You feel like people \nare thinking/saying, what is wrong with you? Why can't you make it \nwork? Why can't you stay married? I've heard people say, What is \nwrong with the Skaggs girls? They've all 3 been divorced. Or people \nwill say, He or she has been married 3 times, 4 times. That \nstatement is loaded with unspoken innuendos. There is a stigma and \nlabel. When you get to the point of realizing that divorce is \nsomething you experienced, not your identity, then you can move on \nwith your life.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Strengthened and Weakened My Faith\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce can strengthen your faith in God if you turn to God for \ncomfort and strength. Some may get angry at God and say, why did you \nlet this happen to me? I don't know how those who have no faith get \nthrough it except to say they must have friends/family around them \nwho do have faith and help them through it. For me, it was a time \nthat I was closest to the Lord than I have ever been before. I was at \nrock bottom. Sometimes that is what it takes for us to open up and \nlisten to the Lord's leading. \u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce leaves scars. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt leaves a wake in its path. It impacts your future relationships \nand it can leave children with hurtful, disappointing, heart-breaking \nfeelings and memories. Some children do fine because both parents \nwork together to minimize those negative feelings. Other children, \nwho aren't so fortunate, deal with the pain for the rest of their \nlives. Sometimes, not always, but a lot of the times, adding step \nparents just complicates and magnifies the pain. Divorce should not \nbe taken lightly and should be the last resort. \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nANGELA SKAGGS LAYNE 7/20/16\u0014\n\u0014\n---------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a Death - Without a doubt.You have lost the person that \nyou thought was your true love, your best friend and the person who \nwas supposed to always be there.The life you built and were building \nis dead.You may never see or speak to that person again and even if \nyou do, it's like an out of body experience. It's hard to remember \nwhat you had at some point because it's dead.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce is a Soul Deep Accuser. Not sure I totally agree with this. \nYou definitely doubt yourself; you either feel like a loser or feel \nthat others see you as one.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Becomes an Identity. This is true. It took a long time to \nsay, \"I'm divorced\" and not cringe a little and wonder what people \nwere thinking. I've often wondered why do we need to check \"divorced\" \non all the doctor forms? Why wouldn't single be enough? Or does \ndivorced mean tragically alone while single means you're out having \nfun.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce Strengthened and Weakened My Faith. Don't totally agree with \nthis. I think every person and their personal level of faith \ndetermines that. I turned more to my faith, but the feelings of \nanger, disappointment and the transition a person goes through \ncertainly make it understandable that one could have feelings of \nturning from God during that time.\u0014\n\u0014\nCINDY SKAGGS ROWE    7/20/16\u0014",

    "title": "DEEP IN THE SWAMPS, HOW SLAVES KEPT THEIR FREEDOM",
    "words": "Deep in the Swamps, Archaeologists Are Finding \nHow Fugitive Slaves Kept Their Freedom\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Richard Grant; Photographs by Allison Shelley \u0014\nSmithsonian Magazine     September 2016 \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Dismal Swamp was once a thriving refuge for runaways\u0014\n\u0014\nThe worse it gets, as I wade and stumble through the Great Dismal \nSwamp, the better I understand its history as a place of refuge. Each \nripping thorn and sucking mudhole makes it clearer. It was the dense, \ntangled hostility of the swamp and its enormous size that enabled \nhundreds, and perhaps thousands, of escaped slaves to live here in \nfreedom.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont know much about them, but thanks to the archaeologist \nhacking through the mire ahead of me, we know they were out here, \nsubsisting in hidden communities, and using almost nothing from the \noutside world until the 19th century. The Dismal Swamp covered great \ntracts of southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina, and its \nvegetation was far too thick for horses or canoes. In the early \n1600s, Native Americans fleeing the colonial frontier took refuge \nhere, and they were soon joined by fugitive slaves, and probably some \nwhites escaping indentured servitude or hiding from the law. From \nabout 1680 to the Civil War, it appears that the swamp communities \nwere dominated by Africans and African-Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThigh deep in muddy water, wearing Levis and hiking boots rather than \nwaterproof waders like me, Dan Sayers stops to light a cigarette. \nHes a historical archaeologist and chair of the anthropology \ndepartment at American University in Washington, D.C., but he looks \nmore like an outlaw country singer. Long-haired and bearded, 43 years \nold, he habitually wears a battered straw cowboy hat and a pair of \nWaylon Jennings-style sunglasses. Sayers is a Marxist and a vegan who \nsmokes nearly two packs a day and keeps himself revved up on Monster \nEnergy drinks until its time to crack a beer.\u0014\n\u0014\nI was such a dumb-ass, he says. I was looking for hills, hummocks, \nhigh ground because thats what Id read in the documents: Runaway \nslaves living on hills.... I had never set foot in a swamp before. I \nwasted so much time. Finally, someone asked me if Id been to the \nislands in North Carolina. Islands! That was the word Id been \nmissing.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Dismal Swamp, now reduced by draining and development, is \nmanaged as a federal wildlife refuge. The once-notorious panthers are \ngone, but bears, birds, deer and amphibians are still abundant. So \nare venomous snakes and biting insects. In the awful heat and \nhumidity of summer, Sayers assures me, the swamp teems with water \nmoccasins and rattlesnakes. The mosquitoes get so thick that they can \nblur the outlines of a person standing 12 feet away.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn early 2004, one of the refuge biologists strapped on his waders \nand brought Sayers to the place were going, a 20-acre island \noccasionally visited by hunters, but completely unknown to historians \nand archaeologists. Before Sayers, no archaeology had been done in \nthe swamps interior, mainly because conditions were so challenging. \nOne research party got lost so many times that it gave up.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen youve been toiling through the sucking ooze, with submerged \nroots and branches grabbing at your ankles, dry solid ground feels \nalmost miraculous. We step onto the shore of a large, flat, \nsun-dappled island carpeted with fallen leaves. Walking toward its \ncenter, the underbrush disappears, and we enter a parklike clearing \nshaded by a few hardwoods and pines.\u0014\n\u0014\nIll never forget seeing this place for the first time, recalls \nSayers. It was one of the greatest moments of my life. I never \ndreamed of finding a 20-acre island, and I knew instantly it was \nlivable. Sure enough, you cant put a shovel in the ground anywhere \non this island without finding something.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe has named his excavation areasthe Grotto, the Crest, North \nPlateau and so onbut he wont name the island itself. In his \nacademic papers and his 2014 book, A Desolate Place for a Defiant \nPeople, Sayers refers to it as the nameless site. I dont want to \nput a false name on it, he explains. Im hoping to find out what \nthe people who lived here called this place. As he sifts the earth \nthey trod, finding the soil footprints of their cabins and tiny \nfragments of their tools, weapons and white clay pipes, he feels a \nprofound admiration for them, and this stems in part from his Marxism.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese people performed a critique of a brutal capitalistic \nenslavement system, and they rejected it completely. They risked \neverything to live in a more just and equitable way, and they were \nsuccessful for ten generations. One of them, a man named Charlie, was \ninterviewed later in Canada. He said that all labor was communal \nhere. Thats how it would have been in an African village.\u0014\n\u0014\nWherever Africans were enslaved in the world, there were runaways who \nescaped permanently and lived in free independent settlements. These \npeople and their descendants are known as maroons. The term \nprobably comes from the Spanish cimarrn, meaning feral livestock, \nfugitive slave or something wild and defiant.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarronage, the process of extricating oneself from slavery, took \nplace all over Latin America and the Caribbean, in the slave islands \nof the Indian Ocean, in Angola and other parts of Africa. But until \nrecently, the idea that maroons also existed in North America has \nbeen rejected by most historians.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2004, when I started talking about large, permanent maroon \nsettlements in the Great Dismal Swamp, most scholars thought I was \nnuts, says Sayers. They thought in terms of runaways, who might \nhide in the woods or swamps for a while until they got caught, or who \nmight make it to freedom on the Underground Railroad, with the help \nof Quakers and abolitionists.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy downplaying American marronage, and valorizing white involvement \nin the Underground Railroad, historians have shown a racial bias, in \nSayers opinion, a reluctance to acknowledge the strength of black \nresistance and initiative. Theyve also revealed the shortcomings of \ntheir methods: Historians are limited to source documents. When it \ncomes to maroons, there isnt that much on paper. But that doesnt \nmean their story should be ignored or overlooked. As archaeologists, \nwe can read it in the ground.\u0014\n\u0014\nSayers first heard about the Dismal Swamp maroons from one of his \nprofessors at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, \nVirginia. They were smoking cigarettes after class in late 2001. \nSayers proposed to do his dissertation on the archaeology of \n19th-century agriculture. Stifling a yawn, Prof. Marley Brown III \nasked him what he knew about the maroons of the Great Dismal Swamp \nand suggested this would make a more interesting dissertation \nproject. It sounded great, says Sayers. I had no idea what I was \ngetting into.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe started doing archival research on the Great Dismal Swamp. He \nfound scattered references to maroons dating back to the early 1700s. \nThe first accounts described runaway slaves and Native Americans \nraiding farms and plantations, and then disappearing back into the \nswamp with stolen livestock. In 1714, Alexander Spotswood, the \ncolonial lieutenant governor of Virginia, described the Dismal Swamp \nas a No-mans-land, to which Loose and disorderly people daily \nflock. Since Africans and African-Americans were not referred to as \npeople in the records of 18th-century Virginia, this suggests that \npoor whites were also joining the swamp communities.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1728, William Byrd II led the first survey into the Great Dismal \nSwamp, to determine the Virginia/North Carolina boundary. He \nencountered a family of maroons, describing them as mulattoes, and \nwas well aware that others were watching and hiding: It is certain \nmany Slaves Shelter themselves in this Obscure Part of the World.... \nByrd, an aristocratic Virginian, loathed his time in the swamp. \nNever was rum, that cordial of life, found more necessary than it \nwas in this dirty place.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the 1760s until the Civil War, runaway slave ads in the Virginia \nand North Carolina newspapers often mentioned the Dismal Swamp as the \nlikely destination, and there was persistent talk of permanent maroon \nsettlements in the morass. British traveler J.F.D. Smyth, writing in \n1784, gleaned this description: Runaway negroes have resided in \nthese places for twelve, twenty, or thirty years and upwards, \nsubsisting themselves in the swamp upon corn, hogs, and fowls....[On \nhigher ground] they have erected habitations, and cleared small \nfields around them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most comprehensive work that Sayers found was a 1979 dissertation \nby an oddball historian named Hugo Prosper Leaming. He was a white \nUnitarian minister and civil rights activist who managed to get \naccepted into a Black Muslim temple in Chicago and wore a fez with \nhis Unitarian robes. Leaming surveyed local and state records related \nto the Dismal Swamp, and scoured unpublished local histories, memoirs \nand novels for references to maroons. In his dissertation, later \npublished as a book, he presents a detailed account of maroon history \nin the swamp, with a list of prominent chiefs and vivid descriptions \nof Africanized religious practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis interpretations are stretchy, but I like the book, and it was \nuseful on the history, says Sayers. When it came to the \narchaeology, I had nothing. I didnt know where to look, or what to \nlook for. So I decided to survey the swamp, find the high ground and \ndig there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most useful map was a digital representation of the swamps \nvegetation. It showed clusters of tree species that typically grow on \nhigher, drier ground. To help him get into these areas, Sayers \nrecruited young, energetic assistants and armed them with machetes \nand loppers. I remember one day in particular, he says. There were \nfour of us and we went at it with everything we had, just sweating \nbullets. In eight hours, we made 200 feet. The brush was so thick it \nwould have taken us a week to get there, so we gave up.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the edge of the swamp, where sites were more accessible, Sayers \nfound some artifacts that clearly suggested maroons. But it wasnt \nuntil he saw the island that he felt the rush of a big discovery. He \nwent back to his professors with a timetable. In 12 weeks, he would \nidentify the key sites, complete the shovel tests and perform his \nexcavations. Then hed be ready to write his dissertation.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was probably the greatest underestimation in the history of \narchaeology, he says. Instead of 12 weeks, it took three \neight-month sessions. Then I spent five more summers excavating with \nmy students in field schools.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the excavation sites at the nameless site are now filled in and \ncovered over. Apart from some water catchment pits with fire-hardened \nfloors, theres not much he can show me. But Sayers is an expressive \ntalker and gesticulator, and as he walks me around the island, he \nconjures up clusters of log cabins, some with raised floors and \nporches. He points to invisible fields and gardens in the middle \ndistance, children playing, people fishing, small groups off hunting. \nCharlie, the ex-maroon interviewed in Canada, described people making \nfurniture and musical instruments.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere were hardships and deprivations, for sure, he says. But no \noverseer was going to whip them here. No one was going to work them \nin a cotton field from sunup to sundown, or sell their spouses and \nchildren. They were free. They had emancipated themselves.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the outside wall of Dan Sayers office at American University is a \nlarge photograph of Karl Marx, and a flier for Great Dismal Black IPA \nbeer. Inside, the office has a comfortable, masculine, lived-in feel. \nTheres an old pith helmet hanging on the wall, and a Jaws poster, \nand the front page of a newspaper announcing Obamas election. In the \nbookshelves are the entire works of Karl Marx.\u0014\n\u0014\nI ask him how his Marxism influences his archaeology. I think \ncapitalism is wrong, in terms of a social ideal, and we need to \nchange it, he says. Archaeology is my activism. Rather than go to \nthe Washington Mall and hold up a protest sign, I choose to dig in \nthe Great Dismal Swamp. By bringing a resistance story to light, you \nhope it gets into peoples heads.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen ideological passion drives research, in archaeology or anything \nelse, it can generate tremendous energy and important breakthroughs. \nIt can also lead to the glossing over of inconvenient data, and \nbiased results. Sayers has concluded that there were large, \npermanent, defiant resistance communities of maroons in the Great \nDismal Swamp. Is there a danger that hes over-interpreted the \nevidence?\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorical archaeology does require interpretation, he says. But I \nalways imagine what my worst critic is going to say, or want as \nevidence, and Ive done a decent enough job to convince my academic \npeers on this. Theres a few who dont buy it. The show-me-the-money \nhistorians dont see much money.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe takes me down the hall to his laboratory, where soil samples are \nstacked in plastic bags on high shelving units and hundreds of \nartifacts are bagged, numbered and stored in metal cabinets. I ask to \nsee the most important and exciting finds. In one sense, this has \nbeen the most frustrating archaeology project imaginable, he says. \nWe havent found much, and everything is small. On the other hand, \nits fascinating: These soils are completely undisturbed. Youre \nscratching the surface of an undiscovered world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn order to date these soils, and the traces of human occupation left \nin them, Sayers used a combination of techniques. One was the law of \nsuperposition: Layers of undisturbed soil get older as you dig \ndeeper. Also, artifacts found in them, arrowheads, pottery and \nmanufactured items like nails, can be dated through the collective \nknowledge of historical archaeologists, based on the objects style \nand attributes. The third technique was optically stimulated \nluminescence, or OSL.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe collected soil samples without exposing them to sunlight and sent \nthem to a lab, he explains. They can measure when these grains of \nsand last saw sunlight. Normally, historical archaeological projects \ndont need to use OSL because there are documents and mass-produced \nartifacts. Its a testament to how unique these communities were in \navoiding the outside world.\u0014\n\u0014\nBefore 1660, most people at the nameless site were Native Americans. \nThe first maroons were there within a few years of the arrival of \nAfrican slaves in nearby Jamestown in 1619. After 1680, Native \nAmerican materials become scarce; what he identifies as maroon \nartifacts begin to dominate.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSayers pulls out a stone arrowhead about an inch long, one side \nchipped away to form a tiny curved knife or scraper. In the interior \nof the swamp, there was only one source of stone, he says. Tools \nleft behind by indigenous Americans. Maroons would find them, modify \nthem, and keep using them until they were worn down into tiny nubs.\u0014\n\u0014\nNothing was more exciting than finding the footprints of seven cabins \nat the nameless site, in the 1660-1860 range. We know from documents \nthat maroons were living in the swamp then. Theres no record of \nanyone else living there. It is certainly not the type of place that \nyou would make a choice to live in, unless you needed to hide.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe pulls out a disk of plain, earth-colored Native American pottery, \nthe size of a large cookie. Maroons would find ceramics like this, \nand jam them down into the post holes of their cabins, to shore them \nup. This is probably the largest item weve found. Then he shows me \na tiny rusted copper bead, perhaps worn as jewelry, and another bead \nfused to a nail. The artifacts keep getting smaller: flakes of pipe \nclay, gunflint particles from the early 19th century, when the \noutside world was pushing into the swamp.\u0014\n\u0014\nEverything weve found would fit into a single shoe box, he says. \nAnd it makes sense. They were using organic materials from the \nswamp. Except for the big stuff like cabins, it decomposes without \nleaving a trace.\u0014\n\u0014\nSeven miles away from American University, at the new National Museum \nof African American History and Culture, an exhibit about the maroons \nof the Great Dismal Swamp is scheduled to go on view. For the curator \nNancy Bercaw, it presented an unusual challenge. The ethos here is \nthat objects should speak for themselves, she says, talking over \ncoffee in her office. Dan Sayers generously gave us ten objects. \nThey are reworked pebbles, shims for post holes, tiny fragments of \nstone from an unnamed island. Some of them look like grains of sand.\u0014\n\u0014\nArtifact 1 is a white clay tobacco-pipe fragment, 12 millimeters \nlong. There is a small chunk of burnt clay, a five-millimeter piece \nof flattened lead shot, a quartz flake, a British gunflint chip \n(circa 1790), a shard of glass, a nail head with a partial stem.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are not the sort of objects, in other words, that catch the eye \nor speak for themselves. Her solution was to mount some of them in \njewel cases like priceless treasures\u0014\n\u0014\nThe exhibit is in the 17,000-square-foot Slavery and Freedom gallery, \nin a section about free communities of color. Traditionally, weve \nstudied the institution of slavery, not enslavement as it was lived, \nshe says. Once you start looking at our history through an \nAfrican-American lens, it really changes the focus. Maroons become \nmuch more significant.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe largest community of American maroons was in the Great Dismal \nSwamp, but there were others in the swamps outside New Orleans, in \nAlabama and elsewhere in the Carolinas, and in Florida. All these \nsites are being investigated by archaeologists.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe other maroon societies had more fluidity, says Bercaw. People \nwould slip off down the waterways, but usually maintain some contact. \nThe Dismal Swamp maroons found a way to remove themselves completely \nfrom the United States, in the recesses of its geography.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn a cool cloudy morning in the Great Dismal Swamp, Sayers parks his \nvehicle by a long straight ditch full of black water. He sips his \nMonster, and sucks fire into a cigarette. The ditch arrows through \nthe gloomy swamp to a vanishing point in the far distance.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is Washington Ditch, a somewhat unique monument to brutality \nand entrepreneurship, he says. George Washington was the first to \nsee economic opportunity in the vast coastal swamp south of Norfolk, \nVirginia. In 1763, he formed a company with fellow investors to drain \nthe swamp, exploit its timber resources and dig canals for \ntransportation. This is the first canal, completed in the late 1760s, \nand excavated by slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nImagine it, says Sayers. Digging, chopping, bailing mud, working \nin chest-high water. One hundred degrees in summer, full of water \nmoccasins, ungodly mosquitoes. Freezing cold in winter. Beatings, \nwhippings. Deaths were fairly common.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe canal now known as Washington Ditch was the first significant \nencroachment into the Great Dismal Swamp. More canals were dug. \nTimber companies cut thousands of acres of Atlantic white cedar, \nknown locally as juniper, and turned it into barrel staves, ship \nmasts and house shingles.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt became more dangerous for maroons because the canals allowed \nslave-catchers to get into the swamp. But there were also new \neconomic opportunities. Maroons were able to cut shingles for lumber \ncompanies that turned a blind eye. Frederick Law Olmsted, who \ntraveled in the South as a journalist before he took up landscape \narchitecture, writing about the maroons in 1856, observed that \npoorer white men, owning small tracts of the swamps, will sometimes \nemploy them, and also that maroons were stealing from farms, \nplantations and unwary travelers.\u0014\n\u0014\nOlmsted asked if locals ever shot the maroons. Oh yes, came the \nreply. But some on em would rather be shot than be took, sir. Its \nclear that there were two different ways of marooning in the swamp. \nThose living near the edge of the swamp, or near the canals, had far \nmore interaction with the outside world. In the remote interior, at \nthe nameless site and other islands, there were still maroons who \nlived in isolation, fishing, farming and trapping feral hogs in the \ndeep swamp muck. We know this from Dan Sayers excavations and from \nCharlie the former maroon. He described whole families that had never \nseen a white man and would be scared to death to see one.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe white residents of Norfolk and other communities near the swamp \nwere terrified of being attacked by the swamps maroons. Instead, \nthey got Nat Turners insurrection of 1831a rebellion of slaves and \nfree blacks in which more than 50 whites were killed and then at \nleast 200 blacks killed in reprisal. Turner was planning to hide in \nthe Dismal Swamp with his followers, recruit the maroons and more \nslaves, and then emerge to overthrow white rule. But his rebellion \nwas suppressed after two days, and Turner, after two months in \nhiding, was captured and hanged.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat became of the Dismal Swamp maroons? Olmsted thought that very \nfew were left by the 1850s, but he stayed near the canals and didnt \nventure into the interior. Sayers has evidence of a thriving \ncommunity at the nameless site all the way up to the Civil War. \nThats when they came out, he says. Weve found almost nothing \nafter the Civil War. They probably worked themselves back into \nsociety as free people.\u0014\n\u0014\nEarly in his research, he started interviewing African-Americans in \ncommunities near the swamp, hoping to hear family stories about \nmaroons. But he abandoned the side project. Theres still so much \narchaeology work to do, he says. Weve excavated only 1 percent of \none island.\u0014\n\u0014\nHes out of Monsters and low on cigarettes. Its time to leave the \nGreat Dismal Swamp and find the nearest convenience store. On a \nraised gravel road, we pass through a charred expanse of forest, \ntorched by a lightning fire. We skirt the shores of Lake Drummond, \nthe perfect blue lake at the center of the swamp, and drive on \nthrough waterlogged cypress trees and stretches where the road is \nwalled in on both sides by thorny brush.I got very comfortable being \nin the swamp, he says. Bears would watch me excavating. I ran into \nhuge water moccasins and rattlesnakes as thick around as my thigh. \nBut nothing worse happened than scrapes, bug bites and losing \nequipment in the muck. Once he was wading to the nameless site with \na group of students. A young woman stepped into an underwater hole \nand disappeared. But she surfaced a moment later, with no damage \ndone. On many occasions, students and other visitors became so \nentangled in thorn patches that they had to be cut loose. Nothing \nhappens quickly or easily, he says. The swamp is a trickster and \nsummertime is really tough. But I love it. The thunderstorms are \nreally something. The sound of the frogs and the insects and the \nbirds, just as the maroons heard it. I love what the swamp has done \nfor me, and I love what it did for them.\u0014",

    "words": "Henry Francis Lyte was desperately ill with tuberculosis. He did not \nexpect to live. He was so sick, in fact, that he had prepared a \nfarewell sermon to preach later on this morning, September 4, 1847. \nMeanwhile he drew a paper toward him on which he had begun to write \nsome verses: \u0014\n\u0014\nAbide with me; fast falls the eventide; \u0014\nThe darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. \u0014\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\u0014\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis mind passed back over his life as he touched up the stanzas; and \nhe wrote, \"Thou on my head in early youth did smile...\" Henry's \nloving mother had taught him Bible stories and God's love. However, \nhis father abandoned the family. Henry's mother soon died. \nNine-year-old Henry was left alone in the world. A kindly Irish \nminister named Dr. Robert Burrows, with five children of his own, \ntook Henry in and put him through school. (Later Henry paid the Rev. \nBurrow back all that he owed him.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry planned to study medicine but weak health forced him to turn to \nthe ministry instead. He won prizes at Trinity College, Dublin for \npoems--three years in a row--and a scholarship. In 1814 he graduated, \nand was ordained as a minister of the Church of England the next year.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young clergyman tended Abraham Swanne, a dying pastor. Swanne's \ndeep faith and fearlessness in the face of death made a strong \nimpression on Henry. He helped Swanne's wife and family arrange their \naffairs while carrying on his own pastoral duties. As a consequence \nof his overwork, his health broke down. He had to go to warmer France \nto regain his health. \u0014\n\u0014\nHenry pastored English churches the rest of his life. Twenty-three of \nthose years were at Brixham, a Devonshire fishing town. His people \nloved him, for he took a strong interest in their work and visited \nthe boats whenever they returned from sea. Anna Maxwell, his wife, \nvisited the sick and lent a hand in the town's projects. By careful \nmanagement of household expenses, she saved enough money to send \nHenry to warmer France and Italy by himself every winter.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty-four-year-old Henry was used to living with one foot in the \ngrave when he preached his final sermon. He reminded his hearers that \nwe must all die and that those who have embraced the death of Christ \nin their lives are best prepared to face the body's death. \"I stand \nhere among you today, as alive from the dead, if I may hope to \nimpress it upon you, and induce you to prepare for that solemn hour \nwhich must come to all, by a timely acquaintance with the death of \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe planned to go to Italy where he hoped sunshine and warmth would \nrestore him. He made it only as far as Nice, France. There he became \nso ill he had to rest. Again God stayed with him in the form of an \nEnglish clergyman who nursed him. Ten weeks after preaching his \nfarewell sermon, Henry died. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBoreham, F. W. \"Abide with Me,\" in A Late Lark Singing.

    "words": "Dishonesty is nearly universal\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian B. Miller/ October 18, 2016   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\nReading the news, you might well conclude that the 2010s are the \ndecade of cheating. Dozens of runners allegedly broke the eligibility \nrules to enter the 2015 Boston Marathon. In 2012, 125 of the students \nin a Harvard University government classwith 279 students totalwere \naccused of cheating, and 70 were eventually forced to withdraw from \nHarvard altogether. In 2015, the hacking of Ashley Madisons website \n(Life is short. Have an affair) uncovered 37 million users \nworldwide.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe world of sports has provided seemingly endless examples. In 2013 \nLance Armstrong admitted that he had cheated, for decades, while \nbicycling. Alex Rodriguez missed the whole 2014 Major League Baseball \nseason for cheating. Russian weightlifters were banned from the 2016 \nRio Olympic Gamesand though Russias Olympic delegation barely \nescaped a blanket ban for that nations history of cheating, the same \nwas not true for the Paralympic Games that followed the Olympics, \nwhere the entire Russian team was banned.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd lest we Christians congratulate ourselves, in recent years \nvarious Christian leaders have spent money given for disaster relief \non their own property (the pastors of Glad Tidings Tabernacle in New \nYork City), signed contracts to inflate their apparent book sales \n(Seattle pastor Mark Driscoll), and betrayed others trust (too many \ntimes and in too many ways to name).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe sheer volume of these cases is enough to make us despair about \nhuman charactereven if we didnt have ample evidence from our own, \nmore or less spectacular, moments of dishonesty. Maybe we are all, \ndeep down, just dishonest people.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut we dont just have to speculate. We live in the age of social \npsychology, where researchers can actually investigate our hunches \nabout the prevalence of dishonesty. But surprisingly, the same \nresearchers who have confirmed our worst suspicionspeople are very \nprone to cheathave also discovered something less expected. Theyve \nfound a way to practically eliminate cheating altogether.\u0014",

    "title": "DO CHILDREN GO TO HEAVEN WHEN THEY DIE?",
    "words": "Do Children Go to Heaven When They Die?\u0014\n\u0014\nGod's love for children is clear in Scripture, but the 'age of \naccountability' is harder to find.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlan Bandy| May 26, 2017   Christianity Today\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSeveral years ago, I took a group of college students to the Amazon \nbasin to share the love of Christ in some remote river communities. \nAfter a few days in one village, I left a small group of students \nthere and continued upriver to another village. After I left, a young \nfamily in the community tragically lost a 6-month-old baby to an \nunknown illness and dehydration. The parents asked my students to do \nthe funeral. These 19- and 20-year-olds were not prepared for the \nemotional and spiritual gravitas of the situation. They did the best \nthey could to minister to that family. But they all felt the acute \nburden of answering the inevitable theological questions arising from \nsuch a difficult loss: What happens when children die? Are they \nsaved? What do we say to comfort grieving parents?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is natural, maybe even inevitable, that we seek comfort in the \nhope that God welcomes little ones in heaven when their time on earth \nis cut painfully short. While most Christians affirm the doctrine of \ninherited sin and confess that forgiveness of sin comes only through \npersonal faith in Christ, we also believe God is good and gracious in \ncases when a lost child was too young to make a profession of faith. \nHow is it, though, that God would save young children without the \nneed for repentance of sin and expressed faith in Christ?\u0014\n\u0014\nTheologians and Christian leaders throughout history have sought to \nanswer this knotty problem. Augustine and Ambrose argued that since \ninfants inherit the guilt of sin, not just the sin nature, only \nbaptized infants would be saved. John Calvin and C. H. Spurgeon \nmaintained that God's election could extend to infants and children, \nso they were already predestined for salvation. And a variation of \nthis view argues that God foreknows who will believe, so they are \nsaved even if they die before they reach the age or mental capacity \nto do so.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese views may make theological sense, but they often lack clear \nscriptural support or, somewhat uncomfortably, they only account for \nsome children. Of all the approaches to solving this problem, the \nidea of an age of accountability is one of the more popular views \nacross a broad spectrum of evangelicals. It offers a sensible \nsolution that is also comprehensive in scope.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe concept of the age of accountability is that God does not hold \nchildren accountable for the guilt of their sins until they achieve \nproper moral awareness of their choices. Children who have not \nreached this age of accountability will get into heaven because God \ndoes not lay the guilt of their sin upon them. In other words, God \ndoes not hold young children accountable for wrongs they don't know \nthey committed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe theology of this position is certainly appealing for a number of \nreasons. But is there biblical support for the notion of an age of \naccountability? While some passages may appear to affirm the idea, \nthey don't directly support it when viewed in broader context:\u0014\n\u0014\nDeuteronomy 1:39\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your \nchildren who do not yet know good from badthey will enter the land. \nI will give it to them and they will take possession of it.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe context of this verse relates to the rebellious generation of \nHebrews who were punished with 40 years of wilderness wanderings. God \nprohibits that generation from entering the Promised Land, but in \nthis verse promises to allow those who were children during that \nrebellious time to enter the land, because they did not yet know \ngood from bad.\u0014\n\u0014\nBecause God did not hold the Hebrew children accountable for their \nparents' sins, people use this verse as support for the age of \naccountability. The problem is that, in this passage, children \nrefers to those who were too young to be eligible for military \nservice at that time, meaning anyone 20 years old or younger. While \nmost teenagers certainly have much room for maturing, it seems \nimplausible to suggest they are somehow not morally accountable by \nthat age.\u0014\n\u0014\nIsaiah 7:1516\u0014\n\u0014\nHe will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the \nwrong and choose the right,for before the boy knows enough to reject \nthe wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread \nwill be laid waste.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis passage relates directly to the famous prophecy that the virgin \nwill conceive and give birth to a son (\\\\Isa. 7:14). These verses \nstate that the boy in his youth does not yet know how to tell the \ndifference between right and wrong. It suggests the biblical authors \nhad at least some conception of a period of time before children have \nan understanding of morality. Unfortunately, this passage is not \nintended to establish the parameters for when a child can be viewed \nas morally culpable; rather, the focus is on God's coming deliverance.\u0014\n\u0014\n2 Samuel 12:23\u0014\n\u0014\nBut now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him \nback again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy far the most familiar verse on this subject is David's lament at \nthe death of his firstborn son with Bathsheba. While the child was \ndying, a direct consequence of David's sin, David fasted and prayed \nin hope that God would be merciful. But once the child died, he \nstopped grieving. David recognized that the only way he could be \nreunited with his son was if he, too, died.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis verse wields enormous pastoral comfort and, I believe, \nestablishes clear evidence to affirm that young children are safely \nwith God. While it provides a basis for our hope regarding children, \nit unfortunately does not suggest an age of accountability as the \nreason.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe New Testament doesn't offer much in terms of an age of \naccountability, either. Some point to Romans 7:9 to argue that \npunishment for sins is not meted out until the guilty are aware of \ntheir crime, but this reads too much into what Paul is saying. He is \nmaking an argument about the way the law works, not suggesting people \nare innocent prior to being aware of the law. Another passage cited \nis Acts 17:2931. Again, Paul is making a case that God is the God of \nall people, Jews and Gentiles alike, and he is calling them to repent \nof their idolatry. But Paul is not saying that God overlooks sin \nuntil a certain point. Some even try to use the prodigal son \n[coming] to his senses in Luke 15:17 as support for the age of \naccountability, but again, this seems a stretch.\u0014\n\u0014\nMercy for the young and mischievous\u0014\n\u0014\nEven if we had clear biblical support for an age of accountability, \nit would still be virtually impossible to determine exactly when a \nchild might arrive at that age. Most argue it occurs sometime between \nthe ages of 4 and 12, but this is based on extra-biblical traditions. \nTo be sure, children eventually grow up and, as they mature, they \nmust face the reality of sin and their own moral culpability. But to \nsay children are not aware of good and bad seems to contradict the \nexperience of most anyone who has raised them. Parents know that even \nat a very young age, children sense when they are being naughty. \nTake, for instance, when my wife and I were sitting in our living \nroom, and our 5-year-old daughter suddenly ran past us and exclaimed, \nNothing! We would not have suspected anything, except that her \nlittle conscience and poorly timed work of reverse psychology alerted \nus to an entire box of Q-tips she had emptied in our now-clogged \ntoilet.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to research by Karen Wynn at Yale University's Infant \nCognition Center, also known as The Baby Lab, babies as young as \nthree months show preference for an individual who is seen helping \nrather than harming. In another study by J. Kiley Hamlin of the \nUniversity of British Columbia, babies as young as eight months were \nobserved embracing the punishment of bad characters. Yale \npsychology professor Paul Bloom, who is married to Wynn, explains \nthat the sense of morality found in infants is tragically limited \nand a product of cultural development, but is nevertheless present\u0014\n.\u0014\nIf children as young as three months show an awareness of the \ndifference between right and wrong, it potentially weakens the notion \nof an age of accountability.\u0014\n\u0014\nWith the lack of biblical support, and everyday evidence and \npsychological studies suggesting that children are, in fact, capable \nof recognizing good and bad behavior very early on, perhaps we should \nnot look to an age of accountability as the basis for our hope \nconcerning children.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs evangelicals, we believe salvation is exclusively found through \nfaith in Christ, but we have good reason to believe that his saving \nwork extends to children too young to make this decision. What the \nBible does explicitly teach about God should already dispel our \nconcerns about the fate of infants and young children. So we don't \nneed conjectures like the age of accountability.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne reason we can have hope is because God is a good and just judge. \nAs Abraham said, Will not the Judge of all the earth do right? \n(Gen. 18:25). Because we see this idea echoing throughout Scripture, \nwe can confidently trust God to always do what is good, right, and \nperfect (Deut. 32:4; Zeph. 3:5). Another reason we don't need an age \nof accountability is because the doctrine of God's grace is clearly \nevident in Scripture (Ex. 34:6; Ps. 103:8; Lam. 3:22; Joel 2:13; John \n1:14; Rom. 3:2224; Eph. 2:89). Certainly, God's grace extends to \nall humanity, and especially to children.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, Jesus had some very specific things to say about children, \nand it is clear that God has deep love, care, and even preference for \nthem. Jesus taught that we must become like little children to enter \nthe kingdom of heaven (Matt. 18:25; Luke 18:17). And he warns that \nno one should despise little ones because their angels in heaven \nalways see the face of my Father in heaven (Matt. 18:10). Jesus also \nsaid to let the little children come to me because the kingdom of \nheaven belongs to them (Matt. 19:14). What is more, Jesus threatened \nsevere punishment and woe for anyone who would cause a child to \nstumble (Matt. 18:67).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIf Jesus elevates children in this way, we can take comfort that \nchildren who die are safe in his keeping. He is good, kind, merciful, \nand just. We can trust that he cares for children more than we can \never comprehend. When their little lives are cut short and our vision \nis blurred by tears, we can be certain that he will deal graciously \nwith them in a way that is consistent with his saving work. He is a \ngood and loving heavenly Father who always does what is right (Ps. \n33:45). God always acts in a manner in keeping with his holy, \nrighteous, merciful, gracious, loving, and good characterthe same \nloving character that prompted God to send his own Son to die for a \nworld of sinners.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn that dark day in the Amazon rainforest, my students went with the \nparents and most of the community to a small gravesite in the jungle. \nThere were only a handful of believers in the community and, because \nthey were looking to God for answers, they had asked the students to \ndo the funeral. As shafts of sunlight dotted the leaf-covered jungle \nfloor, these students represented the love, hope, and salvation of \nGod to a people overcome by grief. Although it was an immensely \ndifficult experience, these students could confidently speak of God's \nlove and goodness. Those parents, who were brand new to faith in \nChrist, took tremendous comfort because they knew their son was now \nwith God.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAlan Bandy is professor of New Testament and Greek at Oklahoma \nBaptist University. He recently coauthored, with Benjamin Merkle, \nUnderstanding Prophecy: A Biblical-Theological Approach (Grand \nRapids: Kregel Academic, 2015).\u0014",

    "words": "Cheap grace is preaching forgiveness without requiring repentance, \nbaptism without church discipline, Communion without confession. . . \n. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, \ngrace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.\u0014\n\u0014\n  As his tactics were changing, he had gone to America to become a \nguest lecturer. But he couldnt shake a feeling of responsibility for \nhis country. Within months of his arrival, he wrote theologian \nReinhold Niebuhr, I have made a mistake in coming to America. I must \nlive through this difficult period in our national history with the \nChristian people of Germany. I will have no right to participate in \nthe reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after the war if I do \nnot share the trials of this time with my people.\u0014\n\u0014\n  Bonhoeffer spent two years in prison, corresponding with family and \nfriends, pastoring fellow prisoners, and reflecting on the meaning of \nJesus Christ for today. As the months progressed, be began \noutlining a new theology, penning enigmatic lines that had been \ninspired by his reflections on the nature of Christian action in \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\n  A decade later, a camp doctor who witnessed Bonhoeffers hanging \ndescribed the scene: The prisoners . . . were taken from their \ncells, and the verdicts of court martial read out to them. Through \nthe half-open door in one room of the huts, I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer, \nbefore taking off his prison garb, kneeling on the floor praying \nfervently to his God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable \nman prayed, so devout and so certain that God heard his prayer. At \nthe place of execution, he again said a prayer and then climbed the \nsteps to the gallows, brave and composed. His death ensued in a few \nseconds. In the almost 50 years that I have worked as a doctor, I \nhave hardly ever seen a man die so entirely submissive to the will of \nGod.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(from 131 Christians Everyone Should Know,  2000 Christianity Today, \nInc.

    "words": "Thursday, March 20, 2014\u0014\nDefined by Winter\u0014\nCHRIST IN WINTER: Reflections on Faith from a Place of Winter for the \nYears of Winter\u0014\n\u0014\nFred Skaggs says that he cant look at snow for more than three days \nin a row without seeing a therapist. He doesnt even care if it is \nhis therapist; he just has to see somebodys therapist. [It would be \nfun to slip in an albino therapist on him.] So he asked for an \nexplanation of the tag line of these CIW mutterings: where life is \ndefined by winter even in the summer. He says he thinks others might \nlike to know, too.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen you retire, you can live any place you wish, and grandchildren \nare more important than anything else in your life, and if only one \nof your children has produced grandchildren, you can just trail them \naround. To Mason City, IA, the River City of Meredith Willsons \nThe Music Man. To Sterling, IL. Finally, the coup de grace, to Iron \nMountain, MI.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe moved to Iron Mountain on July 11. It was a warm and lovely day, \ntypical of Iron Mountain summers, high in the 70s, low in the 50s. We \ndid not know that on July 10 the last of the snow had melted because \nthe temperature finally got above freezing. Nor did we know that the \nsnow and cold would return on July 12.\u0014\n\u0014\nI should have known. I read Sports Illustrated. There had been an \ninterview in SI with NFL coach, Steve Mariucci, who grew up in Iron \nMountain. [1] They asked him what folks in Iron Mountain did in \nsummer. He said, If it doesnt snow that day, we have a picnic.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut on July 11, there were bright flowing hanging baskets of summer \nflowers on every porch, and people had turned their garages into \nsummer homes, complete with sofas and TV sets. They just leave the \ndoors up, for, unlike the rest of the UP, where people are called \nYoopers [UPers], Iron Mountain has no problem with mosquitoes or \nother bitey bugs. We have about 50 thousand bats that live in an old \nmine shaft. At dusk they come out and fan out across the town. A bat \ncan eat up to one thousand mosquitoes in an hour. Our bats have a \ncomity agreement, assigning specific bats to specific yards. Ours is \nWalter.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe learned that the flowers were all in hanging baskets to keep the \ndeer and rabbits from getting at them. We have as many deer as \nmosquitoes, but they are too big for the bats to eat. That first \nsummer, our daughter planted a rose bush. She went around the corner \nof her house to get the hose to water it. By the time she got back \naround the corner, the rose bush was gone. [As Dave Barry would say, \nI am not making this up.]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe hanging baskets come from about two dozen temporary summer \ngreenhouses that are set up in tents or parking lots, so folks can do \ndrive-by planting. UP here you dont have enough summer to plant \nseeds and wait for flowers to grow. They would be eaten by the deer, \nanyway. You just buy a hanging pot with the flowers already blooming \nand put it up and stare at it.\u0014\n\u0014\nSummer is so short here, and beautiful, that you dont want to waste \na single precious minute of it. The first day above freezing, you get \nthe lawn chairs, shovel off the deck, and start summering. You know \nthat winter is looking over your shoulder.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, on this first day of spring, where March is just February under \nan assumed name, and our average temperature the February just past \nwas 5.4 degrees [F], and the city snow plow truck just went by, and \nwere slated for below zero temperatures again this weekend, when \nwell celebrate Helens March 6 birthday because weve waited until \nthe weather was better for our Chicago daughter to come, Ill remind \nyou that Iron Mountain is where Life is defined by winter, even in \nthe summer.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Robert McFarland\u0014\njmcfarland1721@charter.net\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1] Folks here are highly, and rightly, proud of former Iron Mountain \nHigh School teammates Mariucci and Tom Izzo, MSU basketball coach.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe place of winter mentioned in the title line is Iron Mountain, \nin Michigans Upper Peninsula, where life is defined by winter even \nin the summer!\u0014",

    "title": "DO RELIGIOUS PEOPLE LIVE LONGER?",
    "words": "\u0014\nIF A LONG LIFE IS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER, GOING to church may be the \nanswer to your prayers. \u0014\n\u0014\nA number of studies have shown associations between attending \nreligious services and living \u0014\na long time. One of the most comprehensive, published inJAMA Internal \nMedicine in 2016, \u0014\nfound that women who went to any kind of religious service more than \nonce a week had a \u0014\n33% lower chance than their secular peers of dying during the 16-year \nstudy-follow-up period. \u0014\nAnother study, published last year in PLOS One, found that regular \nservice attendance was linked \u0014\nto reductions in the body's stress responses and even in mortality-so \nmuch so that worshippers \u0014\nwere 55% less likely to die during the up to 18- year follow-up \nperiod than people who didn't \u0014\nfrequent the temple, church or mosque. \u0014\n\u0014\nYou don't have to become a nun to get these health benefits, however. \nThe simple act of \u0014\ncongregating with a like-minded community might deserve much of the \ncredit. Tyler \u0014\nVanderWeele, one of the authors of the JAMA study and a professor of \nepidemiology at the \u0014\nHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says factors related to \nchurchgoing-like having a \u0014\nnetwork of social support, an optimistic attitude, better \nself-control and a sense of purpose in life- \u0014\nmay account for the long-life benefits seen in his study and others.\u0014\n\u0014\nIT'S ALSO THE VALUES drawn from religious tradition-such as \"respect, \ncompassion, \u0014\ngratitude, charity, humility, harmony, meditation and preservation of \u0014\nhealth\" - that seem to predict longevity, not the dogma preached at \nthe altar, says How- \u0014\nard Friedman, a professor of psychology at the University of \nCalifornia, Riverside, \u0014\nand co-author of the book The Longevity Project. Fostering these \nqualities may even \u0014\naffect rates of chronic disease, says Marino Bruce, a co-author of \nthe PLOS One study and a research associate professor of medicine, \nhealth and society at Vanderbilt University. \"Having that sense that \nyou're not in the world alone, that you are part of a power larger \nthan oneself, can give one confidence to deal with the issues of \nlife:' Bruce says. \"Biologically, if that reduces stress, then that \nmeans you're less likely to have high blood pressure or diabetes or \nthings that can increase mortality!'\u0014\n\u0014\nBut what if organized religion isn't your style? Can solo prayer-or \neven a more abstract sense of \u0014\nfaith or spirituality-provide the same payoff? It's difficult to say \nwith certainty, because \u0014\ngoing to church is easier to measure than the intimate, individual \nway a person might practice \u0014\nreligion. And the research on praying has been mixed. Some studies \nhave found that prayer can \u0014\nimprove disease outcomes and prolong survival, while others have been \nless conclusive. One 2006 \u0014\nstudy published in the American Heart Journal even found that people \nwho knew they were being \u0014\nprayed for before undergoing heart surgery were more likely to \nexperience complications than \u0014\npeople who didn't know whether they were in others' prayers. \u0014\n\u0014\nBUT PRAYER HAS BEEN SHOWN to be powerful, in at least one way. It \ntriggers the relaxation re- \u0014\nsponse, a state of mind-body rest that has been shown to decrease \nstress, heart rate and blood \u0014\npressure; alleviate chronic disease symptoms; and even change gene \nexpression. This state is \u0014\ntypically linked to activities like meditation and yoga, and research \nsuggests it can also be found \u0014\nthrough praying. \u0014\n\u0014\nGiven that uncertainty and the accumulating evidence supporting \ncommunal religious partici- \u0014\npation, VanderWeele says solitary practitioners might want to \nconsider congregating every once \u0014\nina while.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Might you be missing out on something-the power of religion and \nspirituality-by not partici- \u0014\npating communally?\" VanderWeele says. \"That's not saying, 'You should \nhave religious beliefs to live \u0014\nlonger! That's saying, 'You already hold these beliefs. Maybe it \nwould be worthwhile to consider communal participation? \" \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n-JAMIE DUCHARME\u0014\nTime, 2/26/18  \"How To Live Longer Better\u0014",

    "words": "Death of Stalwart Bishop Ambrose\u0014\nDiane Severance Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nMilan's bishop was dying. Whether consciously or unconsciously, he \nextended his arms like Christ on the cross. Christ Jesus appeared to \nhim in a vision. People were awed.\u0014\n\u0014\nPopular singers today have a tremendous influence on our culture. \nPresidents cultivate their friendships, postage stamps honor their \ntalents, and fans worship their every move. However, when Ambrose of \nMilan died on this date, April 4, 397, his popularity and influence \nwere as great as anything we see today. The day was a Good Friday. \nHis death made such an impression on the public that five bishops \ncould hardly cope with all the people who requested to be baptized \nthe next day.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmbrose had been a governor of Northern Italy back in the day when \nthe barbarians were invading the Roman Empire. At that time it was \nstill the custom for the people to elect their bishops, and in 374 \nthe people of Milan could not agree who their new bishop should be. \nSome wanted an Arian to lead them. Arians denied the full divinity of \nChrist. Others wanted a bishop who would teach that Christ was the \nson of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen it appeared that a riot was about to break out over the \nelection, governor Ambrose stepped forward and encouraged the people \nto conduct themselves in an orderly and Christian manner. A child \ncried out, \"Let Ambrose be bishop!\" The crowd took up the cry and \nelected him. \u0014\n\u0014\nAmbrose tried to duck his new responsibility. He had been a ho-hum \nChristian up to this point and was not even baptized yet. However, he \ncould not escape his obligation. And so he dedicated himself fully to \nChrist and His Church. He gave all of his money to the poor and \nstrongly defended Christian truth.\u0014\n\u0014\nJustina, mother of the Roman Emperor, was an Arian. She demanded \nAmbrose give up a church for her followers. Despite intense pressure, \nAmbrose refused. The empress sent soldiers to take Ambrose's own \nchurch. Ambrose and his supporters recognized a spiritual battle when \nthey saw one. They chose to fight with spiritual weapons, not swords, \nrocks and sticks, entering the building and praying. With imperial \nsoldiers surrounding the church, the people stayed inside for several \ndays, praying, singing psalms, and listening to Ambrose preach. \nDuring this time Ambrose developed a form of congregational singing \nin which two groups of the congregation sang alternately.\u0014\n\u0014\nFortified by message and song, the people held out against the \nsoldiers. Finally, Justina recalled her troops. Ambrose and his \npeople had won the spiritual battle using spiritual weapons, \nespecially Christian hymns. In his life, he wrote many other hymns. \nThe type of congregational singing Ambrose began in Milan became \npopular and was used in the church for centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\n\"Ambrose of Milan.\" http://www.cyberhymnal.org\u0014\nMcGuire, M.

Is the New Testament writer \nmisquoting the Old Testament? Or is there another explanation?\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke records that when Jesus began his ministry, he went to the \nsynagogue in Nazareth on the Sabbath day. When he stood up to read \nthe Scriptures, The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him \n(Luke 4:17). Jesus read the description of a climactic arrival of the \nanointed one from Isaiah 61:12, excluding the last half of verse \ntwo. That omission is understandable, but if you look at \tLuke \n4:1819 and Isaiah 61:12 side by side, several dissimilarities in \nwhat Jesus read are readily apparent.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the original Old Testament passage, there is no reference to \nmaking the blind see. Conversely, Isaiah speaks of binding up the \nbrokenhearted, a phrase absent in Luke. Since Luke is clear that \nJesus was reading from a scroll, the divergence is not due to Luke \n(or Jesus) quoting from memory and messing up the passage! Whats \ngoing on here?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to \nproclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to \nthe captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty \nthose who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lords favor. \n(Luke 4:1819)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed \nme to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the \nbrokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening \nof the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the \nLords favor. (Isaiah 61:12)\u0014\n\u0014\nMost of the time when a divergence occurs between a New Testament \nquotation and the Old Testament, the answer is the Septuagint, the \nancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. It often does not \nmatch the Hebrew text from which most Old Testaments were translated. \nJesus apparently either read from a Hebrew text that reflected the \nSeptuagint, or Luke fills in the quoted passage with the Septuagint. \n(And since Luke was not Jewish and spoke Greek, the Septuagint would \nhave been his Bible.)\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Septuagint version of Isaiah 61:12 reads, The spirit of the \nLord is upon me, because he has anointed me; he has sent me to bring \ngood news to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim the \nrelease of the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to \nsummon the acceptable year of the Lord (NETS). Jesus (or Luke) gets \nthe recovery of sight to the blind line from the Septuagint. The \nSeptuagint also contains a line from the traditional Old Testament \nthat isnt in Lukes record!\u0014\n\u0014\nThis example shows that its worth our time to check \ncross-references, especially in quotations. Do it yourself by \ncomparing New Testament quotations both to translations of the \ntraditional Hebrew text, like the NASB or ESV, and an up-to-date \nEnglish translation of the Septuagint.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe often dont realize that even biblical writers depended on \ntranslations that they considered the Word of God. In the same \nmanner, we can consider our own translations the Word of God.\u0014\n\u0002Dr. Michael S. Heiser is a scholar-in-residence for Faithlife, the \nmakers of Logos Bible Software.\u0014",

No one knows for sure. What is certain is that at least 1,500 \nwere cruelly tortured and killed. For the most part these were \npeaceful citizens who did not believe in war and who became the \nforerunners of today's Mennonites and Amish. The main complaint of \nthe authorities against them was that they did not believe infant \nbaptism had any value. They chose to be re-baptized as willing adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough no other charges were proven against them, they were \nsentenced to death. For the men death was usually by fire; for women \nit was by drowning. Many Anabaptists proved to be so bold in their \nfinal testimony for Christ that authorities began to clamp their \ntongues before leading them out to their execution so that they could \nnot speak up and win more converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the Anabaptists who died in flames was Dirk Willem. His story \nis particularly touching, because he forfeited a real chance to \nescape when he turned back to help one of his pursuers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was captured and imprisoned in his home town of Asperen in the \nNetherlands. Knowing that his fate would be death if he remained in \nprison, Dirk made a rope of strips of cloth and slid down it over the \nprison wall. A guard chased him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrost had covered a nearby pond with a thin layer of ice. Dirk risked \na dash across it. He made it to safety, but the ice broke under his \npursuer who cried for help. Dirk believed the Scripture that a man \nshould help his enemies. He immediately turned back and pulled the \nfloundering man from the frigid water.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn gratitude for his life, the man would have let Dirk escape, but a \nBurgomaster (chief magistrate) standing on the shore sternly ordered \nhim to arrest Dirk and bring him back, reminding him of the oath he \nhad sworn as an officer of the peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack to prison went Dirk. He was condemned to death for being \nre-baptized, allowing secret church services in his home and letting \nothers be baptized there. The record of his sentencing concludes: \n\"all of which is contrary to our holy Christian faith, and to the \ndecrees of his royal majesty, and ought not to be tolerated, but \nseverely punished, for an example to others; therefore, we the \naforesaid judges, having, with mature deliberation of council, \nexamined and considered all that was to be considered in this matter, \nhave condemned and do condemn by these presents in the name; and in \nthe behalf, of his royal majesty, as Count of Holland, the aforesaid \nDirk Willems, prisoner, persisting obstinately in his opinion, that \nhe shall be executed with fire, until death ensues; and declare all \nhis property confiscated, for the benefit of his royal majesty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was burned to death on this day, May 16, 1569. His tongue was \nnot clamped. The wind blew the flame away from him so that his death \nwas long and miserable. Time and again Dirk cried out to God. Finally \none of the authorities could not bear to see him suffer any longer \nand ordered an underling to end his torment with a quick death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBraght, Thieleman J. van.

    "title": "DIVINE ELECTION",
    "words": "The doctrine of election raises serious problems in the human mind, \nso we must consider more fully what the Bible does (and does not) \nteach on this subject.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, it teaches that God does choose men to salvation (2 Thess. \n2:13). It addresses believers as those who are \"elect according to \nthe foreknowledge of God\" (1 Pet. 1:2). It teaches that people can \nknow whether they are elect by their response to the gospel: those \nwho hear and believe it are elect (1 Thess. 1:47).\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the other hand, the Bible never teaches that God chooses men to be \nlost. The fact that He chooses some to be saved does not imply that \nHe arbitrarily condemns all the rest. He never condemns men who \ndeserve to be saved (there are none), but He does save some who ought \nto be condemned. When Paul describes the elect, he speaks of them as \n\"vessels of mercy which He had prepared beforehand for glory\" (Rom. \n9:23); but when he turns to the lost, he simply says, \"vessels of \nwrath prepared for destruction\" (Rom. 9:22). God prepares vessels of \nmercy to glory, but He does not prepare men for destruction: they do \nthis for themselves by their own unbelief.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe doctrine of election lets God be God. He is sovereign, that is, \nHe can do as He pleases, though He never pleases to do anything \nunjust. If left alone, all men would be lost. Does God have the right \nto show mercy to some?\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is another side to the story. The same Bible that teaches \nsovereign election also teaches human responsibility. No one can use \nthe doctrine of election as an excuse for not being saved. God makes \na bona fide offer of salvation to all people everywhere (John 3:16; \n3:36; 5:24; Rom. 10:9, 13). Anyone can be saved by repenting of his \nsins and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, if a person \nis lost, it is because he chooses to be lost, not because God desires \nit.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe fact is that the same Bible teaches election and free salvation \nto all who will receive it. Both doctrines are found in a single \nverse: \"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who \ncomes to Me I will by no means cast out\" (John 6:37). The first half \nof the verse speaks of God's sovereign choice; the last half extends \nthe offer of mercy to all.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis poses a difficulty for the human mind. How can God choose some \nand yet offer salvation freely to all men? Frankly, this is a \nmystery. But the mystery is on our side, not on God's. The best \npolicy for us is to believe both doctrines because the Bible teaches \nboth. The truth is not found somewhere between election and man's \nfree will, but in both extremes. W. G. Blaikie summarizes:\u0014\n\u0014\nDivine sovereignty, human responsibility and the free and universal \noffer of mercy are all found in Scripture, and though we are unable \nto harmonize them by our logic, they all ought to have a place in our \nminds.?\u0014\n\u0014\n1:5 The second spiritual blessing from the treasury of God's grace is \npredestination, or foreordination. Though somewhat related to \nelection, it is not the same. Election pictures God's choice of \npeople to salvation. But predestination is an advance on this: it \nmeans that God determined ahead of time that all who would be saved \nwould also be adopted into His family as sons. He could have saved us \nwithout making us His sons, but He chose to do both.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany translations link the last two words of verse 4 with verse 5 as \nfollows: in love having predestined us.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis reminds us of the unique affection that prompted God to deal \nwith us so graciously.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe have the fact of our glorious adoption in the phrase, having \npredestined us to adoption as sons. In the NT, adoption means placing \na believer in the family of God as a mature, adult son with all the \nprivileges and responsibilities of sonship (Gal. 4:47). The Spirit \nof adoption plants within the believer the instinct to address God as \nFather (Rom. 8:15).\u0014\n\u0014\nOur adoption as sons is by Jesus Christ. God could never have brought \nus into this position of nearness and dearness to Himself as long as \nwe were in our sins. So the Lord Jesus came to earth, and by His \ndeath, burial, and resurrection He settled the sin question to God's \nsatisfaction. It is the infinite value of His sacrifice on Calvary \nthat provides a righteous basis on which God can adopt us as sons.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd it is all according to the good pleasure of His will. This is the \nsovereign motivation behind our predestination. It answers the \nquestion, \"Why did He do it?\" Simply because it was His good \npleasure. He could not be satisfied until He had surrounded Himself \nwith sons, conformed to the image of His only begotten Son, with Him \nand like Him forever.\u0014\n\u0014\n1:6 To the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us \naccepted in the Beloved. As Paul has contemplated the grace of God \nfirst in electing us and then in predestining us to be His sons, he \npunctuates his meditation with this refrain that is at once an \nexclamation, an explanation, and an exhortation. It is an \nexclamationa holy gasp at the transcendent glories of such grace. It \nis an explanation that the object and the result of all God's \ngracious dealings with us is His own glory. Eternal adoration is due \nto Him for such matchless favor. Notice the terms of His graceHe \n(freely) made us accepted. The recipients of His graceus. The \nchannel of His gracein the Beloved. Finally, it is an exhortation. \nPaul is saying, \"Let us praise Him for His glorious grace\". Before we \ngo any farther, let us do it!'\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n MacDonald, W. (1995).

    "title": "DR. HAING NGOR - CAMBODIAN REFUGEE",
    "words": "Haing Ngor was a doctor by training. As a Buddhist, he examined his \nlife according to principals of the cycle of life, each reincarnation \na part of the struggle to perfection. He was captured by the Khmer \nRouge following the 1975 takeover of Cambodia by that party, and \nendured 4 years of torture and starvation. He had to conceal his \nmedical training to escape execution, even to the extent of being \nunable to offer medical help when his wife and child died in a \ndifficult premature labor. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt the time of the Vietnamese invasion he, along with his orphaned \nniece Ngim whose parents were slain by the Khmer Rouge, escaped to a \nrefugee camp in Thailand, and they emigrated to the United States in \n1980. He always specified his intention to adopt Ngim (Sophia) but in \nfact never did so. In February of 1996, after surviving the Killing \nFields of Cambodia, he was shot while standing near his BMW in the \ndriveway of his home. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt first it was thought that he was killed by Khmer Rouge agents, but \npolice investigation found that he was shot by three members of the \nOriental Lazyboy street gang when he resisted a robbery attempt to \nget loot for purchase of rock cocaine. He left no will, and both his \nniece Sophia and relatives in Cambodia laid claim to the estate.\u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Ngor's best known role was that of Dith Pran, the Cambodian \nassistant to New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg in the \n'Killing Fields'. \u0014\n\u0014\n  A gynecologist and surgeon, Ngor was ordered out of Phnom Penh \nalong with the rest of the city's 2 million inhabitants after the \nKhmer Rouge takeover in 1975. He was sent to the country's Northwest \nZone, where middle-class Cambodians were turned overnight into \npeasant farmers in a classless society. Fearing for his life if his \nlevel of education were revealed, Ngor constantly attempted to \ndisguise his medical knowledge, hiding his glasses and ignoring \natrocities in the Khmer camp. When a Vietnamese invasion ousted the \nKhmer Rouge in 1979, Ngor escaped to Thailand and in 1980 settled in \nthe U.S. While working in various television and movie roles, Ngor \ncontinued to work for the benefit of Cambodian refugees, including \nco-founding two major refugee aid societies.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrivia (11) \u0014\n\u0014\nHe lost half his right little finger to the Khmer Rouge.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was the first non-professional since Harold Russell in The Best \nYears of Our Lives (1946) to win an Academy award.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe was probably shot during the robbery for resisting giving up a \ncherished gold watch and chain bearing the picture of his wife, whom \nKhmer Rouge soldiers allowed to die in childbirth in 1975.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas not interested at first in the role of Dith Pran but after \ninterviews with the filmmakers he changed his mind, remembering that \nhe promised his late wife to tell Cambodia's story to the world.\u0014\n\u0014\nWas the second Asian actor to win an Oscar. Miyoshi Umeki was the \nfirst.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn April 14, 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Central District \nof California overturned the 1998 conviction of the Oriental Lazy \nBoyz threesome who were jailed for the murder of Ngor. The court \nruled that the original prosecutor had unfairly played on the jury \nsympathy in obtaining the conviction. However, on July 7, 2005, the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated the \n1998 convictions (life without parole for the gang member who pulled \nthe trigger, 56 years to life for his accomplice and 26 years to life \nfor his other accomplice) rejecting claims of misconduct on the part \nof the original prosecutor.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe police investigation of Dr. Haing S. Ngor's murder is depicted in \nPrice of Duty: John Garcia (2018), the third episode of the true \ncrime series \"Price of Duty\".\u0014",

    "words": "Disputing slavery as start of war\u0014\n\u0014\nHow often do we hear or read, The South fought to preserve slavery; \nThe war was fought because of slavery; The Civil War was about \nslavery and not states rights and so on? \u0014\n\u0014\nEach of these so-called explanations turns on a single word or group \nof words, e.g., preserve, about keep because of, etc. They \nare used interchangeably by the media when buttressing the claim that \nslavery, and slavery alone, took the nation to war in 1861. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere can be no doubt that slavery played a significant role in the \ncause of the Civil War, but the South did not fight to preserve, \nkeep, or maintain slavery; it already was protected by the U.S. \nConstitution and the 1857 ruling of the Supreme Court. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did many of the Southern states secede, and How did the Civil War \nbegin, are two separate questions with two dissimilar answers.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat evidence supports the statement the South started the war \npreserve slavery?\u0014\n\u0014\nWasnt slavery already preserved following the Dred Scott ruling in \n1857? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution \nguaranteed that citizens could not be deprived of their property and \nslaves were considered property.  \u0014\n\u0014\nHow many Local readers know about the Corwin Amendment, the original \nproposed 13th Amendment, which was passed by Congress on March 2, \n1861 (without the participation of representatives from the seceded \nSouthern states!)?  \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Corwin Amendment guaranteed the protection of domestic \ninstitutions, i.e., slavery, from any future Congressional \ninterference to include abolition.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn other words, it guaranteed the preservation of slavery forever in \nevery state in which it existed in January 1861 (including Maryland, \nDelaware, Missouri, and Kentucky).\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter he was inaugurated, President Lincoln signed the Corwin \nAmendment on March 16, 1861, and sent it to the states for \nratification.  \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his inaugural speech, Lincoln, when referring to this amendment, \nstated, had no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. \u0014\n\u0014\nKentucky, Rhode Island, Ohio, Maryland, and Illinois ratified the \nCorwin Amendment, but the firing on Fort Sumter brought the \nratification process of the original 13th Amendment to an end. \u0014\n\u0014\nHad it been ratified, the Corwin Amendment would have become the 13th \nAmendment, forever protecting slavery instead of abolishing it.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor the South, the issue of slavery was not about its preservation; \nrather, it was about the future expansion of slavery into U.S. \nterritories.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln was always clear he would oppose the spread of slavery into \nnew territories, but he also recognized he had no authority to \nabolish slavery where it existed and that is why he faced no personal \ndilemma in signing the Corwin Amendment.  \u0014\n\u0014\nHistorians, high school teachers, college professors, and Hollywood \ngloss over the fact that President Lincoln signed a congressionally \npassed amendment protecting and preserving slavery in all states in \nwhich it was legal in 1861. \u0014\n\u0014\nOnce slavery was elevated later to be the single cause of the war, \nand following his assassination, it became essential for Lincoln to \nbe acknowledged as  the freer of slaves and not the President who \nhad no objection to the Corwin Amendment.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs further evidence countering the perspective that slavery was the \ncause of the Civil War, on July 2, 1861 (after the Civil War began), \nthe United States House of Representatives (with no voting members \nfrom the seceded Southern states) overwhelmingly passed the following \nresolution:\u0014\n\u0014\nThat this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of \noppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor \npurpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights of those \nstates; but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, \nand to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights \nof the several states unimpaired; that as soon as the objects are \naccomplished the war ought to cease.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis Congressional resolution made it clear that the Civil War did \nnot originate as a war to eliminate slavery. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, it clearly stated when the Union was again unified, slavery \ncould continue where it existed before the war began.\u0014\n\u0014\nLincoln did not send 75,000 Federal troops into Virginia on May 24, \n1861, to free slaves. Rather, his objective was to restore the Union \nas soon as possible.  \u0014\n\u0014\nRichard A. Marksbury, Ph.D.\u0014\n\u0014\nLee-Davis 1969\u0014\nNew Orleans\u0014",

    "words": "Sexual Abuse at Bellevue: No Consequences\u0014\nby Christa Brown and David Clohessy | Aug 6, 2020 \u0014\n\u0014\nDoes it get any sicker than this?\u0014\n\u0014\nAt a flagship megachurch of the Southern Baptist Convention, church \nstaffer James A. Hook sexually abused a 15-year-old church girl.\u0014\n\u0014\nHook sent the girl sexually explicit photos of her own mother  \nphotos he had taken when he had an affair with the mother seven years \nearlier.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats just one of the details set forth in the complaint of a \nrecently filed civil lawsuit in Memphis, Tennessee.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn a separate criminal case, Hook pled guilty to sexual battery by an \nauthority figure. Police had found Hook together with the girl in a \ncar.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe girls mother, identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, had first \nbegun attending the church after the affair with Hook ended and after \nHook himself suggested that Doe and her husband get counseling from \none of the churchs staff pastors, Eric Brand.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs alleged in the lawsuit, Pastor Brand shared sexually explicit \nphotos of his own wife during the counseling sessions and he \nencouraged Jane Doe to do what his wife did so that Doe would keep \nher husband interested.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Does husband asked Brand to stop sharing the sexually explicit \nphotos, Brand explained the photos were for ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs if all of this wasnt awful enough already, the surrounding \ncircumstances of this story make it still worse.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the lawsuits allegations, Hook groomed the 15-year-old \ngirl and fomented his incredibly inappropriate relationship with her \nat Bellevue Baptist Church and some of the sexual abuse took place on \nthe grounds of the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBellevue is a big church with a troubling history.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 2006, its senior pastor Steve Gaines admitted to having knowledge \nthat staff minister, Paul Williams, had sexually abused a child.\u0014\n\u0014\nGaines had agreed to keep it quiet, and for six months, Gaines did \nin fact keep Williams secret, not reporting the child molestation to \npolice and not informing the congregation.\u0014\n\u0014\nGaines disclosed it only after a blogger had already made public the \nnews that the church was harboring a child-molesting minister.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church then conducted an investigation, which reported that \nminister Williams had engaged in egregious, perverse sexual \nactivity with a child over a period of 12 to 18 months.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt also said that not only had Gaines known about Williams abuse of \na child, but also that other church staffers had known, and yet \ncongregants were kept in the dark.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe investigation concluded, There appears to have been no serious \nconsideration given by anyone to the health and safety of the \nBellevue family.\u0014\n\u0014\nOrdinary decent people might imagine that, with such a report from \nthe churchs own investigation, Gaines would have faced serious \nconsequences. But thats not necessarily how things work in Baptist \nchurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nNot only did Gaines remain at Bellevue, but in 2016, the Southern \nBaptist Convention elected him as president of the denomination.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor many Baptist abuse survivors, it felt as though Gaines was \nessentially rewarded for having successfully navigated the media \nexposure of a clergy sex abuse cover-up.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd now, sadly, with still another abuse case inside its doors, it \nappears that Bellevue didnt learn much from its prior experience. \nSuch is the consequence of a lack of consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the currently pending lawsuit, the complaint says, Members of \nBellevue Baptist Church came to Hooks sentencing hearing to show \nsupport and ask the judge for leniency.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo again, we see that many in the church apparently view sexual abuse \nas a matter meriting little consequence.\u0014",

    "title": "DO WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE UP ON GOD?",
    "words": "In December 2019, a Gallup poll found that a whopping 87% of \nAmericans say they still believe in God. And yet, despite that \nprofessed belief, since the onset of the 21st century, Americans have \nbeen abandoning organized religion in droves. According to a recent \narticle in Foreign Affairs, Giving Up on God, between 2007 and \n2019, 43 out of 49 countries grew significantly less religious. The \nauthor, Ronald F. Inglehart, says virtually every high-income country \nhas seen a drastic decline in religion in the past 12 years.\u0014\n\u0014\nInglehart says of all those countries, the United States has seen the \nbiggest abandonment of organized faith. That is stunning, considering \nthe U.S. long was regarded as the one prosperous nation whose \ncitizenry continued to practice religion faithfully. But despite that \nGallup poll, since 2007, there has been an astonishing decline in the \nnumber of Americans who believe God plays an important role in their \nlives.\u0014\n\u0014\nInglehart attributes that decline to modern technology and economic \nadvancements. Most of us no longer worry where our next meal is \ncoming from or if our child will perish from a bout of strep throat \nor some other once-deadly illness. We have less reason to rely on God \nfor our needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nDramatic changes in social norms since the beginning of the 21st \ncentury also have caused many people to question the authority of \nmainline religions to demand we conform to their moral standards.\u0014\n\u0014\nInglehart is convinced that as technology increases and living \nstandards improve globally, people will continue to abandon their \nreligions. He seems to believe that with this will come a growing \nculture of tolerance, which will result in a shrinking influence of \ntraditional religion.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe might be correct. But without God, where do we turn for help and \nsuccor? Where do we find the strength to go on when life is at its \nworst or the hope that things will improve even when there is no \npromise of a better tomorrow?\u0014\n\u0014\nThose are questions that are especially meaningful for younger \nAmericans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, suicide rates for young people between the ages of 10 and \n24 remained fairly stable until the late 2000s. But between 2007 and \n2017, the number of suicides among that age group skyrocketed 56%. Is \nit a coincidence that 2007 is the same year Inglehart says Americans \nbegan eschewing God en masse? Suicide now is the second leading cause \nof death among teens ages 15 to 19, only behind accidents. This is a \nnational epidemic.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn December, Erica Komisar, a prominent psychoanalyst, therapist and \nauthor, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she believes the \ncultural shift away from religion is perhaps the most important cause \nfor increasing rates of depression and anxiety  key indicators of \nsuicide  among children and adolescents.\u0014\n\u0014\nKomisar cited a 2018 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology \nthat determined children and teens raised in families with spiritual \nbeliefs who attended religious services at least once a week scored \nhigher on psychological well-being measurements and had lower risks \nof mental illness.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdditionally, she noted that when the young attended weekly services, \nthey also were associated with higher rates of volunteering, a sense \nof mission, forgiveness, and lower probabilities of drug use and \nearly sexual initiation.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobin Beres,Times Dispatch column, 8/30/20\u0014",

    "title": "DECIPHERING THE EVANGELICAL LEXICON",
    "words": "The redefinition of Americanized Christianity from a primary call to \nfollow Jesus to a fear-based ideology has solidified during the \nhighly divisive political activities of recent years. To accomplish \nthis fuller evangelical evolution, words had to change meanings.\u0014\n\u0014\nLong in the making, this shift has produced a more complete litany of \nshared beliefs and terminology that benefits the defense of white \nnationalism. This revised lexicon has redefined evangelical and \nlabeled its resulting posture as Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\nBy words and deeds, highly public evangelicals, like Franklin Graham, \nJerry Falwell Jr. and James Dobson, have shifted the earlier meaning \nof evangelical  one who brings Gods good news in Jesus to others \n to the use of raw and often amoral political power to sooth white \ngrievance, advance discrimination and seek to preserve cultural \ndominance.\u0014\n\u0014\nAdvancing this political agenda, masked as Christian faithfulness, \nrequired a new vocabulary to support a major refocusing from concern \nfor others (as reflective of Jesus) to self-preservation.\u0014\n\u0014\nWords, very naturally, can take on pejorative meanings. So, its \nalways wise to keep up with how language changes over time.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet, in this case, words were intentionally redefined and misused to \naccomplish a desired goal  that is, seeking to justify a \nself-serving political agenda as somehow being consistent with \nChristianity. Wise persons, and there are not enough of them, know to \nread between the lines  and often the lies.\u0014\n\u0014\nHere are some of the redefined terms in the white evangelical lexicon \nthat have created checklist Christians  those who uncritically \naffirm an emerging litany of ill-defined and misleading beliefs.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious liberty\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen most evangelicals speak of religious liberty, they are not \nreferring to the long-held constitutional guarantee of freedom of \nreligion for all persons, which was greatly influenced by earlier \nBaptists who experienced religious persecution firsthand.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe bastardized definition of religious freedom, advanced by \nChristian nationalists, has no concern for all persons. These are \nmerely efforts to secure and preserve political and cultural favor, \nrooted in a false history of a Christian nation.\u0014\n\u0014\nA primary privilege they seek in the name of religious liberty is \nfor the government to aid their desire to discriminate freely, \nespecially against LGBTQ persons.\u0014\n\u0014\nPro-life\u0014\n\u0014\nWe all know how narrowly this politicized term is used  and how \nlittle it has to do with valuing and preserving life in general. I \naddressed this matter more fully in an earlier column.\u0014\n\u0014\nFamily\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals love to talk about families, but they affirm a narrow \nconcept more aligned with 50s-style television than anything \nrealistic or biblical. This is done, among other things, to advance \nmale dominance that is an essential aspect of religious \nfundamentalism.\u0014\n\u0014\nTheir so-called biblical marriages and families, however, disregard \nthe culture contexts and many of the teachings within the Bible. And \nthere is a lot of hypocrisy as well.\u0014\n\u0014\nMarriage failures are as common within the church as without. But \nmore alarm and political energy are spent on undermining families, \nespecially those of same-sex couples, than addressing the greater \nthreat of family breakdown and the often-associated abuse.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd there was hardly a whisper of concern when families crossing the \nsouthern border were separated, including parents and children who \nwill never be reunited. So much for family values.\u0014\n\u0014\nPro-Israel\u0014\n\u0014\nHighly partisan and widely misleading voter guides, such as one \nissued by the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, contribute to the \nredefinition of terms for secular political benefit.\u0014\n\u0014\nSouthern Baptist churches were encouraged to distribute this guide \nduring the election season. It is heavy on anti-abortion politics and \nabsent of any concerns about poverty, justice, compassion and other \nmatters Jesus considered to be highly important.\u0014\n\u0014\nRather the issues, purportedly important to Georgia Baptists and \nChristians overall, include building a border wall, limiting access \nto health care, getting out of a nuclear deal with Iran and putting \nconservative ideologues on the Supreme Court.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem actually made the voter \nguide posted by Georgia Baptists. Really? This is a top-10 concern \nfor Christians in America when lying is rampant, injustice is \nunaddressed, a pandemic is wreaking havoc due to failed leadership \nand democracy is threatened?\u0014\n\u0014\nPro-Israel posturing by evangelicals really means \nanti-Palestinian, including fellow Christians in Bethlehem who \nsuffer ongoing oppression.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey are stunned and deeply hurt that their Christian brothers and \nsisters in America actually enable such aggression. They are cut off \nfrom economic opportunities by the continuing encroachment on their \nlands and livelihoods.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis nonsensical offense, egged on by American evangelicals, is based \non bad end-times theology and the ignorant misperception that all \nPalestinians are Muslims and that all Muslims are terrorists.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a result, the modern Israeli government, falsely conflated with \nthe biblical children of God, is blessed to act in any way they \nplease regardless of human rights abuses.\u0014\n\u0014\nGovernment authority\u0014\n\u0014\nRomans 13 gets trotted in and out depending on whether ones \npreferred authoritarian is the office holder or not. White Christian \nnationalists love to claim that everyone should be subject to \ngoverning authorities when the political agenda aligns with theirs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThen, of course, choosing God over government gets reinstated when \nthose elected to positions of national leadership dont carry out \ntheir preferred restrictive and discriminatory nationalistic efforts.\u0014\n\u0014\nNo wonder churches are bleeding membership and the \nvoter-guide-distributing Baptist convention is flailing while the \nChristian witness experiences one self-inflicted blow after another.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis shift is not something that happened by accident. It is an \nintentional effort to define Christianity apart from following Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian\u0014\n\u0014\nYes, the term Christian itself has been redefined in lesser ways \nfor a lesser (and politicized) purpose. Pollster George Barna, who \nhas joined forces with fake historian David Barton in advancing white \nChristian nationalism, contributes to this redefinition.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor research purposes, Barnas polling organization defines a \npracticing Christian as someone who has attended church in the last \nmonth and considers his or her faith to be very important. Whats \nmissing? Well, Jesus.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe evangelical lexicon allows for religious/political leaders to \nadvance an agenda that is absent and often at odds with Jesus. They \ndo so by using familiar words in controlling and misleading ways that \ndont mean what they really mean.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo ignore what is taking place will get you carried along in this \nraging stream of ill-defined evangelical Christianity. So, heres a \nsuggestion for being a better Christian and citizen:\u0014\n\u0014\nRead between the lines (and lies) of those who advance this false \ngospel, ignore nonsensical voter guides and other propaganda, and \ninstead read and heed the words of Jesus. That, and only that, is \nwhat it means to be Christian.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn D. Pierce\u0014",

    "title": "DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS - INVENTOR OF A.D. CALENDAR DATING",
    "words": "Dionysius Exiguus (Latin for \"Dionysius the Humble\"[a]; c.?470  \nc.?544) was a 6th-century monk born in Scythia Minor (probably modern \nDobruja, in Romania and Bulgaria). He was a member of a community of \nScythian monks concentrated in Tomis (present day Constanta), the \nmajor city of Scythia Minor. \u0014\n\u0014\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of Anno Domini (AD) dating, \nwhich is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and \nthe (Christianised) Julian calendar. Almost all churches adopted his \ncomputus for the dates of Easter.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most \nthat he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian \ncalendar into the Julian calendar. The resulting Julian date for \nEaster was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of \nthe moon) that occurred on or after the XII Kalendas Aprilis (21 \nMarch) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day \nof the moon, Nisan 14, was the date that paschal lambs were slain (in \nlate afternoon) until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 \nprevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all \nleavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 \nwas the day of preparation for Passover (Lev 23:5). Alexandria may \nhave chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified \naccording to the Gospel of John (18:28, 19:14), in direct \ncontradiction to the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 26:17, Mark 14:12, and \nLuke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the Seder, \nhis Last Supper. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at \nthe beginning of Nisan 15. \u0014\n\u0014\n\n                                                                              \nGregorian Calendar\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world.  It \nwas introduced in October 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a minor \nmodification of the Julian calendar, reducing the average year from \n365.25 days to 365.2425 days, and adjusting for the drift in the \n'tropical' or 'solar' year that the inaccuracy had caused during the \nintervening centuries.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe calendar spaces leap years to make its average year 365.2425 days \nlong, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined \nby the Earth's revolution around the Sun. \u0014\n\u0014\nThere were two reasons to establish the Gregorian calendar. First, \nthe Julian calendar assumed incorrectly that the average solar year \nis exactly 365.25 days long, an overestimate of a little under one \nday per century. The Gregorian reform shortened the average \n(calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with \nrespect to the equinoxes.[3] Second, in the years since the First \nCouncil of Nicaea in AD 325,[Note 1] the excess leap days introduced \nby the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to drift such that \nthe (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well before its nominal \n21 March date. This date was important to the Christian churches \nbecause it is fundamental to the calculation of the date of Easter. \nTo reinstate the association, the reform advanced the date by 10 \ndays: Thursday 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October \n1582.[3] In addition, the reform also altered the lunar cycle used by \nthe Church to calculate the date for Easter, because astronomical new \nmoons were occurring four days before the calculated dates.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe \nand their overseas possessions. Over the next three centuries, the \nProtestant and Eastern Orthodox countries also moved to what they \ncalled the Improved calendar, with Greece being the last.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                                                 \nJulian Calendar\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in AUC 708 (46 BC), \nwas a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on 1 January AUC \n709 (45 BC), by edict. It was designed with the aid of Greek \nmathematicians and astronomers such as Sosigenes of Alexandria.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe calendar became the predominant calendar in the Roman Empire and \nsubsequently most of the Western world for more than 1,600 years \nuntil 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII promulgated a minor modification \nto reduce the length of the average year from 365.25 days to 365.2425 \ndays and thus corrected the Julian calendar's drift against the solar \nyear. Worldwide adoption of this revised calendar, which became known \nas the Gregorian calendar, took place over the subsequent centuries, \nfirst in Catholic countries, and subsequently in Protestant countries \nof the Western Christian world.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Julian calendar is still used in parts of the Eastern Orthodox \nChurch and in parts of Oriental Orthodoxy as well as by the Berbers.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Julian calendar has two types of years: a normal year of 365 days \nand a leap year of 366 days. They follow a simple cycle of three \nnormal years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 \ndays long. That is more than the actual solar year value of 365.24219 \ndays, which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years. \nFor any given event during the years from 1901 to 2099 inclusive, its \ndate according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind its \ncorresponding Gregorian date.\u0014",

    "words": "The date of birth of Jesus is not stated in the gospels or in any \nhistorical reference, but most theologians assume a year of birth \nbetween 6 and 4 BC. The historical evidence is too incomplete to \nallow a definitive dating, but the year is estimated through three \ndifferent approaches: (A) by analyzing references to known historical \nevents mentioned in the nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and \nMatthew, (B) by working backward from the estimation of the start of \nthe ministry of Jesus, and (C) astrological or astronomical \nalignments. The day or season has been estimated by various methods, \nincluding the description of shepherds watching over their sheep.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe nativity accounts in the New Testament gospels of Matthew and \nLuke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus. \u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of Herod \nthe Great. Matthew 2:1 states that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of \nJudaea in the days of Herod the king\". He also implies that Jesus \ncould have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of \nthe Magi, because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age \nof two years, \"in accordance with the time he had learned from the \nMagi\". Matthew 2:16.  In addition, if the phrase \"about 30\" in Luke \n3:23 is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of \nbirth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke 1:5 mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of \nJesus,[4] and places the birth during the Census of Quirinius, which \nthe Jewish historian Josephus described as taking place circa AD 6 in \nhis book Antiquities of the Jews (written c. AD 93),[9] by indicating \nthat Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6 and a \ncensus took place during his tenure sometime between AD \n67.[17][18][19] Since Herod died many years before this census, most \nscholars discount the census and generally accept a date of birth \nbetween 6 and 4 BC, the year in which Herod died.[1][4][9] Tertullian \nbelieved, some two centuries later, that a number of censuses were \nperformed throughout the Roman world under Saturninus at the same \ntime.[19][20][21] Some biblical scholars and commentators believe the \ntwo accounts can be harmonized,[22][23] arguing that the text in Luke \ncan be read as \"registration before Quirinius was governor of Syria\", \ni.e. that Luke was actually referring to a completely different \ncensus.[24]\u0014\n--------------------------------\u0014\nThe nativity accounts in the New Testament gospels of Matthew and \nLuke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of \nJesus.[7][8] Karl Rahner states that the authors of the gospels \ngenerally focused on theological elements rather than historical \nchronologies.[9]\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of Herod \nthe Great.[9] Matthew 2:1 states that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of \nJudaea in the days of Herod the king\".

Matthew 2:16[10] In addition, if the phrase \"about 30\" in Luke \n3:23 is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of \nbirth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.\u0014\n\u0014\nLuke 1:5 mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of \nJesus,[4] and places the birth during the Census of Quirinius, which \nthe Jewish historian Josephus described as taking place circa AD 6 in \nhis book Antiquities of the Jews (written c.

Since \nHerod died many years before this census, most scholars discount the \ncensus and generally accept a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC, the \nyear in which Herod died. Tertullian believed, some two centuries \nlater, that a number of censuses were performed throughout the Roman \nworld under Saturninus at the same time. Some biblical scholars and \ncommentators believe the two accounts can be harmonized, arguing that \nthe text in Luke can be read as \"registration before Quirinius was \ngovernor of Syria\", i.e. that Luke was actually referring to a \ncompletely different census.\u0014\n\u0014\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nThe historical Jesus scholarship is bound by the following \nlimitations:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. There is no physical or archaeological evidence for Jesus; all \nexisting sources are documentary.\u0014\n2. The sources for the historical Jesus are mainly Christian \nwritings, such as the gospels and the purported letters of the \napostles.\u0014\n3. All extant sources that mention Jesus were written after his death.\u0014\n4. The New Testament represents sources that have become canonical \nfor Christianity, and there are many apocryphal texts that are \nexamples of the wide variety of writings in the first centuries AD \nthat are related to Jesus. The authenticity and reliability of these \nsources have been questioned by many scholars, and few events \nmentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.\u0014",

Maud, a fiery speaker and ardent evangelist, took him up on it.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow she told an assembly of prisoners: \"I do not come here to prevent \nyou from paying the just penalty of your crimes; take your medicine \nlike men.

It depends on you whether I keep doing so or not.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFive Sing Sing prisoners made up their minds to follow Christ. By \nyear's end, the Volunteer Prison League was formed. By 1923, over \n100,000 prisoners had signed up for its programs. Maud championed \nprison reform to the end of her life. She set up Houses of Hope \naround the country to help ease ex-cons back into society. In one \nform or another these halfway houses remain to this day. Volunteers \nof America did as much to bring about twentieth century prison reform \nas any other organization--and probably more.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Volunteers of America had emerged out of the Salvation Army. \nBallington Booth, the son of General William Booth, founder of the \nSalvation Army, came to America to reorganize the Salvation Army \nwork.

Remove his \nname from Richmond spaces.\u0014\nMichael Paul Williams Aug 7, 2020  \u0014\n\u0014\nStatues to the Confederate president, generals, soldiers and sailors \nhave fallen by the wayside.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Dr. Hunter Holmes McGuire, surgeon to Stonewall Jackson and the \nConfederate army, remains unmoved during this moment of racial \nreckoning, despite his unrepentant racism as a pusher of eugenics \npseudoscience and Lost Cause propaganda until his death in 1900.\u0014\n\u0014\nOur Veterans Administration Medical Center bears his name. Virginia \nCommonwealth University  a school with an inglorious past of robbing \nthe graves of Black people for medical research  has a medical \ncampus building named for him. A statue of McGuire stands in Capitol \nSquare.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the pandemic exacts a disproportionate toll on Black and brown \nlives, the pre-existing condition of racism has proven more deadly \nthan the virus.\u0014\n\u0014\nMedical science should be as much on trial as Confederate soldiers. \nBut McGuire, who helped blaze a trail for the medical mistreatment of \nBlack bodies, is venerated in the Richmond landscape.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGuires writings are more appropriate for a Grand Wizard of the \nKKK than a medical officer, Richmonder Charles Pool wrote to me in \nan email.\u0014\n\u0014\nIndeed, as president of the American Medical Association in 1893, \nMcGuire co-authored an open letter titled Sexual Crimes Among the \nSouthern Negroes.\u0014\n\u0014\nHe wrote: In the South, the negro is deteriorating morally and \nphysically; and, as the American Indian, the native Australian, the \nnative Sandwich Islander, and other inferior races, disappear before \nthe Caucasian, so the negro, in time, will disappear from this \ncontinent ... It is the frightful survival of the fittest.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGuire asked for some scientific explanation of the sexual \nperversion in the negro of the present day. His corresponding \nco-author, Dr. Frank Lydston, suggested castration as an alternative \nto the lynching of Black men.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the same pamphlet, McGuire strayed dangerously close to being a \nlynching apologist in writing: The newspaper men in the North  seem \nto see only the fearful spectacle of a hung, burnt or shot negro. \nThey seem unable to see the innocent mutilated and ruined female \nvictim \u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, those lynching victims often were guilty of little more \nthan being Black in the South.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1899, McGuire was at the forefront of purging textbooks with any \nmention of slavery as the cause of the Civil War as chairman of the \nhistory committee of the Grand Camp, Confederate Veterans of \nVirginia. And he railed against suffrage to the blacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1946, the VA hospital in Richmond would be named for McGuire.\u0014\n\u0014\nKyle Bibby, a former Marine captain whose tours of duty include \nAfghanistan, does not think much of this choice. He almost \nexclusively goes to VA medical centers for his health care needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a Black man, It is a slap in the face, said Bibby, a New Jersey \nresident and national campaigns manager for Common Defense, an \norganization of politically progressive veterans.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Navy veteran Tashandra Poullard of Houston, the legacy of McGuire \nbrought to mind J. Marion Sims, the so-called father of modern \ngynecology who conducted painful experiments on enslaved Black women \nwithout the use of anesthesia. His statue stood in New Yorks Central \nPark for more than a century before it was removed in 2018.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor her, McGuire represents a history of the medical profession using \nBlack people as guinea pigs, based on the racist belief that Black \nskin was thicker and Black people more unfeeling of pain.\u0014\n\u0014\nA lot of these things are a result of trying to normalize the abuse \nof Black bodies, to make sure that Black people are not seen as human \nbeings, dehumanizing us to justify our treatment, Poullard said. \nAnd the statues, the names of these buildings, all of these things \nare symbolic of ensuring that white supremacy still reigns supreme \nover people of color.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcGuire might not have escaped the judgment of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nVCUs Committee on Commemorations and Memorials has recommended \nremoving McGuires name from its medical campus building. Gov. Ralph \nNortham will be working with legislators to address specific statues, \nincluding McGuires, said his spokeswoman.\u0014\n\u0014\nRalph Jones Jr., spokesman for U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th, who \nrepresents Richmond, said the congressman would absolutely support \nthe renaming of McGuire VA hospital.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Bibby, a Naval Academy graduate, says changing names is not \nenough. Communities, and particularly white residents, must reflect \non the extent theyve internalized the messages theyve conveyed.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat other ways have they affected how their community is framed and \nhow its structured and who gets what, and who has access to \nresources and things like that?

    "words": "Dying Wilberforce Learned Slaves Were Freed\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL 2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nNo man fought harder to abolish slavery than William Wilberforce. A \nmember of Parliament, he introduced antislavery measures year after \nyear for 40 years until he retired in 1825. On this day July 26, \n1833, as he lay dying, word was brought him that the bill to outlaw \nslavery everywhere in the British empire had passed in Parliament. \nThe dream for which he had struggled for decades was now within sight \nof fulfillment!\u0014\n\u0014\nWilberforce had not always been a serious opponent of slavery. As a \nyouth he was a witty, somewhat dissipated man about town who had \nmisspent his time at Cambridge. He was invited to every party.\u0014\n\u0014\nA friend of William Pitt (who became Prime Minister) and a member of \nParliament, Wilberforce seemed assured of a bright political future. \nAnd then in 1784, after winning his election in Yorkshire, he \naccompanied his sister to the Riviera for her health. Isaac Milner, a \ntutor at Queen's College Cambridge and acquaintance from college days \nwas asked along. Isaac agreed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMilner had become a deep and evangelical Christian. He began to \npersuade Wilberforce to commit his life to Christ. Wilberforce had \nalways thought himself a Christian. Now he saw that total commitment \nto Christ was needed. He struggled in anguish for several months. \nDuring that time he read Philip Doddridge's The Rise and Progress of \nReligion in the Soul. Here was a faith far deeper than anything he \nhad known. Gradually he yielded.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt once he began to wonder if it was proper for him to hold a seat in \ngovernment. He confided in Pitt. Pitt, wanting Wilberforce as an \nally, urged him to remain. Unsettled in his conscience, Wilberforce \nspoke to the rector John Newton. Newton, best remembered as the \nauthor of the hymn \"Amazing Grace,\" had been converted while a \nblasphemous sailor and slaver. He counseled Wilberforce to remain in \npolitics and champion good causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriends suggested that the young man take up the slavery issue. Pitt \nalso requested it. After many doubts, Wilberforce decided it was what \nGod wanted. He also felt he must tackle causes which would raise the \nstandard of life and morals in England. The friends who gathered \naround him became known as the Clapham sect because most lived in the \nvillage of Clapham.\u0014\n\u0014\nRarely in history have so many owed so much to so few. These dozen or \nso Clapham men and women not only fought against slavery but also \nagainst every sort of vice. Many were wealthy. They employed their \nworldly goods in behalf of godly causes. Education of the masses, \nsupport of Bible societies, private charity, protection of chimney \nsweeps, creation of Sunday Schools and orphanages--these and dozens \nof other causes received their attention. But it is the abolition of \nslavery which remains their greatest achievement.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMeakin, Annette M. B. Hannah More, a Biographical Study.

So it is refreshing to \nhear how 109 philosophers, neurobiologists, and other scholars \nanswered,         How is the Internet changing the way you think? \nThat is the annual question at the online salon edge.org, where \nevery year science impresario, author, and literary agent John \nBrockman poses a puzzler for his flock of scientists and other \nthinkers.\u0014\n\u0014\n          Although a number of contributors drivel on about, say, how \nmuch time they waste on e-mail, the most striking thing about the \n50-plus answers is that scholars who study the mind and the brain, \nand who therefore seem best equipped to figure out how the Internet \nalters thought, shoot down the very idea. The Internet hasnt \nchanged the way we think, argues neuroscientist Joshua Greene of \nHarvard. It has provided us with unprecedented access to \ninformation, but it hasnt changed what [our brains] do with it. \nCognitive psychologist Steven Pinker of Harvard is also skeptical. \nElectronic media arent going to revamp the brains mechanism of \ninformation processing, he writes.Texters, surfers, and twitterers \nhave not trained their brains to process mul-tiple streams of novel \ninformation in parallel, as is commonly asserted but refuted by \nresearch, and claims to the contrary are propelled by ... the \npressure on pundits to announce that this or that changes \neverything.\u0014\n                                         \u0014\n          And yet. Many scholars do believe the Internet alters \nthinking, and offer provocative examples of howmany of  them \nsurprisingly dystopian. Commu-nications scholar Howard Rheingold \nbelieves the Internet fosters shallowness, credulity, distraction, \nwith the result that our minds struggle to discipline and deploy \nattention in an always-on milieu. (Though having to make a decision \nevery time a link appearsto click or not to click?may train the \nminds decision-making networks.)  The Internet is also causing the \ndisappearance of retrospection and reminiscence, argues Evgeny \nMorozov, an expert on the Internet and politics. Our lives are \nincreasingly lived in the present, completely detached even from the \nmost recent of the pasts Our ability to look back and engage with the \npast is one unfortunate victim. Cue the Santayana quote. [He who \ndoes not know history is bound to repeat it.]\u0014\n\u0014\n          These changes in what people think  are accompanied by true \nchanges in the process of thinkinglittle of it beneficial. The \nubiquity of information makes us less likely to pursue new lines of \nthought before turning to the Internet, writes psychologist Mihaly \nCsikszentmihalyi of Claremont Graduate University. Result: less \nsustained thought? And since online information is often \ndecontextualized, he adds, it satisfies immediate needs at the \nexpense of deeper understanding (result: more superficial thought?). \nBecause facts are a click away, writes physicist Haim Harari, the \nInternet allows us to know fewer facts ... reducing their importance \nas a component of thought. That increases the importance of other \ncornponents, he says, such as correlating facts, distinguishing \nbetween important and secondary matters, knowing when to prefer pure \nlogic and when to let common sense dominate. By flooding us with \ninformation, the Internet also causes more confidence and illusions \nof knowledge  (Nassirn Taleb of MIT, author of The Black Swan), but \nmakes our knowledge seem more fragile, since for every accepted \npiece of knowledge I find, there is within easy reach someone who \nchallenges the fact (Kevin Kelly, cofounder of Wired).\u0014\n\u0014\n          Even more intriguing are the (few) positive changes in \nthinking the Internet has caused. The hyperlinked Web helps us \nestablish connections between ideas,  facts, etc., suggests \nCsikszentrnihalyi. Result: more integrated thought? For Kelly, the \nuncertainty resulting from the ubiquity of facts and anti-facts \nfosters a kind of liquidity in thinking, making it more active, \nless contemplative. Science historian George Dyson believes the \nInternets flood of information has altered the process of \ncreativity: what once required collecting all available fragments of \ninformation to assemble a framework of knowledge now requires \nremoving or ignoring unnecessary information to reveal the shape of \nknowledge hidden within. Creativity by destruction rather than \nassembly.\u0014",

    "title": "DEADLY MISSION TO KOREA",
    "words": "R. J. Thomas' Deadly Mission in Korea\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL     2010  3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert J. Thomas was haunted by the thought of Korea. A Welsh \nmissionary to China, he knew that the people of the \"Hermit Kingdom\" \nneeded the gospel. But Korea, observing how westerners had mistreated \nChina, closed its doors to foreigners. Burning with evangelistic \nzeal, Robert felt he must do something about the people's ignorance \nof eternal life.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, September 13, 1865, he arrived on the coast of Korea and \nbegan to learn what he could about the people and their language. By \nhis action, Robert became the first Protestant missionary to the \nancient land, whose name means \"chosen.\" Roman Catholics, however, \nhad converted many Koreans starting in the late 1700s. They were so \nsuccessful that in 1863 eight thousand were slaughtered by a \ngovernment that feared foreign influence.\u0014\n\u0014\nLacking Korean language material, Robert handed out tracts and New \nTestaments in Chinese. He soon had to return to China, where, the \nfollowing year, his wife died.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1866, Robert learned that an American boat, the General Sherman, \nwas going to try to establish trade relations between Korea and the \nUnited States. He offered to accompany the boat as an interpreter in \nexchange for a chance to spread the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat August, the General Sherman sailed up the Taedong River toward \nPyongyang. Robert tossed gospel tracts onto the river bank as the \nship proceeded.\u0014\n\u0014\nKorean officials ordered the American boat to leave at once. The \nAmericans defied the warning. They paid for their arrogance with \ntheir lives. The schooner ran aground and stuck fast in the muddy \nbottom.\u0014\n \u0014\nThe Governor of the province, Pak Kyu Su, attacked the ship. When the \nKoreans tried to board, waving machetes, the Americans opened fire. \nOver the next two weeks, the Americans held the Koreans off, killing \ntwenty and wounding many more. By September 3, the Koreans were fed \nup. They launched a burning boat down river at the General Sherman to \nset it afire. Now the Americans had to dash ashore or burn to death.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the sailors fled from the boat, the Koreans killed them. Robert \nhad to flee with the rest. True to his mission, he leaped from the \nboat carrying a Bible. \"Jesus, Jesus!\" he cried in Korean to the \nattackers, offering them the Bible. His head was whacked off with a \nstroke of a machete according to one account, but others think he \npleaded for his life and was beaten to death. We may never know the \ntruth, nor if Robert tried to prevent the Sherman's foolish defiance \nof a sovereign power and its butchery of civilians. Seemingly \nRobert's efforts had been in vain.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut God worked in the heart of the man who killed Robert. Convinced \nby Robert's beaming face that he had killed a good man, he kept one \nof the Bibles, wallpapering his house with it. People came from far \nand near to read its words. A church grew. A nephew of Robert's \nkiller became a pastor.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday 40% of South Koreans are Christians and the nation has some of \nthe largest congregations in the world but the North remains largely \nclosed to the gospel.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBelke, Thomas J. \"Juche: A Christian Study of North Korea's State \nReligion.\" http://www.kimsoft.com/2000/jucheNK.htm\u0014\nKim, Young S. \"Corea's 1866 Clash With General Sherman\" \nhttp://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/ \narticle_view.asp?no=240389&rel_no=1 (this claims the story of Thomas \nYoung is largely mythical).\u0014\nPaek, Nak-chun.

He had \nburned at least two thousand victims (some say ten thousand) and \ntortured thousands more.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom property forfeiture to public flogging to burning at the stake, \npersecution and torture were all in a day's work for Tomas de \nTorquemada-- a monk without mercy for anyone who broke the laws of \nthe Church. The number of burnings at the stake during Torquemadas \ntenure has been estimated at about 2,000.\u0014\n\u0014\nTorquemadas implacable hostility to the Jews probably exercised an \ninfluence on the decision of Ferdinand and Isabella to expel from \ntheir dominions all Jews who had not embraced Christianity. Under the \nedict of March 31, 1492, more than 40,000 Jews left Spain. Over \n40,000 Jews were expelled from Spain with only their personal \npossessions. Approximately 50,000 other Jews received a Christian \nbaptism to remain in Spain. Many of them, derogatorily dubbed \n\"Marranos\" by the Old Christian majority, secretly kept some of their \nJewish traditions. They were among the chief targets of the \nInquisition, but it also pursued anyone who would criticize it.\u0014\n\u0014\nOwing to his widespread use of torture to extract confessions, and \nadvocacy of burning at the stake those deemed guilty, Torquemada's \nname has become synonymous with cruelty, religious intolerance and \nfanaticism.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter fifteen years as Spain's Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada died in \nthe monastery on September 16, 1498, and was interred there. His tomb \nwas robbed in 1832, only two years before the Inquisition was finally \ndisbanded. His bones were allegedly stolen and ritually incinerated \nin the same manner as an auto-da-f (act of faith).\u0014",

    "words": "THE DANISH TOWN GILLELEJE DEFENDED HUNTED JEWS FROM NAZIS\u0014\n \u0014\nOctobe 4,1943\u0014\nLutheran pastor Kjeldgaard Jensen in Gilleleje, Denmark, reads a \nletter from his nations bishops, instructing Danes to assist in the \nrescue of Jews from impending Nazi deportation to death camps. The \nbishops remind their flocks that Jesus was a Jew, that persecution \nviolates the command to love ones neighbor, and that it is contrary \nto Danish conceptions of justice. This will inspire the town to hide \nover 1,300 Jews and transport most of them to neutral Sweden.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nazis invaded Denmark in April 1940. For propaganda purposes, \nthey allowed the Danes considerable freedom and did not arrest Danish \nJews.  \u0014\n\u0014\nBy 1943, resistance forces in Denmark had increasingly become a \nnuisance to the Germans. Suffering reverses on many other fronts, the \nGermans feared Denmark could become a staging area for an Allied \ninvasion. Hitler ordered a crackdown on the occupied country. Georg \nF. Duckwitz, a Nazi official, secretly warned the Danish government \nthat Hitler intended to round up Denmarks 7,800 Jews and send them \nto concentration camps.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo the surprise of Hitler, Denmark refused to hand over its Jews, \narguing that they were Danish citizens. Instead, political leaders \nopenly encouraged Danes to protect Jews. Lutheran bishops issued a \nstatement reminding Danes that Jesus was a Jew, that loving ones \nneighbor applies to Jews, and that freedom is worth the risk of life. \nThey reminded their congregations that it is better to obey God than \nman. Citizens responded by hiding Jews and delivering them to the \ncoast where fishermen could ferry them to neutral Sweden. To elude \nNazi checkpoints, the Danes adopted many ruses. Ambulances \ntransported some Jews. A motorcade of refugees was disguised as a \nfuneral procession. Danes donated money to cover the cost of the \nrescue operation and to purchase precious fuel for the boats.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe rescue was not without casualties. Many Jews and boatmen perished \nat sea during bad weather. On land, Nazis captured and sometimes shot \nresistance workers. \u0014\n\u0014\nGilleleje, Denmark, is just ten miles across the Kattegat Straight \nfrom Sweden. Naturally, it became a gathering point for escaping \nJews. On this day 3 October 1943, Kjeldgaard Jensen, Gillelejes \nLutheran pastor, read the bishops letter to his congregation. The \nlittle town responded heroically, accepting over 1,300 Jews and \nsheltering them in attics, barns, and shops. Each night, little boats \nleft the docks with a precious cargo of lives.\u0014\n\u0014\nA large contingent of Jews reached Gilleleje on 5 October. By \nnightfall five hundred Jews and resistance members were hiding in \nGilleleje. This was too many for the fishermen to ferry across. \nFortunately, a schooner had taken shelter in the harbor during a \nstorm the night before. The towns folk raised fifty thousand Danish \nkroner (about US $153,000 in 2020)  to persuade its captain to take \naboard hundreds of Jews.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the schooner was just half loaded, the captain took fright and \ncast off. Little boats loaded as many other Jews as they could. Still \na hundred remained in danger. Where could they hide until the \ntownfolk could disperse them by daylight to safe places outside town? \nPastor Jensen volunteered the church. He hid eighty in the loft and \nanother twenty in the parish hall. \u0014\n\u0014\nSomehow the Gestapo got word. Led by Hans Juhl, Germans surrounded \nthe church, threatening to burn it down with everyone in it unless \nthey surrendered. All one hundred Jews were arrested except one boy \nwho hid in the belfry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfterward pastor Jensen wrote and signed a sad note:\u0014\n\u0014\n5 October 1943 was a terrible day for all of Gilleleje. This was the \nday the German occupation forces carried out a raid looking for any \nJews in the village. This was repeated during the following days, and \nmany known and previously [unknown] Jews (estimated at 12001300) had \ntaken refuge here  both in private houses and, unfortunately, also \nin the church loft and parish hall. Unluckily for us, the Gestapo and \npolice forces stormed these premises. I, the undersigned parish \npriest, had been up in the loft on numerous occasions to help and \ngive comfort in the desperate situation that had unfolded. Probably \n100 Jews were taken to Horserd Prison Camp, from which they have \nsince left  but for where?\u0014\n\u0014\nHe soon collapsed from the strain and sense of failure. However, \nGilleleje was not done with its rescue work. Its citizens rented \nanother schooner, anchoring it out to sea where it would be safer and \nferrying Jews to it. Several voyages later, the town had delivered \nall its remaining hunted people to safety. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of Denmarks courageous defiance of Hitler, ninety-five \npercent of its Jews survived the holocaust. Nearly twenty percent of \nthose survivors went through Gilleleje. In a fascinating side story, \none of the refugees, a musician, repaid his hosts with a family \nheirlooma precious lock of Beethovens hair. Analyzed late in the \ntwentieth century, it showed Beethoven died of acute lead poisoning.\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "words": "Wednesday, October 20 - Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nDying Schaff Placed His Trust in Christ\u0014\n \u0014\nPHILIP SCHAFF was born in Switzerland, but did his greatest work in \nAmerica. Trained at the Universities of Tbingen, Halle, and Berlin, \nhe studied under some of the most famous theologians of his day, \nincluding Tholuck, Neander, and David Strauss. Schaffs sympathy was \nwith evangelical Lutherans. He remarked that a theologian without \nfaith is like a sky without a star, a heart without a pulse, light \nwithout warmth, a sword without edge, a body without soul. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Schaff left Europe in 1844 to become professor of church history \nand biblical literature at the German Reformed Theological Seminary \nin Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, he was already known for his vast \nlearning. One of only two teachers, he taught every class at some \ntime, edited the schools theological paper, and much more. His work \nwas not without opposition. He evoked cries of protest when he urged \nthat instruction be in English not German, arguing that the Lutheran \nchurch would not grow in America unless it adopted the dominant \nlanguage. When he spoke too well of some medieval Catholics and of \nthe Oxford Movement (an Anglican revival of Catholic ideas in his own \nday), he was accused of heresy and had to defend himself. A church \ncouncil exonerated him. \u0014\n\u0014\nSchaff did a prodigious amount of work. His output included six of \nthe eight volumes of The History of the Christian Church, editorial \noversight of the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, a \nthree-volume study of The Creeds of Christendom, an edition of \nLanges Commentary, and oversight of the twenty-eight volumes of the \nNicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn a visit to Germany in 1854, Schaff gathered material for another \nbook that he published as Germany, its Universities, Theology, and \nReligion. Not to be overlooked was his book for laypeople The Person \nof Christ. He described its object as simply to show, in a popular \nstyle, that the person of Christ is the great central miracle of \nhistory, and the strongest evidence of Christianity. He also served \non the revision committee developing a new translation to replace the \nauthorized (King James) version. An advocate of hymn-singing, he \nincreased hymns use among German-American congregations. \u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the American Civil War, the seminary at Mercenberg closed \ntemporarily. Schaff moved to New York where he eventually became a \nprofessor at Union Theological Seminary, holding various chairs until \nhis death on this day, 20 October, 1893. Felled by a stroke that \nyear, he was unable to talk. Friends and family read passages of \nscripture to him and he indicated assent. In his last confession he \nsaid, I am a sinner and place my trust in my Savior who died for \nme.  \u0014\n-----------------\u0014\nPhilip Schaff was committed to Christ and wrote of his centrality. \nModern scholar N.T.

    "words": "DID THE HOLY SPIRIT SELECT FABIAN TO BE BISHOP OF ROME?\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 236, Anteros, bishop of Rome died. Christians gathered to elect \nhis successor. They were to witness one of the most remarkable events \nin the history of the papacy.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt that time the Christian communicants at Rome chose their own \nbishop. The college of cardinals that now chooses the pope was \ncenturies in the future. And the bishop of Rome would not be titled \npope for several centuries yet.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmong those who gathered at Rome was Fabian, a farmer. For thirteen \ndays the church discussed which of several eminent Christians should \nbe chosen as their next leader. Suddenly a dove flew down and landed \non the head of Fabian. This was so like what happened at Christs  \nbaptism, when the Holy Spirit descended on him like a dove, that the \ncrowd took it as a heavenly sign. Upon this, wrote church historian \nEusebius, the whole body exclaimed, with all eagerness and with one \nvoice, as if moved by the one Spirit of God, that he was worthy; and \nwithout delay they took and placed him upon the episcopal throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd so, on this day, 10 January 236, Fabian became bishop of Rome. To \nthe end of his life he served as a worthy leader of the church. Among \nhis many actions, he arranged missions to Gaul (modern France). A \nletter attributed to him shows his concern for souls:\u0014\n\u0014\nWe beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious \nsupplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all \nmen to be saved, and no one to perish, may, by His vast omnipotence, \ncause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the \nCatholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of \nthe devil who are held captive by him, and be united with the \nchildren of our mother the Church. \u0014\n\u0014\nFabian also organized the churchs charitable work in Rome. He \ncondemned heresies, but ironically ordained Novatius as priest. \n(Novatius would later be involved in a schism over the treatment of \nlapsed Christians.) \u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop took a keen interest in past martyrs. He initiated repairs \non the catacombs where many Christians had been buried, appointing \nnotaries to collect and authenticate accounts of those who died for \nChrists sake. He prevailed on the Roman government to exhume and \nreturn the bones of two famous Christian martyrs. Bishop Pontian and \nhis rival Hippolytus had died for their Christian witness while \nexiled to hard labor in the mines at Sardinia. Fabians interest in \nmartyrs was fitting, for he was about to become one himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nA Greek inscription in the Catacomb of St. Callixtus reads Fabian, \nBishop, Martyr. Emperor Decius demanded all Christians leaders offer \nincense to the idols of Rome. Fabian refused. Arrested, he perished \nin captivitypossibly decapitated. At any rate, he died on 20 January \n250, fourteen years and ten days after his unusual elevation to the \nhighest church office in Rome.\u0014\n\u0014\nCyprian, the notable bishop of Carthage, who would himself die a \nmartyr, wrote to the Romans in praise of Fabian:\u0014\nI greatly congratulate you that you honor his memory with so public \nand illustrious a testimony. . . . For just as the fall of a bishop \ntends to bring about the ruinous fall of his followers, so it is a \nuseful and helpful thing when, by the firmness of his faith, a bishop \nbecomes manifest to his brethren as an object of imitation.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014\n\u0014\nJANUARY 10, 236\u0014\n\u0014\nFabian, a farmer visiting Rome, is elected pope (tradition says after \na dove descends on him). He will serve until 250, when he will become \none of the first martyrs under Decius, an emperor hostile to the \nChristian faith.\u0014",

    "words": "We thought it might be helpful to take a big-picture view of the \nmarket and where current market valuation levels sit with a focus on \nthe dividend yield.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe dividend yield is the indicated annual cash dividend (most recent \nquarterly dividend multiplied by four) divided by the current price. \nCharts and financial models help you gauge whether a stock or even \nthe market is reasonably priced. Higher dividend yields indicate that \ndividends are high relative to the stocks market price; in general, \nthis is an indication of undervaluation. Lower dividend yields are a \nsign of overvaluation since the dividends are low relative to the \nmarket price.\u0014\n\u0014\nHistorically, dividends have been important in market analysis \nbecause they represent direct cash flows to investors and cannot be \nmanipulated by accounting techniques, as can earnings and book value. \nDividends also tend to be more stable than earnings: Firms are \nreluctant to raise the cash dividend until they are certain that \nearnings and cash flow levels will be sufficient to cover the new \ndividend leveleven if earnings varyand firms rarely decrease \ndividends unless financially pressed. For market composites, such as \nthe S&P 500 index, the dividend may occasionally decline, but the \ndecreases are small.\u0014\n\u0014\nPrices, on the other hand, vary considerably. When prices rise faster \nthan dividends, the dividend yield falls, and stocks and the market \napproach an overvalued position. Conversely, when prices decline, \ndividend yields rise, and stocks and the market move toward an \nundervalued position. The difficulty lies in determining when the \nyield is approaching an extreme position. It helps to compare the \ncurrent yield to the historical norm to determine if the current \nyield is high or low.\u0014",

    "words": "Do the Dead Sea Scrolls Answer the Canon Question?\u0014\nMichael S. Heiser\u0014\n\u0014\nFebruary 27, 2018\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947 and 1956, transformed \nbiblical studies. Found in a series of caves near an archaeological \nsite on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea known as Qumran, they \ncontributed to research on ancient scribal practices and the history \nof the Hebrew language. But beyond this research, the scrolls also \ndirectly affected an issue that has long been debatedthe Old \nTestament canon. Did this find solidify what should or should not be \nincluded in our Bibles?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe word canon refers to the collection of books considered sacred \nand authoritative by a religious communityin this case, Judaism and \nChristianity. Historical evidence reveals that within the Jewish \ncommunity, there was still uncertainty about some books (e.g., Esther \nand the Song of Solomon) or portions of books (Ezekiel 4048) after \nAD 100. The question of whether Jewish leaders of earlier centuries \nhad similar doubtsor different oneswas shrouded in mystery before \nthe discoveries at Qumran.\u0014\n\u0014\nFragments of all the Old Testament books in the current Protestant \nevangelical canon have been found among the scrollsall except the \nbook of Esther. However, its omission by the Jewish community at \nQumran does not indicate much about its canonical position today.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe omission of the book tells us nothing about how the Qumran \ncommunity actually felt about Esther. The Dead Sea Scrolls discovered \nin modern times are only a fraction of the material originally stored \nat Qumran. The ravages of time have left us an incomplete picture, \nnullifying such a definitive conclusion.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn addition, the Jews at Qumran were one sect of Judaism among \nseveral. Even if there was evidence that they had rejected Esther, \nthat position would have represented only a segment of opinion. Even \ntoday, major segments of modern Christendom do not agree on the \ncanon. That certain books meet approval or disapproval provides no \nguidance as to which opinion is correct.\u0014\n\u0014\nBeyond this, Qumran scribes often indicated a books sacred status by \nciting the book as authoritative for some point of belief or practice \nin their community documents. They also indicated a books sacred \nstatus through produced commentaries. However, not every biblical \nbook of todays Old Testament canon meets this criterion. For \nexample, Judges, Jeremiah, and Job are never cited in community \ndocuments; they have not been the focus of a commentary.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe incomplete nature of the discovery makes this no surprise. \nConversely, the scribes at Qumran considered some books canonical \nthat were not included later in the Old Testament canon by either the \nJewish or Christian communities. Examples include the books later \nknown as 1 Enoch and Jubilees. Although the Dead Sea Scrolls provide \nfascinating insights into how one group of Jews thought about their \ncanon, ultimately they offer no definitive conclusion to the broader \nmodern discussion.\u0014\n\u0014\n***\u0014\n\u0014\n Michael S.

    "words": "Doubt Is Not Unbelief: Evangelicals and the Stigma of Doubt\u0014\nThe key is not the total suspension of confidence or even certainty, \nbut rather the judicious placement of confidence and trust. \u0014\nMICHAEL HAKMIN LEE\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commitment of American evangelicals towards gospel propagation is \nevident from their dominant presence in Protestant mission (vast \nmajority of U.S. based Protestant missionaries are evangelicals) and \nin the identities of their greatest heroes like Billy Graham.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, while evangelicals are understandably and justifiably \npreoccupied with bringing people through the front door of the \nchurch, too many seem relatively inattentive and uninformed as to HOW \nand WHY people are leaving though the back door.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the past few decades, increased religious mobility, which includes \nleaving and switching, has been a notable trend in the shifting U.S. \nreligious landscape (e.g., the rise of the religious nones).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is in part what led me to undertake a research project that \nwould understand leave-takingthe journey from evangelical minister \nand missionary (specifically those who a had formal theological and \nministerial training and served in vocational ministry for at least \ntwo years) to the complete abandonment of the Christian faith, \nincluding any belief in the supernatural.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis research project, which included 31 in-depth interviews with \nsuch deconverts, was guided by the following questions:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat sort of religious experiences and influences did participants \nhave in their early periods of social development (childhood and \nadolescence)?\u0014\n\tIn adulthood, how did participants remember their significant \nChristian experiences, including their ministerial experiences, and \nhow did they make sense of their religious world when they identified \nas Christian?\u0014\n\tHow did the process of leaving unfold, and what was it like \nexperientially?\u0014\n\tWhat are the salient factors and reasons related to discarding the \nChristian faith?\u0014\n\tWhat are the consequences of leaving the Christian faith, and what \nlife changes accompany it?\u0014\n\t\u0014\nMost people and groups I have spoken to about this project seem \ninterested in the reasons given for leaving and the process of \nleaving. I may talk about them in a follow-up post if there is enough \ninterest (let us know!), but in this post I want to jump straight to \nimplications for the evangelical communitynamely, the importance of \nrecovering a proper confidence and the proper place of doubt within \na growing faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicalism, especially its more conservative or fundamentalist \nincarnations, commonly fosters a rigidly constructed faith, with \nmultiple layers of what we consider essential beliefs and values. On \nthe one hand, certitude can be comforting and reassuring in a world \nfilled with chaos and uncertainty. However, the danger of holding \nsomething to be essential to ones faith is that when that essential \nbelief is called into question, the whole edifice, not just that \nbelief, begins to destabilize. And while there is nothing inherently \nwrong with confidence or certainty in ones beliefs and convictions, \nthere is potential harm when evangelical communities and leaders \nplace an unwarranted level of confidence in their theological \nconstructs and impose their certitude on others.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany participants spoke of an environment that encourages the \nsuppression of doubts and discourages the multiplicity of \nunderstandings. Christian traditions that celebrate and normalize \ncertitude, orthodox beliefs, and unwavering faith tend to be \ninhospitable places for those struggling to make sense of how to \nnegotiate dissenting questions and doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs some of the participants commented, after moving on from what was \nonce considered essential (e.g. young earth creationism), they were \nleft wondering what else they were wrong about. Such a tightly wound \noutlook, Lesslie Newbigin suggests, lacks a proper confidence that \navoids the excesses of confidence based on Cartesian, Enlightenment \nrationalism on the one hand and the radical skepticism of postmodern \nnihilism on the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reality of intra-Christian theological disagreements has led some \nto conclude that there is something inherently wrong with the \nChristian faith itself. On the other hand, I do not think the \nsolution is to downplay the place of confidence or even certainty in \nfaith. While I believe there is commonly within evangelicalism an \nundercurrent of misplaced optimism in our ability to objectively \nunderstand truth in an unfiltered way which needs to be challenged, \nmore than the pursuit of certainty itself, it is what we choose to \nplace our confidence in that is the issue. \u0014\n\u0014\nLet me share a few examples:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe should be confident that God exists, but more tentative in our \nincomplete and inevitably distorted claims of what God is like, which \ntends to portray God in our culturally informed image.\u0014\n\tWe should have the highest confidence that God will accomplish what \nGod has set out to do in the course of history, just more tentative \nin how this will unfold.\u0014\n\tWe should be certain that God has spoken to us through the \nprophets, apostles, and ultimately through Jesus, and that Scripture \ncaptures these divine revelations, but we should be more tentative in \nwhat we affirm about the Bible itself and what we discern its \nmeanings to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key is not the total suspension of confidence or even certainty, \nbut rather the judicious placement of confidence and trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should reject the all-or-nothing mentality with regard to our \nunderstanding of faith, which in addition to erroneous \nepistemological assumptions, has to do with a common misunderstanding \namong evangelicals about the place of doubts in the life of believers \n(hence their haste in silencing questions and quelling doubts).\u0014\n\u0014\nOs Guinnesss In Two Minds is one of the most helpful books I have \nread on the subject of doubt. Here, Guinness explains the difference \nbetween doubt and unbelief:\u0014\n\u0014\nDoubt is not the opposite of faith, nor is it the same as unbelief. \nDoubt is a state of mind in suspension between faith and unbelief so \nthat it is neither of them wholly and it is each only partly. This \ndistinction is absolutely vital because it uncovers and deals with \nthe first major misconception of doubtthe idea that in doubting a \nbeliever is betraying faith and surrendering to unbelief. No \nmisunderstanding causes more anxiety and brings such bondage to \nsensitive people in doubt. The word unbelief is usually used of a \nwillful refusal to believe or a deliberate decision to disobey. So, \nwhile doubt is a state of suspension between faith and unbelief, \nunbelief is a state of mind which is closed against God, an attitude \nof heart which disobeys God as much as it disbelieves the truth. \nDoubt is not the opposite of faith, unbelief is. Doubt does not \nnecessarily or automatically mean the end of faith, for doubt is \nfaith in two minds. What destroys faith is the disobedience that \nhardens into unbelief. (1976, 27-30)\u0014\nAs many evangelicals (myself included) and former evangelicals can \npersonally attest to, doubt is commonly vilified within \nevangelicalism as though there is little or no room for doubts within \nan authentic and maturing faith. Consequently, those with doubts, \nlike many of the participants, often feel compelled to suppress them \nand deal with them on their own in secret.\u0014\n\u0014\nA religious environment that compels people to suppress doubts and/or \ndeal with them on their own for fear of being stigmatized as someone \nhaving a defective faith, lacks the compassion and accommodation that \nJesus demonstrated towards the father of the demonized boy (Mark \n9:24) and even Thomas (John 20:27).\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicals commonly speak of their admiration of the zeal and \nboldness of Apostle Paul and laud the faithfulness of his disciple \nTimothy. They may even laugh along at the follies of the disciples, \nlike the impetuousness of Peter or the conniving ambitions of James \nand John, the sons of Zebedee.\u0014\n\u0014\nI find it interesting that much more than others, Thomas, or more \ncommonly referred to as doubting Thomas, perpetually bears the \ninfamy of his supposed shortcomings, suggesting that he embodies an \nexample or path that we are not to follow.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut I believe the different ways that Jesus related to the disciples \ndemonstrates that there is no singular pathway towards vibrant faith \nand spirituality. Not everyone is like Peter, ready to jump in with \nboth feet without careful consideration of the situation and \ncontingencies. Jesus could have refused to provide Thomas the \nassurances that he was seeking, but instead graciously chose to allay \nhis doubts knowing what Thomas needed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThomas doubts were not tantamount to unbelief; it was, rather, as \nGuiness points out, a state of suspension between faith and unbelief \nthat was a part of the Thomas faith journey. Neither glamorizing nor \ndemonizing doubt, Guinness speaks to both the value and perils of \ndoubt and how it ought to be perceived in the life of a believer:\u0014\n\u0014\nThe value of doubt is that it can be used to detect error. But a \nsword like this will cut both ways. If doubt can be turned \ndestructively against truth so that it is dismissed as error, doubt \ncan also be used constructively to prosecute error disguised as \ntruth. Doubt, then, is a problem for both faith and knowledge. As \nlong as the presence of doubt is detected anywhere, neither faith nor \nknowledge can ever be complacent. But though doubt may be normal, it \nshould be temporary and it should always be resolved. Wisely \nunderstood, resolutely faced, it need hold no fear for the Christian. \nTo a healthy faith doubt is a healthy challenge. (1976, 47-49)\u0014\n\u0014\nDoubt then is not necessarily the enemy of faith, but instead can be \na helpful companion in a growing faith. Christian communities and its \nleaders should similarly seek to provide a climate in which believers \nand skeptics are given encouragement and room to honestly explore \ntheir questions and doubts.\u0014\n\u0014\nRather than avoiding or shunning difficult questions that inevitably \narise in the messiness of life, evangelicals ought to promote and \nhonor a culture of constructive dialogue and truth seeking, even if \nit takes us to uncomfortable places.\u0014",

    "title": "DANTE BANISHED WROTE THE DIVINE COMEDY",
    "words": "Dante Banished Wrote the Divine Comedy\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL  2010, 3 May\u0014\n\u0014\nFor Dante, political failure was costly. A \"White\" in the internal \nstruggles of Florence, he became one of the city's six priors. \nDisturbances broke out with the \"Blacks.\" The even-handed priors \nexpelled the worst Blacks and Whites. The Pope, dependent on Black \nmoney, excommunicated the city unless it should restore the \ntroublesome Blacks.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn November 1300, Dante, with others, traveled to Rome to plead with \nthe Pope to lift the interdict. The Pope relented. He was, however, \nplaying a double game. While negotiating with Florence he secretly \ninvited Charles of Valois to bring an army to Italy. He sent Charles \nto Florence to make \"peace.\" The Florentines, long friendly to the \nHouse of France, were reluctant to deny Charles entrance to their \ncity, although they suspected him of duplicity.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles indeed proved to be a serpent. He betrayed the legitimate \ngovernment, strengthened the Blacks and allowed them to enter the \ncity. They immediately went on a five day rampage, looting, killing, \nand burning. They deposed the Whites and with them Dante. On this \nday, March 10, 1302 the victorious Blacks exiled him on pain of being \nburnt alive if he ever returned.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe banishment was deeply distressing to Dante. Emotionally it took \nhim years to accept what had happened. He never saw his wife again, \nalthough some of his children visited him shortly before his death. \nIn exile, Dante solaced himself with writing. One book defended the \nuse of the Italian language over Latin. He produced a series of poems \ncalled Convivo (Banquet). In a treatise he argued for separation of \nchurch and state. Through letters he sought to influence Florentine \npolitics. The collapse of his political hopes led him to stake his \nchance of restoration on one last, great work.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is not known just when he began the Divine Comedy. A giant epic of \nlove and faith, Dante envisioned it in three parts, Hell, Purgatory, \nand Paradise. It yearns with utopian nostalgia for a Pan-Christian \nempire and radiates a Boethian sense of divine reality. \"...in His \nown eternity, outside of time, outside of every other limit, as it \npleased Him, the Eternal Love disclosed Himself in new loves.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBanishment drew out Dante's genius. The Divine Comedy's vigorous \nstyle fixed the Italian language in its modern form well before the \nsame was true of any other European tongue. He had been a poet, \nlover, father, ruler, soldier, and diplomat. Inevitably his work \nreflects this breadth of interests. Nonetheless, its merit escaped \nmost contemporaries and did not win him a return to Florence. In \nfact, the church would place the Divine Comedy on the Index of \nProhibited Books, probably because Dante had consigned seven wicked \npopes to hell.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nDante Alighieri.

    "title": "DIVORCING AN ABUSIVE SPOUSE IS NOT A SIN",
    "words": "Divorcing an Abusive Spouse Is Not a Sin   \u0014\nNot only is it morally justified, it also aligns with Christs heart \nfor the vulnerable.\u0014\nRUSSELL MOORE  MARCH 24, 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nOver the past couple of weeks, Ive received lots of questions about \ndivorce in the case of abuse. At least some of those questions most \nlikely come from reports of a church disciplining a woman for leaving \nher allegedly abusive husband. In case you or someone you love is in \nthat situation, let me start with my conclusion: You are not sinful \nfor divorcing an abusive spouse or for remarrying after you do.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reason this is even a question for people is because they know \nthat the Bible says God hates divorce. In Scripture, marriage is a \ncovenantmeant to embody a sign of the union between Christ and his \nchurch. Jesus spoke very strongly against divorce, even framing the \nlaw of Moses allowance of divorce as a temporary concession to \nhardheartedness, not as Gods plan for marriage (Matt. 5:3132; Mark \n10:212; Luke 16:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen a minister in a more traditional wedding service pronounces the \ncouple married and says, What God hath joined together, let no man \nput asunder, this minister is citing the words of Jesus himself.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven those in the church who rail at the outside world on issues that \nare unclear in Scripture often tend to mute themselves on divorce, \nwhere the Bible speaks emphatically. Usually this is just one more \ncase of tribal culture-war identity politics: There are more divorced \nand remarried people inside our churches than there are people with \nother issues.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats all true. Even so, I believe the Bible treats the question of \ndivorce in cases of abuse not as a matter of sin for the innocent \nspouse.\u0014\n\u0014\nSome people, in the Roman Catholic communion for instance, hold that \nthere is never any moral reason for divorce. Yet even then, the \ndispute is over whether any institution has the authority to \npronounce the marriage dissolved. In that case, the dispute is not \nover whether a spouse should stay in an abusive situation.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont know a single faithful Catholic priest or bishop who would \nsay that a person should stay in an abusive environment. They would \ncounsel in such situations a removal of the person (and his or her \nchildren) and, if the threat of abuse persisted, would keep them away \nfrom such a home, even if that meant for life.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs most of you know, I dont hold to the view that divorce is, in \nevery case, a sin. Along with most evangelical Protestants, I believe \nthat there are some narrow instances in which the sin of a spouse \ndissolves the marriage covenant and that divorce is warranted in \nthose cases. Almost everyone in this view would see unrepentant \nadultery as one of those exceptions. And most of us would see \nabandonment by a spouse as another.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe apostle Paul counseled new Christians in the first century that \nthey were not obligated to leave their unbelieving spouses (1 Cor. \n7:1016). Those marriages were not unholy because of the spouse who \nworshiped some other god; they were made holy by the one who \nworshiped the living God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile God has called us to pursue peace and reconciliation with all \npeople, Paul wrote that in the case of a spouse who walked away, \nabandoning the marriage, the remaining spouse should let it be so \nand not consider himself or herself bound, strongly implying the \nfreedom to remarry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn abusive spouse, in fact, has abandoned the marriage. Abuse is much \nworse than abandonment, involving the use of something holy \n(marriage) for satanic ends. Abuse of a spouse or a child is exactly \nwhat God condemns everywhere in the Biblethe leveraging of power to \nhurt the vulnerable (Ps. 9:18; Isa. 3:1415; Ezek. 18:12; Amos 2:7; \nMark 9:42; etc.). While abuse is worse than abandonment, it is no \nless than abandonment.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf one spouse abandons the home, the Bible reveals, it is not the \nfault of the innocent party. And if a spouse makes the home a \ndangerous place for the other spouse (or their children), that is not \nthe fault of the innocent party either. In those cases, divorce is \nnot a sin but is, first of all, a recognition of what is already the \ncasethat the one-flesh union covenant is dissolvedand the abused \nspouse should feel no condemnation at all in divorcing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuggesting that marital fidelity entails subjecting oneself or ones \nchildren to abuse is akin to implying, based on the Romans 13 command \nto submit to the governing authorities, that Jesus was immoral for \nurging those in danger in Judea to flee to the mountains in the \ntime of great tribulation (Matt. 24:1519). God forbid.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to a 2015 survey, the overwhelming majority of Protestant \npastors would say that divorce in cases of domestic violence is \nmorally legitimate. Yet I would go even further to contend that, in \nmany cases, divorce not only is allowable, as it would be for \nadultery or other forms of abandonment, but is necessary to protect \nthe abused person from further harm.\u0014\n\u0014\nBoth the church and the state have a role in making sure that the \nabuser does not bully the abused person, which often happens through \nthe deprivation of income or housing. A divorce usually involves \nsocietys acknowledging that the marriage is over, helping to divide \nresources, and providing some ongoing protection (often through \nrestraining orders or police files) for those who have been abused.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf youre a minister, you can almost guarantee that someone in your \npews or in your immediate community is experiencing domestic \nviolence. Sometimes the victim will have internalized the abusive \nrhetoric of the abuser and blame herself for bringing on the abuse to \nher or her children.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the one being abused will believe that there is no other \noption but to stay, feeling trapped in the marriage. In the case of \ndomestic violence, the church has a responsibility not only to alert \nthe relevant civil authorities but also to bear the abuse sufferers \nburdens by arranging a safe place of refuge and meeting other needs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe very least that one can expect from ones church is not to be \ncondemned as a sinner for escaping danger.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecognize that abusers often weaponize spiritual language to cover \nthe abuse. They might suggest that the abused spouses are \nunforgiving if they leave or that they would be sinning against \nJesus if they were to pursue divorcequoting out-of-context Bible \nverses all the while. As the steward of the oracles of God, the \nchurch has a mandate to call such misuse of the Scriptures what it \nis: a taking of the Lords name in vain, in one of the worst ways \nimaginable.\u0014\n\u0014\nDivorce for domestic violence is not a sin. Its about sin all \nrightbut its the sin of the abuser, not the sin of the abused who \ndecides to divorce. The abused in our churches and in our communities \nneed to see us applying the Bible the right way, and they need to see \nus embodying the Jesus Christ who protects the vulnerable.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. Yes and amen. \nBut sometimes Jesus also would have us recognize that man should not \nforce together what God has put asunder.\u0014\n\u0014\nSometimes the path to divorce court is not a way to destruction but a \nroad to Jericho. We should look to see who is beaten on the roadside \nand be for them who Jesus told us to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: The general tone of this article is written from a very \nconservative point of view.\u0014",

    "title": "DO WE NEED A RAISED BODY? RESURRECTION OF JESUS",
    "words": "Do we need a raised body?\u0014\nby Ross M. Allen\u0014\n\u0014\nI USED TO WORK as a campus minister at Kansas State University. In \nthat context, I worked with dozens of undergraduates who endured \nfaith crises that were made immeasurably more challenging by the \ntheological absolutism they encountered in their home churches. \nStudents often adopt- ed their pastors idea of a Christian \nworldview, one seen through a lens of certainty and insistent on an \nall-or-nothing approach. When these young people first encountered \nhigher criticism of the Bible or challenges to their beliefs from \nphilosophy or the social sciences, they came to see that the \ndoctrines they had long held as timeless and absolute were anything \nbut. The ministries I worked with maintained a safe environment where \nthese students could talk about their doubts openly. While many found \na way to integrate that doubt into a more nuanced understanding of \nfaith, others could never quite shake the all-or-nothing standard. \nWhen they found they could no longer muster infallible confidence, \nthey opted out of Christianity altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nA common stumbling block was the resurrection of Jesus. For \nevangelicals in particular, being a Christian requires an assertion \nthat Jesus body was reanimated on the third day following his death \nand that he walked around on the earth for a time before ascending up \nthrough the sky to sit at the right hand of the Father. This was \nwhere things always got hazy. Everybody knows that when you keep \ngoing up into the sky, you hit the stratosphere and eventually outer \nspace without ever whizzing past a throne room. So where did Jesus \nfly off to? It seemed everyone was fine demythologizing the \nascension, but the natural question which followed set off alarms: If \nthat idea was a metaphor, then wouldnt that mean the resurrection \nwas too? \u0014\n\u0014\nThese questions arent just nagging college kids in Kansas. According \nto the most recent polling data, only 45 percent of American \nChristians are certain about Jesus bodily resurrection, which marks \na precipitous 20 percent drop from what the Harris Poll reported 15 \nyears ago. Indeed, in my more recent years doing adult education with \nolder mainline Protestants, Ive encountered many who silently \nstruggle with the fact that they cant recite the creeds earnestly or \nfeel confident that Jesus rose from the dead. Most will just shrug \nindifferently, assuming someone else has an answer if one is needed, \nbut some harbor lingering insecurities about what feels like \nintellectual dishonesty. Few have full confidence in the idea of the \nresurrection they grew up with, but everyone seems to feel the need \nto pretend that they do.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat if we didnt have to pretend? It matters pastorally how we treat \nthis kind of doubt and how we steward the resurrection story. When \nreanimation is regularly presented as the default view, take it or \nleave it, people naturally believe that this is simply what all \nChristians have, until recently, believedand that to think \ndifferently is tantamount to betraying the received gospel. \nThankfully, thats not the case. A closer look at the writings of the \nearly church shows that the earliest accounts arent committed to the \nreanimation of Jesus flesh at all and that, in any event, there has \nalways been a diversity of opinion on the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nt is widely accepted that the writings of Paul predate the Gospels \nand that his, therefore, is the first recorded account of the \nresurrected Christ. And as Orthodox theo- logian and Bible translator \nDavid Bentley Hart has laid out, Paul flatly rejects the idea that \nJesus rose in the flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn responding to a critique on this question by N. T. Wright, Hart \nshows just how far removed from the world of the first century we \nare as modern readers. While he outlines what for many of us would \nprove a complicated argument about the New Testament usage of the \nwords pneuma (spirit) and sarx (flesh) and the theologies of \nresurrection that attach to them, the gist is that the only extended \nbiblical discussion of the resurrection body occurs in 1 Corinthians \n15, where Paul explicitly says that flesh and blood cannot inherit \nthe Kingdom of God. Paul further claims that Jesus rose with a body \nthat con- sisted solely of pneuma, which was understood in terms of \nwhat we might recognize as something like oxygen or electricity. On \nthat view, Jesus resurrection body would still be made of a kind of \nmaterialbut it would be an airy, ephemeral kind which at the same \ntime permeates the whole cosmos.\u0014\n\u0014\nHart cautions us that we wont understand what Paul means unless we \ncan contextualize our reading and account for his very different \nclassical cosmology. We moderns, formed by the dualism of Ren \nDescartes, tend to work in terms of a binary where spiritual means \nnot physical or less than physical. This, however, would be \ncompletely foreign to the authors of scripture, who saw the spiritual \nas more real than the physical. (For more on this, see Dale Martins \nThe Corinthian Body and Troels Engberg-Pedersens Cosmology and Self \nin the Apostle Paul: The Material Spirit.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHart is quick to acknowledge the ambiguity at the heart of an honest \nexegesis. He writes, There is, admittedly, no single consistent \naccount of resurrectioneither Christs or ours in the New \nTestament. This debatability is, however, precise- ly the point. The \nresurrection has been debated among Christians since the earliest \ndays of the churchnot just since the advent of liberalism. While \nallegorizing the resurrection is often associated with Gnosticism, \nthere is a tradition of oth- erwise orthodox Christian teaching that \ndenies what we would call a bodily resurrection altogether. While \nthis teach- ing was, admittedly, an outlier position, it was never \nanathe- matized and existed well after the Council of Nicaea in 325.\u0014\n\u0014\nSynesius of Cyrene, trained as a Neoplatonic philosopher, is the \nbest-known exemplar of this tradition. He was made bishop in 410, but \nnot before writingin an open letter to the church that was \nattempting to elect him, no lessthat the resurrection is nothing \nfor me but a sacred and mysterious allegory. Throughout his \nministry, he would insist on maintaining this view, even as he would \nalso insist that other views must be accommodated. He became a \ncelebrated church leader in his day, and a small but important body \nof his writing survives today. Synesius demonstrates that earlier \ngenerations of Christians were much more heterogeneous in their \ntheological commitments than most conser- vative accounts would have \nus believeand not just at the fringes.\u0014\n\u0014\nBehind the resurrection debate is a debate about Gods rela- tionship \nto the world. Theological descendants of the Reformation have \ninherited a tradition heavily influenced by William of Ockham. Called \nnominalists, these thinkers under- stood God as a personal divine \nbeing who existed among other objects in the universe just like we \nhuman beings do. In this view, reality is imagined as existing \noutside of God, so divine action is understood as competing with \nhuman action. In the wake of this idea, later thinkers would then \ncome to understand the miraculous as a supernatural interruption of \nnatural law.\u0014\n\u0014\nAmerican Protestants have tended to argue on nominalist terms and \nthen split based on whether they can believe in the seemingly \nimpossible. A better way forward might come from questioning the \nassumptions behind nominalisms nature/ supernature distinction.\u0014\n\u0014\nNominalism marked a departure from the classical theism of thinkers \nlike Iranaeus of Lyon, Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas, who thought of \nGod as not merely a being among others but the source of being \nitself. In this view, God donates existence to all other things, \nwhich live, and move, and have their being in Gods self (Acts \n17:28). Within a classical under- standing, it is much more \nintelligible to argue that Jesus physical resurrection was, at its \nroot, spiritualbecause the physical world we inhabit is already and \nalways derivative from the spiritual world.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologians still maintain some \nform of this classical view. Thats part of why they have recourse to \na much richer understanding of the mystical significance of the \nresurrection than we typically find among Protestants, whether \nmainline or evan- gelical. Thus, Catholic and Orthodox Christians are \noften will- ing to admit two things that many Protestants find \nthreatening: that we cant know the resurrection as an object of \nhistorical fact, and that insisting on certainty about Jesus \nphysical resur- rection proves disillusioning to the faithful and \nuncompelling to those outside the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nMichael H. Crosby, a Catholic priest and theologian who died in 2017, \nmade much the same argument: that it is the mystical seeing and not \nthe factuality of a historical event which is at the heart of Jesus \nresurrection. In one of the last pieces he con- tributed to the \nNational Catholic Reporter, Crosby advocated for a return to the \nmystical interpretation of the resurrection. He approached the topic \nthrough a discussion of Pauls conversion account as recorded in 1 \nCorinthians:\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is my conviction that we need to reclaim this Pauline meaning of \nResurrection from our futile debates about the meaning of any \nphysical resurrection of Jesus   Moving from a concentration on the \nGospel narratives stressing the bodily resurrection to a \nreclamation of the mystical expe- rience of the Risen Christ will \nhelp us grasp the heart of the mystery of faith in the Resurrection \nwhich, indeed, is the heart of our belief.\u0014\n\u0014\nSaul was transformed by his mystical experience of the Risen Christ. \nHe insisted that his Resurrection experience was equal to those in \nthe Gospels who had their own expe- riences of seeing Jesus as \nalive in, among and around them. This led the convert Paul to become \nthe missionary theolo- gian of the churchs understanding of itself \nas the extension in time and space of the Jesus of history. Now this \nJesus was alive (risen) in each and every member of the living body \nof Christ, in the church and throughout the cosmos.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I traveled more in evangelical circles, I often heard that much \nof the mainline has not taken the resurrection seri- ously enough. I \nstill wonder if this critique might be true. That doesnt mean that \nProtestants should double down on the wrong question though, of \nwhether the reanimation of Jesus body is historically provable. \nInstead, we might become more ecumenical and learn from our Christian \nsiblings. Like Crosby, the best among them have honored the \nresurrection as part of a broader paschal mysteryand insisted that \nthis mystery is at the center of Christian life.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaking this move does not require embracing a naive materialism, \nwhich by this point many physicists and philosophers see as outdated \nand false. It also does not require that we try to debate, on a \nscientific basis, the possibility of a reanimated corpse. Instead, \nthis view asks us to reimagine our understand- ing of the material \nworld altogether.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat it invites us to is a new way of seeing. In this under- \nstanding, the body with which Jesus rose is one we can perceive only \nwith our spiritual senses, honed through contemplative practicebut \nit is nonetheless real. Theologian Sarah Coakley has written a set of \nbeautiful reflections on the resurrection much along these lines, \nwhich she delivered at Salisbury Cathedral in 2013. She makes clear \nthat this isnt a kind of abandonment of bodies, as if they didnt \nmatter, but rather a radical commitment to the embodied experience of \nthe risen Christ and our transformation.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the global pandemic keeps death at the forefront of our minds, so \nmany of us are longing for resurrection. We continue to receive \nambivalent news about what life post-COVID will look like, and we are \nall looking for a sense of ultimate hope that we can trust. For some \nof us, the idea that the bodies we now inhab- it will be brought back \nin a stronger form is an endorsement of the basic goodness of our \nphysicality and a promise that we will all one day be healed: it \noffers that kind of steadfast hope.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there is also room in the family of faith for those who think a \nreanimated body, however conceived, simply isnt the best way to make \nsense of what happened to Jesus and will happen to us. For some, a \nmyopic insistence on resurrection as reanimation can push hope out of \nreach. Instead of frag- menting along this divide, we might simply \nacknowledge that questions surrounding the resurrection areand \nalways have beencomplicated, debatable, and invested with \nexistential meaning for those who aim to live in its light.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf the epistles are right, the good news of Easter speaks to all of \nus. As a result of the resurrection, the Spirit of Christ is alive in \nall Christians and is at work in the life of all humanity, pantas \nanthropous (Rom. 5). In our dying, we are all promised life hid with \nChrist in God, which is free from evil and decay (Col. 3). Thus, if \nwe are going to make an Easter proclamation at all, let it be \nsomething like the bene- diction with which Coakley ends her final \nreflection:\u0014\n\u0014\nHere is the great truth at the heart of Christian faithresurrection. \nStake your life on it, struggle with it, and everything will change. \nDie, turn, see . . . and then live in this mys- tical body, which is \nthe blessed company of all faithful peo- ple [who] walk with you on \nthis great adventure of the Christian life . . . and which will hold \nyou in all your frailty and glory, unto your lifes end. For Christ \nis risen indeed. Alleluia. Amen.\u0014",

    "title": "DWIGHT L. MOODY WAS CONVERTED",
    "words": "Dwight L. Moody Was Converted\u0014\nDiane Severance, Ph.D. and Dan Graves, MSL  2010, 28 Apr\u0014\n\u0014\nDwight L. Moody didn't attend school beyond the fifth grade; he \ncouldn't spell, and his grammar was awful. His manners were often \nbrash and crude, and he never became an ordained minister. Once, \nbefore his conversion, he so outraged an Italian shoe salesmen with a \nprank, that the man chased him with a sharp knife, clearly intending \nto kill him. Yet, Dwight L. Moody was used by God to lead thousands \nof people to Christ. Moody's life of Christian service began with his \nconversion on this day, April 21, 1855.\u0014\n\u0014\nDwight came to Boston as a teenager from Northfield, Massachusetts, \nand he felt all alone in the big city. The boy was desperate for \nwork. An uncle took him on as a shoe salesman--on condition that he \nbe obedient and that he attend Mt. Vernon Congregational Church. The \nyoung man had been raised in a Unitarian church which denied the full \ndivinity of Christ and did not emphasize human need for salvation \nfrom sins. Now Dwight heard about those things. But he decided that \nhe wanted to enjoy the pleasures of the world and wait to get saved \nuntil just before he died.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the kindness of his Sunday School teacher, Edward Kimball, \nturned young Moody into his life-long friend, and encouraged him to \npersist in his church attendance and regular Bible reading. Though \nMoody did try to read the Bible, he couldn't understand it. Kimball \nlater said he had never seen anyone whose mind was as spiritually \ndark as Dwight's.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat changed on this day, April 21, 1855. Kimball came to the shoe \nstore to ask Dwight to commit his life to Christ. Dwight listened \nclosely and became a Christian that day. Immediately he began sharing \nhis faith with others, including his own family. They wanted nothing \nto do with his faith. \"I will always be a Unitarian,\" his mother \nsaid. (However, she converted shortly before her death.)\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd at first Dwight Moody wasn't allowed to become a church member. \nAsked what Christ had done for him, the nervous boy replied that he \nwasn't aware of anything particular. Leaders felt that was an \nunacceptable answer.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Moody later moved to Chicago he wandered the streets to find \nyoung boys to bring to his Sunday School class. He had a passion for \nsaving souls and determined never to let a day pass without telling \nsomeone the gospel of Jesus Christ. Often he irritated strangers on \nthe street by asking them if they were Christians -- but his pointed \nquestioning stirred the consciences of many. God used the converted \nshoe salesman to become the leading evangelist of his day.\u0014\n\u0014\nEstimates vary, but Dwight Moody is thought to have led as many as a \nmillion people to confess faith in Christ. Among his many \nachievements on either side of the Atlantic was the founding of Moody \nBible Institute.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nFindlay, James F. \"Moody, Dwight Lyman.\" Encyclopedia of American \nBiography, edited by John A.

    "title": "DARBY SHONE BRILLIANT LIGHT ON BIBLE PROPHECU",
    "words": "DARBY SHONE BRILLIANT LIGHT ON BIBLE PROPHECY AND CHURCH FUNCTIONS\u0014\n \u0014\nOn first meeting John Nelson Darby, one might not guess he was a \nbrilliant scholar. Once he kept an appointment but went to the back \ndoor by mistake. Seeing his threadbare suit, the servants assumed he \nwas a beggar and fed him as one. When Darby realized the impression \nhe had created, he finished his meal and left without revealing who \nhe was rather than embarrass his host.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarby trained for the bar at Trinity College, Dublin, but soon \nabandoned law to become a curate in the Church of Ireland. This led \nhis father to disinherit him, although the pair later reconciled. \nAssigned to Calary in Wicklow Country, Ireland, Darby lived as humbly \nas his parishioners. And he preached in Gaelic, which brought many \nIrish to faith. At his own expense, he built schools and practiced \ncharity while wearing his threadbare clothes. After he left Calary, \nseveral parishioners wrote him a letter of gratitude for all he had \ndone.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarby left the Church of Ireland because he became convinced state \nchurches are unbiblical. He protested a clergy letter that claimed \nCatholic emancipation would lead to persecution. If Christ suffered, \nwhy did his followers expect to be exempt? He objected when his \narchbishop required all clergy to swear an oath acknowledging the \nEnglish king as head of the church. Christ, not king, was supreme in \nthe church, said Darby. Decades later he wrote a book arguing that \nrites of ordination and some other practices of the Episcopal Church \nwere man-made.\u0014\n\u0014\nA fall from a horse laid him up for several weeks in 1827. During his \nconvalescence, he pored over the Bible and became convinced all state \nchurches are a hindrance to church unity. He defined the church as \nall true believers united by the Holy Spirit. A church body exists \nwherever two or three gather together in Christs name. All believers \nshould accept any true believer. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhile recovering, Darby also considered the Bibles promises to the \nJews of a permanent and blissful nation. Specific prophecies that \nspoke about the land of Israel remained unfulfilled. The details \nshowed they could not apply to the church. Careful study over the \nnext five years led him to develop the Dispensationalism for which he \nis famous. Along the way he acquired his belief in the \npre-tribulation rapture of the church. His writings inspired a \nrenewed interest in Israels place in prophecy. People respected his \nopinions because he was a master of biblical languages.\u0014\n\u0014\nDarby was a founder of a Brethren movement. Beginning in 1827 he and \na few others gathered for simple services. Later they became known as \nthe Plymouth Brethren because in Plymouth they first became \nprominent. Although they set out to break barriers, the Brethren soon \nargued over Bible interpretation and split into many factions.\u0014\n\u0014\nMeanwhile, Darby used his linguistic gifts to translate the Bible \nfrom its original languages into German, French, and English. He \nplanted Brethren churches throughout Europe, Canada, the United \nStates, and New Zealand. A fall in old age weakened him, but he wrote \nuntil a few days before his death at eighty-one years of age, on this \nday, 29 April 1882.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "DETHRONING THE CANONICAL PAUL",
    "words": "Dethroning the canonical Paul\u0014\nCavan Concannon believes that the apostles writings belong in the \nlatrine.\u0014\nby Greg Carey May 19, 2022\u0014\n\u0014\nProfaning Paul\u0014\nBy Cavan W. Concannon\u0014\n\u0014\nPauls shit stinks, argues Cavan Concannon, so much so that Paul \ncannot be redeemed. Concannon draws the scatological language from \nPaul himself, noting that Paul frequently flings poo at his \nopponents. Concannon sustains the imagery throughout his book, which \naims to dethrone Paul as a moral and spiritual authority. If we \ncannot count the souls in heaven who have benefited from Pauls \ntheological musings, we also cannot count the bodies that have been \nleft behind.\u0014\n\u0014\nA wonderfully vivid writer, Concannon weighs his argument carefully. \nHe does not exactly blame Paul for holding views shared by most of \nhis contemporaries. Instead, he questions why such a person should \nhold moral authority today. Why should anyone looking for resources \nto challenge neoliberal capitalism or the rising current of racist \nfascism trust the insight of someone who couldnt see that the forced \nbondage of human beings was an unconscionable wrong?\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannon also cautions that we are talking not about Paul the \nhistorical figure but about Paul as canonically constructed, with all \nthe authority that entails. He thereby avoids labored debates about \nwhich letters Paul actually authored. He even concedes the \npossibility that Paul can be redeemed somehowbut not yet, not before \nwe have sifted through the filth to the point of revulsion.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannons primary objections to Paul will be familiar to many \nreaders, as they are to many of the seminarians I teach. Pauls \nwritings convey patriarchy, reinforce slavery, and contribute to the \noppression of sexual minorities. He can be authoritarian in ways that \nhave served colonizers and despots. One essay option my students face \nbegins with the prompt, Was Paul a jerk?\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I want from my students is a sophisticated grappling with this \nquestion or some aspect of it. Concannon maintains that a question \nlike mine reflects the countless ways readersliberal, conservative, \ninclusive, and doctrinairerationalize Paul, as if a little air \nfreshener could remove the stench.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannons extended investigation of shit is valuable all by itself. \nWe humans remove ourselves from waste, in part as a means of defining \ncivilized space. But we also recycle manure, and waste in general, in \nways both productive and exploitative. We need to pay closer \nattention to our waste, to the significance we attach to it, and to \nits role in serving people and exploiting them. Concannons deep \nengagement with philosophical and cultural theory has much to teach \nus, especially when he meditates on what it is like to feel like dung \nand how our society renounces whole classes of people, notably \nprisoners, as if they were waste.\u0014\n\u0014\nRegarding Paul, Concannons greatest contribution lies in dismantling \nattempts to apply lipstick to a turd. Concannon tracks this pattern \nto the origins of academic biblical scholarship, which sought to \nstrip pure ideas and sentiments from historical layersand in doing \nso set aside frank engagement with the Bibles ethical liabilities. \nThe pattern continues as scholars elevate Pauls critique of empire \nto explain away Pauls accommodation of slavery and his clear \narticulation of misogynist values. Bending our best judgment to \naccommodate Paul functions no better than our rationalizations of \nabusive family members and institutions.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannon likewise flushes away attempts to reconstruct a radical \nPaul by means of secular philosophy and other disciplines. He \ncritiques the Pauls set forth by Jacques Ellul, Alain Badiou, Giorgio \nAgamben, filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, and biblical scholars Ward \nBlanton and Brian Blount. Both Pasolini and Blount recognize Pauls \npotential for harm as well as for liberation, but Concannon argues \nthat redeeming Paul is ultimately impossible. Such efforts may make \ngold from dung, but never without a malodorous residue. A former \nevangelical, Concannon has given up the effort. He recommends \njettisoning Paul from canonical status: when something stinks, just \nleave it alone.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannon does offer an alternative. Drawing upon African American \nand queer interpreters, he proposes that we profane Paul, rejecting \nhim as a holy authority but instead engaging him playfully. In so \ndoing, we might find ourselves identifying with both Christs \nself-abasement (Phil. 2:611) and Pauls (Phil. 3:411) and find \nsolidarity with one another in our stinky humanity. This is the \nbooks most elegant part.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannon makes use of Black interpreters who reject Pauls authority \nbut not of others who identify a liberationist legacy. He briefly \nnotes several of the latter groupAllen Dwight Callahan, Emerson \nPowery, Rodney Sadler, and Lisa Bowensbut never engages their work \ndeeply. I confess that I too am at a loss for how to address these \nscholars divergent readings, which may not be his or mine to \nadjudicate.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat conflict among interpreters has much to teach us. Concannon well \nknows that some Christian believers find inspiration and challenge in \nPaul. He acknowledges that Paul says valuable things, but he says \nlittle about what precisely those might be, especially as it relates \nto healthy theology. Ecumenical Christians will read Paul without \nlimiting ourselves to only two options, the pedestal or the latrine. \nWhat about those preachers and scholars who wade into Pauls sewage \nyet insist that he also presents gifts wed be impoverished without?\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians will continue to read Paul and seek meaning from him. For \nexample, one can make a better case for Paul as a gender egalitarian \nthan for Jesus, yet Pauls views in this area are deeply, deeply \nflawed. He claims women have a sexual use (thats the Greek word in \nRom. 1:2627) while men do not. When he warns men against \nprostitution (1 Cor. 6:1020), he takes no account of the \nprostitutes welfareand most prostitutes in the ancient world were \nenslaved. These are deep problems. We dont talk about them enough.\u0014\n\u0014\nYet there is much to learn from Paul, even from his deficiency \nitself. Many of us value equality and dignity, yet our cultures \ndehumanizing scripts keep running in the back of our head, \ncompromising our speech and our behavior. In this respect we can \nidentify with a flawed Paul. It is possible to learn from scripture \nspecifically when things go wrong.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor should we overlook the value of some Pauline theologizing. In or \nout of fashion, my students respond extremely positively to the \ndecades-long faith in Christ versus faith of Christ conversation. \nThey find spiritual freedom and pastoral value in grounding our \nsalvation in Jesus faithfulness rather than in our own mustard-seed \nfaith. Recent scholarship that demonstrates grace as a relational \ndynamic rather than a simple transaction counters the shallow all \nyou have to do is receive the gift gospel. These things matter for \nChristians, and Paul offers their classic expression.\u0014\n\u0014\nConcannon focuses on Paul, but his argument just as easily applies to \nthe whole Bible. None of it is pristine. Yet Jews and Christians will \nfind meaning in conflicted texts. Paul often reeks, and Concannon \nshows us new and deeper ways that is so. There is no point spraying \nhim with perfume. The treasure Paul deposits in clay pots may repulse \nus. But as any medical lab will attest, excrement can be revelatory, \ntoo.\u0014",

    "words": "D-Day for the Volunteers of America\u0014\n\u0014\nThe prisoners eyed the beautiful woman with interest. How short she \nwas! But it was obvious she cared about them. Not many other people \ndid.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaud Booth was is Sing Sing Prison, New York, on this day, May 24, \n1896, because she had received a letter from a prisoner. He asked her \nto provide relief for his family, left destitute when he was locked \nup. On the envelope, the Warden scrawled an invitation for Maud to \nspeak. Maud, a fiery speaker and ardent evangelist, took him up on it.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow she told an assembly of prisoners: \"I do not come here to prevent \nyou from paying the just penalty of your crimes; take your medicine \nlike men. When you have paid the penalty, I will help you. I will \nnurse you back to health. I will get you work. Above all, I will \ntrust you. It depends on you whether I keep doing so or not.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nFive Sing Sing prisoners made up their minds to follow Christ. By \nyear's end, the Volunteer Prison League was formed. By 1923, over \n100,000 prisoners had signed up for its programs. Maud championed \nprison reform to the end of her life. She set up Houses of Hope \naround the country to help ease ex-cons back into society. In one \nform or another these halfway houses remain to this day. Volunteers \nof America did as much to bring about twentieth century prison reform \nas any other organization--and probably more.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Volunteers of America had emerged out of the Salvation Army. \nBallington Booth, the son of General William Booth, founder of the \nSalvation Army, came to America to reorganize the Salvation Army \nwork. General Booth didn't like the way Ballington \"Americanized\" the \nArmy.\u0014\n\u0014\nFollowing a sharp disagreement, Ballington and his beautiful wife \nMaud left the Army. On March 8, 1896, they announced they were \nsetting up a new organization, God's American Volunteers (afterwards \nknown as Volunteers of America).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe volunteers not only engaged in prison work. Wherever its leaders \nsaw a need, they stepped forward to meet it. VOA sponsored disaster \nrelief, helped found the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA), set up \nfood pantries, provided lodgings for working men, affordable housing \nfor the working classes, and even offered day nurseries for working \nmothers. Eventually it offered housing programs for the mentally ill \nand medical services to the poor.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen we total up the impact for good that Christianity has had on \nAmerican society, we must not forget the important role of the \nVolunteers of America.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nChesham, Sallie.

    "title": "DO I  STAY CHRISTIAN?",
    "words": "by Martin Thielen June 1, 2022\u0014\nIN REVIEW  CHRISTIAN CENTURY\u0014\n\u0014\nDo I Stay Christian?\u0014\nA Guide for the Doubters, the Disappointed, and the Disillusioned\u0014\n\u0014\nBy Brian D. McLaren\u0014\n\u0014\nI often encounter people who are struggling with big questions about \nfaith. Is God personal? Does God intervene in the world? Was Jesus \ndivine? Do miracles occur? Is the Bible still relevant? Is it time to \ngive up on institutional religion? I often see lurking behind these \nquestions a bigger and more frightening question, one that many \nChristians ask themselves privately but are afraid to name in public: \nCan I remain a Christian? Brian McLaren openly and courageously asks \nthis question in his new book.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcLaren begins by laying out ten solid reasons for abandoning \nChristianity. These include historic (and current) antisemitism; the \nchurchs habit of crushing dissenters; a history of Christian \ncolonialism that includes support of slavery, White supremacy, and \nWhite Christian nationalism; toxic institutionalism; financial greed; \nWhite patriarchy; rigid theology; the failure of Christianity to \ntransform lives; an anti-intellectual streak that rejects science and \nencourages poisonous politics; and an aging demographic in the church \nthat trends toward regressive views.\u0014\n\u0014\nMore reasons could be added, including the reality that traditional \ntheistic theology no longer rings true for a growing number of \npeople. But the section is compelling as it is, and if readers finish \nit with the thought, Case closed, Im done with Christianity, it \nwould be difficult to fault them. As McLaren clearly spells out, \nthere are many good reasons for giving up on the Christian faith and \nthe institutional church.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, he is not yet finished. Next he lays out ten reasons for \nremaining Christian. He argues that leaving Christianity hurts the \npeople who are trying to transform it into something better, that \nthey need our help rather than our abandonment. If we stay, he \ncontinues, we can fight for a better faith from the inside, providing \ncritique and energy for reformation. Also, rather than going it \nalone, we need the help of a global network of like-minded people to \nmake the world better. He notes that Christianity is still young, \nhistorically speaking, and needs more time to mature and improve.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcLaren also encourages readers to stay Christian because of our love \nfor Jesusand because all religions (like all humans) are imperfect. \nWhile he believes that traditional theism (that old Big White Guy on \na Throne in the Sky) has to go, he is convinced that Christianity \ncan evolve into something far more beautiful. If we stay, he says, we \ncan participate in that evolutionary movement toward a more \nenlightened faith. He offers several other reasons to stay Christian, \nand even more could have been includedsuch as the deeply felt human \nneed for the friendship, support, and belonging of Christian \ncommunity.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis section of the book will receive mixed reviews. Some will find \nMcLarens case for remaining Christian and staying connected to the \nchurch compelling; others will not. A good number of readers will \nlikely find his arguments for staying more aspirational than \nrealistic, concluding that the kind of Christianity he envisions is \nnot likely to happen, at least not in our lifetime. Those who do \nresonate with his reasons for staying may wish hed offered more \npragmatic strategies for implementing the kind of faith communities \nhe aspires toalthough the appendix provides a modest start.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs a clergyperson who communicates with religious skeptics on a \nregular basis, my instinct is that most people struggling with faith \nwill find the first section (leave) more convincing than the second \n(stay). However, for those on the fence who are looking for reasons \nto stay, the second section will prove helpful.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter laying out reasons to leave and stay, McLaren, in the third and \nfinal section of his book, begins by reframing the questions: Will \nwe stay Christian? and Will Christianity survive? are less important \nquestions than these: How shall we humans survive and thrive? What \ngood future shall we strive for? How can we align our energies with \nthe divine energy at work in our universe? In this section, McLaren \nlays out an agenda that humanists both Christian and secular will \nlikely agree on.\u0014\n\u0014\nMcLaren ends the book by calling for a radical redefinition of \nChristianity to match his humanist vision: I could not stay a \nChristian if my only option was the old way, the old way of white \nChristianity, the old way of patriarchal Christianity, the old way of \nTheo-Capitalistic Christianity, the old way of violent, exclusive, \nand authoritarian Christianity with its suppressed but real history \nof cruelty. Lest his readers begin to lose hope at this point, he \nmoves forward into a positive vision for Christian faith:\u0014\n\u0014\nI have found the permission and freedom to be a new kind of \nChristian, a progressive Christian, a contemplative-activist \nChristian, a Christian humanist, or whatever you want to call me. I \nam learning to be content whatever I am called, as long as I remain \npassionately eager to embody a way of being human that is \npro-justice, pro-kindness, and pro-humility.\u0014\n\u0014\nYou have that permission too, if you would like it.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMcLaren was once an evangelical preacher. So its only fitting that \nthe final paragraphs of his book have the feel of a revival meeting \naltar call.\u0014",

    "title": "DIVINE LIGHT ENNABLED ISAAC BACKUS TO SEE CHRIST",
    "words": "Divine Light Enabled Isaac Backus to See Christ's Perfect \nRighteousness\u0014\n \u0014\nISAAC BACKUS grew up in New England during the Great Awakeninga \nspiritual revival of the eighteenth century that turned many \nAmericans to Christ. Alarmed for his soul, seventeen-year-old Backus \nasked his pastor how he could be saved. His pastor was unsure. \nPowerless and frightened, Backus went about his business, praying \ndesperately that God would show him what to do. One morning, while he \nwas mowing a field, peace settled on him. I was enabled by divine \nlight to see the perfect righteousness of Christ and the freeness and \nriches of his grace. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt seemed a shame to Backus that anyone should be left in darkness \nabout salvation. He studied the Scripture, determined to be able to \nexplain salvation to others. When he was twenty-two he began to \npreach. Two years later a separate church in Titicut, Massachusetts \ninvited him to be their pastor. Separates had left the established \nCongregational church, considering its ministers spiritually dead. \nBackus accepted their call, pleading with the Lord to keep him from \nany snare or evil way. \u0014\n\u0014\nBackus led the Separates for about eight years. However, as he \nstudied Scripture, his views on baptism changed. The Separates \nbelieved baptism was for infants, but he became convinced it was only \nfor Christians old enough to understand what they were doing. \nAlthough he accepted differences on the issue, his congregation \nbecame hostile to him and they parted ways. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, 16 January 1756, Backus formed the first Baptist church \nin neighboring Middleboro. From this base he rode 1,200 miles a year \nas an evangelist throughout New England. The number of Baptists in \nthe region increased from 1,500 to 21,000, largely through his \nefforts. He also helped found Rhode Island College (Brown \nUniversity), Americas first Baptist college, and wrote a history of \nthe Baptists in New England. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn the eighteenth century, Massachusetts taxed all alike to support \nCongregational churches. Anyone who refused to pay the tax could be \nharassed. Authorities jailed some and seized the property of others. \nBackus gathered the testimony of hundreds who had suffered \nharassment. He testified, wrote letters, printed pamphlets, and spoke \nthroughout Massachusetts to make others aware of the problem. When he \nhimself refused to pay the church tax, authorities jailed him, \nreleasing him only because an anonymous benefactor stepped in and \npaid his tax. \u0014\n\u0014\nFor all his efforts, Backus did not live to see separation of church \nand state in Massachusetts. He died in 1806, but state funding of \nCongregational churches continued until 1833.\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "DIOCLETIAN, ROME'S CRUELIST PERSECUTOR OF CHRISTIANS",
    "words": "DIOCLETIAN became Roman emperor in 284. Under him, the empire \nexperienced its cruelest and most systematic persecution of \nChristians. To share the load of governance, he made Maximian his \nco-emperor and Galerius and Constantius junior emperors. To bind \nGalerius to himself, Diocletian gave him his daughter Valeria as a \nwife, allegedly a Christian. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 298 Diocletian required that all soldiers and imperial officials \nsacrifice to the heathen gods. Five years later, junior emperor \nGalerius, who was a cruel man and hated Christianity, met with his \nfather-in-law in Nicomedia and urged him to persecute Christians more \nharshly. \u0014\n\u0014\nAt first Diocletian resisted the idea. To persuade him, Galerius \nbrought learned pagans to the conference. Finally, when the oracle of \nthe sun god at Miletus agreed with Galerius, Diocletian gave in. On \nthis day 24 February 303 he decreed that all who would not serve the \ngods of Rome should lose their offices, have their property seized, \nand be demoted if they were persons of rank. He forbade Christians to \nmeet for worship, ordered their churches destroyed, and their holy \nbooks burned. As soon as this proclamation was posted, a Christian \ntore it down, and loudly reproached the emperors. For this, he was \nroasted alive over a slow fire, but died without uttering a groan. \nDown came the great church at Nicomedia, and the persecutors burned \nits books. \u0014\n\u0014\nBefore the end of the year, Diocletian issued two more proclamations \nagainst Christians and Maximian issued a fourth the following year. \nOne ordered the imprisonment of Christian teachers, filling the \nprisons with bishops and clergy. The next ordered that these \nprisoners either sacrifice to the pagan gods or be tortured. The \nthird directed that all Christians should be required to sacrifice on \npain of torture. \u0014\n\u0014\nChristians suffered terribly, especially in the eastern empire. Some \nwere thrown to wild beasts, others burned alive or roasted on \ngriddles. Some were skinned or had their flesh scraped from their \nbones. Others were crucified. A few were tied between trees that were \nbent so as to meet and, when the branches were released, the force \nripped these victims limb from limb. Eventually the Romans wearied of \nthis and set the remaining Christians to work in mines or gave them \nmenial jobs. In many instances, they gouged out an eye or maimed a \nhand or foot before sending the workers off. From this period come \nmany notable martyrs, including the young girl, Agnes of Rome. \u0014\n\u0014\nGalerius persisted in his cruelty until, at the end of eight years, \nhe found himself tormented with a disgusting bowel disease. Evidently \nhe saw this as a judgment from God, for he reprieved the Christians \nand implored their prayers. Despite his belated remorse, he died in \nagony. Maximian persecuted Christians just as savagely as Galerius, \nbut Constantius showed them kindness, and his son Constantine later \nlegalized Christianity and embraced the religion himself.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves\u0014",

    "title": "DID THE 10 PLAGUES REALLY HAPPEN? 3 THEORIES",
    "words": "Did the 10 Plagues of Egypt Really Happen? Here Are 3 Theories\u0014\nBY OLIVIA B. WAXMAN \u0014\n\u0014\n UPDATED: APRIL 13, 2022  | ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED: APRIL 18, 2019   \nTIME MAGAZINE\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Passover holiday begins  on the evening of April 15 in 2022 \n Jewish people around the world will celebrate by retelling the \nbiblical story of the Exodus from Egypt  including the 10 plagues \nthat God inflicted on the Ancient Egyptians.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs the Passover story tells it, after Pharaoh refuses Moses \nentreaties to let the enslaved Israelites go free, God sends a series \nof ten plagues to pressure the Egyptian ruler. Each time, Pharaoh \npromises to free the Israelites, but reverses his decision when the \nplague is lifted  until the last one. The plagues are: water turning \nto blood, frogs, lice, flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hail, \nlocusts, darkness and the killing of firstborn children.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe question of whether Bible stories can be linked to archaeological \ndiscoveries is one that has long fascinated scholars. The ten plagues \nare no exception, and over the years scientists have been curious \nabout whether the story of the plagues may have been based on some \nevent that can be proved to have happened. Here are three of the \nmajor theories to know.\u0014\n\u0014\nVolcanic Eruption\u0014\n\u0014\nThis theory argues that the plagues were really the fallout of \nvolcanic eruption on the island of Santorini in the south of Greece \naround 1620-1600 BCE. Microbiologist Siro Trevisanato, author of The \nPlagues of Egypt: Archaeology, History and Science Look at the Bible, \nargues that ancient Egyptian medical texts support this idea.\u0014\n\u0014\nWinds would have carried the volcanic ash to Egypt at some point over \nthe summer, and the toxic acids in the volcanic ash would have \nincluded the mineral cinnabar, which could have been capable of \nturning a river a blood-like red color, Trevisanato holds. The \naccumulated acidity in the water would have caused frogs to leap out \nand search for clean water. Insects would have burrowed eggs in the \nbodies of dead animals and human survivors, which generated larvae \nand then adult insects. Then, the volcanic ash in the atmosphere \nwould have affected the weather, with acid rain landing on peoples \nskin, which in turn caused boils. The grass would have been \ncontaminated, poisoning the animals that ate it. The humidity from \nthe rain and the subsequent hail would have created optimal \nconditions for locusts to thrive. Volcanic eruptions could also \nexplain the several days of darkness  which means nine plagues are \naccounted for.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrevisanato also found an ancient Egyptian account of the children of \naristocrats lying dead in public and archaeological data matching the \naccount. He believes that, amid all this destruction, firstborn \nchildren could have been sacrificed out of desperation, in the hopes \nthat such a meaningful sacrifice would lead their gods to stop \npunishing them.\u0014\n\u0014\nRed Algae\u0014\n\u0014\nThis theory  put forth by scientists like John S. Marr, an \nepidemiologist who wrote a 1996 journal article featured in the New \nYork Times  argues that red algae could have sucked oxygen out of \nEgypts waterways, killed the fish and turned the water red. Just as \nin the volcano theory, frogs then leapt out looking for food, and \ndied. Without frogs to eat the insects, the pests proliferated and \nfeasted on corpses, a feeding frenzy for flies and locusts. The paper \nargued that the lice could have been a type of insect called \nculicoides, which can carry two diseases that could explain the \nlivestock deaths: African horse sickness and Bluetongue. The boils on \nhumans could have been caused by glanders, an airborne bacterial \ndisease spread by flies or tainted meat.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn this theory the darkness is coincidentally caused by a sandstorm. \nThe darkness would have left the crops  well, whatever crops were \nleft after the other problems  moldy, and the mold could have \nproduced airborne toxins that might explain widespread childhood \ndeath.\u0014\n\u0014\nClimate Change\u0014\nThis addendum to the algae theory points out that, for red algae to \nflourish in the first place, there needs to be slow, sludgy, warm \nwater. In 2010, research on stalagmites elongated mineral deposits \nthat form out of calcium in precipitation  suggested that there had \nbeen a dry period towards the end of the rule of Pharaoh Ramses II. \nThat change would have dried up the Nile and significantly slowed \ndown the flow of water, according to paleoclimatologist Augusto \nMangini. These conditions are ripe for the growth of the bacterium \nOscillatoria rubescens, more colloquially, Burgundy Blood algae, \naccording to biologist Stephan Pflugmacher.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut ask someone whos celebrating Passover, and theyre likely to say \nthat the question of whether scientists can prove the plagues really \nhappened in ancient history is irrelevant to the holiday.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo me it doesnt matter whether scientists are able to find a \nhistorical basis for something that happened around 3,500 years ago. \nThe central message is that God brought the plagues on Egypt in order \nto free the Israelite slaves, says Jerusalem-based Rabbi Yonatan \nNeril. God was teaching the ancient Egyptians a lesson about justice, \nhe says, and when they refused to do the right thing and free the \nIsraelites, they suffered the consequences.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, Neril  as the co-founder and executive director of the \nInterfaith Center for Sustainable Development  does say that science \nhas a key role to play in how the story of the plagues is told and \nreceived today. Thats because he sees another lesson in it, one for \nthe era of man-made climate change. The pollution of Ancient Egypts \nwater echoes water-pollution and water-scarcity issues today. Frogs, \nwith their very sensitive skin, are an indicator species, meaning \nthat their suffering is seen by scientists as a marker of a larger \nimbalance in society around them. And to Neril, the parallels dont \nstop there.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the \nform of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were \nreluctant to change, he says. Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, \nhave replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. Theres \na Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something thats not \nright.\u0014\n\u0014\nFRS: These are interesting prognostications, but it is still true \nthat the overwhelming number of archeologists today do not believe \nthat the Exodus, as it is described in the book of Exodus, is \nhistorically accurate. It is nevertheless a meaningful part of the \nstory of Judaism.\u0014",

Here are the key points about \ndividend yield:\u0014\n\u0014\nCalculation: The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual \ndividends per share by the price per share. Mathematically, it can be \nrepresented as: [ \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Annual \nDividends per Share}}{\\text{Price per Share}} ]\u0014\n\u0014\nInterpretation:\u0014\n\u0014\nA higher dividend yield indicates that a company pays a larger \nportion of its profits as dividends.\u0014\nMature companies are more likely to pay dividends.\u0014\n\u0014\nSectors such as utilities and consumer staples often have relatively \nhigher dividend yields.\u0014\n\u0014\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnerships \n(MLPs), and business development companies (BDCs) tend to pay \nhigher-than-average dividends, but these dividends are taxed at a \nhigher rate.\u0014\n\u0014\nConsiderations:\u0014\n\u0014\nBe cautious: A high dividend yield doesnt always mean an attractive \ninvestment opportunity. Sometimes, a declining stock price can \nartificially inflate the yield.\u0014\n\u0014\nTechnology stocks typically have lower dividend yields.\u0014\n\u0014\nExample: As of June 2023, Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), an \nestablished telecommunications equipment manufacturer, had a trailing \ntwelve months (TTM) dividend of $3.20.

    "words": "DEMONS, LIARS, AND MINISTERS AT THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS\u0014\n \u0014\nIN JANUARY 1692, two children in Salem, Massachusetts, developed \nconvulsions and uncontrollable screaming. Doctor William Griggs found \nnothing physically wrong and suggested bewitchment was at work. Once \nhis premise was accepted, five other local girls exhibited similar \nsymptoms. Late in February, authorities arrested three women for \nwitchcraft, based in part on spectral evidence (dreams and visions).\u0014\n\u0014\nUnsure how to proceed, Salems judges contacted nearby ministers. \nTwelve replied in a letter dated on this day, 15 June 1692. While \nthey supported detection of witches, they cautioned that satanic \ntestimony should not be accepted and urged great tenderness in \ncases where the accused had led otherwise blameless lives. They \nrecommended as little public spectacle as possible and avoidance of \nunlawful tests. Spectral evidence, they said, was insufficient by \nitself for conviction.\u0014\n\u0014\n[C]onvictions whereupon persons may be condemned as guilty of \nwitchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable than barely the \naccused persons being represented by a spectre unto the afflicted, \ninasmuch as it is an undoubted and notorious thing that a demon may \nby Gods permission appear even to ill purposes, in the shape of an \ninnocent, yea, and a virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made \nin the sufferers, by a look or touch of the accused, to be an \ninfallible evidence of guilt, but frequently liable to be abused by \nthe devils legerdemains.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe outbreak would quickly end, they surmised, if the devils \ntestimony (that is, things told by the devil to the bewitched) was \nnot accepted. Yet they encouraged continued prosecutions.\u0014\n\u0014\nCotton Mather was the lead author of this letter. Nearing thirty \nyears of age, he was interested in scientific questions and had \ninvestigated earlier bewitchments. He had even taken several \nbewitched children into his own home where they were cured. His \nwritings showed credulity but also compassion both for those who \nclaimed witch powers and their supposed victims.\u0014\n\u0014\nHowever, the Salem judges used tortures to obtain confessions. (A \ncommon technique was to bind the accused for twenty-four hours in a \ncontorted posture.) They posed questions worded so that whether the \naccused answered either yes or no they implicated themselves. \nHearsay, conjecture, play-acting by the bewitched, past quarrels, \nspectral evidence, unaccountable accidents, tests such as reciting \nthe Lords Prayer, and admissions extracted through promises of \nreduced sentences were accepted as evidence. \u0014\n\u0014\nNot surprisingly lies and conjectures became proof of guilt. \nContemporaries such as Thomas Brattle and Robert Calef denounced the \nprocedures. Cotton Mathers father, Increase Mather, said it would be \nbetter ten witches escaped than that one innocent person be \ncondemned. Later, when the mania had died down, several witnesses \nretracted their testimony and some judges acknowledged they had acted \nwrongly.

    "words": "Did God intervene to save Trumps life?\u0014\nUnderneath this question lies layer upon layer of ever more troubling \ntheological questions.\u0014\nby Brandon Ambrosino  July 18, 2024\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nHow to do the theology of a presidential assassination attempt:\u0014\n1.\tBelieve that God is all powerful, is in control of everything that \nhappens, and takes a special interest in US politics.\u0014\n2.\tBelieve that God can override free will whenever God wants to or \nwhenever its in the divine interest to do so, like when it concerns \nUS politics.\u0014\n3.\tBelieve that God has a special interest in the would-be target of \nan assassination attempt becoming the next president of the United \nStates.\u0014\n4.\tBelieve that God is capable of intervening in human affairs in a \nway that can determine the next president of the United States while \nsimultaneously respecting the free will of the voters.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe could keep climbing these steps, stopping when we no longer feel \nthe need to keep going, when we feel that our theological questions \nhave been sufficiently answered. But theres another possibility: we \nmight think about climbing the steps in the other direction, down to \nthe basement. Be warned, though. Its creepy down there, and dark, \nand very cold. Still, the dank, ominous basementthe structure that \nupholds the theological edifice we enjoy occupyingis where some of \nthe best theology is done.\u0014\n\u0014\nIm using the metaphor of a basement to call attention to something \nthat every theology teacher knows well: underneath the theological \nquestions that we dont know how to answer are other theological \nquestions that we dont even know how to ask.\u0014\n\u0014\nSo, for instance, some people might want to know how exactly God was \nable to save former President Trumps life. Did God send a wind gust \nto move the bullet a smidge to the left? Deploy a guardian angel to \ncover most of Trumps head? Cause the shooter to blink at just the \nright moment?\u0014\n\u0014\nThese questions seem acceptable to ask in polite Christian company. \nBut a lot of unasked questions lurk underneath these ones. For \nexample, when God moved Trumps head out of the way of the shooters \nbullet, did God know that the bullet would end up striking a \nfirefighter? Did God have no way to save Trumps life while also \nprotecting everyone elses life that day? Did God engage a version of \nthe trolley dilemma and conclude that it was more ethical to save a \nformer president than a rally attendee?\u0014\n\u0014\nRelated to these questions are even more troubling ones. If God is \ncapable of saving someone from gun violence, then what is God doing \nwhen a shooter breaks into an elementary school? If God can perform \nlife-saving miracles, why is any child anywhere dying of leukemia?\u0014\n\u0014\nThen there are the more trivial questions that are implicated in the \noriginal line of questioning: Is Gods assassination prevention a \nstamp of approval on the Republican candidate? In the event that a \nsimilar attempt is made on a Democratic candidate, will God \nintervene? I thought God sent the rain down on the just and unjust \nalike. Does God shield only conservatives from bullets? But then why \nnot protect the presumably Republican voter who was killed by the \nshooter?\u0014\n\u0014\nLast weekends assassination attempt has left us with questions, \nfears, rage, and wounds. And it is precisely at this intersection \nwhere theology is called upon to get to work. Not so much to offer \nanswers as to help us uncover some of the deep, disturbing questions \nthat have stymied theologians for millennia.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor me, the work of Christian theology always begins underground, in \na dark, musty tomb, with the body of a man whose death God didnt \nprevent. Yes, sure, the resurrection and all thattheres no \nChristianity without it! But the resurrection doesnt undo what \nprecedes it. What is resurrected is a murdered body, and that body \nwas murdered because God didnt prevent it from being murdered.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Documents/Did God Intervene to Save Trump's \nLife?\u0014",

They had not been doing \nwell. Times were hard; there was little money for common folk to come \nto hear the minstrels, even though their fee was small. Attendance \nhad been falling off, so early one evening the group met to discuss \ntheir plight. 'I see no reason for opening tonight,' one said. 'To \nmake things even worse than they may have been, it is starting to \nsnow. Who will venture out on a night like this?' 'I agree,' another \ndisheartened singer said. 'Last night we performed for just a \nhandful. Fewer will come tonight. Why not give back their meager fees \nand cancel the concert?

They should not be punished with less \nthan the best we can give.' Heartened by his words, the minstrels \nwent ahead with their show. They never performed better. When the \nshow was over and the small audience gone, the old man called his \ntroupe to him. In his hand was a note, handed to him by one of the \naudience just before the doors closed behind him. 'Listen to this, my \nfriends!' Something electrifying in his tone of voice made them turn \nto him in anticipation. Slowly the old man read: 'Thank you for a \nbeautiful performance.'

    "words": "The tests of canonicity (the selection of which books were to be \nincluded in the Holy Bible) included: (1) the book had to have a \nhistory of being used in Christian worship; (2) the book had to be \nwritten by an apostle, or affirmed by an apostle; and (3) the book \nhad to have evidenced power in the lives of helievers. Justin Martyr, \nTheophilus, Victorinus, and Tatian are some of the early believers \nwho became Christians simply by reading the New Testament books.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Muratorian Canon is named br its discoverer, L. A. Muratori, who \nfirst published it in 1740. A fascinating look into the early church, \nit reveals that by the year 190, Christians had developed a New \nTestament and put it alongside the Jewish Scripturesthe former the \nfttlfillment of the latter. It contains in order: Matthew, Mark, \nLuke, John, Acts, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, \nColossians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Romans, Philemon, \nTitus, 1 and 2 Timothy, the Apocalypse of John (Revelation), the \nApocalypse of Peter, and the Wisdom of Solomon.\u0014\n\u0014\n.\tSome books of Scripture faced challenges. Christians in the West \ndidii't like Hebrews, while those in the East opposed Revelation. \nChurch historian Eusebius, writing in the fourth century, noted that \nJames, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation were the only \nhooks \"spoken against.\" Martin Luther would challenge the Book of \nJames in the sixteenth century, calling it \"an epistle of straw.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\tThe Apocrypha, a collection of books associated with the ancient \nchurch, was accepted as part of the Bible by Augustine in the late \nfourth century. Because much of Roman Catholic theology is based on \nthe writings of Augustine, Catholics still accept the Apocrypha as \npart of the Word of God. However, neither the Jews nor Christians in \nPalestine ever accepted it as Scripture. Protestants during the \nReformation rejected it as part of the canon, and it no longer \nappears in Protestant Bibles.\u0014\n\u0014\n.\tThe allegorical method of interpretation went to extreme lengths to \ntry to make the Old Testament into a Christian book.

    "title": "DESCENDED INTO HELL--ALWAYS PART OF THE CREED?",
    "words": "Was the phrase \"he descended into hell\" always part of the Apostles' \nCreed, or was it introduced later? And how have Christians \ninterpreted it over time?\u0014\n\u0014\nBruno\u0014\nJesus' purported descent into hell has long been the subject of \ndisagreement between Christians. Its presence in the Apostles' Creed \npoints to a long-standing, lively, and ultimately inconclusive \ndiscussion on the theme of Jesus' post-crucifixion activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians first recited the Creed not as a statement of belief, but \nas a baptismal confession. Much as liturgical churches now pose \nquestions in confirmation ceremonies, the ancient churches asked \ncandidates for baptism three questions about the Trinity. From this \ncame the Apostles' \"Symbol\" or \"sign\" identifying with the community \nin baptismand eventually the Creed in its current wording.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Creed, then, was not set from its beginning, but fluid. The \noldest extant version comes from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (ca. A.D. \n337), and it does not contain the clause about descending into hell. \nScholars call this version \"The Old Roman Form\"the earliest creed of \nthe Roman church.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently the clause first appeared in the East with Sirmium's \nfourth formula in 359also called the \"Dated Creed\" though the \nEastern church rejected it as tinged with Arianism. The first mention \nof the descent in the West occurs in the writings of Rufinus of \nAquileia, who included it in his baptismal creed around 400. Over \ntime, the Latin church appropriated it as well, officially \nintegrating it into the Creed in 750.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have long been troubled over what the descent actually \nmeans. Augustine, for example, believed Christ literally descended \ninto hell. But in his letter to Evodius, he admits several \nuncertainties over the meaning of 1 Peter 3:19, which says that Jesus \npreached to those \"spirits in prison\" who had been disobedient in \nNoah's day. If \"prison\" equals \"hell,\" then why, Augustine wonders, \nshould these people be singled out for such an honor, and who, if \nanyone, did Christ save with his preaching in hell? Further, Jesus \ncould not have come only to take the \"righteous men\" from hell, for \nwere they not already separated from the condemned, as demonstrated \nin the story of the beggar Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16? \nAugustine does not attempt to resolve the matter, but openly admits \nhis perplexity.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies later, Thomas Aquinas resolved Augustine's problem by \nsaying Christ descended to two placeshell and purgatoryand that his \npurpose in each was different. In hell, he put unbelievers to shame, \nwhile in purgatory, he gave sinners hope for glory and the righteous \ndeliverance. But this explanation did not satisfy all. Martin Luther, \nthough he believed Christ descended to hell, would offer no clear cut \nexplanation for the event. John Calvin went so far as to describe the \ndescent as symbolic, pointing to Christ's suffering at Gethsemane and \nthe cross.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd the debate continued. Nineteenth-century church historian Philip \nSchaff deemed the translation \"descended into hell\" unfortunate and \nmisleading. \"We do not know whether Christ was in hell,\" he wrote, \n\"but we do know from His own lips that He was in Paradise between His \ndeath and resurrection. The term Hades is much more comprehensive \nthan Hell (Gehenna) which is confined to the state of the lost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly there are unacceptable readings, such as preacher Kenneth \nCopeland's claim that it was Jesus' descent to hell, not his death on \nthe cross, that redeemed sinners. But most proposed solutions have \nlittle bearing on the essentials of Christian faith. Such puzzles \nwill always be with us, providing fodder for speculation and debate, \nbut admitting of no definitive solution this side of heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n* For a concise overview of the historic development of the Creed and \nthe doctrine of the descent, look up \"Apostle's Creed\" and \"Harrowing \nof Hell\" in the Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, 2nd ed.(Garland, \n1997). Also, consult the entry \"Descent into Hell\" in the \nEncyclopedia of the Early Church (Oxford University Press, 1992).\u0014\n\u0014\n* Read Augustine's letter to Evodius online and Aquinas' reflections.\u0014\n* To listen in on the current debate, check out two sites, one \nfavorable to the descent: and one more skeptical.\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Gertz is editorial coordinator for Christian History\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014\n\\Click here for reprint information on Christian History.\u0014",

    "title": "DEFINING RELIGION AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM",
    "words": "\"Defining Religion Narrowly Compromises Religious Freedom\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBy K. Hollyn Hollman\u0014\n\u0014\nReligion comes in many different forms. We know that within our \ndenomination - and even within our congregations - numerous \ndifferences of belief exist among those identifying themselves as \nBaptists. Venture beyond this community, of course, and the \ndiversity of religious beliefs only multiplies. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is easy to defend religious liberty for one's own faith and maybe \neven for those with whom one shares some general doctrines and \ntraditions. But does religious liberty reach to religions that \nembrace a pantheon of deities or those that do not affirm the \nexistence of God at all? In a word, the answer is yes. A recent \ncontroversy in Texas reminds us that excessively narrow definitions \nof religion threaten religious liberty. \u0014\n\u0014\nChurches and other religious entities often qualify for broad \nexemptions under federal and state tax laws. In many ways, they are \ntreated like other not-for-profit organizations. One of the \nrequirements for this tax-exempt status is that an organization is \ncreated for charitable purposes, including religious purposes. This \ntest in most cases is easily met. After all, who wants the government \nto make in-depth inquiries into religious beliefs and practices? \u0014\n\u0014\nIn an important departure from this permissive approach, the Texas \ncomptroller's office recently made headlines when it denied tax \nexemptions for two organizations after finding that the applicants \ndid not have a clearly defined system of belief in God, gods, or a \nhigher power. In one case, the comptroller refused tax-exempt status \nfor the Ethical Society of Austin; in another, the same office denied \nan exemption for a Unitarian Universalist Church. In both cases, the \ncomptroller's decisions were eventually reversed, either through \ncourt order or after voluntary reconsideration. Nevertheless, the \nTexas cases underscore the dangers of restrictive definitions of \nreligion by government authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nReligious liberty requires government not to interfere with the \nreligious choices of individuals. In fact, the protection of \nreligious liberty for all forbids the government from even endorsing \nreligion. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in the 1989 Allegheny \nCounty case, The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits \ngovernment from appearing to take a position on questions of \nreligious belief. This means that the government may not penalize \nunpopular answers to religious questions. Questions about the \nexistence and nature of God certainly qualify as religious inquiries \nthat are inappropriate for government authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the main reasons for protecting religious liberty is to allow \npeople with fundamentally different beliefs to live together in \npeace. Stark differences in views exist within most religious groups \nas well as among them. To protect religious liberty for all, the law \nshould neither set up a hierarchy of religious beliefs nor should it \ndiscriminate against those with minority views and different concepts \nof God.\u0014",

Or at least that is what early \ncritics thought.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristianity faced opposition from its inception. Its founder was \nkilled, and its first major missionaries were martyred. But as \nChristianity spread beyond Judea, the nature of the criticisms \nchanged. Rather than opposing Jesus' teachings, most attacks against \nChristianity arose from ignorance and fear. Frequently critics had \nlittle, if any, firsthand experience with Christians, their worship, \nor their beliefs. So for the first two centuries, at least, attacks \ntended to restate stereotypes, stock objections, and misconceptions \ncirculating throughout the pagan world.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we examine the main charges and how Christians responded, we'll \ndiscover why Christianity could not easily be dismissed in the \nancient world.\u0014\n\"Deadly superstition\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn his Lives of the Caesars, Suetonius (a Roman writer and secretary \nto Emperor Hadrian) was one of the first pagan writers to mention \nChristianity. But the context was hardly positive: believers are \nmentioned only as \"a class of men given to a new and mischievous \nsuperstition.\" This charge of superstition was perhaps the most \nserious, and most common, pagan accusation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe comment was repeated by Tacitus, a Roman historian, in his \naccount of the burning of Rome. He acknowledged that Nero fabricated \nthe accusations that Christians started the fire, but he held little \nsympathy for the \"notoriously depraved\" believers.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Their originator, Christ, had been executed in Tiberius's reign by \nthe governor of Judea, Pontius\u0014",

    "title": "DILLINGER: THE UNTOLD STORY-- A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "\u0014\nFrom Publishers Weekly\u0014\nThis is one of the most unusual books in the annals of modern \ntrue-crime writing, for the bulk of the text was written 60 years ago \nand never before published. In 1933, Girardin, a Chicago ad man, \npersuaded Louis Piquett, who had served as John Dillinger's lawyer, \nto collaborate on a series of newspaper articles, which were \nsyndicated in the Hearst newspapers, and on a book-length biography \nof Dillinger, who was gunned down by the police in Chicago in 1934 at \nthe age of 31. In 1989, Playboy contributing editor Helmer met \nGirardin and together they reworked the unpublished biography, until \nGirardin died in 1990. Helmer has been faithful to the florid style \nof the original, which retains much of the spirit of the Depression \nera, when many regarded bankers as evil and bank robbers were \ncelebrated in the media. Piquette and Girardin contend that a number \nof Dillinger's robberies were prearranged with the banks. Helmer's \ncopious and informative notes reflect his further research, based on \nsources not available to Girardin. The book constitutes a significant \naddition to Americana. Photos not seen by PW .\u0014\nCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Library Journal\u0014\nJohn Dillinger, Indiana's most infamous criminal, was gunned down by \npolice in Chicago in 1934. His brief but violent bank-robbing and \njail-breaking spree captured headlines and enhanced the FBI's \ncrime-fighting image. By chance, Helmer, an editor at Playboy \nmagazine and a crime buff, discovered Girardin's contemporary \nmanuscript, an expansion of articles he sold to the Hearst press \nduring the 1930s. It was based on interviews with Dillinger's lawyer, \nhimself convicted in the case and thus a shaky source. Whatever its \ndegree of accuracy, the mass of detail, largely favorable to \nDillinger, is likely to benumb the general reader. The book does \ncapture the flavor of the 1930s, and Helmer's extensive commentary \nand notes will appeal to those with a special interest in the subject.\u0014\nGregor A. Preston, Univ. of California Lib., Davis\u0014\nCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Booklist\u0014\nIt will be 60 years since John Dillinger, labeled \"Public Enemy \nNumber One,\" was gunned down by federal and local agents after being \npointed out by the misnamed \"woman in red\" outside the Biograph \nTheatre in Chicago on July 22, 1934. For those familiar with the \nDillinger saga and those who aren't, this book brings new light to \nthe outlaw's story from two men who knew him best during the critical \nlast few months, defense attorney Louis Piquett and legal \ninvestigator Arthur O'Leary. Each befriended Dillinger shortly before \nthe bandit broke out of a Crown Point, Indiana, jail with a handmade \nwooden gun and escaped in a stolen car across the Indiana-Illinois \nborder, thus bringing the FBI into the case. The contrasts between \ncrooks and good guys alike are fascinating: the amiable, \ndevil-may-care Dillinger offsets his tougher, more volatile \nconfederates Homer Van Meter and \"Baby Face\" Nelson, both of whom \nalso meet violent ends; and the hardworking, honest G-man, Melvin \nPurvis, clashes constantly with the fledgling FBI's power-hungry \ndirector, J. Edgar Hoover. Joe Collins\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom Kirkus Reviews\u0014\nInitially written (but never published) in the 1930s, this biography \nof notorious gangster John Dillinger has the authentic flavor of the \nera, bolstered by its coauthor's firsthand contact with some of the \nleading players. Girardin penned his manuscript not long after \nDillinger was shot dead by the FBI at the Biograph Theatre on North \nLincoln Avenue in Chicago on July 22, 1934. An advertising man, he \nhad had a chance meeting with Dillinger's dubious lawyer, one Louis \nPiquett, and had been prompted to follow the outlaw's story. In 1990, \njust before he died, he collaborated with William Helmer (The Gun \nThat Made the Twenties Roar, 1969) to produce the present text. \nDillinger was the most charismatic and charming of the '20s-era \ngangsters, with none of the cold-blooded ruthlessness of Al Capone or \nBaby Face Nelson. The centerpiece of the book is an account of \nDillinger's first and most spectacular jailbreak, from a small prison \nin Arizona, with a wooden gun smuggled in by one of his associates \n(Piquett himself was suspected). The escape was a national sensation, \nand Piquett, who had a sharp eye for any opportunity, became the \n``most famous lawyer in America'' (in his own words). The authors \nshed interesting light on crime detection in the US and its relative \nbackwardness as late as the 1920s. Before the emergence of the FBI, \nthe looseness of national policing made it relatively easy for \noutlaws to roam the country; the creation of this agency in \nessentially its contemporary form was precisely what stopped \nDillinger in his tracks. As Hoover said, the outlaw had two major \nweaknesses: sex and ``a flair for the spectacular.'' He was betrayed \nby a woman who was linked to one of his police killers, and he did \nindeed die spectacularly. Thousands of people filed past the Biograph \nTheatre to dip handkerchiefs in his blood. Eminently revealing and \nenjoyable. -- Copyright 1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights \nreserved.\u0014",

    "title": "DANGEROUS MEDITATIONS",
    "words": "Dangerous Meditations\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat harm is there in achieving a higher state of consciousness \nthrough meditation?\u0014\nBy Douglas Groothuis    10/20/2004\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nOverstressed Americans are increasingly turning to various forms of \nEastern meditation, particularly yoga, in search of relaxation and \nspirituality. Underlying these meditative practices, however, is a \nworldview in conflict with biblical spiritualitythough many \nChristians are (unwisely) practicing yoga.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Eastern religions teach that the source of salvation is found \nwithin, and that the fundamental human problem is not sin against a \nholy God but ignorance of our true condition. These worldviews \nadvocate meditation and \"higher forms of consciousness\" as a way to \ndiscover a secret inner divinity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nYoga, deeply rooted in Hinduism, essentially means to be \"yoked\" with \nthe divine. Yogic postures, breathing, and chanting were originally \ndesigned not to bring better physical health and well-being (Western \nmarketing to the contrary), but a sense of oneness with Brahmanthe \nHindu word for the absolute being that pervades all things. This is \npantheism (all is divine), not Christianity.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nTranscendental Meditation is a veiled form of Hindu yoga, though it \nclaims to be a religiously neutral method of relaxation and \nrejuvenation. Initiates to TM receive a mantra (Hindu holy word) to \nrepeat while sitting in yogic postures and engaging in yogic \nbreathing. The goal is to find God within their own beings, since God \n(Brahman) and the self (Atman) are really one.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDifferences in various forms of Eastern meditation aside, they all \naim at a supposedly \"higher\" or \"altered\" state of consciousness. \nMeditation guides claim that normal consciousness obscures sacred \nrealities. Therefore, meditation is practiced in order to suspend \nrational patterns of thought.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThis helps explain why so many Eastern mystics claim that divine \nrealities are utterly beyond words, thought, and personality. In \norder to find \"enlightenment,\" one must extinguish one's critical \ncapacitiessomething the Bible never calls us to do (Rom. 12:1-2). In \nfact, suspending our critical capacities through meditation opens the \nsoul to deception and even to spiritual bondage.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biblical worldview is completely at odds with the pantheistic \nconcepts driving Eastern meditation. We are not one with an \nimpersonal absolute being that is called \"God.\" Rather, we are \nestranged from the true personal God because of our \"true moral \nguilt,\" as Francis Schaeffer says.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nNo amount of chanting, breathing, visualizing, or physical \ncontortions will melt away the sin that separates us from the Lord of \nthe cosmoshowever \"peaceful\" these practices may feel. Moreover, \nPaul warns that \"Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light\" (2 \nCor. 11:14). \"Pleasant\" experiences may be portals to peril. Even \nyoga teachers warn that yoga may open one up to spiritual and \nphysical maladies.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe answer to our plight is not found in some \"higher level of \nconsciousness\" (really a deceptive state of mind), but in placing our \nfaith in the unmatched achievements of Jesus Christ on our behalf. If \nit were possible to find enlightenment within, God would not have \nsent \"his one and only Son\" (John 3:16) to die on the Cross for our \nsins in order to give us new life and hope for eternity through \nChrist's resurrection. We cannot raise ourselves from the dead.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe biblical concept of prayer assumes that rational and meaningful \ncommunication between God and humans is possible. There is no summons \nto suspend rational judgment even when prayer through the Holy Spirit \nis \"with groans that words cannot express\" (Rom. 8:26). Nor should we \nrepeat words meaninglessly to induce a trance (Matt. 6:7).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Bible, meditation always means pondering God's revealed truths \nand reflecting on how they pertain to us. David revels in the \nrichness of God's law throughout Psalm 119. He encourages us to \nmeditate on it: \"I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways. \nI delight in your decrees; I will not neglect your word\" (Ps. \n119:15-16). Since all Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16), all of \nit is profitable for meditation in the biblical sense.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nDouglas Groothuis is professor of philosophy at Denver Seminary and \nthe author of several books, including Unmasking the New Age and \nConfronting the New Age.\u0014\nCopyright  2004 Christianity Today.

The \nnational press pilloried Birmingham for weeks afterward, calling the \ncity the American hotbed of anti-Catholic fanaticism, where the \nmurder of a priest had been added to the achievements of bigotry.\u0014\n \u0014\nA decade later Alabamas U.S. Sen. J. Thomas Heflin gained national \nnotoriety for his attacks on the Knights of Columbus and Catholics in \ngeneral (all in the name of Christ and conservative Protestant \nChristianity).\u0014\n \u0014\nAgain the state became a national laughing stock. A Maryland senator \ndismissed Heflins views as the flimsiest bubble that ever found \nlodgement in an empty head. The New York Sun added: The feeling of \nmost Americans toward Heflin is one of undescribable loathing.\u0014\n \u0014\nThree decades later it was a new trinity of demagogues and a \ndifferent issue that besmirched the states reputation. Gov. George \nC. Wallace, Selmas sheriff James G. Clark Jr. and Birminghams \npolice commissioner Eugene Bull Connor represented Alabama to a \nnational audience, all in the name of lily-white Christianity.\u0014\n \u0014\nAccusing Birminghams African Americans of being impudent, unruly, \narrogant, law breaking, violent, and insolent, Connor turned a \nthriving metropolis that in the 1950s contained only 15,000 less \npeople than Atlanta into a backwater city smaller than Atlanta by a \nquarter-million people in 1970.\u0014\nThe 2004 election cycle has supplied Alabama yet another generation \nof demagogues led by Roy Moore, Tom Parker and John Giles. With a \nvote for Amendment 2 that would have removed racism from Alabamas \nconstitution, the state had the opportunity to close the door on a \nwretched past and begin the 21st century with a new message and a \nclean image. Without Moore, Parker, Giles and their lesser Republican \nhenchmen railing against it, Alabamians would have done just that.\u0014\n\u0014\n One part of that racism was Amendment 111, passed in 1956 as a piece \nof last-ditch segregationist legislation. That amendment even revoked \nthe obligation of Alabama to educate its children. Let those who \ncould afford education send their children to private schools, the \nlogic went, and let black children grow up ignorant.\u0014\n\u0014\nEnter messengers Moore, Parker, Giles and their cohorts. Passing \nAmendment 2 (which would have repealed that 1956 law) would harm \nhome-schoolers, lead to free adult education, prepare the way for \nfederal or state courts to increase taxes for schools, they harangued.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat lots of uninformed Alabamians believed such rubbish is obvious. \nThat lots of white racists still live between the Chattahoochee and \nthe Tombigbee rivers is equally obvious. That many Alabamians would \nrather see their children half-educated and woefully unprepared for \nthe modern economy rather than pay more taxes is slowly dawning on \nmore and more of us. That many citizens care more about the future of \nmiddle-class children than about the children of poor people is also \napparent. And to be fair, many progressive voters now believe, with \nconsiderable evidence in their favor, that the only way to force a \nnew constitution is to vote down every amendment to the current one.\u0014\n \u0014\nBut voters didnt decide the fate of Amendment 2 based on their \ncareful reading and reflective thought about a vague 1956 law. They \nwere misinformed and demagogued by Roy Moore, Tom Parker and John \nGiles.\u0014\n \u0014\nThese three men (like Catts, Heflin, Wallace, Clark, and Connor \nbefore them) are not stupid. They know full well the racist origins \nof the 1956 law. They know that no clean new amendment in 2005 can \nleave the 1956 law intact and still remove racism from our \nconstitution. They know that a circuit court judge in 1993 struck \ndown the amendment they cherish. They know the state Supreme Court \ntwice upheld that ruling. They know that the state recently passed an \namendment requiring that any court-authorized tax increase be \nreferred to a statewide referendum so no judge can unilaterally raise \ntaxes. And they know that the consequence of their demagoguery will \nbe a national campaign of ridicule unparalleled in recent Alabama \nhistory.\u0014\n\u0014\nShortly after the Nov. 2 election, a professor in California called \nthe vote absolutely astonishing, the kind of thing people use in \nuniversity classes to present the backwardness of the state.\u0014\nNorth Carolinas Charlotte Observer pondered why Alabama could not \nmuster enough votes to obliterate antiquated and unenforceable Jim \nCrow laws. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorialized that for \nreasons Northerners could not fathom Alabama is still wrestling with \nghosts other parts of the South exorcised decades ago.\u0014\n\u0014\n CNN Headline News led a segment on Sunday night, Nov. 28, with a \nstory about Alabama voters refusing to take racism out of their \nconstitution. The Washington Post led its front-page that day with \nthe same story. The following evening, the nationally syndicated Bev \nSmith talk radio show spent two hours informing Americans about \nAlabamas backward state constitution and its racist voters.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Moore, Parker, Giles and their allies celebrate their Nov. 2 \nvictory, they might ponder a few additional matters:\u0014\n\u0014\n--Alabamas 2000 income growth trailed in 50th place among all states;\u0014\n\u0014\n--Alabamas low per-capita income and loss of 100,000 manufacturing \njobs during the past 15 years;\u0014\n\u0014\n--The decline from 22nd largest population in 1990 to 23rd in 2000;\u0014\n\u0014\n--The state lags behind all Southern states other than Louisiana in \npopulation growth;\u0014\n\u0014\n--The problems UAB medical center and the states universities have \nrecruiting and retaining top researchers;\u0014\n\u0014\n--Frequent anecdotes from economic recruiters about the way the \nstates poverty, inadequate schools and blemished reputation \ncomplicate attracting new businesses and creating new jobs.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey might even ponder what message it sends the rest of the world \nwhen demagogues boast that Alabama has no obligation to its own \nchildren.\u0014\n\u0014\n When your newly graduated son or daughter sadly informs you that \ndespite love for family, kin and community they have decided to \nstrike out for greener pastures elsewhere, blame Roy Moore, Tom \nParker, John Giles, et al. They have been accused of racism. I am \nconvinced they are innocent of that charge. But they have proven \nthemselves (all in the name of Christ) guilty of demagoguery, which \nis alive and thriving in the Heart of Dixie.\u0014\n\u0014\n \u0014\n\u0014\nWayne Flynt is a member of First Baptist Church in Auburn, Ala., and \na professor at Auburn University.

    "words": "Eyewitness\u0014\nDavid Brainerd: \"I could scarce believe he used me.\"\u0014\nBy Jennifer Trafton\u0014\n\u0014\nChristian History magazine\u0014\n\u0014\nExpelled from Yale for saying that one tutor \"had no more grace than \na chair\" and refusing to apologize, David Brainerd (1718-1747) did \nnot embark upon his brief career as a missionary to the Native \nAmericans with the shining prospect of being an icon for Protestant \nmissions. Yet his diary, edited and published posthumously by \nJonathan Edwards, became a spiritual classic, inspiring such \nmissionary heroes as William Carey, David Livingstone, and Jim Elliot.\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brainerd's status as a model missionary is ironic, since in \nmany respects he was a failure. Plagued by ill health, self-doubt, \nand extreme depression, yet driven by a profound determination to \nobey God's calling, he made relatively few converts in the five years \nof ministry before his death of tuberculosis at age 29. In 1743 he \nwrote, \"Appeared to myself exceeding ignorant, weak, helpless, \nunworthy, and altogether unequal to my work. It seemed to me I should \nnever do any service or have any success among the Indians.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in the summer of 1745 a new mission to the Crossweeksung Indians \nin central New Jersey began to show some signs of taking root, and in \nAugust of that year Brainerd was astonished and overjoyed to see, at \nlast, unexpected fruits from his seemingly barren ministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAug. 16. Spent a considerable time in conversing privately with \nsundry of the Indians. Found one that had got relief and comfort, \nafter pressing concern, and could not but hope, when I came to \ndiscourse particularly with her, that her comfort was of the right \nkind.In the afternoon, I preached to them from John vi.26-34. Toward \nthe close of my discourse, divine truths were attended with \nconsiderable power upon the audience, and more especially after \npublic service was over, when I particularly addressed sundry \ndistressed persons.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere was a great concern for their souls spread pretty generally \namong them; but especially there were two persons newly awakened to a \nsense of their sin and misery, one of whom was lately come, and the \nother had all along been very attentive, and desirous of being \nawakened, but could never before have any lively view of her \nperishing state. But now her concern and spiritual distress was such, \nthat, I thought, I had never seen any more pressing. Sundry old men \nwere also in distress for their souls; so that they could not refrain \nfrom weeping and crying out aloud, and their bitter groans were the \nmost convincing, as well as affecting, evidence of the reality and \ndepth of their inward anguish.God is powerfully at work among them!\u0014\n\u0014\nTrue and genuine convictions of sin are daily promoted in many \ninstances, and some are newly awakened from time to time; although \nsome few, who felt a commotion in their passions in days past, seem \nnow to discover that their hearts were never duly affected. I never \nsaw the work of God appear so independent of means as at this time.\u0014\n\u0014\nI discoursed to the people, and spoke what, I suppose, had a proper \ntendency to promote convictions; but . . . I could scarce believe he \nused me as an instrument, or what I spake as means of carrying on his \nwork; for it seemed, as I thought, to have no connexion with, nor \ndependence upon, means in any respect.  I seemed to do nothing, and \nindeed to have nothing to do, but to \"stand still and see the \nsalvation of God;\" and found myself obliged and delighted to say, \n\"Not unto us,\" not unto instruments and means, \"but to thy name be \nglory.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2004 by the author or Christianity Today\u0014",

    "words": "Don't Ever Say That Again \u0014\n\u0014\nIn A 3rd Serving of Chicken Soup for the Soul, there is a story about \na \u0014\nstudent who was unlike most students. One day in the 11th grade he \nwent into \u0014\na classroom to wait for a friend. The teacher appeared and asked him \nto go \u0014\nto the blackboard. He replied, \"Im not one of your students.\" The \nteacher \u0014\nsaid, \"Doesnt matter. Go to the board anyhow.\" The student told him \nhe \u0014\ncouldnt do that and when the teacher asked \"why not?\" the student \ntold him \u0014\nhe was mentally retarded. The teacher came over to the student and \nsaid, \u0014\n\"Dont ever say that again. Someones opinion of you does not have \nto  \u0014\nbecome your reality.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nIt became a liberating moment for the student, a time of great \nlearning. The \u0014\nteacher, Mr. Washington, became the students mentor. Later that \nschool year \u0014\nMr. Washington addressed the graduating seniors. And in his speech he \nsaid, \u0014\n\"You have greatness within you .. You can touch millions of peoples \u0014\nlives.\" After the speech the student went up to Mr. Washington and \nasked him \u0014\nif he had greatness within him. The teacher replied, \"Yes, Mr. Brown, \nyou \u0014\ndo.\" The student thanked him and told him that one day he would make \nthe \u0014\nteacher proud. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his senior year it happened that Brown was placed in Mr. \nWashingtons \u0014\nspeech and drama class. Although Brown was a special education \nstudent, the \u0014\nprincipal realized that this would be a good match up. Mr. Washington \ngave \u0014\nBrown a larger vision of himself. While other teachers passed Brown \nfrom \u0014\nclass to class, Mr. Washington made more demands of him. He made him \u0014\naccountable. He enabled him to believe in himself. Years later the \nfamous, \u0014\nLes Brown, produced five specials on public television. Mr. \nWashington saw \u0014\nthe program and called Les Brown to tell him how proud he was of his \u0014\nachievement. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen others believe in us we gain confidence in ourselves and are \nable to do \u0014\ngreat things. Naturally, we still have to apply ourselves. Les Brown \nhad to \u0014\nwork hard to finish high school. But, he was now motivated to learn. \nOur \u0014\nchildren need to hear from us that we believe in them. Our students, \nwho \u0014\ncould be our friends, relatives, or co-workers will be motivated to \naspire \u0014\nto greater things when we believe in them. \u0014\n\u0014\nDr. Keith Wagner, St. Pauls United Church of Christ, Sidney, Ohio\u0014",

    "title": "DISCERNING A CHURCH'S HIDDEN VALUES",
    "words": "Discerning Your Church's Hidden Core Values\u0014\nIt's the unstated, underlying purpose that really drives a church.\u0014\nby Angie Ward\u0014\n\u0014\nA lot has been written lately about the church and culture; most of \nit, however, refers to the culture around a church. Just as important \nis the culture within a church, the shared attitudes, values, and \nbeliefs that define a church and shape its practices.\u0014\n\u0014\nFresh out of seminary, my husband and I began ministry at an \nestablished, 850-member church in a large city. During the interview \nprocess, we were impressed by the church's forward-thinking mission \nand values, and we were excited to join such an apparently dynamic \nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs time passed, however, it became clear that there was far more bark \nthan bite at that church, missionally speaking.\u0014\n\u0014\nOh, the church leadership certainly talked the talkabout the need to \nbe an \"outward-focused\" church, about the importance of having staff \nmembers who demonstrated \"proven character and proven ministry,\" \nabout the priority of \"people over programs.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut in reality, the church was not growing, evangelism was not a \npriority, staff members were allowed to bully others as long as they \ngot the job done on Sundays, and heaven forbid that a program be \ndropped, even when it was no longer effective.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt took several years to realize that the problem was not a lack of \nresources, expertise, or a clearly worded purpose statement. The \nproblem was that the church's actual culture didn't reflect its \nstated mission.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs with any organization, a church's culture can be encapsulated into \nan \"ethos,\" or a statement that summarizes its true guiding beliefs. \nThe ethos is almost never officially articulated. It's something that \nis felt. This ethos is often hard to define, but that doesn't mean it \nis any less powerful. Ideally, the ethos of an organization should \nflow out of its purpose, but when it doesn't, the church's underlying \nculture can subvert even the best vision.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe ethos at our first church? \"Don't rock the boat.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile that church on the surface valued outreach, character, and \ninnovation, the no-rocking ethos meant that its actual directive was \n\"Don't offend anyone; don't take risks; and don't deal with hidden \nsin.\" It took more than three years for us to figure this out, by \nrepeated trial and error, but also by looking at our church's \nhistory, the personalities of its leaders, and even the culture of \nour surrounding community.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe also learned from experience that simply changing a church's \npurpose statement or core values does not automatically change its \nculture. One of our church's stated core values was \"diversity in \nworship styles.\" Apparently the music director never got that memo, \nas he vehemently fought any efforts to introduce contemporary \nelements into the worship service\u0014\n\u0014\nCopyright  2005 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Leadership Journal.\u0014",

    "title": "DESCENDED INTO HELL",
    "words": "Was the phrase \"he descended into hell\" always part of the Apostles' \nCreed, or was it introduced later? And how have Christians \ninterpreted it over time?\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus' purported descent into hell has long been the subject of \ndisagreement between Christians. Its presence in the Apostles' Creed \npoints to a long-standing, lively, and ultimately inconclusive \ndiscussion on the theme of Jesus' post-crucifixion activities.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians first recited the Creed not as a statement of belief, but \nas a baptismal confession. Much as liturgical churches now pose \nquestions in confirmation ceremonies, the ancient churches asked \ncandidates for baptism three questions about the Trinity. From this \ncame the Apostles' \"Symbol\" or \"sign\" identifying with the community \nin baptismand eventually the Creed in its current wording.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Creed, then, was not set from its beginning, but fluid. The \noldest extant version comes from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (ca. A.D. \n337), and it does not contain the clause about descending into hell. \nScholars call this version \"The Old Roman Form\"the earliest creed of \nthe Roman church.\u0014\n\u0014\nApparently the clause first appeared in the East with Sirmium's \nfourth formula in 359also called the \"Dated Creed\" though the \nEastern church rejected it as tinged with Arianism. The first mention \nof the descent in the West occurs in the writings of Rufinus of \nAquileia, who included it in his baptismal creed around 400. Over \ntime, the Latin church appropriated it as well, officially \nintegrating it into the Creed in 750.\u0014\n\u0014\nChristians have long been troubled over what the descent actually \nmeans. Augustine, for example, believed Christ literally descended \ninto hell. But in his letter to Evodius, he admits several \nuncertainties over the meaning of 1 Peter 3:19, which says that Jesus \npreached to those \"spirits in prison\" who had been disobedient in \nNoah's day. If \"prison\" equals \"hell,\" then why, Augustine wonders, \nshould these people be singled out for such an honor, and who, if \nanyone, did Christ save with his preaching in hell? Further, Jesus \ncould not have come only to take the \"righteous men\" from hell, for \nwere they not already separated from the condemned, as demonstrated \nin the story of the beggar Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16? \nAugustine does not attempt to resolve the matter, but openly admits \nhis perplexity.\u0014\n\u0014\nCenturies later, Thomas Aquinas resolved Augustine's problem by \nsaying Christ descended to two placeshell and purgatoryand that his \npurpose in each was different. In hell, he put unbelievers to shame, \nwhile in purgatory, he gave sinners hope for glory and the righteous \ndeliverance. But this explanation did not satisfy all. Martin Luther, \nthough he believed Christ descended to hell, would offer no clear cut \nexplanation for the event. John Calvin went so far as to describe the \ndescent as symbolic, pointing to Christ's suffering at Gethsemane and \nthe cross.\u0014\nAnd the debate continued. Nineteenth-century church historian Philip \nSchaff deemed the translation \"descended into hell\" unfortunate and \nmisleading. \"We do not know whether Christ was in hell,\" he wrote, \n\"but we do know from His own lips that He was in Paradise between His \ndeath and resurrection. The term Hades is much more comprehensive \nthan Hell (Gehenna) which is confined to the state of the lost.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nClearly there are unacceptable readings, such as preacher Kenneth \nCopeland's claim that it was Jesus' descent to hell, not his death on \nthe cross, that redeemed sinners. But most proposed solutions have \nlittle bearing on the essentials of Christian faith. Such puzzles \nwill always be with us, providing fodder for speculation and debate, \nbut admitting of no definitive solution this side of heaven.\u0014\n\u0014\n* For a concise overview of the historic development of the Creed and \nthe doctrine of the descent, look up \"Apostle's Creed\" and \"Harrowing \nof Hell\" in the Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, 2nd ed.(Garland, \n1997). Also, consult the entry \"Descent into Hell\" in the \nEncyclopedia of the Early Church (Oxford University Press, 1992).\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nSteven Gertz is editorial coordinator for Christian History\u0014\nCopyright  2002 by the author or Christianity Today \nInternational/Christian History magazine.\u0014\n\u0014\n                                               Whether Christ went \ndown into the hell of the lost?\u0014\n\u0014\nObjection 1. It would seem that Christ went down into the hell of the \nlost, because it is said by the mouth of Divine Wisdom (Sirach \n24:45): \"I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth.\" But \nthe hell of the lost is computed among the lower parts of the earth \naccording to Ps. 62:10: \"They shall go into the lower parts of the \nearth.\" Therefore Christ who is the Wisdom of God, went down even \ninto the hell of the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjection 2. Further, Peter says (Acts 2:24) that \"God hath raised up \nChrist, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that \nHe should be holden by it.\" But there are no sorrows in the hell of \nthe Fathers, nor in the hell of the children, since they are not \npunished with sensible pain on account of any actual sin, but only \nwith the pain of loss on account of original sin. Therefore Christ \nwent down into the hell of the lost, or else into Purgatory, where \nmen are tormented with sensible pain on account of actual sins.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjection 3. Further, it is written (1 Pt. 3:19) that \"Christ coming \nin spirit preached to those spirits that were in prison, which had \nsome time been incredulous\": and this is understood of Christ's \ndescent into hell, as Athanasius says (Ep. ad Epict.). For he says \nthat \"Christ's body was laid in the sepulchre when He went to preach \nto those spirits who were in bondage, as Peter said.\" But it is clear \nthe unbelievers were in the hell of the lost. Therefore Christ went \ndown into the hell of the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjection 4. Further, Augustine says (Ep. ad Evod. clxiv): \"If the \nsacred Scriptures had said that Christ came into Abraham's bosom, \nwithout naming hell or its woes, I wonder whether any person would \ndare to assert that He descended into hell. But since evident \ntestimonies mention hell and its sorrows, there is no reason for \nbelieving that Christ went there except to deliver men from the same \nwoes.\" But the place of woes is the hell of the lost. Therefore \nChrist descended into the hell of the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nObjection 5. Further, as Augustine says in a sermon upon the \nResurrection: Christ descending into hell \"set free all the just who \nwere held in the bonds of original sin.\" But among them was Job, who \nsays of himself (Job 17:16): \"All that I have shall go down into the \ndeepest pit.\" Therefore Christ descended into the deepest pit.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the contrary, Regarding the hell of the lost it is written (Job \n10:21): \"Before I go, and return no more, to a land that is dark and \ncovered with the mist of death.\" Now there is no \"fellowship of light \nwith darkness,\" according to 2 Cor. 6:14. Therefore Christ, who is \n\"the light,\" did not descend into the hell of the lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nI answer that, A thing is said to be in a place in two ways. First of \nall, through its effect, and in this way Christ descended into each \nof the hells, but in different manner. For going down into the hell \nof the lost He wrought this effect, that by descending thither He put \nthem to shame for their unbelief and wickedness: but to them who were \ndetained in Purgatory He gave hope of attaining to glory: while upon \nthe holy Fathers detained in hell solely on account of original sin, \nHe shed the light of glory everlasting.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn another way a thing is said to be in a place through its essence: \nand in this way Christ's soul descended only into that part of hell \nwherein the just were detained. so that He visited them \"in place,\" \naccording to His soul, whom He visited \"interiorly by grace,\" \naccording to His Godhead. Accordingly, while remaining in one part of \nhell, He wrought this effect in a measure in every part of hell, just \nas while suffering in one part of the earth He delivered the whole \nworld by His Passion.\u0014\n\u0014\nReply to Objection 1. Christ, who is the Wisdom of God, penetrated to \nall the lower parts of the earth, not passing through them locally \nwith His soul, but by spreading the effects of His power in a measure \nto them all: yet so that He enlightened only the just: because the \ntext quoted continues: \"And I will enlighten all that hope in the \nLord.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReply to Objection 2. Sorrow is twofold: one is the suffering of pain \nwhich men endure for actual sin, according to Ps. 17:6: \"The sorrows \nof hell encompassed me.\" Another sorrow comes of hoped-for glory \nbeing deferred, according to Prov. 13:12: \"Hope that is deferred \nafflicteth the soul\": and such was the sorrow which the holy Fathers \nsuffered in hell, and Augustine refers to it in a sermon on the \nPassion, saying that \"they besought Christ with tearful entreaty.\" \nNow by descending into hell Christ took away both sorrows, yet in \ndifferent ways: for He did away with the sorrows of pains by \npreserving souls from them, just as a physician is said to free a man \nfrom sickness by warding it off by means of physic. Likewise He \nremoved the sorrows caused by glory deferred, by bestowing glory.\u0014\n\u0014\nReply to Objection 3. These words of Peter are referred by some to \nChrist's descent into hell: and they explain it in this sense: \n\"Christ preached to them who formerly were unbelievers, and who were \nshut up in prison\"--that is, in hell--\"in spirit\"--that is, by His \nsoul. Hence Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): \"As He evangelized \nthem who are upon the earth, so did He those who were in hell\"; not \nin order to convert unbelievers unto belief, but to put them to shame \nfor their unbelief, since preaching cannot be understood otherwise \nthan as the open manifesting of His Godhead. which was laid bare \nbefore them in the lower regions by His descending in power into hell.\u0014\n\u0014\nAugustine, however, furnishes a better exposition of the text in his \nEpistle to Evodius quoted above, namely, that the preaching is not to \nbe referred to Christ's descent into hell, but to the operation of \nHis Godhead, to which He gave effect from the beginning of the world. \nConsequently, the sense is, that \"to those (spirits) that were in \nprison\"--that is, living in the mortal body, which is, as it were, \nthe soul's prison-house--\"by the spirit\" of His Godhead \"He came and \npreached\" by internal inspirations, and from without by the \nadmonitions spoken by the righteous: to those, I say, He preached \n\"which had been some time incredulous,\" i.e. not believing in the \npreaching of Noe, \"when they waited for the patience of God,\" whereby \nthe chastisement of the Deluge was put off: accordingly (Peter) adds: \n\"In the days of Noe, when the Ark was being built.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nReply to Objection 4. The expression \"Abraham's bosom\" may be taken \nin two senses. First of all, as implying that restfulness, existing \nthere, from sensible pain; so that in this sense it cannot be called \nhell, nor are there any sorrows there. In another way it can be taken \nas implying the privation of longed-for glory: in this sense it has \nthe character of hell and sorrow. Consequently, that rest of the \nblessed is now called Abraham's bosom, yet it is not styled hell, nor \nare sorrows said to be now in Abraham's bosom.\u0014\n\u0014\nReply to Objection 5. As Gregory says (Moral. xiii): \"Even the higher \nregions of hell he calls the deepest hell . . . For if relatively to \nthe height of heaven this darksome air is infernal, then relatively \nto the height of this same air the earth lying beneath can be \nconsidered as infernal and deep. And again in comparison with the \nheight of the same earth, those parts of hell which are higher than \nthe other infernal mansions, may in this way be designated as the \ndeepest hell.\"\u0014",

All rights reserved.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the influence of alcohol, Dawson Trotman was arrested and on \nhis way to jail. The policeman who was hauling him in looked down and \nasked, \"Do you like this kind of life?\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"Sir, I hate it,\" answered Trotman. Three hours later, after Trotman \nsobered up in a park, the policeman returned his keys to him on the \nstrength of a pledge to do better. That weekend, Dawson found his way \nto church. His Sunday school leader assigned him ten verses on \nsalvation to memorize. But three weeks later, with twenty verses in \nhis head, he had slipped back onto the bottle and reckless behavior. \nThis wasn't his first time in church. Although he'd been stealing \nsince a child, he had become president of a church's young people's \nsociety. But he did not have eternal life.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuddenly it registered with him that he could have everlasting life \njust as a Bible verse from the Gospel of John, chapter five promised. \nHe prayed, \"O God, whatever that means, I want to have it.\" Another \nverse flashed into his mind, \"But as many as received Him [Jesus], to \nthem gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe \non His name.\" Dawson pleaded to \"receive\" Jesus right then--whatever \nthat meant.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis life changed. While working as a truck driver in California, he \ntaught a sailor named Les Spencer how to live for Christ. Another \nsailor asked Spencer the secret of his changed life. Spencer brought \nthe man to Trotman and asked him to teach the other man. Trotman felt \nexasperated. He had just spent months passing on to Spencer \neverything he needed to know to do the job himself. \"You teach him!\" \nhe said. That was the beginning of the Navigators.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Navigators were founded on this day, March 3, 1933. (The \norganization was not incorporated for another decade.) Soon Spencer \nand his shipmate were teaching 125 men aboard the USS West Virginia, \nwho, in turn, taught others aboard the ships that were sunk at Pearl \nHarbor.\u0014\n\u0014\nDawson Trotman, a dashing man who had been valedictorian of his class \nand student president, continued to put his talents to good use. The \nNavigators grew and grew. Today over 100,000 people take its \nDiscipleship Journal. You may have seen other study guides and books \nthat the organization publishes, or their prayer magazine. More than \n3,000 people work for the Navigators in almost a hundred nations. \nThat is how one man's obedience snowballed.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrotman died in 1956, rescuing a girl from drowning.

    "title": "DAWSON TROTMAN -- THE DISCIPLED LIFE",
    "words": "Dawson Trotman\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Discipled Life\u0014\n\u0014\n     The Reverend Billy Graham preached the funeral of Dawson Trotman \nin 1956 after Trotman died while rescuing a swimmer at an upstate New \nYork lake. \u0014\n     I think Dawson Trotman has personally touched more lives [for \nChrist's sake] than anybody that I have ever known,\" Graham said. \u0014\n     Graham knew Trotman and the ministry he foundedThe \nNavigatorsquite well, using material Trotman developed as follow-up \ninstruction for his crusades. \u0014\n     The Navigators' influence has since grown to worldwide \nproportions with about 3,600 staff representing 60 nationalities \nworking in 101 countries. \u0014\n     Trotman founded The Navigators in 1933. He originated its Bible \nteaching material and led it through its formative years as it \nexpanded from an initial emphasis on discipling military personnel to \nreaching college students and laymen. \u0014\n     At the heart of Trotman and the ministry he founded was and is \nthe discipleship of believersgrounding Christians in the spiritual \ndisciplines of prayer, worship, Bible study, and service. \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Conversion \u0014\n     Trotman's high school years featured impressive credentials. He \nwas class valedictorian, student body president, chairman of the \nstudent council, and captain of the basketball team. \u0014\n     However, the next several years saw Trotman's life drift \ndangerously. He gambled. He drank. He became a noted pool shark. \nHowever, a late night encounter with a local policeman was the \ncatalyst for a spiritual encounter with Jesus Christ. \u0014\n     Drunk and unable to find his car, Trotman was arrested at an \namusement park. Fortunately, the officer saw a deeper problem than \nalcohol. \u0014\n     \"Son, do you like this kind of life?\" the officer questioned. \n\"Sir, I hate it,\" Trotman replied. The policeman returned Trotman's \nkeys and encouraged him to change his lifestyle. \u0014\n     Two days later, Trotman attended a youth gathering at a local \nchurch where contests were conducted for Scripture memorization. \u0014\n     Given ten verses on salvation, Trotman was the only person in \nthe group who memorized them for the next week's meeting. Given ten \nmore verses to memorize on spiritual growth for the next week, \nTrotman quickly grasped them as well. \u0014\n     Several weeks later, one of the Scripture verses on salvation \nflashed through his mind. And it was then that he asked for Christ to \nchange his life. \"Oh God,\" he said, \"whatever it means to receive \nJesus, I want to do it right now.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Beginning Of Ministry \u0014\n     Trotman spent the next several years engaging in intensive \npersonal evangelism while committing himself to a disciplined life of \nprayer. As usual, his focus was on the intake and absorption of God's \nWord. \u0014\n     In 1934, Trotman was asked to visit a sailor, Les Spencer, and \nshare God's Word with him. Betty Skinner, the author of Trotman's \nbiography Daws, described the scene: \"Parked by a schoolhouse, they \nwere pouring over the Scriptures when a security guard approached and \nasked what they were doing. 'Reading the Bible,' Trotman answered and \nseized the opportunity to witness . . . Dawson turned from one \npassage to another to explain the Gospel and answer all the defenses \nof the hapless guard. \u0014\n     \"On the way back to the landing [Spencer] said, 'Boy, I'd give \nmy right arm to know how to use the Word like that.'\" \u0014\n     It marked the beginning of The Navigators ministry, so named for \nits nautical origins. Spencer led another to Christ who in turn led \nstill others to salvation. The discipleship ministry of The \nNavigators was birthed, and the process of winning and discipling men \nand women for Christ continues throughout the world today. \u0014\n\u0014\nMemorization And Meditation \u0014\n     Trotman's conversion experience centered on memorization and \nmeditation on God's Word. He was a discipler of men because he \nhimself was first discipled by God through the Scriptures. His \nemphasis on memorizing Scriptures, arranged on topical themes, \ncontinues to be part of the core curriculum of The Navigators today. \u0014\n     Memorization was not approached in legalistic fashion by \nTrotman, who understood that God's Spirit must create the desire and \nwill to mine the treasures of His Word. \u0014\n     Regular Scripture memorization and meditation are fundamental to \nexperiencing an abundant Christian life. The psalmist \"treasured\" \nGod's Word in his heart (Psalm 119:11) and meditated on the \nScriptures \"day and night.\" (Psalm 1:2) \u0014\n     As you write God's Word on the tablet of your heart, you will \nfind your mind renewed and ready to face temptations, challenges, and \nadversity from God's perspective of truth. \u0014\n     It is truth that sets you free; and the more Scripture you store \nin your heart, the more like Christ you will become. \u0014\n     Graham summed up Trotman's life this way: \"Dawson loved the Word \nof God. I think more than anybody else he taught me to love it. He \nalways carried his Bible around and always had it marked. The Word of \nGod was sweetness to him.\"\u0014",

Reportedly bred first around 1660 as \nguard dogs for the monastery and hospice founded six centuries \nearlier by Bernard of Menthon (Monthen/ Montjou/ Aotha/ Montjoux), \nthey gained a reputation as rescuers, credited with more than 2,000 \nsaves over the past two centuries. One dog saved more than 40 people \nbetween 1800 and 1812.\u0014\n\u0014\nRecently, however, (2005) the dogs (now 18 adults and 16 pups) \nthemselves needed rescue: \"We no longer have the money to breed and \ncare for these marvelous dogs,\" the monastery's Father Ilario told \nThe Times of London last year. The animals eat more than four pounds \nof meat a day, and helicopters and other technology have put them out \nof the rescue business since 1975. So in January, Swiss \nphilanthropists announced that they would grant the monks more than \n$4 million to care for the animals and to build a museum honoring \nthem and the monastery's longtime hospitality.\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch tourism with a spiritual twist is consistent with Bernard's \nhistory: after his appointment as Archdeacon of Aosta, Italy, Bernard \nwas largely focused on converting Alpine people. He soon became \nconcerned about reports of French and German pilgrims trapped by \navalanches as they traveled to Rome. The four monks who remain at the \nmonastery he founded for their safety say their pleas for help were \nlargely driven by a desire to spend more time ministering to \nmodern-day pilgrims and less to the canines.\u0014",

Still, it teaches a powerful moral \nlesson, one you might find useful.]\u0014\n\u0014\nThe painting of The Last Supper is said to have taken Da Vinci seven \nyears to complete. Starting out, Da Vinci wanted to find the perfect \nChrist caricature for his portrait. Da Vinci always used real people \nin all his portraits and paintings, so he always searched for just \nthe right actors to portray the realism he wanted to capture for his \ncanvas.\u0014\n\u0014\nAccording to the story, hundreds and hundreds of young men were \ncarefully viewed in an endeavor to find a face and personality \nexhibiting innocence and beauty, free from the scars and signs of \ndissipation caused by sin. Eventually, after searching for weeks, a \nyoung man of 19 years was found and selected. For the next six \nmonths, Da Vinci worked on the portraiture of Christ as he, the \nartist, saw him, the Messiah, in the face and demeanor of this young \nsubject.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow completed, Da Vinci settled himself into the task of searching \nfor and capturing the faces of the other disciples around that table \nin the upper room. One by one, over the next six years, Da Vinci \nsearched and worked.\u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, the work had progressed to the point that there remained but \none face left to find - that of The Traitor himself, Judas Iscariot. \nIt was a face that the old master had purposefully left for last for \nany number of reasons. Now, near the end of his task, he went on a \nsearch not unlike the one he had at first - looking, scrutinizing, \nstudying faces in endless crowds for just that one face - the face - \nthat would tell the story behind the story.\u0014\n\u0014\nHis travels finally took him to a dungeon in Rome, where he had heard \nresided a man who was thought to be the epitome of what the artist \nwas looking for. Upon introduction, Da Vinci realized his \nexpectations were not disappointed. Indeed, here was a man of dark \nsoul - a wretched, unkempt and vicious human. Yes, this was the \nperfect Judas!\u0014\n\u0014\nBy special order of the king, the prisoner was released into Da \nVinci's care for the next several months. For both days and nights, \nthe portrait was crafted into the scripted scene. The moment finally \ncame when the portrait was completed and the prisoner was returned to \nthe care of his incarcerators.\u0014\n\u0014\nTurning to leave, Da Vinci suddenly found himself in the clutches of \nthe prisoner crying out, O, Da Vinci, look at me! Do you not know who \nI am?\u0014\n\u0014\nUpon studying the poor man closer, Da Vinci exclaimed that he did not \nknow the man. O, Da Vinci, the man cried louder, I am your Christ!! I \nam the man you painted seven years ago as Christ! O, God, have I \nfallen so low?. It is said that the young man was Pedro Bandandello.\u0014",

    "words": "Publisher Comments:\u0014\nHis methods have been ridiculed, his business tactics questioned, and \nhis plans derided. Yet not even the most stiff-necked Southern \npatrician can deny that D. Wayne Lukas is the most successful horse \ntrainer in history. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1999 Lukas became the first trainer to surpass $200 million in \nearnings. During the course of his career, he has saddled more than a \nthousand stakes winners. He has trained twenty Eclipse champions \n(including two that won Horse of the Year awards) and has been the \nnation's leading money-winning trainer fourteen times, having hit the \nall-time single-season record of $17.8 million in 1988. He's won \nthirteen Triple Crown races--including a record-breaking six in a \nrow--counting up four Kentucky Derbies, five Preaknesses, and four \nBelmonts. He also is the all-time winningest Breeders' Cup trainer, \nwith fifteen victories. This revolutionary genius has also trained an \nentire generation of hot young trainers that has already begun to \nleave its mark on the world of horse racing.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn short, if horse racing is the sport of kings, then D. Wayne Lukas \nis undoubtedly its emperor.\u0014\n\u0014\nNow, in this first book-length biography of D. Wayne Lukas, \nsportswriter Carlo DeVito tells the riveting life story of the man \nknown throughout the sports world as the \"Vince Lombardi of horse \nracing.\" DeVito traces Lukas's career from his days as a basketball \ncoach to his rise in quarter-horse racing, from his emergence as a \ndriving force in thoroughbred racing to his induction in the Horse \nRacing Hall of Fame. He reveals the controversial strategies and \nbusiness tactics D. Wayne employed to wrest control of thoroughbred \nracing from the handful of wealthy families who had held it for two \ncenturies. Using more than five hundred articles and interviews with \nLukas, rivals and fans, colleagues and competitors, wives, and \nfriends, author Carlo DeVito paints a fascinating portrait of a man \nwho embodies Americans' most cherished images of \nthemselves--self-made man, innovator, and cowboy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first biography of the most successful and notorious horse \ntrainer of all time, D. Wayne is must reading not only for \nhorse-racing aficionados but for everyone who finds inspiration in \ntales of true grit and determination along the road to the winner's \ncircle of life.\u0014\n\u0014\nPraise for D. Wayne\u0014\n\"Winning isn't everything, but it's the principal goal in all sports. \nWayne Lukas has accomplished it with skill, dedication, attention to \ndetail, panache and controversy more than any horse trainer before \nhim. It's a fascinating story from starting gate to finish line.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n--Jim McKay, ABC Sports Emmy-winning journalist and commentator, \nOlympics and \"Wide World of Sports\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\"A fascinating look into the history and career of America's most \nfamous horse trainer.\" \u0014\n--William Nack, Sports Illustrated\u0014\n\u0014\n\"D. Wayne is the complete story of the man who, quite simply, changed \nthe game of training thoroughbred racehorses. Lukas also raised the \nbar for those who follow. All of that, and he still gives the best \nsound bite and quotes in the game!\"\u0014\n--Chris Lincoln, host of ESPN's \"Racehorse Digest\" and global \ntelevision presenter for the World Series Racing Championships.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first biography of the most successful--and controversial--horse \ntrainer of all timeD. Wayne Lukas has trained more winners, won more \nraces, and amassed a greater fortune than any horse trainer in \nhistory. His unorthodox methods as well as his stormy personal life \nhave also earned him a celebrity traditionally reserved for movie \nstars and big-league athletes. Now, in D. Wayne, journalist Carlo \nDeVito provides us with an intimate look into the life, times, and \ncomplex personality of one of the most colorful entrepreneurial \nmavericks of all time.\u0014",

Everyday he \nscanned\u0014\nthe horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming. Exhausted, he\u0014\neventually managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect \u0014\nhim from the elements, and to store his few possessions.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne day, after scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his \nlittle \u0014\nhut in flames, with smoke rolling up to the sky.

A few more \nstrikes to the head left it sitting under a pickup truck.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen I reached down to pick up the head, it raised around and did a \nbackflip almost, and bit my finger, Anderson said. I had to shake \nmy hand real hard to get it to let loose.\u0014\n\u0014\nVenom was spreading\u0014\nHis wife insisted they go to the hospital, and by the time they \narrived at Prosser Memorial Hospital 10 minutes later, Andersons \ntongue was swollen and the venom was spreading. He then was taken by \nambulance 30 miles to a Richland hospital to get the full series of \nsix shots he needed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe snake head ended up in the bed of his pickup, and Anderson landed \nin the hospital until Wednesday afternoon.\u0014\n\u0014\nMike Livingston, a Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife \nbiologist, said the area where the Andersons live is near prime \nsnake habitat. But he said he had never heard of anyone being bit by \na decapitated snake before.\u0014\n\u0014\nThats really surprising but thats an important thing to tell \npeople, he said. It may have been just a reflex on the part of the \nsnake.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf another rattlesnake comes along, Anderson said hell likely try to \nkill it again, but said hell grab a shovel and bury it right there.\u0014",

We assume both parties will benefit \nfrom the transaction. Marketing is a wonderful thing. I like to hear \npitches about products I might use. I like the fact that my \npublishers pitch my books to a larger public. Thank God for marketing!\u0014\nRelated articles and links\u0014\n\u0014\nBut there's a reason Jesus said \"You shall be my witnesses,\" and not \n\"You shall be my marketers.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAlmost no one in America could fail to recognize that marketingboth \nits language and culturehas become an epidemic. And that, more \nunfortunately, it has become a significant means of \"promoting\" the \nchurch and the gospel in American Christianity, with billboards, \nsoundbites, slogans, and come-ons. The language and practice of \nmarketing so saturates the Christian world, it is difficult to \nremember a time when it was not so fashionable.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn Jesus' day, marketing was the rage, and it was something Jesus \nprohibited on many occasions. Take his dramatic healing of a leper, \nafter which he sternly commanded him, \"See that you say nothing to \nanyone!\" (Mark 1:44). Scholars call this repeated behavior \"the \nmessianic secret,\" and many preachers imagine that Jesus had mostly \npragmatic concerns in mind: If word of his power spread, he not only \nwould have been flocked by crowds, but he would also have been \nprematurely crucified by the authorities.\u0014\n\u0014\nMaybe. But I wonder if soft-pedaling the Good News is intrinsic to \nthe message. Jesus spoke in parables, he said, not to reveal the Good \nNews but to hide it: \"For those outside everything is in parables, so \nthat they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but \nnot understand\" (Mark 4:11). Elsewhere, he specifically tells his \ndisciples not to cast gospel-pearls before swine. Make something as \ncheap as slop, and people will treat it like slop.\u0014\n\u0014\nJump ahead 20 centuries, and we find a church that doesn't think \ntwice about treating the gospel like slop, like fast food. About 30 \nyears ago, the church-growth movement exploded onto the scene; \nchurches became enamored with the efficiency of businesses like \nDisney and McDonald's, and they began fashioning their life together \nto meet people's needs in the same sorts of waysexcept that their \nproduct was the gospel. So churches became places where thousands \ncould be served efficiently. And where the message was served in \nMcSermons that could be easily digested and applied.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd where \"marketing\" became part of the church's vocabulary.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the church starts marketing itself or the gospel, something odd \nis taking place. It conjures up the idea that the church is offering \nthem some benefitall well and good. But it also implicitly suggests \nthat when they \"buy\" or consume that good, the church somehow \nreceives some benefit. That's the assumption of the marketplace: it's \nan exchange of value for goods and services.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould it surprise us, then, that in the same era the church has \nmarketed itself more and more, neighborhoods and cities are \nincreasingly resentful of the presence of the church in their \ncommunities? Churches today have a heck of a time trying to get \npermits for expanding or building because communities think they're a \nnuisance. The church has become just another business exchanging \ngoods and services, albeit spiritual goods and services.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe perception is that as the church markets itself, more benefits \nwill accrue to the churchmore people, more programs, more money, \nmore buildings, more success. When a neighborhood thinks of the \nchurch as little more than an ever-expanding spiritual business, it \nis naturally resentful when this business disrupts the life of the \ncommunity with parking, traffic, and late-night meetings.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould it surprise us that in this church-marketing era, members \ndemand more and more from their churches, and if churches don't \ndeliver, they take their spiritual business elsewhere? Have we ever \nseen an age in which church transience was such an epidemic?\u0014\n\u0014\nShould it surprise us that in this era, pastors increasingly think of \nthemselves as \"managers,\" \"leaders,\" and \"CEOs\" of \"dynamic and \ngrowing congregations,\" rather than as shepherds, teachers, and \nservants of people who need to know God? And that preaching has \nbecome less an exposition of the gospel of Jesus' death and \nresurrection and more often practical lessons that offer a lot of \n\"take-away value,\" presented in an efficient, friendly manner, as if \nwe were selling cheeseburgers, fries, and a shake?\u0014\n\u0014\nAnd on it goes. Let me be clear. There is nothing inherently wrong \nwith large churches. Medieval Europe was full of them, and I long for \nthe day when those cathedrals will be full of the worshiping faithful \nagain. I have been blessed time and again by the ministry of \nmegachurches.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday churches large and small (the small imitating the large) have \nunthinkingly adopted a marketing mentality that, it turns out, \nsubverts rather than promotes the gospel. We inadvertently imply that \nthe church benefits as much from the spiritual transaction as does \nthe recipient. Marketing, by its very nature, contradicts the essence \nof the gospel lifestyle of Jesus, who came not to be served, but to \nexpend his life for othersno exchange implied or expected.\u0014\n\u0014\nHow can we possibly communicate the radical, self-giving love of God \nto our culture if we continue to use a method that by its very nature \nreplaces the notions of sacrificial service for an exchange of goods \nand services?\u0014\n\u0014\nWe are indeed called to the four corners of the earth to be witnesses \nof Christ's transforming love. But witnesses are not carnival \nbarkers. Sometimes it feels like the church is just another voice \nshouting for attention in the marketplace. I wonder what would happen \nif we quit shouting, if we quit trying to tell the world how \nbeneficial the faith is or what a difference going to church can \nmakeand simply told others, when appropriate, what God has done for \nus, and let our lifestyle \"market\" the message.\u0014\n\u0014\nMark Galli is senior managing editor of Christianity Today.

    "title": "DID JESUS REALLY DESCEND INTO HELL?",
    "words": "Did \nJesus Really Descend to Hell?\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the Apostles' Creed, there is a statement about Jesus descending \ninto hell. Did he literally go there?DEBRA BLACK, Alton, Illinois. \nEach Sunday, millions of Christians around the world recite the \nApostles' Creed, including that statement:\u0014\n\u0014\n    \"I believe that Jesus  descended into hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet a few years back at one Christian college, a series of chapel \nmessages on the Apostles' Creed had to omit this item, because none \nof the 12 professors of Bible and theology believed it. Actually the \nstatement is not found in the earliest form of the Apostles' Creed. \nIt echoes Acts 2:31, and seems to be there simply to make the point \nthat Jesus' death was real and complete. Jesus went to hades, which \nin the Greek signifies the world of the departedparadise for some, \npain for others. When the Apostles' Creed took its English form in \nthe sixteenth century, \"hell\" meant hades as such, rather than the \nfinal state of the lost (which Jesus called gehenna), as it always is \ntoday. So, should those who accept the Bible as their supreme \nauthority for belief hold to the Creed's doctrine on this point?\u0014\n\u0014\nScripture tells us very little about Jesus' state between his death \nand resurrection. The most commonly cited biblical passages are Acts \n2:31 ; Ephesians 4:8-10 ; 1 Peter 4:6; and, most importantly, 1 Peter \n3:18-20. Ephesians 4 is likely a reference to the Incarnation, and 1 \nPeter 4:6 could apply to any preaching of the gospel. But numerous \ninterpretations of 1 Peter 3:18-20 exist. Some say the 1 Peter 3 \npassage should not be taken literallythat it is symbolic, conveying \nin graphic form the idea that redemption is universal in its extent. \nThis, however, involves a more spiritualized hermeneutic than usually \npracticed by evangelicals.\u0014\n\u0014\nOthers contend that this refers to a descent by Jesus into the realm \nof the dead between his death and resurrection, and an actual \npreaching to its occupants, either offering salvation to them or \ndeclaring his own triumph over death and judgment upon those who in \ntheir earthly life did not respond to God. This interpretation, \nhowever, seems in conflict with the rest of Jesus' life and \nministryand with the context of the passage, which emphasizes a \nfaithful, gentle witness, giving a reason for one's faith, even in \nthe face of opposition (vv. 15-17). At the same time, the non-literal \ninterpretation has difficulty accounting adequately for the reference \nto Noah (v. 20), unless the preaching was restricted only to people \nfrom Noah's time, which seems strange. It also appears to conflict \nwith the theological context, or how our interpretation fits with \nother, more clearly established doctrines. Here we encounter biblical \nreferences teaching the finality of death over and against any \nopportunity for salvation, at least since the time of Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany consider the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) \npertinent to the question, as are much of Psalm 49 and Revelation \n20:11-15. Hebrews 9:27 indicates a close linkage between death and \njudgment, with nothing mentioned as intervening. And Jesus' statement \nto the thief on the cross\"today you will be with me in paradise\" \n(Luke 23:42,43)also is relevant.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne other interpretation, held by Augustine and defended strongly by \nseveral evangelicals, seems more promising. In this view, Christ \npreached \"in spirit\" through Noah as Noah built the ark. This was a \nmessage of repentance and righteousness, given to unbelieving people \nwho were then on earth but now are \"spirits in prison\" (i.e., in \nhell).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhile this reference to spirits in prison is not completely natural, \nthis view fits better with the other considerations. It also is \nsupported by 1 Peter 1:10-12, which speaks of the Spirit of Christ in \nthe prophets who spoke. While none of the interpretations is totally \nwithout difficulty, one might conclude that this is the most adequate \nreading of the relevant data.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Mounce, in his commentary Living Hope, says that the 1 Peter \n3:18-20 passage is \"widely recognized as perhaps the most difficult \nto understand in all of the New Testament.\" Even if one holds that \nJesus did descend into hell to offer salvation to those who had lived \non earth before him, this special effort does not apply to those who \nlived and died later.\u0014\n\u0014\nThere is one thing of which we can be certain: Jesus' death was a \nliteral event, not some temporary state of unconsciousness. Hence, in \nhis resurrection, Christ did indeed conquer deathboth in its \nspiritual and physical forms.\u0014\n\u0014\nBible-believing Christians can allow themselves to differ on the \nnature of Jesus' descent into hell. Some will be able to recite this \npart of the Apostles' Creed with conviction, while others may choose \nto remain silent.Millard J.

    "words": "Instone-Brewer:\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Piper has written a gracious and well-argued response to my \narticle in Christianity Today. He criticizes my conclusions and \noutlines his own, non-traditional, interpretation of the texts, which \nI will respond to below. He also says that the article has been \nmisunderstood by many readers, pointing out that it is easy to jump \nto the wrong conclusions if you read the article, without having read \nmy books (which he knows well).\u0014\n\u0014\nMany readers have misunderstood the article to say that divorce is \nallowed for any breaking of marriage vows by emotional or physical \nneglect. But what my research demonstrates is that both Jesus and \nPaul criticized no-fault divorce and taught that we should forgive \nthe faults of our marriage partners. Jesus did, however, allow \ndivorce if the marriage vows were broken with hardness of heart  \nan Old Testament word meaning continuing, or stubborn, unrepentance. \nThis means, in effect, that divorce is allowed for adultery, \nabandonment or abuse. I am glad to have the opportunity to put this \nimportant distinction across.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Pipers own interpretation of the divorce passages is based on \nthe view that porneia (Greek for sexual indecency) had a different \nmeaning in first century Judaism, when it referred mainly to \nfornication (i.e. sexual sin before marriage). This \nwell-established theory was popularized a few decades ago by the \nCatholic scholar Murphy OConnor, who found supporting evidence in \nthe Dead Sea Scrolls. This interpretation is important for Catholic \nscholars because it means that Jesus did not allow any divorce after \nmarriage has occurred  the same teaching that Piper supports.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls was based on only one \npassage, a particularly difficult one, in the Damascus Document, \nwhich relies on the translation of the word zenut (the Hebrew \nequivalent of porneia) as \"sex before marriage\". Since OConnor put \nforward this theory, however, other scrolls have been studied \n(especially the Temple Scroll) and most scholars have concluded that \nthe early interpretations of this passage were mistaken, and that it \nwas actually forbidding polygamy.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis does not mean that John Pipers non-traditional interpretation \nof porneia is wrong (it is still a possible interpretation that is \nwaiting for more evidence), but it does mean that we do not now have \nmuch evidence that it can be translated this way. In fact, most \nscholars agree that porneia is a general term for sexual sin, as seen \nin the New Testament itself. It is used for visiting a prostitute (1 \nCor.6.13-15, 18), incest (1 Cor.5.1), general sexual sin by a married \nperson (1 Cor.7.2), use of cultic prostitutes (Rev.2.20-21) and the \nsin of the whore of Babylon (Rev.17.2, 4; 18.3; 19.2) - though the \nmost common meaning is sexual sin in general (e.g. Acts 15.20; \nEph.5.3; Col.3.5).\u0014\n\u0014\nIt is a pity that I wasnt clearer when I summarized my book in the \nCT article, but that is the danger of trying to say a great deal in \nfew words. Id like to thank John Piper for helping to set aside some \nof the misconceptions which resulted.\u0014",

In the 4th century, John Chrysostom\u0014\n         (apparently anticipating an American Express slogan) wrote,\u0014\n         Never leave home without making the sign of the cross.\u0014\n           How the sign of the crossthe motion of the hand over\u0014\n         the torso, up, down, then side-to-sidemade its way from\u0014\n         the early church to us today is a lesson in Christian \nhistory. \u0014\n         Over the years, believers imbued this simple gesture\u0014\n         with volumes of theological meaning.\u0014\n         \u0014\n          Holding three fingers togetherthumb,\u0014\n         forefinger, and middle fingeras you\u0014\n         make the sign symbolizes the Trinity. Holding the other two \nfingers\u0014\n         against your palm represents the two natures of Christ, \nhuman \u0014\n         and divine. Dropping the hand from forehead to waist to begin\u0014\n         the gesture represents Christs descent to earth. The upward\u0014\n         movement that follows represents his resurrection. And so on.\u0014\n           \u0014\n         The origins of the sign are unknown. As Andreas \nAndreopoulos, \u0014\n         author of The Sign of the Cross: The Gesture,\u0014\n         the Mystery, the History points out: Our information is\u0014\n         sparse because this ancient practice emerged naturally, as\u0014\n         something that made sense to most Christians. The earliest\u0014\n         descriptions, such as Tertullians, indicate that the cross \nwas\u0014\n         made with one fingerprobably the thumbon the fore-\u0014\n         head in the shape of a Hebrew T or a Greek X, letters that\u0014\n         stood for names of God and Christ. Presumably, early Chris-\u0014\n         tians were taking their cues from passages in Genesis 4:15,\u0014\n         Ezekiel 9:4, and Revelation 14:1 and 22:4, which describe a\u0014\n         mark on the forehead as a sign of Gods claim on a person.\u0014\n       \u0014\n            At some point, Christians began to make the sign with\u0014\n         two fingers rather than one, probably to indicate the two\u0014\n         natures of Christ, and later, with three fingers to symbolize\u0014\n         the Trinity. This change in fingering may have led to the\u0014\n         large crossthe sign made over the entire upper body.\u0014\n         One explanation is that amid 9th-century debates over the\u0014\n         nature of the Trinity, Christians may have wanted to empha-\u0014\n         size that they were now using three fingers rather than two,\u0014\n         and so they used the larger sign to make it more obvious.\u0014\n        \u0014\n            If you think thats getting theologically meticulous, you\u0014\n         havent heard the debates over whether to finish the motion\u0014\n         with a left-to-right movement (left cross) or right-to-left\u0014\n         (right cross). The right cross, still practiced by Eastern\u0014\n         Orthodox believers, symbolizes how Christ descended\u0014\n         from the heavens to the earth, and from the Jews (right) he\u0014\n         passed to the Gentiles (left), according to Pope Innocent\u0014\n         III. In Roman Catholic practice, the left cross has become\u0014\n         standard, showing (in one of many interpretations) that the\u0014\n         believer hopes to be not on Christs leftwith the goats, as \nin\u0014\n         Jesus parableat the day of judgment, but on Christs right.\u0014\n\u0014\n             Andreopoulos explains that all symbols hold within them\u0014\n         a multitude of meanings attained both intentionally and\u0014\n         unconsciously. The sign as an act, however small it may be,\u0014\n         expresses an impetus to cross the threshold between think-\u0014\n         ing and practicing the Christian life.\u0014\n\u0014\n           Many Protestants avoid the sign, assuming it is only a\u0014\n         Catholic practice, or fearing it is a superstition. But the \nsign\u0014\n         does have a Protestant heritage: Martin Luther prescribed the\u0014\n         sign of the cross in his Small Catechism, and the sign has \nlong been\u0014\n         part of Anglican and Lutheran practice.\u0014\n         \u0014\n            So whether we practice it or not, we ought to recognize \nthe sign\u0014\n         of the cross as one manifestation of how physicalhow \nembodied\u0014\n         worship really is. It can be as simple as raising our hands \nduring a\u0014\n         praise song, sitting up straight during the first few chords \nof a hymn,\u0014\n         or closing oure eyes and folding our hands to pray. All of \nthese \u0014\n         motions have become ingrained in our body language of \nworship.\u0014\n         Like the sign of the cross, they contain great potential to \nphysically\u0014\n         demonstrate and recall a deeper meaningand also great\u0014\n         potential to become so routine that eventually we do them\u0014\n         out of habitor worse, for show.\u0014\n          \u0014\n             Centuries ago, Chrysostom admonished us to mean what\u0014\n         we do. You should not just trace the cross with your \nfinger,\u0014\n         he wrote, but you should do it in faith. His words bear\u0014\n         remembering during all our expressions of worship, old or\u0014\n         new, liturgical or charismatic, public or private.\u0014\n         \u0014\n             Nathan Bierma is communications and research coordinator\u0014\n         for the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship and author of \nBringing\u0014\n         Heaven Down to Earth: Connecting This Life to the Next.\u0014",

I've interviewed them, \nwatched them operate, observed them with patients and just plain hung \nout with them. Some were friendly, others cranky. Some were arrogant, \nothers humble and selfless. As a group, they have impressed me with \ntheir confidence, intelligence and dedication to helping people in \nneed. From the outside, the doctor's life seems a rich and rewarding \none. And surely it is. But a new documentary, \"Struggling in Silence\" \n(airing next month on public-television stations), explores a dark \nside of the professionthe little-known and rarely discussed problem \nof depression and suicide among physicians. The unsettling truth is \nthat doctors have the highest rate of suicide of any profession. \nEvery year, between 300 and 400 physicians take their own \nlivesroughly one a day. And, in sharp contrast to the general \npopulation, where male suicides outnumber female suicides four to \none, the suicide rate among male and female doctors is the same.\u0014\n\u0014\nNewsweek, 4/28/08\u0014",

    "words": "(Phoebe) she is called a deacon (diakonon) of the\u0014\nchurch at Cenchreae (v. 1b). Deacons are mentioned in\u0014\nPhilippians 1:1; the women in 1 Timothy 3:11 are almost certainly\u0014\nfemale deacons; Pliny, Epistle 10.96.8, refers to two female slaves\u0014\ncalled ministrae in Bithynia; a sixth-century inscription found on\u0014\nthe Mount of Olives describes a deaconess called Sophie as the\u0014\nsecond Phoebe. The NASVs and NIVs translation as servant\u0014\nis inadequate. Phoebe was a deacon, the first deacon named in\u0014\nChristian history! Origen, in his Commentary on the Epistle to the\u0014\nRomans, had this to say:\u0014\n\u0014\nThis passage teaches that there were women ordained in the churchs\u0014\nministry by the apostles authority. . . . Not only thatthey ought to\u0014\nbe ordained into the ministry, because they helped in many ways and\u0014\nby their good services deserved the praise even of the apostle.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Talbert, Epistle to the Romans, Smith & Helwys\u0014\n\u0014\n-------\u0014\n\u0014\nThe evidence for a woman deacon (Phoebe, Rom 16:1-2), a\u0014\nwoman apostle (Junia, Rom 16:7), and various female laborers for\u0014\nthe Christian cause (Rom 16:6, Mary who has worked very hard\u0014\namong you; 16:12a, Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord;\u0014\n16:12b, Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord; 16:13, Rufuss\u0014\nmother who has been a mother to Paul; cf. Phil 4:2-3, Euodia and\u0014\nSyntyche who have struggled beside Paul in the work of the gospel;\u0014\n1 Cor 11:4, women pray and prophesy in church) in the time of\u0014\nPaul raises the question about the role of women in Christian\u0014\nministry.\u0014\n\u0014\nCertain Christians are willing to grant the evidence even for a\u0014\nwoman deacon and a woman apostle but then offer qualifiers.\u0014\nThomas R. Schreiner is an example. About Phoebe, he has said:\u0014\nThe office of deacon, however, must be distinguished from that of\u0014\noverseer/elder. . . . One should not conclude from Phoebes role as a\u0014\ndeacon that she functioned as a leader of the congregation.\u0014\nRegarding Junia, he has argued:\u0014\n\u0014\nOne should scarcely conclude from the reference to Junia and the\u0014\nother women coworkers named here that women exercised authority\u0014\nover men contrary to the Pauline admonition in 1 Timothy 2:12.  We\u0014\nsee evidence that women functioned as early Christian missionaries,\u0014\nand it may have been the case that they concentrated especially on\u0014\nother women, given the patriarchal nature of the Greco-Roman\u0014\nworld. The Pauline pattern prescribed in 1 Timothy 2:11-15 was the\u0014\napostolic pattern in the early Christian mission, and the vibrant \nministry\u0014\nof Christian women did not contradict the admonitions\u0014\ndelivered in 1 Timothy 2.20.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo questions must be raised about such a position. First, in Acts\u0014\n18:26 we hear that Priscilla and Aquila took Apollos aside and\u0014\nexplained the Way to him more accurately. Here a woman is a\u0014\nteacher of a male preacher, behavior that is approved of by the\u0014\nauthor of Acts. Moreover, the fact that she is mentioned first in the\u0014\nbest manuscripts indicates that she is regarded as the dominant\u0014\nauthority (cf. Acts 13:2, Barnabas and Saul; 13:13, Paul and his\u0014\ncompanions, etc.). So, in a document from the Pauline wing of the\u0014\nchurch, in the same geographical area as the Pastorals, from about\u0014\nthe same time as the Pastorals, we have a womans teaching and\u0014\nhaving authority over a male preacher approved. How, then, should\u0014\none read 1 Timothys rejection of womens teaching?\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, it is necessary to ask about the historical occasion of the\u0014\nPastoral epistles. They were written to counteract heresy in the\u0014\nchurches addressed by these three little letters. The technique used\u0014\nto protect against heresy was the principle of succession. God gave\u0014\nthe true tradition to Paul (2 Tim 1:11-12). Paul delivered it to\u0014\nTimothy (2 Tim 1:13-14) before many witnesses (2 Tim 2:2a).\u0014\nTimothy is to entrust this tradition to faithful men (contra\u0014\nNRSVs faithful people; 2 Tim 2:2b) who will be able to teach\u0014\nothers also. The author believed that if the churches listen only to\u0014\nauthorized teachers, those who received their teaching from\u0014\nTimothy who got it from Paul who received it from God, they will\u0014\nbe protected against the false teaching circulating in the communities\u0014\naddressed. Who were the members most susceptible to the false\u0014\nteaching? In this particular case it was the women (2 Tim 3:6-7). In\u0014\nsuch a situation, using such a technique, those most susceptible to\u0014\nheresy would hardly be entrusted with the task of teaching. In this\u0014\ncase, the women members were like Eve who had been deceived by\u0014\nSatan. In this case, only men could teach. Read in this way, it is\u0014\nclear that the issue is not gender but orthodoxy and heresy. The\u0014\nwomen are not prohibited from teaching because they are women\u0014\nbut because they are caught up in heresy. Viewed in such a light,\u0014\nthe differences between Acts 18 and the Pastoral epistles become\u0014\nclear. When women are teaching the true Pauline tradition (like\u0014\nPriscilla is doing), they can teach;....\u0014",

The slaughter of five schoolgirls and the wounding \nof five others  by a gunman who then shot himself  was an \nunimaginable trauma, for any community, but especially for a deeply \nreligious, nonviolent people like the Amish.

H. Williams, and John Anthony \nMcGuckin | posted 7/01/2008\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nAll Aboard? \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Nicaea lives on in the imagination of the Church, both \nEast and West. In this photograph taken in 1925, Russian Orthodox \npatriarchs prepare to board a train for St. David's, Wales, to \ncelebrate Nicaea's 16th centenary. In Rome that same year, Pope Pius \nXI planned a party of his own in the Vatican basilica, declaring \nNicaea a formative event for the Catholic understanding of the nature \nof Christ. \u0014\n\u0014\nProtestants too have honored Nicaea in their own way. Anglicans, \namong others, recite the Nicene Creed in church every Sunday, and \nmany Protestants (perhaps unknowingly) celebrate Nicaea in their \nhymns. One of the most beloved is Reginald Heber's \"Holy, Holy, Holy, \nLord God Almighty,\" which ends with a rousing \"God in Three Persons, \nblessed Trinity.\" Written for Trinity Sunday, the hymn was set to \nmusic by John B. Dykes, who named the tune \"Nicaea.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nWipe Out Those Arian Barbarians \u0014\n\u0014\nTheodosius the Great may have dealt a death blow to Arians in the \nRoman Empire at the Council of Constantinople (381), but the heresy \ngot a new lease on life among the barbarian Goths. Particularly \ninfluential was Theodoric the Great (d. 526), a ruthless military \ntactician (he murdered his rival) who adopted Arianism as his \nreligion and built numerous Arian churches in Raverina, Italy. When \nthe Byzantine Emperor Justinian recovered Ravenna in 535, he resolved \nto erase any Arian influence from the city. One example is a mosaic \nin the Basilica of San Apollinare Nuovo, formerly Theodoric's palace \nchurch, that has obviously been alteredthe mosaic likely originally \ndisplayed Theodoric with his family or members of his court. Look \nclosely, and you can still see in the far left column a hand that \nJustinian's artists apparently missed. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt Didn't Start with Alexander and Arius \u0014\n\u0014\nMost historians of the Council of Nicaea begin their story with the \nfiery exchange of words between Arius and Alexander. But the \ndiscussion of the nature of Christ has a much longer history in the \nchurch. The great third-century theologian Origen, for example, \npressed a bishop named Heraclides to define the relationship of \nChrist to God the Father. After much careful questioning, Heraclides \nadmitted to believing in two Gods but clarified that \"the power is \none.\" Origen reminded Heraclides that some Christians would \"take \noffense at the statement that there are two Gods. We must express the \ndoctrine carefully to show in what sense they are two, and in what \nsense the two are one God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Nicene Creed Isn't What You Think It Is \u0014\n\u0014\nThe creed you may recite in church each Sunday is not the original \ncreed as crafted by the Council of Nicaea in 325. It is, in fact, a \nmore developed version of the creed as issued by the Council of \nConstantinople in 381. The original Nicene creed had fewer clauses \nand a much simpler theology of the Holy Spirit. It also had an \n\"anathema\" or legal condemnation that directly attacked the Arian \nposition. The later council dropped this to make the creed more \nuniversally applicable. To compare the two side-by- side, see Which \nCreed Is Which?.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt's Not All About Doctrine \u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishops who met at Nicaea discussed other mat ter besides \ntheological ones. They needed to decide on a universal date for \nEaster, as well as resolving such prob lem as what to do with \nChristians who had renounced their faith during the persecutions and \nwhat sort of marriag restrictions to place on clergy .\u0014\n\u0014\nIt Could Have Been the Ancyran Creed \u0014\n\u0014\nThe Council of Nicaea had been originally planned to meet in the city \nof Ancyra (modem Ankara in central Turkey), but Constantine moved the \nlocation to Nicaea only two or three months before the council's \nopening meeting. \u0014\n\u0014\nNo Hometown Referee \u0014\n\u0014\nThe bishop of Nicaea, Theognis, was not a supporter of the creed that \nthe council produced, even though he signed it. He argued that \nArius's views had been misrepresented and rejected the anathema \nattached to the creed. For this reason, he, along with Eusebius of \nNicomedia.\u0014\n\u0014\nDid Someone Forget to Get a Count? \u0014\n\u0014\nHow many bishops attended the Council of Nicaea? Unfortunately, no \noriginal, authoritative list from the council survives. Eusebius of \nCaesarea says \"more than 250\" were in attendance, whereas Athanasius \nclaims there were \"300 of them, more or less.\" Ambrose of Milan would \nlater peg the number at 318, but that number was erroneously inspired \nby a story in Genesis in which Abraham and his household of 318 rout \nthe forces of four wicked kings (in the same way, the Council exposed \nthe evil errors of Arius).\u0014\n\u0014\nMore reliable are multiple medieval lists in Greek, Latin, Syriac, \nCoptic, Arabic, and Armenian that reflect the names of that original \nlist with varying accuracy. The earliest manuscripts list between 194 \nand 220 names, though the more probable figure is closer to 200. \u0014\n\u0014\nWe also know that most bishops were accompanied by fellow clergy, \npresbyters, and deaconsplacing the total number of attendees close \nto a thousand or more. The sheer size of the assembly had no \nprecedent in church history.\u0014",

Sports moved to the back burner after I spent a week \nin a courtroom and saw my son sentenced to 65 years in prison. \u0014\n\u0014\nI spent days wrestling over whether to address Damon's sad situation \nin a column and finally decided it was something I needed to do. \nAmong the many reasons leading to my decision was an outpouring of \nlove, prayers and compassion from family and friends, and from some \nfolks my wife, Genie, and I don't even know.\u0014\n\u0014\nThese words on a card from Betty and Gene Scott sum it all up. \"If \nyou could listen to all the thoughts going out to you now, you'd hear \na symphony of warmth and caring.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSo where do you start to explain how the high school quarterback, the \nAll-American boy, the kid most everybody from his hometown really \nliked could end up breaking our hearts? In this case, the answer is \nas simple as two words  methamphetamine addiction.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat's another reason I wanted to write this column. If I can reach \none kid, one parent with the human tragedy crystal meth made of Damon \nWest, it will be my greatest achievement as a writer. Hopefully, I \ncan connect with more than one because this insidious drug is all too \navailable.\u0014\n\u0014\nAnybody with concerns should go to the Web site www.meth911.net. \nJumping off the top of the lead page in bold letters is the quote, \n\"The first thing people on methamphetamines lose is their common \nsense.\" It gets more eye-opening from there.\u0014\n\u0014\nDamon lost his common sense, his grasp of reality and eventually his \nfreedom. He wasn't the same person who left home 15 years ago with a \nfootball scholarship to North Texas, the same guy who as recently as \n2004 was impressing heavyweights in the Democratic Party as a \nfund-raiser for presidential candidate Dick Gephardt.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe downfall began after he moved to Dallas in 2005. Our alarm bells \nstarted going off a year or so later. He began dating a stripper who \nwas bad news and told us he was working for a limousine service and \non the side buying things to resell from storage facilities. At times \nhe would get belligerent with us over the phone.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe began to suspect drug use. On the rare occasions he came home, we \npleaded with him to get out of Dallas and move back in with us.

    "words": "Drafting Guys over 60 ----was obviously written by a former Soldier. \u0014\n\u0014\nI am over 60 and the Armed Forces think I'm too old to track down \nterrorists. You can't be older than 42 to join the military. They've \ngot the whole thing ass-backwards. Instead of sending 18-year olds \noff to fight, they ought to take us old guys. You shouldn't be able \nto join a military unit until you're at least 35. For starters: \nResearchers say 18-year-olds think about sex every 10 seconds. Old \nguys only think about sex a couple of times a day, leaving us more \nthan 28,000 additional seconds per day to concentrate on the enemy.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung guys haven't lived long enough to be cranky, and a cranky \nsoldier is a dangerous soldier. 'My back hurts! I can't sleep, I'm \ntired and hungry'. We are impatient and maybe letting us kill some \nasshole that desperately deserves it will make us feel better and \nshut us up for a while. An 18-year-old doesn't even like to get up \nbefore 10 AM. Old guys always get up early to pee so what the hell. \nBesides, like I said, 'I'm tired and can't sleep and since I'm \nalready up, I may as well be up killing some fanatical SOB.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf captured we couldn't spill the beans because we'd forget where we \nput them. In fact, name, rank, and serial number would be a real \nstretch. Boot camp would be easier for old guys. We're used to \ngetting screamed and yelled at and we're used to soft food. We've \nalso developed an appreciation for guns. We've been using them for \nyears as an excuse to get out of the house, away from the screaming \nand yelling.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey could lighten up on the obstacle course however. I've been in \ncombat and didn't see a single 20-foot wall with rope hanging over \nthe side, nor did I ever do any pushups after completing basic \ntraining. Actually, the running part is kind of a waste of energy, \ntoo. I've never seen anyone outrun a bullet.\u0014\n\u0014\nAn 18-year-old has the whole world ahead of him. He's still learning \nto shave, to start up a conversation with a pretty girl. He still \nhasn't figured out that a baseball cap has a brim to shade his eyes, \nnot the back of his head. These are all great reasons to keep our \nkids at home to learn a little more about life before sending them \noff into harm's way.\u0014\n\u0014\nLet us old guys track down those dirty rotten coward terrorists. The \nlast thing an enemy would want to see is a couple of million pissed \noff old farts with attitudes and automatic weapons who know that \ntheir best years are already behind them. How about recruiting women \nover 50 with PMS! You think men have attitudes! Oh my Lord! If \nnothing else, put them on Border Patrol. We will have it secured the \nfirst night!\u0014",

His critics suggest his atheism makes him unfit for \npublic office. \u0014\n \u0014\nThe citizens of Ashville, N.C., recently elected an atheist, Cecil \nBothwell, to serve on their city council, but North Carolina's state \nconstitution prohibits anyone \"who shall deny the being of Almighty \nGod\" from holding public office.\u0014\n \u0014\nArticle VI of the U.S. Constitution, however, says \"no religious test \nshall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public \ntrust under the United States.\" Some conservatives had suggested that \nBothwell not be sworn in until the conflict between the state's \nconstitution and the U.S. Constitution could be resolved. Never mind \nthat the U.S. Constitution clearly trumps the state's.\u0014\n\u0014\nBryan Fischer of the American Family Association suggests that \nArticle VI does not apply in North Carolina or any other state. \nFischer and the Religious Right have long been reviving \"states \nrights\" arguments that legitimated the losing causes of the Civil War \nera. This time, instead of slavery, they are trying to legitimate the \nestablishment of religion and the persecution of persons of minority \nfaith and no faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe 14th Amendment protects a person's rights from being denied by \nany state. If the Religious Right and Fischer's contentions were true \n and the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to all the rights contained in \nthe Bill of Rights to the citizens of every state  what else would \nthat mean?\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would mean that freedom of speech, press, assembly, petition and \nthe free exercise of religion are no longer rights but mere benefits \ngranted and withdrawn at the shifting whims of the electorate in \nevery state. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt would mean that no one can be sure that they will be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures or free from cruel and unusual \npunishment. It would mean that we have no guarantee of legal counsel \nor of a speedy trial or of a public trial before a jury of our peers. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn effect, it would make the Constitution of the United States and \nthe Bill of Rights a hollow and meaningless document.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt wouldn't surprise me if Fischer and the Religious Right would \ngladly trade these birthrights for a bowl or two of Christian \nNationalist porridge.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt would surprise me if they would be happy to learn that they were \nno longer guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms  and that would \nalso be in jeopardy.\u0014\n\u0014\nBruce Prescott is executive director of Mainstream Oklahoma Baptists\u0014",

She and her \nhusband were planning a week's vacation in Florida, so she wrote to a \nparticular campground asking for a reservation.She wanted to make \nsure the campground was fully equipped, but didn't quite know how to \nask about the toilet facilities. She just couldn't bring herself to \nwrite the word \"toilet\" in her letter. After much deliberation, she \nfinally came up with the old-fashioned term BATHROOM COMMODE. But \nwhen she wrote that down, she still thought she was being too \nforward. So she started all over again and rewrote the entire letter \nreferring to the bathroom commode merely as the BC.\u0014\n\u0014\n \"Does the campground have it's own BC?\" is what she actually wrote.\u0014\n\u0014\nWell, the campground owner wasn't old-fashioned at all, and when he \ngot the letter, he just couldn't figure out what the woman was \ntalking about. That BC business really stumped him.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter worrying about it for awhile, he showed the letter to several \ncampers, but they couldn't imagine what the lady meant either. So the \ncampground owner, finally coming to the conclusion that the lady must \nbe asking about he local Baptist Church, sat down and wrote the \nfollowing reply:\u0014\n\u0014\nI regret very much the delay in answering your letter, but I now take \npleasure in informing you that a BC is located nine miles north of \nthe campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time. I \nadmit it is quite a distance away, if you are in the habit of going \nregularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great \nnumber of people take their lunches along and make a day of it. They \nusually arrive early and stay late. It is such a beautiful facility \nand the acoustics are marvelous. Even the normal delivery sounds can \nbe heard\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last time my wife and I went was six years ago, and it was so \ncrowded we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may \ninterest you to know that right now a supper is planned to raise \nmoney to buy more seats. \u0014\n\u0014\nI would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more \nregularly, but it surely is no lack of desire on my part. As we grow \nold, it seems to be more of an effort, particularly in cold weather.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf you do decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go \nwith you the first time you go, sit with you, and introduce you to \nall the other folks.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemember, this is a friendly community.\u0014",

After the war was over, Israeli scientists analyzed \nthe official mortality statistics and found something remarkable. \nAlthough the death rate had jumped among Israeli citizens on the \nfirst day of the Iraqi attacks, the vast majority of them did not die \nfrom any direct physical effects of the missiles. They died from \nheart failure brought on by fear and stress associated with the \nbombardment.\u0014\n\u0014\nPsychological studies conducted on Israelis at the time showed that \nthe most stressful time was the first few days leading up to the \noutbreak of war on January 17 and peaking on the first day of the \nScud missile attacks. There was enormous and well-founded concern \nabout possible Iraqi use of chemical and biological weapons. The \ngovernment had issued to the entire Israeli population gas masks and \nautomatic atropine syringes in case of chemical attack, and every \nhousehold had been told to prepare a sealed room.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the first Iraqi strike turned out to be less cataclysmic than \nfeared, levels of stress declined markedly. As in other wars, the \npeople adapted to the situation with surprising speed. Then as the \nfear and anxiety subsided, the death rate also declined. There were \n17 further Iraqi missile attacks over the following weeks, but \nIsraeli mortality figures over this period were no higher than \naverage.\u0014\n\u0014\nIt was fear and the psychological impact of the missiles, not the \nphysical impact that claimed the majority of victims.\u0014",

    "words": "They were deaf, but they were not silent. For decades, a group of men \nwho were sexually abused as children by the Rev. \\Lawrence C. Murphy \nat a school for the deaf in Wisconsin reported to every type of \nofficial they could think of that he was a danger, according to the \nvictims and church documents. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey told other priests. They told three archbishops of Milwaukee. \nThey told two police departments and the district attorney. They used \nsign language, written affidavits and graphic gestures to show what \nexactly Father Murphy had done to them. But their reports fell on the \ndeaf ears of hearing people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThis week, they learned that Cardinal \\Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope \nBenedict XVI, received \\letters about Father Murphy in 1996 from \nArchbishop \\Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, who said that the deaf \ncommunity needed a healing response from the Church. The \\Vatican \nsat on the case, then equivocated, and when Father Murphy died in \n1998, he died a priest. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat man should have been in prison for a very long time, but he was \nlucky, Steven Geier, one of Father Murphy's victims, said Thursday. \nWhat about me? I wasn't supposed to touch girls. What gave him the \nright to be able to do that? Father Murphy constantly thought about \nsex with children, and he got away with it.\u0014\n\u0014\nYoung victims of sexual abuse are often so confused, ashamed or \ntraumatized that they wait years to report the violations. Some never \nsay a word. One of the remarkable aspects of the Father Murphy case \nis that young victims began alerting the authorities in the \nmid-1950s, when sexual abuse was hardly even a part of the public \nvocabulary. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn his ranch house in Madison, where he lives with his wife, Ann, and \ntwo dachshunds, Mr. Geier said through an interpreter that he entered \nSt. John's School for the Deaf in St. Francis, Wis., when he was 9. \nHis father had helped build a Catholic church in rural Dane County, \nand his aunt was a nun. His family wanted him to get a good education \nin a Catholic school. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Geier, now 59, said that between the ages of 14 and 15, starting \naround 1965, Father Murphy molested him four times in a closet at the \nschool. The priest, a hearing man fluent in sign language, said that \nGod wanted him to teach the boy about sex but that he had to keep it \nquiet because it was under the sacrament of confession. Mr. Geier \nsaid he felt sick. \u0014\n\u0014\nFirst thing in the morning, Mr. Geier said, we took communion, and \nas he passed out the communion wafers, I thought about how many boys \ndid he touch with those hands and all of the germs, all of the filth \nof his hands.\u0014\n\u0014\nFather Murphy may have molested as many as 200 boys while he worked \nat the school from 1950 to 1974, according to the accounts of victims \nand a social worker hired by the Archdiocese of Milwaukee to \ninterview him. \u0014\n\u0014\nMr. Geier said he first tried to tell the priest at his home parish \nin Madison, where he served as an altar boy, in 1966 when he was just \n16. But the priest, he said, told him he did not want to hear about \nit, and to just forget about it. He told another priest while he was \nstill a teenager, and yet a third priest years later, after he \nmarried.\u0014\n\u0014\nFor full article, see Word/MyDocuments/Deaf Boys Tried to Tell\u0014",

He and his associates asked over \n10,000 people in various parts of the world certain questions about \nreligious faith. One of the questions in the BBC survey was, \"Does \nsuffering in the world make it harder for you to believe in God?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nAs he began to tabulate the results, Mr. Vine found something that \nsurprised him to no end. When he asked that question in Britain, he \ndiscovered that large portions of the population said yes, the \nreality of human suffering is an obstacle to faith. But when he asked \nthe same question in Lagos, Nigeria, or Delhi, India  chronically \npoor and overpopulated places where life is short and difficult, and \npeople are literally dying in the streets  a very different answer \ncame back. Comparatively few people in those poverty-stricken places \nsaid that suffering in the world made it harder for them to have \nfaith.\u0014\n Jeremy Vine, \"Beyond Belief,\" in The Guardian, February 23, 2004\u0014",

    "words": "What is it that Christians ought to say and do about the issue of \nsexual relations between single people? This question currently \npresses most painfully upon the life of the churches. The real issue \nis not whether the churches ought to adopt a new sexual ethic, but \nwhether the new sexual ethic they are in fact in the process of \nadopting is one that is worthy of (their) calling. Let me explain.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1982, Newsweek published the results of a poll carried out by two \nscholars at Johns Hopkins University. It showed that one out of every \nfive young women who reach the age of 15 admitted to having had \nsexual intercourse. By the time these young women reach 16 the figure \nrises to one in three, and by the time they are 17 the number is one \nof every two. If we add to this the sexual activity of young men of \nthe same age, of gay men and lesbian women at a later stage of life \nand that of unmarried and divorced heterosexual couples, it becomes \nclear that the sexual practice of people in our society is quite \ndifferent from that held to be normative by the traditional teaching \nof the churches. \u0014\n\u0014\n- Philip Turner, Sex and the single life, First Things, May 1993, \n15.\u0014",

Matthew and\u0014\n         Mark have Jesus on his way to Galilee by the time the women \narrive at the tomb,\u0014\n         while Luke and John have Jesus in Jerusalem on the night of \nthe first Easter Sunday.\u0014\n         Luke's gospel says the disciples stayed continually in the \ntemple because Jesus\u0014\n         had told them to wait in Jerusalem until they had been \nclothed with power from on\u0014\n         high. But John's gospel has the disciples returning to \ntheir fishing trade in Galilee,\u0014\n         where Matthew has Jesus appearing and commissioning the \neleven in Galilee.\u0014\n         John's gospel mentions an appearance of Jesus and says: \nthis was now the third\u0014\n         time Jesus appeared to his disciples' (21:14) but Paul's \nlist and order of appearances\u0014\n         (1 Cor. 15:5~8) doesn't square with John's order of \nappearances. Paul doesn't men-\u0014\n         tion any appearances to women.\u0014\n\u0014\n            There are three major discrepancies. First, the synoptic \nGospels disagree with\u0014\n         John, by having women visit the tomb, encounter angels, and \nsuccessfully relay the\u0014\n         angelic message, while John has the women encounter no \nangels on their first visit\u0014\n         and no message is relayed. Second, Matthew describes the \nangelic descent, earth-\u0014\n         quake, and removal of the stone after the women arrive, in \ncontrast to the other\u0014\n         gospels, which have the stone already rolled away before the \nwomen arrive. Third.\u0014\n         Luke mentions that Jesus appeared on the first Easter Sunday \nto eleven men (24:l3,\u0014\n         36), which would imply Doubting Thomas was present (minus \nJudas), while John\u0014\n         denies that Thomas was there (20:1924). These are three \nexplicit contradictions in\u0014\n         the resurrection narratives.\u0014",

He did not \nexpect to live. He was so sick, in fact, that he had prepared a \nfarewell sermon to preach later on this morning, September 4, 1847. \nMeanwhile he drew a paper toward him on which he had begun to write \nsome verses: \u0014\n\u0014\nAbide with me; fast falls the eventide; \u0014\nThe darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. \u0014\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\u0014\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me. \u0014\n\u0014\nHis mind passed back over his life as he touched up the stanzas; and \nhe wrote, \"Thou on my head in early youth did smile...\" Henry's \nloving mother had taught him Bible stories and God's love. However, \nhis father abandoned the family. Henry's mother soon died. \nNine-year-old Henry was left alone in the world. A kindly Irish \nminister named Dr. Robert Burrows, with five children of his own, \ntook Henry in and put him through school. (Later Henry paid the Rev. \nBurrow back all that he owed him.)\u0014\n\u0014\nHenry planned to study medicine but weak health forced him to turn to \nthe ministry instead. He won prizes at Trinity College, Dublin for \npoems--three years in a row--and a scholarship. In 1814 he graduated, \nand was ordained as a minister of the Church of England the next year.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe young clergyman tended Abraham Swanne, a dying pastor. Swanne's \ndeep faith and fearlessness in the face of death made a strong \nimpression on Henry. He helped Swanne's wife and family arrange their \naffairs while carrying on his own pastoral duties. As a consequence \nof his overwork, his health broke down. He had to go to warmer France \nto regain his health. \u0014\n\u0014\nHenry pastored English churches the rest of his life. Twenty-three of \nthose years were at Brixham, a Devonshire fishing town. His people \nloved him, for he took a strong interest in their work and visited \nthe boats whenever they returned from sea. Anna Maxwell, his wife, \nvisited the sick and lent a hand in the town's projects. By careful \nmanagement of household expenses, she saved enough money to send \nHenry to warmer France and Italy by himself every winter.\u0014\n\u0014\nFifty-four-year-old Henry was used to living with one foot in the \ngrave when he preached his final sermon. He reminded his hearers that \nwe must all die and that those who have embraced the death of Christ \nin their lives are best prepared to face the body's death. \"I stand \nhere among you today, as alive from the dead, if I may hope to \nimpress it upon you, and induce you to prepare for that solemn hour \nwhich must come to all, by a timely acquaintance with the death of \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHe planned to go to Italy where he hoped sunshine and warmth would \nrestore him. He made it only as far as Nice, France. There he became \nso ill he had to rest. Again God stayed with him in the form of an \nEnglish clergyman who nursed him. Ten weeks after preaching his \nfarewell sermon, Henry died. \u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\nBoreham, F. W. \"Abide with Me,\" in A Late Lark Singing.

    "words": "January 17. 1525\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Ulrich Zwingli preached in Zurich, he sought to bring reformation \nto Switzerland within the context of the established state church. In \nZurich and throughout Europe, there was little difference between \nstate and church. All babies baptized were thereby considered members \nof the church and citizens of the city. But Conrad Grebel and Felix \nManz, impatient with Zwingli's reforms, began holding Bible classes \nin private homes, and their investigation of Scripture raised \nquestions about state-sponsored sprinkling of infants.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Grebel's wife gave birth to a son the stage was set for \nconflict. On January 17, 1525, the Zurich City Council arranged a \npublic debate on the issue. Zwingli insisted that all children be \nbaptized by their eighth day, while Grebel and Manz argued that \nbaptism symbolized a believer's commitment to Christ. They lost.\u0014\n\u0014\nFour days later under cloak of darkness, a dozen men trudged through \nfalling snow to Manz's house. After kneeling in prayer, one of them, \nGeorge Blaurock, asked Grebel to baptize him in the apostolic \nfashionupon his confession of personal faith in Christ. Grebel did \nso, then Blaurock, a former priest, baptized the others.\u0014\n\u0014\nZwingli was incensed, and these radical reformers were soon driven \nfrom Zurich. They established a congregation in the nearby village of \nZollikon, the first \"free\" church of modern times. But they weren't \nfree from Zwingli, who hounded them, or from Zurich's arm of \npersecution.\u0014\n\u0014\nGrebel, his health failing in prison, died of the plague. Blaurock \nwas burned at the stake. And Zurich officials decided that if Manz \nwanted baptism so badly, they would give it to him. Taking him from \nWellenberg prison, they bound his arms and legs. As they rowed down \nthe middle of Zurich's Limmat River, his mother shouted over the \nsplashing oars for him to remain true to Christ. After he sang \"Into \nthy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit,\" he was rolled overboard, and \nthe cold waters of Lake Zurich closed over his head.\u0014",

But public pressure is beginning to count, too. \nAn attempt to persuade the Congress to ban the eating of dog- and \ncat-meat has captivated the Chinese press and caused an uproar. A \nproposed animal-rights law, circulated in draft last September by \nChinese activists and legal experts, would be the first of its kind \nin a country where animal welfare rarely seems a priority. \u0014\n\u0014\nPigs destined for slaughter are often seen crammed excruciatingly \ntightly in cages on the backs of lorries. In safari parks visitors \nhappily pay to dangle live chickens into lions dens, or even to have \na live calf dragged by its legs behind a jeep past ravenous tigers. \nBut a fast growing middle class, despite enjoying gory outings, is \nalso fond of pet dogs and cats.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis creates conflict with ancient eating habits. Dogs are a popular \ndish in many parts of China, not least among ethnic Koreans in the \nnorth-east. Dog restaurants are also common in Beijing. Many believe \nthat eating dog helps keep the human body warm in winter. Cats are \npopular in southern China. The sweet-tasting meat has been served to \nyour correspondent, diced into small cubes reassembled in feline form \nwith fur-stripped paws sticking in the air. The wretchedness of its \nforeshortened life was left to the imagination.\u0014\n\u0014\nDogs were once banned in many urban areas, but in recent years the \ngovernment has caved in to soaring demand. For each household Beijing \nstill has a one-dog policy and decrees that they must not be taller \nthan 35cm (14 inches). They are nonetheless ubiquitous. The proposed \nlaw would make theillegal consumption or sale of dog- or cat-meat \npunishable by a fine of up to 5,000 yuan ($730) or imprisonment for \nup to 15 days. But opponents are still many and vociferous both in \nthe press and online. Dog-eating, they argue, is a time-honoured \ntradition and China is not yet ready for Western-style prissiness \nabout consuming such animals. Perhaps, they suggest hopefully, the \nword illegal could be taken to mean that there might still be a \nlegal way of killing cats and dogs for the table.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Congress admitted two years ago that better laws were needed to \nprevent cruelty to animals. But this one is not yet on the agenda.\u0014",

    "words": "November 10, 1871 \u0014\nDr. Livingstone, I Presume?\u0014\n\u0014\nFor years, no one had heard from the Scottish missionary explorer, \nDavid Livingstone. In l866, he had disappeared into the East African \ninterior, searching for the source of the River Nile. Livingstone's \nreports of his earlier explorations in Africa had fascinated \nmultitudes of readers at home. Once asked why he decided to be a \nmissionary, Livingstone replied: \"I was compelled by the love of \nChrist.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nHis Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa, published in \n1857, told of treks totaling more than 20,000 miles back and forth \nacross the African continent. His explorations provided valuable \ninformation about the people and geography of Africa's interior. \nHowever, when he didn't know, he guessed; and his dreams were often \nbigger than the facts; this cost a number of missionary their lives \nbecause they relied on his accounts. James Stewart (founder of \nLovedale mission) was so disgusted with Livingstone's personal life \nand misinformation that he threw one of his books into an African \nriver.\u0014\n\u0014\nAll the same, Livingstone awakened the world to the horror of the \nArab slave trade, which he called a \"monster of iniquity brooding \nover Africa.\" By publicizing the evil of slavery, Livingstone worked \neffectively to see it abolished. For every 20,000 slaves captured and \nexported, he estimated 100,000 Africans were killed, wounded, or died \nof disease on the slave trails. He wrote: \"The many skeletons we have \nseen along the paths of the wilderness attest the awful sacrifice of \nhuman life that must be attributed to this trade in hell.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1871, concerned that for five years no one had heard from \nLivingstone and eager to obtain a \"scoop,\" the New York Herald sent \njournalist Henry Stanley to find him. Landing in Zanzibar, Stanley \ntraced Livingstone's steps into the interior. To do so, he had to \nfind his way (sometimes fighting) through hostile territory and \novercome attacks of malaria, the jaws of crocodiles, mutiny and \ndesertion.\u0014\n\u0014\nAfter months of misery, learning that Livingstone was close, Stanley \nand his porters donned their best clothes. At last, on this day, \nNovember 10, 1871, they saw an old white man by the shores of Lake \nTanganyika. Knowing this could be only one person, Stanley greeted \nhim with his now world-famous comment: \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nThe foods Henry brought with him saved Livingstone's life, for he was \ndesperately ill and able to eat only African porridge. \"You have \nbrought me new life,\" said the missionary over and over. Unable to \npersuade Livingstone to leave Africa, Stanley joined him in exploring \npart of Lake Tanganyika and then returned to England. Unlike James \nStewart, Stanley was impressed with Livingstone's Christianity, and \nwrote: \"It is not of the theoretical kind, but it is a constant, \nearnest, sincere practice...and it is always at work.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAdapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story.\u0014\nAllen, John.

    "words": "November 22, 1963 \u0014\n\u0014\n The Death of C.S. Lewis\u0014\n\u0014\nDiana Severance, Ph.D. edited by Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is the date that is remembered around the world and annually \nrecalled on the evening news as the date President John F. Kennedy \nwas assassinated in Dallas in 1963. Far less noticed is the fact that \nanother famous twentieth century figure also died on this date. On \nthis day, November 22, l963 C.S. Lewis (who preferred to be called \n\"Jack\") went to be with the Lion named Aslan.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo understand what that means, we must recall that Jack was one of \nthe world's outstanding writers and a professor of English Literature \nat Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He succeeded in capturing the \nimagination of young and old with his Chronicles of Narnia. These \nseven books tell the story of boys and girls magically stepping \nthrough their wardrobe closet to venture into a fictional land \nprotected by Aslan, a magnificent lion who symbolizes Christ. The \nstories have proved to be more than captivating reading adventures \nfor children. They also have been an effective instrument for \nconverting many to faith in Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nJack referred to himself at age fourteen as a \"happy atheist,\" but \nafter years of analytical thinking, he concluded that knowing Christ \nis the only logical way to understand both man and the universe \naround him. Accepting Christ as his Redeemer at age 30, Jack soon \nachieved worldwide recognition as the author of more than 25 \nChristian writings. Perhaps best known of his non-fiction books is \nMere Christianity, a simple yet strikingly logical statement of why \nthe Gospel is worthy of acceptance.\u0014\n\u0014\nRemarkably, Jack stands out as one of history's gifted geniuses who \nhas had the versatility to fascinate and delight children with his \nsimple stories of Aslan and at the same time challenge the most \nscholarly philosophers with his profound thought and keen logic. One \nof his widely known scholarly writings is English Literature in the \nSixteenth Century. Another, Abolition of Man, was classified by \nEncyclopedia Britannica as one of the Great Books of the World.\u0014\n\u0014\nJack suffered from kidney problems late in life and had to have many \ntransfusions. Once he went into a coma. However, he continued to read \nnew books and reread books he loved. At five thirty on this day, \nNovember 22, 1963, Jack's brother Warnie heard a crash and found Jack \nunconscious. The famous writer died a few minutes later.\u0014\n\u0014\nShadowlands, a BBC film on Jack's life, co-produced with Gateway \nFilms, won the international Emmy award for best drama and spun off a \nstage play and theatrical feature film of the same title, bringing \nthe life of this English professor to a wide popular audience. Today, \nmillions continue to read, enjoy, and benefit from the remarkable \nworks of C.S.

    "title": "DNA CASTS DOUBT ON MAN'S EXECUTION",
    "words": "Doubt on Texas Man's Execution\u0014\n\u0014\nBy \\Nathan Thornburgh  Friday, Nov. 12, 2010, Forbes\u0014\n\u0014\nFor over two decades, the hair was stored in a plastic evidence bag \nin the courthouse in Coldspring, Texas, cataloged as belonging to \nClaude Jones, who was convicted of murder in 1990 and executed 10 \nyears later. Now, it can be relabeled: a court-ordered DNA test found \nThursday that the hair actually belonged to the murder victim Allen \nHilzendager. The result casts significant doubt on the validity of \nJones' conviction and his execution. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat single 1-in. (2.5 cm) strand of hair was the key to Jones' \noriginal conviction. A truck carrying Jones and Danny Dixon did pull \nup in front of Hilzendager's liquor store that night. One man got \nout, went inside and gunned Hilzendager down, according to two \neyewitnesses across the highway (neither could see the murderer's \nface). Both Jones and Dixon were certainly capable of the crime  \nboth were on parole after serving time for murder. But there was \nlittle other firm evidence of which one had done it. Dixon accused \nJones, and Jones accused Dixon. The prosecution's star witness \nagainst Jones was a friend of Dixon's who later said that prosecutors \nhad coerced him into testifying. \u0014\n\u0014\nAnd from the beginning, the evidence was handled questionably. The \nhair expert at the Texas crime lab originally thought the small \nsample was \"unsuitable for comparison\" using the microscopy \ntechnology available at the time, but eventually changed his mind and \ndecided to test it after all. Using that outdated technology  which \nessentially has two hairs examined side by side under a microscope  \nthe expert then determined that the hair belonged to Jones and not \nDixon. \u0014\n\u0014\nThat dubious determination went on to haunt all of Jones' failed \nappeals as well. Time and again, lawyers and judges pointed to the \nphysical evidence against Jones as a damning factor. \u0014\n\u0014\nExcept, in the end, it wasn't. The fact that the hair was actually \nHilzendager's doesn't mean that Jones was necessarily innocent, but \nit does mean that the jury convicted him  and did so quickly  based \nlargely on false evidence. \"What's crucial to understand is that the \nhair was critical evidence in the case,\" says Barry Scheck, whose \nInnocence Project, along with the Texas Observer, led the lawsuit \ndemanding that the hair be subjected to DNA testing. \"I have no doubt \nthe conviction would've been reversed with these results.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nScheck points out the most poignant aspect of the story: Jones came \nvery close to having a chance for that reversal just before he was \nexecuted. At the time, then Governor George W. Bush was on record \nstating that he would delay executions if there were relevant new DNA \ntests that could be performed. Jones' case seemed to fit that bill  \nmitochondrial DNA testing was not available during his trial but was \nin wide use before his final appeals in 2000. Jones' attorney at the \ntime warned the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles that without \nBush's intervention, \"the state of Texas runs the risk of executing a \nman despite the availability of modern technology that might \nexonerate him.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe four-page memo that Bush received from his legal advisers on Dec. \n7, 2000, however, made no mention of a possible new DNA test. It \nended with the assertion that Jones \"has had full and fair access to \njudicial review of his case.\" Bush denied clemency, and Jones was \nexecuted that evening. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"What I'm really hoping is that when President Bush gets an \nopportunity to look at this,\" says Scheck, \"that he would acknowledge \nthat he was blindsided and that an error was made.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nThe new DNA results come during a rough patch for capital punishment \nin Texas. After 18 years in prison  12 of those on death row  \nAnthony Graves was exonerated and walked free in October based on the \nopinion of a special independent prosecutor who found in favor of a \n2006 reversal (stemming from a lack of evidence) of his conviction. \nThat case, in which Graves was convicted of slaughtering a family he \ndidn't know based on the testimony of informants and co-defendants, \nhad one striking similarity with the Jones case: the original \nprosecutors fought fiercely against any suggestions that the \nconvictions might be invalid. \u0014\n\u0014\nAs doubts over the evidence that had convicted Graves swirled in \n2009, prosecutor Charles Sebesta took out full-page ads in local \npapers calling Graves \"cold-blooded.\" \u0014\nIn Jones' case, prosecutor Bill Burnett fought hard to destroy the \nhair before it could be tested, and he took his fight all the way to \nhis grave. The pastor at his funeral in June assailed TIME's coverage \nof the Jones case, in which I had argued in favor of testing, and \nlauded Burnett for being someone who \"took a stand against some \npowerful people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter the evidence findings were revealed Thursday, Hilzendager's \nbrother Joe told the Associated Press that he still thinks Jones was \nthe shooter, staying true to what he had told me in his living room \nalmost a year ago, as he argued against testing the hair: \"There's no \ndoubt they executed the right person.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nBut Jones' son Duane has always believed his father was wrongfully \nconvicted. He says the results aren't a relief and that it's just \n\"disappointing\" to see the missed opportunities for justice. \u0014\n\u0014\n\"It saddens me because you know they spend all the taxpayers' money \nfighting DNA tests,\" he says. \"If you're so confident in your \nconvictions, do the testing. You might find out something new.\"\u0014",

    "words": "Defenders of Incendiary Political Speech Favor the Ethic of Cain\u0014\n\u0014\nBy: Robert Parham\u0014\nPosted: Thursday, January 13, 2011 \u0014\n\u0014\nAmerica's moral discernment is as scrambled as the brain of  the of \nthe alleged Tucson shooter. \u0014\nAfter Jared Lee Loughner allegedly killed six people and wounded 14 \nothers in a shooting spree in Arizona, Pima County Sheriff Clarence \nDupnik addressed the national ethos surrounding the violence. \u0014\n\u0014\nHe spoke about the \"vitriolic rhetoric\" against the government heard \nday in and day out on radio and TV. \u0014\nNo sooner had Dupnik made that observation than those who make a \nliving off creating conflict through verbal bomb-throwing began \ndefending themselves. \u0014\n\u0014\nRush Limbaugh weighed in. Newt Gingrich attacked the left and said \nLoughner was an atheist. Known for attending town hall meetings angry \nand armed, the Tea Party said don't blame us. Others used the \"two \nwrongs make a right\" argument: The other side makes extreme \nstatements, too. Still others said the problem was a mentally ill \nman, not talk radio programs, not cable TV shows, not pundits who say \nhateful things.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut political talk radio and cable TV are places of hate speech:\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\  Glenn Beck spoke on his radio show about murdering Michael Moore \nand accused Moore of helping Hezbollah. He defended Sarah Palin, who \nis being criticized for having crosshairs over the congressional \ndistrict that U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) represents.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\  Rush Limbaugh accused Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Rep. Nancy \nPelosi (D-Calif.) of being terrorists.\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\  Ann Coulter, a frequent guest on cable TV shows, told The New \nYork Observer, \"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go \nto the New York Times building.\" She later clarified that she should \nhave said, \"after everyone had left the building except the editors \nand reporters.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nSuch speech and numerous other examples are morally irresponsible  \nand responsible for the hate-filled public square.\u0014\n\u0014\nThankfully, some leaders are saying it is time to tone down the \nrhetoric.\u0014\n\u0014\nFox News president Roger Ailes said both right and left use extreme \nrhetoric. He also said: \"I told all of our guys, shut up, tone it \ndown, make your argument intellectually. You don't have to do it with \nbombast. I hope the other side does that.\" \u0014\n\u0014\nLong known for his inflammatory rhetoric, Pat Buchanan said \nconservatives needed to be careful.\u0014\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Buchanan said, \"I'd give everybody the \nadvice to tone down the rhetoric and to get away from the military or \nthe armed metaphors.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nYet Sarah Palin bucked the emerging consensus that words matter. She \nissued a video statement Jan. 12 defending her map with crosshairs on \nGiffords' congressional district and asserting that society has no \nresponsibility for individual behavior.\u0014\n\u0014\nA few days after the shooting, adjunct philosophy professor Kent \nSlinker, one of Loughner's teachers at Pima Community College, said \nLoughner was someone \"whose brains were scrambled.\"\u0014\nSlinker observed that the Tucson shooter had thoughts \"unrelated to \nanything in our world.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOur society does have some whose thoughts are \"unrelated\" to reality, \nand those thoughts disclose \"scrambled\" thinking.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen anti-gun control folk argue that \"guns don't kill people  \npeople kill people,\" they are disclosing scrambled moral thinking. \u0014\n\u0014\nOther examples of scrambled thinking:\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\ \"Cigarettes don't kill people  people kill people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\  \"Alcohol doesn't kill people  people kill people.\" \u0014\n\u0014\n\\\\  \"Venomous talk doesn't kill people  people kill people.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the first stories in the Bible contains a question that \nchallenges such moral junk: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\"\u0014\n\u0014\nGoodwill people of faith know that they are keepers of the well-being \nof their brothers and sisters  individually and collectively.\u0014\n\u0014\nIf we act as our brother's keeper, we care that guns, cigarettes, \nalcohol and incendiary political talk can harm. People of good will \nthen take actions to control access to guns, to reduce smoking, to \nstop drunken drivers and to discourage vitriol.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, too many in our society  many of whom light verbal \nfuses for a living  favor the ethic of Cain, who denied having any \nresponsibility for the death of his brother.\u0014\n\u0014\nRobert Parham is executive editor of EthicsDaily.com and executive \ndirector of its parent organization, the Baptist Center for Ethics\u0014",

    "words": "January 14, 1743 \u0014\nDavid Brainerd's Dark Night of the Soul\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid Brainerd, was a legendary pioneer missionary to the American \nIndians. He died in 1747 when he was only 29 years old, but his \njournal has inspired Christians in every generation since. One day in \nDecember, 1742, he made an entry that gave later generations a peek \nat the experience of a believer who has diligently pursued the \npresence of God.\u0014\n\u0014\nBrainerd wrote that on that date he \"had a sweet melting sense of \ndivine things, of the pure spirituality of the religion of Christ \nJesus . . . Oh, the sweetness, the tenderness I felt in my soul! If \never I felt the temper of Christ, I had some sense of it now. Blessed \nbe my God, I have seldom enjoyed a more comfortable and profitable \nday than this. Oh, that I could spend all my time for God.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Brainerd's diary writings take us to the pits as well as to the \nmountain tops. They candidly reveal the times of the \"dark night of \nthe soul,\" as John of the Cross called them. A little more than two \nweeks after Brainerd wrote the jubilant words quoted above, he walked \nthrough spiritual torment.\u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, January 14, 1743, he wrote: \"My spiritual conflicts \ntoday were unspeakably dreadful, heavier than the mountains and \noverflowing floods. I seemed enclosed, as it were, in Hell itself; I \nwas deprived of all sense of God, even of the being of a God; and \nthat was my misery. I had no awful apprehensions of God as angry. \nThis was distress, the nearest akin to the damned's torments, that I \never endured; their torment, I am sure, will consist much in a \nprivation (lack) of God, and consequently of all good. This taught me \nthe absolute dependence of a creature upon God the Creator, for every \ncrumb of happiness it enjoys. Oh I feel that, if there is no God, \nthough I might live for ever here, and enjoy not only this but all \nother worlds, I should be ten thousand times more miserable than a \nreptile. My soul was in such anguish I could not eat; but felt as I \nsuppose a poor wretch would that is just going to the place of \nexecution.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDavid's journal reminds us that following God isn't all peaches and \ncream. There were times when he knew God was wonderfully close but \nother times when he couldn't find him at all. He came to realize what \nmany spiritual giants have also discovered, that even in the dark \nnights God is still with us regardless of inner fluctuations. God is \nmore faithful than our emotions. We can trust Him at all times.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nResources:\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Adapted from an earlier Christian History Institute story\u0014",

    "title": "DOWN WITH KING JAMES II",
    "words": "February 13, 1689 \u0014\n\u0014\nDown with King James II!\u0014\n\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nThe year 1689 witnessed an extraordinary event. William III of Orange \ncame to the throne of England in a bloodless revolution. It was not \nthat England had no king. James II sat in Whitehall and did not \nhesitate to exert his royal prerogative as he saw fit. The problem \nwas the Roman Catholic king used his powers to browbeat Anglicans and \nraise \"papists\" to positions of authority.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames might have kept his throne if he'd been more merciful to rebels \nearly in his reign and more accommodating of the interests of his \npeople. Protestant forms were firmly entrenched and the English had \nno desire to return to the Catholicism whose hierarchy seemed \ncontradictory to the democratic ideals which were coming into vogue. \nFor most Englishman a return to Catholicism seemed a turn from a \ngospel of faith to a life of works; from a liberating parliamentary \nsystem back to a dictatorial monarchy. Liberties were still scarce \nenough that people prized them; and not least of those was the \nprinciple that the king could not override a law of Parliament.\u0014\n\u0014\nJames had a knack for rousing suspicion. He raised a personal army of \n13,000 men, a threat to Parliament; and he accepted subsidies from \nLouis XIV, the Catholic King of France; naturally the Anglican church \nviewed this as a threat. Cruel, dishonest Jeffries became the king's \nleading judge and James made him a lord. James forbade clergymen to \npreach on certain political topics and arrested John Sharp when he \npreached on the motives of converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Universities of Cambridge and Oxford were training grounds for \nAnglican priests. James tried to force Cambridge to accept Catholic \nleadership. The schoolmen refused. James was furious. He then tried \nto usurp Magdalen College's long-standing right to elect its own \npresident and compel them to accept a Catholic as head of the school. \nAgain the schoolmen resisted him. The situation worsened when \nAnglican churchmen refused to read James' Declaration of Indulgence \nfrom their pulpits. The Declaration was an excellent idea, granting \nreligious liberty. However it was seen as an attempt to defy \nParliament through whom such authorization ought to come. James \nbrought four Anglicans to trial. The jury acquitted them.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat finally brought James down was the birth of his son. Rather than \nface the prospect of a Catholic heir, the English decided to replace \nJames with a Protestant. They contacted his Son-in-law, William III. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn this day, February 13 1689, Parliament granted the throne to \nWilliam with certain religious and civil conditions: \"Whereas the \nlate King James II... did endeavor to subvert and extirpate the \nProtestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom...\" \nthey wrote, \"...[we] do resolve that William and Mary, Prince and \nPrincess of Orange, be and be declared King and Queen of England...\" \nThe declaration further barred anyone of the Roman Catholic faith \nfrom possessing the English throne.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nClaydon, Tony.

Janet decided to have mushroom-smothered steak. \nBut mushrooms are expensive. She then told her husband, \"No \nmushrooms. They are too high.\"\u0014\nHe said, \"Why don't you go down in the pasture and pick some of those \nmushrooms? There are plenty in the creek bed.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nShe said, \"No, some wild mushrooms are poison.\"\u0014\nHe said, \"Well, I see varmints eating them and they're OK.\" So Janet \ndecided to give it a try. She picked a bunch, washed, sliced, and \ndiced them for her smothered steak. Then she went out on the back \nporch and gave Ol' Spot (the yard dog) a double handful. Ol' Spot ate \nevery bite. All morning long, Janet watched Ol' Spot and the wild \nmushrooms didn't seem to affect him, so she decided to use them. The \nmeal was a great success, and Janet even hired a helper lady from \ntown to help her serve. She had on a white apron and a fancy little \ncap on her head. \u0014\n\u0014\nAfter everyone had finished, they relaxed, socialized, and played 42 \nand dominoes.

    "title": "DEFENDING CONSTANTINE - A BOOK REVIEW",
    "words": "Many evangelicals view the fourth-century conversion of the Roman \nEmperor Constantine as an unfortunate chapter in church history, one \nthat sabotaged the purity of the early church and ushered in the \ncorrupt Middle Ages. Peter J. Leithart believes this version of \nchurch history is a myth. In Defending Constantine: The Twilight of \nan Empire and the Dawn of Christendom (IVP Academic), Leithart shows \nthat the early church was not as united as we think, nor was \nConstantine the villain many have made him out to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlong the way, Leithart teases out contemporary implications \nregarding the church's role in the world, implications that distance \nhim from scholars like John Howard Yoder. Defending Constantine could \nhave been called Dismantling Yoder, for although Leithart's primary \npurpose is to vindicate Constantine, he devotes significant effort to \npointing out the cracks in Yoder's Anabaptist perspective on \nChristendom.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefending Constantine begins as a biography. Leithart argues that the \nemperor was a sincere believer who transformed the empire by \nproclaiming \"the end of sacrifice.\" Citizens of Rome once expressed \ntheir support for the empire's civic religion by making offerings to \nthe city's deities. In contrast, Constantine's newfound Christianity \ninsisted upon the once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\u0014\n\u0014\nLeithart does not portray Constantine as a power-hungry leader who \nadopted Christianity for political gain, as some have. Nor is he the \nsaint (or apostle!) some ancient Christians thought him to be. \nInstead, we see a complex individual who gave preferential treatment \nto Christians without dominating church councils.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt times, Leithart's sketch of Constantine is overly sympathetic, a \nportrayal challenged by the emperor's hatred for the Jews and his \nmurder of his wife and son. While Leithart notes these unflattering \nincidents, he is unable to find a place for them in his overall \nportrait that makes sense of the man.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe greatest strength of Leithart's proposal comes later in the book, \nwhen he demonstrates how Anabaptist thinkers like Yoder oversimplify \nthe issues surrounding Constantine's reign. By showing, for example, \nthat the early church was not universally pacifistic, Leithart casts \ndoubt on Yoder's insistence that the so-called uniform non-violence \nof the early church should be the norm today.\u0014\n\u0014\nInterestingly enough, Leithart agrees with Yoder's critique of \nConstantinianism: It is indeed a heresy that seeks efficiency instead \nof faithfulness to Christ. The difference is that Leithart does not \nbelieve we should name this heresy after Constantine. Instead, we \nshould recognize the great debt we owe to Constantine for \n\"desacrificing\" Rome and thus allowing Christians to worship without \nfear of retribution.\u0014\n\u0014\nDefending Constantine demonstrates the enduring relevance of the \n\"Constantinian moment\" of the fourth century. While recent \nscholarship has focused mainly on the negative results, Leithart \nswings the pendulum back, reminding us of all the good that God \nbrought from this contested period of history.\u0014\n\u0014\nTrevin Wax is author of Counterfeit Gospels: Rediscovering the Good \nNews in a World of False Hope (Moody, 2011).\u0014\nCopyright  2011 Christianity Today\u0014",

    "title": "DOUBT IS NOT THE OPPOSITE OF FAITH",
    "words": "In Paul Tillich's brilliant essay The Courage to Be, he states that \ndoubt is not the opposite of faith but an integral part of faith. The \ngospel writers and biblical interpreters down through the years have \nqualified the role of doubt for Thomas, even diminished it. John puts \nit into the words of Jesus: \"Have you believed because you have seen \nme? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to \nbelieve.\" This interpretation has kept us from recognizing the \nimportance of articulating our doubts in our own faith development. \nThomas needed courage to articulate the doubts that he experienced. \nJesus responded to Thomas' fear with love and understanding. \"Put \nyour finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in \nmy side.\" Jesus accepts our doubts likewise with touching tenderness.\u0014\n\u0014\n--------------------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nDo you dislike buying shoes? How about dress shoes that are stiff, \nexpensive, and high-maintenance? How many of us dream of going \nthrough life in soft, white, 100 percent cotton sweatsocks... or \nmaybe flipflops... or slippers? Life demands that we buy and wear \nshoes, sometimes shoes that don't fit as comfortably as we'd like. \nSome of us have arches high as the London Bridge. Others have \nradically different sizes between our two appendages. We often curse \nthe coverings that must be stood in, walked in, worked in. We moan \nand groan to get back into soft, white, 100 percent cotton \nsweatsocks, flipflops, or slippers. Doubt is like a pair of \nill-fitting shoes. It cramps our spiritual toes, weakens our high \narches of faith, and aggravates our moral sciatica. Doubt drives us \nto get relief, to move into something more comfortable. Maybe then \ndoubt isn't all bad? Can doubt become a driving force to believe with \nmore rigor and vigor toward the right-fitting faith? Might it make \nour souls better, not bitter? Sometimes ill-fitting shoes need to be \nworn awhile, broken in, contoured to the uniqueness of our feet. \nOften they don't need cursing so much as constant formation. Thomas \nneeded faith to fit a certain way... his way... the comfortable, \n\"unless I see,\" 100 percent cotton way. Yet, New Testament faith \nrequires that we put on the uncomfortable and continue walking! Once \ntop-grade is broken in, it contours and protects much longer than \nsoft, white, 100 percent cotton ever could.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen Greg MacAleese, a police officer in Albuquerque, came up with \nhis idea of having anonymous tipsters call in to the police station \nwith information about a crime, there were doubters. When the idea of \na cash reward was attached to the idea, many believed the idea \nunworkable. But MacAleese, with the help of several others, was \npersistent. He worked to set up a program, got help fund-raising to \nbuild up a reward fund, and launched the program. On September 8, \n1976, the first tip came into the hotlines that had been set up and \nCrime Stoppers was up and running. Those who doubted that such a \nprogram could work were quickly turned into believers. They saw what \ncould be done when citizens were brought into the process of \ncrime-solving.\u0014\n\u0014\nToday, most police departments have a Crime Stoppers program. No one \ncan give a number to the crimes that have been solved because of \nCrime Stoppers, but it is safe to say that most doubting Thomases \nhave seen enough solved cases to firmly believe.\u0014\n\u0014\n----------------------------\u0014\n\u0014\nAbraham Lincoln never claimed to be a Christian. His closest friends \nwere in agreement in their assessment that neither at age 20 nor at \nage 50, nor despite some of the religious language of his speeches, \nwas Lincoln a Christian in any orthodox sense of the word.\u0014\n\u0014\n\"When he was making an old woman's will, he could indeed, at her \nrequest, repeat for her a psalm out of his head; and when, after the \ndeath of their little boy, Eddie, Mary joined the Presbyterians, he \nrented a pew in the church, and became friendly with the minister; \nbut he would not himself become a church member. He said, 'Probably \nit is to be my lot to go on in a twilight, feeling and reasoning my \nway through life, as questioning, doubting Thomas did.' \"\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n-- from Emil Ludwig, Lincoln [Little, Brown, and Co., 1930], p. 166\u0014",

    "words": "May 16, 1569 \u0014\n\u0014\nDirk Willem Burned after Rescuing Pursuer\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many Anabaptists died during the sixteenth century persecution in \nEurope? No one knows for sure. What is certain is that at least 1,500 \nwere cruelly tortured and killed. For the most part these were \npeaceful citizens who did not believe in war and who became the \nforerunners of today's Mennonites and Amish. The main complaint of \nthe authorities against them was that they did not believe infant \nbaptism had any value. They chose to be re-baptized as willing adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough no other charges were proven against them, they were \nsentenced to death. For the men death was usually by fire; for women \nit was by drowning. Many Anabaptists proved to be so bold in their \nfinal testimony for Christ that authorities began to clamp their \ntongues before leading them out to their execution so that they could \nnot speak up and win more converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the Anabaptists who died in flames was Dirk Willem. His story \nis particularly touching, because he forfeited a real chance to \nescape when he turned back to help one of his pursuers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was captured and imprisoned in his home town of Asperen in the \nNetherlands. Knowing that his fate would be death if he remained in \nprison, Dirk made a rope of strips of cloth and slid down it over the \nprison wall. A guard chased him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrost had covered a nearby pond with a thin layer of ice. Dirk risked \na dash across it. He made it to safety, but the ice broke under his \npursuer who cried for help. Dirk believed the Scripture that a man \nshould help his enemies. He immediately turned back and pulled the \nfloundering man from the frigid water.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn gratitude for his life, the man would have let Dirk escape, but a \nBurgomaster (chief magistrate) standing on the shore sternly ordered \nhim to arrest Dirk and bring him back, reminding him of the oath he \nhad sworn as an officer of the peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack to prison went Dirk. He was condemned to death for being \nre-baptized, allowing secret church services in his home and letting \nothers be baptized there. The record of his sentencing concludes: \n\"all of which is contrary to our holy Christian faith, and to the \ndecrees of his royal majesty, and ought not to be tolerated, but \nseverely punished, for an example to others; therefore, we the \naforesaid judges, having, with mature deliberation of council, \nexamined and considered all that was to be considered in this matter, \nhave condemned and do condemn by these presents in the name; and in \nthe behalf, of his royal majesty, as Count of Holland, the aforesaid \nDirk Willems, prisoner, persisting obstinately in his opinion, that \nhe shall be executed with fire, until death ensues; and declare all \nhis property confiscated, for the benefit of his royal majesty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was burned to death on this day, May 16, 1569. His tongue was \nnot clamped. The wind blew the flame away from him so that his death \nwas long and miserable. Time and again Dirk cried out to God. Finally \none of the authorities could not bear to see him suffer any longer \nand ordered an underling to end his torment with a quick death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nBraght, Thieleman J. van.

    "words": "One of the criticisms of Christianity is that it is a crutch for the \nweak. Belief in God is considered by some to be nothing more than an \nillusion to satisfy unconscious needs. But Dr. Paul Vitz, Professor \nof Psychology at New York University, wondered the opposite: suppose \nit's the atheists who are engaging in unconscious wish fulfillment.\u0014\n\u0014\nTo find the answer, Vitz scanned the last four centuries for patterns \nthat distinguish the lives of atheists from the lives of theists. \nAfter studying the lives of more than a dozen of the world's most \ninfluential atheists, Vitz discovered they all had one thing in \ncommon: defective relationships with their fathers. Vitz defines \n\"defective\" fathers as those who were dead, abusive, weak, or who \nabandoned their children. \u0014\n\u0014\nSigmund Freud wrote that his father was a sexual pervert. Thomas \nHobbes's father was an Anglican clergyman who got into a fight with \nanother man in the churchyard and, subsequently, abandoned his \nfamily. Ludwig Feuerbach, at age 13, was abandoned by his father, who \nopenly took up living with another woman in a different town. \nVoltaire fought constantly with his father, causing him later to \nreject his surname. \u0014\n\u0014\nSchopenhauer's father committed suicide when he was 16. Both Bertrand \nRussell and Nietzsche lost their fathers at the age of four. Sartre's \nfather died before Sartre was born, and Camus was a year old when he \nlost his father. Hume also lost his father in early childhood. \nHitler's father was a violent man who unmercifully beat Adolf, his \nmother, and even the family dog; he died when Adolf was 14. Stalin's \nfather also administered brutal beatings to his son.\u0014\n\u0014\nObviously, much more evidence needs to be obtained on the \"defective \nfather\" hypothesis.

A \nmember of Parliament, he introduced antislavery measures year after \nyear for 40 years until he retired in 1825. On this day July 26, \n1833, as he lay dying, word was brought him that the bill to outlaw \nslavery everywhere in the British empire had passed in Parliament. \nThe dream for which he had struggled for decades was now within sight \nof fulfillment!\u0014\n\u0014\nWilberforce had not always been a serious opponent of slavery. As a \nyouth he was a witty, somewhat dissipated man about town who had \nmisspent his time at Cambridge. He was invited to every party.\u0014\n\u0014\nA friend of William Pitt (who became Prime Minister) and a member of \nParliament, Wilberforce seemed assured of a bright political future. \nAnd then in 1784, after winning his election in Yorkshire, he \naccompanied his sister to the Riviera for her health. Isaac Milner, a \ntutor at Queen's College Cambridge and acquaintance from college days \nwas asked along. Isaac agreed.\u0014\n\u0014\nMilner had become a deep and evangelical Christian. He began to \npersuade Wilberforce to commit his life to Christ. Wilberforce had \nalways thought himself a Christian. Now he saw that total commitment \nto Christ was needed. He struggled in anguish for several months. \nDuring that time he read Philip Doddridge's The Rise and Progress of \nReligion in the Soul. Here was a faith far deeper than anything he \nhad known. Gradually he yielded.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt once he began to wonder if it was proper for him to hold a seat in \ngovernment. He confided in Pitt. Pitt, wanting Wilberforce as an \nally, urged him to remain. Unsettled in his conscience, Wilberforce \nspoke to the rector John Newton. Newton, best remembered as the \nauthor of the hymn \"Amazing Grace,\" had been converted while a \nblasphemous sailor and slaver. He counseled Wilberforce to remain in \npolitics and champion good causes.\u0014\n\u0014\nFriends suggested that the young man take up the slavery issue. Pitt \nalso requested it. After many doubts, Wilberforce decided it was what \nGod wanted. He also felt he must tackle causes which would raise the \nstandard of life and morals in England. The friends who gathered \naround him became known as the Clapham sect because most lived in the \nvillage of Clapham.\u0014\n\u0014\nRarely in history have so many owed so much to so few. These dozen or \nso Clapham men and women not only fought against slavery but also \nagainst every sort of vice. Many were wealthy. They employed their \nworldly goods in behalf of godly causes. Education of the masses, \nsupport of Bible societies, private charity, protection of chimney \nsweeps, creation of Sunday Schools and orphanages--these and dozens \nof other causes received their attention. But it is the abolition of \nslavery which remains their greatest achievement.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nMeakin, Annette M. B. Hannah More, a Biographical Study.

    "title": "DID 9/11 MAKE ANY REAL CHANGES IN OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE?",
    "words": "Five years ago, Mark D. Roberts did a series of five articles called, \n\\9/11 and Faith: Some Reflections. His observations are still \npertinent today.\u0014\n\u0014\nFive years ago yesterday the United States was rocked by the \nunthinkable. Terrorists hit us in the heart, shattering our icons and \nkilling thousands of our innocent citizens. We were stunned. We were \nheartsick. We were outraged. We were, indeed, terrorized. And, for a \nwhile, we were also more interested in God. In the aftermath of the \n9/11 attacks, there were prayer meetings throughout the land. Church \nattendance was up. And religious leaders, if they weren't blaming \nAmerican immorality for the attacks, were predicting an era of \nspiritual renewal. Tragedy and death have a way of turning our hearts \ntoward God.\u0014\n\u0014\nAt least for a while. Maybe even a very short while. The Barna Group \nhas recently released the results of an extensive survey of American \nfaith pre-9/11 and five years afterwards. The bottom line? Almost \nnothing has changed. Americans still believe more or less the same \nthings and do more or less the same things when it comes to religion. \nThe intense surge in religious activity and expression in the weeks \nimmediately following 9/11? has led to no significant or lasting \nresult, according to the Barna Group.\u0014\n\u0014\nHonestly, though I find this disappointing, it doesn't really \nsurprise me much. I've spent a good chunk of my pastoral life \ninteracting with people in crisis. Time and again I've seen how a \ncrisis can intensify someone's interest in God, yet not make any long \nterm difference in that person's faith or religious life.\u0014\n\u0014\nRoberts cites the Barna report further as it criticizes churches for \nnot being ready to deal with turning the short-term crisis into a \nlong-term ministry of spiritual formation in people's lives. Few \ncongregations, the study noted, led people to a serious and \nprolonged period of self-reflection and personal change.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut Roberts (rightly, in my opinion) observes that this failure was \nnot a matter of being ill-prepared to handle the aftermath of \ncatastrophe. If churches are doing their jobs, times of crisis merely \nadd another dimension to the work the church is always doing.\u0014\n\u0014\nSerious and prolonged attention to spiritual formation is our \ncontinual task, not something we take up when public tragedy strikes, \nin hopes that people will be more open to what we offer. Then, in \nextraordinary circumstances, we have ministry habits to build upon \nand a reputation for maturity that will enable us to minister to \nspecial needs and discuss specific questions.\u0014",

    "words": "Doubt Is Not Unbelief: Evangelicals \nand the Stigma of Doubt\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key is not the total suspension of confidence or even certainty, \nbut rather the judicious placement of confidence and trust. \u0014\nMichael Hakmin Lee\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe commitment of American evangelicals towards gospel propagation is \nevident from their dominant presence in Protestant mission (vast \nmajority of U.S. based Protestant missionaries are evangelicals) and \nin the identities of their greatest heroes like Billy Graham.\u0014\n\u0014\nUnfortunately, while evangelicals are understandably and justifiably \npreoccupied with bringing people through the front door of the \nchurch, too many seem relatively inattentive and uninformed as to HOW \nand WHY people are leaving though the back door.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn the past few decades, increased religious mobility, which includes \nleaving and switching, has been a notable trend in the shifting U.S. \nreligious landscape (e.g., the rise of the religious nones).\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is in part what led me to undertake a research project that \nwould understand leave-takingthe journey from evangelical minister \nand missionary (specifically those who a had formal theological and \nministerial training and served in vocational ministry for at least \ntwo years) to the complete abandonment of the Christian faith, \nincluding any belief in the supernatural.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis research project, which included 31 in-depth interviews with \nsuch deconverts, was guided by the following questions:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWhat sort of religious experiences and influences did participants \nhave in their early periods of social development (childhood and \nadolescence)?\u0014\n\tIn adulthood, how did participants remember their significant \nChristian experiences, including their ministerial experiences, and \nhow did they make sense of their religious world when they identified \nas Christian?\u0014\n\tHow did the process of leaving unfold, and what was it like \nexperientially?\u0014\n\tWhat are the salient factors and reasons related to discarding the \nChristian faith?\u0014\n\tWhat are the consequences of leaving the Christian faith, and what \nlife changes accompany it?\u0014\n\t\u0014\nMost people and groups I have spoken to about this project seem \ninterested in the reasons given for leaving and the process of \nleaving. I may talk about them in a follow-up post if there is enough \ninterest (let us know!), but in this post I want to jump straight to \nimplications for the evangelical communitynamely, the importance of \nrecovering a proper confidence and the proper place of doubt within \na growing faith.\u0014\n\u0014\nEvangelicalism, especially its more conservative or fundamentalist \nincarnations, commonly fosters a rigidly constructed faith, with \nmultiple layers of what we consider essential beliefs and values. On \nthe one hand, certitude can be comforting and reassuring in a world \nfilled with chaos and uncertainty. However, the danger of holding \nsomething to be essential to one's faith is that when that essential \nbelief is called into question, the whole edifice, not just that \nbelief, begins to destabilize. And while there is nothing inherently \nwrong with confidence or certainty in one's beliefs and convictions, \nthere is potential harm when evangelical communities and leaders \nplace an unwarranted level of confidence in their theological \nconstructs and impose their certitude on others.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany participants spoke of an environment that encourages the \nsuppression of doubts and discourages the multiplicity of \nunderstandings. Christian traditions that celebrate and normalize \ncertitude, orthodox beliefs, and unwavering faith tend to be \ninhospitable places for those struggling to make sense of how to \nnegotiate dissenting questions and doubt.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs some of the participants commented, after moving on from what was \nonce considered essential (e.g. young earth creationism), they were \nleft wondering what else they were wrong about. Such a tightly wound \noutlook, Lesslie Newbigin suggests, lacks a proper confidence that \navoids the excesses of confidence based on Cartesian, Enlightenment \nrationalism on the one hand and the radical skepticism of postmodern \nnihilism on the other.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe reality of intra-Christian theological disagreements has led some \nto conclude that there is something inherently wrong with the \nChristian faith itself. On the other hand, I do not think the \nsolution is to downplay the place of confidence or even certainty in \nfaith. While I believe there is commonly within evangelicalism an \nundercurrent of misplaced optimism in our ability to objectively \nunderstand truth in an unfiltered way which needs to be challenged, \nmore than the pursuit of certainty itself, it is what we choose to \nplace our confidence in that is the issue.\u0014\n\u0014\nlet me share a few examples:\u0014\n\u0014\n\tWe should be confident that God exists, but more tentative in our \nincomplete and inevitably distorted claims of what God is like, which \ntends to portray God in our culturally informed image.\u0014\n\tWe should have the highest confidence that God will accomplish what \nGod has set out to do in the course of history, just more tentative \nin how this will unfold.\u0014\n\tWe should be certain that God has spoken to us through the \nprophets, apostles, and ultimately through Jesus, and that Scripture \ncaptures these divine revelations, but we should be more tentative in \nwhat we affirm about the Bible itself and what we discern its \nmeanings to be.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe key is not the total suspension of confidence or even certainty, \nbut rather the judicious placement of confidence and trust.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe should reject the 'all-or-nothing' mentality with regard to our \nunderstanding of faith, which in addition to erroneous \nepistemological assumptions, has to do with a common misunderstanding \namong evangelicals about the place of doubts in the life of believers \n(hence their haste in silencing questions and quelling doubts).\u0014\n\u0014\nOs Guinness's In Two Minds is one of the most helpful books I have \nread on the subject of doubt. Here, Guinness explains the difference \nbetween doubt and unbelief:\u0014\n\u0014\nDoubt is not the opposite of faith, nor is it the same as unbelief. \nDoubt is a state of mind in suspension between faith and unbelief so \nthat it is neither of them wholly and it is each only partly. This \ndistinction is absolutely vital because it uncovers and deals with \nthe first major misconception of doubtthe idea that in doubting a \nbeliever is betraying faith and surrendering to unbelief. No \nmisunderstanding causes more anxiety and brings such bondage to \nsensitive people in doubt. The word unbelief is usually used of a \nwillful refusal to believe or a deliberate decision to disobey. So, \nwhile doubt is a state of suspension between faith and unbelief, \nunbelief is a state of mind which is closed against God, an attitude \nof heart which disobeys God as much as it disbelieves the truth. \nDoubt is not the opposite of faith, unbelief is. Doubt does not \nnecessarily or automatically mean the end of faith, for doubt is \nfaith in two minds. What destroys faith is the disobedience that \nhardens into unbelief.

    "title": "DONATISTS DUG IN THEIR HEELS IN NORTH AFRICA",
    "words": "Donatists Dug in Heels in North Africa\u0014\nDan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nUnder the beating sun, two slaves of Carthage pulled their master and \nmistress in a cart. As they drew abreast of some rocks, they turned \ntheir heads with dull curiosity for they heard a noise. Armed men \nleaped out, yelling. While some pulled the owners out of the cart, \nothers released the slaves from their harnesses. Within moments the \nsocial world was turned upside down. Two uncertain slaves were seated \nin the cart and the frightened owners were harnessed to the cart \nshafts. \"Pull,\" shouted the men, brandishing swords and spears.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis was not an isolated incident. The turmoil in North Africa was \nthe result of an ugly instance of spiritual pride. It began in 303 \nwith one of the most horrific persecutions ever unleashed against the \nchurch. Its buildings were demolished, Christians tortured, clergymen \narrested, and scriptures confiscated. The instigator of this \nonslaught was Galerius, the co-emperor of the Roman Empire, who \ninsisted that Christians were disloyal. Diocletian agreed to crush \nthem.\u0014\n\u0014\nDuring the persecutions, many Christians apostatized, offering \nsacrifices to Roman gods, and some cooperated with pagan authorities \nas far as their consciences allowed. Here and there, bishops canceled \npublic worship, intending to lie low until the trouble passed over. \nSome gave up scriptures, considering lives worth more than \nmanuscripts. Others gave up heretical books, pretending they were \nscriptures. But staunch Christians refused to cooperate at all with \nthe authorities, and were tortured or killed.\u0014\n\u0014\nGalerius finally called a halt to the terror and asked for Christian \nprayers. By then he was dying, eaten alive by worms. His successor \nrenewed the oppression, but the next emperors, Constantine and \nLicinius agreed on a policy of religious toleration. \u0014\nAt once the church quarreled over what should be called betrayal of \nChrist and who should be allowed back into the church. In North \nAfrica, hard-liners said that any bishop who had forfeited scriptures \nunder persecution, had forfeited his holy office and its powers. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the church as a whole refused to apply this stringent rule to \noffenders, the hard-liners set up rival bishops. In Carthage, the \nCatholic bishop was Caecilian and his rival was Marjorinus, soon \nsucceeded by Donatus. Donatus considered Caecilian an illegal bishop, \nbecause he had supposedly gone so far as to picket against martyrs \nheld in prison and because one of the bishops who consecrated \nCaecilian was considered a traitor. \u0014\n\u0014\nConstantine ordered a council to meet at Arles to decide the issue. \nOn this day, August 1, 314, the council met. It handed down a \ndecision in favor of Caecilian. \u0014\n\u0014\nDonatus and his followers dug in their heels. Private feuds fueled \ntheir schism. For instance, the bishops of Numidia joined Donatus \nbecause they felt slighted by the church and a leading woman joined \nhim because she resented Caecilian for rebuking her for kissing the \nrelics of a saint not recognized by the church.\u0014\n\u0014\nBitter division resulted in North Africa. The behavior of the \nDonatists suggests that pride had more to do with their stand than \nprinciple. They actively sought martyrdom and (according to their \nopponents) even engaged in suicidal behavior to win death. When \nConstantine ordered their property confiscated, the Donatists joined \nforces with groups who sought to abolish class distinctions and set \nup communes. They used violence and intimidation to right social \nwrongs and even forced masters out of carriages, making them pull \ntheir slaves.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough divisive, the Donatists had some good ideas. For instance, \nit seems that they believed that church and state should be separate. \nDonatus asked, \"What has the emperor to do with the church?\" But the \nsum effect of their breakaway was to weaken North Africa so that it \nwas more easily overrun first by the Vandals and then by the Muslims.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\nAland, Kurt.

    "title": "DISCOVERING THE HUMAN JESUS OPENS NEW POSSIBILITIES",
    "words": "Discovering the human Jesus opens new possibilities for becoming more \nlike Jesus\u0014\nChuck Queen  |  January 30, 2019  Baptist News Global\u0014\n\u0014\nI had a coming to Jesus moment when I met Jesus again for the first \ntime. The book by the late Marcus Borg, Meeting Jesus Again for the \nFirst Time (1994), opened a new chapter in my spiritual journey. It \nwas a liberating experience when I, for the first time, allowed Jesus \nto be an authentic, legitimate human being. I had always professed \nJesus was human, but I did not really believe it (which, by the way, \nis true of every evangelical I know). I thought I believed Jesus was \nhuman, but in my heart I knew Jesus was more God than human.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhat I really believed is what I think every evangelical believes, \nwhether they are aware of it or not  namely, that Jesus was God \nwalking around in the flesh.\u0014\n\u0014\nMost evangelicals are not actually Trinitarians. They are actually \nTri-theists because what they really imagine are three distinct, \nseparate persons who are at the same time one person. When one \nquestions the contradiction of that claim by pointing out that it \ndefies logic and common sense  and asks How can that be?  the \nresponse is typically some variation on this: I cant understand it. \nIts a mystery. But the Bible teaches it, so it must be true.\u0014\n\u0014\nI dont think the Bible teaches that at all.\u0014\n\u0014\nI understand Christ to be a reality connected to the man, Jesus, \nbut greater than the man, Jesus.\u0014\nAs I began to read Borg, Richard Rohr, Walter Wink and others, a \nwhole new world opened up to me. (I listed books that have been most \ninfluential in my Christian journey in Being a Progressive Christian \n(is not) for Dummies (nor for know-it-alls) published by Nurturing \nFaith.) When I allowed Jesus to be human, which means letting him be \na man with limitations and imperfections (not sinless or perfect), I \nbegan to see that living like Jesus is actually a real human \npossibility. I began to see that the character and passion of Jesus, \nwhich constitutes the Christians window into the character and \npassion of God, is within human grasp and experience.\u0014\n\u0014\nTwo commonly accepted ideas of contemporary, mainline biblical \nscholarship helped me arrive at this place.\u0014\n\u0014\nFirst, I realized that the Gospel stories are not historical reports. \nThey are spiritual proclamations that communicate truth pertinent to \na disciples spiritual and moral transformation. Some stories contain \nechoes of memories of actual conversations, events and experiences, \nwhile other stories are mostly or perhaps entirely metaphorical, \nsymbolic and parabolic. Gospel stories were passed on orally for \nyears and underwent a number of changes before they were ever \ncollected, redacted, edited and composed into what constitutes a \nGospel.\u0014\n\u0014\nSecond, in the evolving, growing experience and tradition of the \nearly disciples, their worship and understanding of Christ became a \nmuch larger reality than the historical person of Jesus of Nazareth. \nHere is how I imagine it. When the first disciples witnessed Jesus \nalive they immediately worshiped him as Lord and Christ (Messiah). \nThese first Jewish disciples, however, did not imagine Jesus was God. \nThey knew there is only one God. But they viewed Jesus as Gods \nchosen agent of redemption par excellence. Jesus instantly became \nGods quintessential representative disclosing Gods character and \npassion, and Gods human savior for humankind and creation. This is \nreflected clearly in Lukes account of the earliest preaching in the \nbook of Acts. Consider Peters sermon in Acts 2:\u0014\n\u0014\nYou that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of \nNazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, \nand signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know, \nthis man handed over to you . . . you crucified and killed . . . But \nGod raised him up, having freed him from death . . . . This Jesus God \nraised up, and of that all of us are witnesses. Being therefore \nexalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father \nthe promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you both \nsee and hear. . . . Therefore let the entire house of Israel know \nwith certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah [Christ], \nthis Jesus whom you crucified (2:22-24, 32-33, 36).\u0014\n\u0014\nThe first disciples made a clear distinction between the man, Jesus \nof Nazareth, and God, who worked through the man, Jesus. Jesus was \nkilled by the powers that be, but God raised him up, and in raising \nhim up made (declared or appointed) him Lord and Christ. Paul \nstates something very similar in Romans 1:3-4 where he says that \nJesus was declared Son of God with power . . .  by resurrection from \nthe dead. The early Christians viewed Gods resurrection of Jesus \nfirst and foremost as Gods vindication of Jesus. This lead almost \nimmediately to their veneration of Jesus, and their earliest of \nconfessions, Jesus is Lord.\u0014\n\u0014\nI suspect that the title Lord was used as a kind of subversive \ncounterclaim to Caesar who claimed that title for himself. The title \nChrist I imagine was used as a subversive counterclaim to the Jews \nwho were expecting a Messiah/Christ who would use force to deliver \nthem from Roman oppression. However, in the course of the developing \nworship and evolving liturgy of these early Messianic communities, \nboth titles  Lord and Christ  became more  i.e., larger and \nuniversal and interchangeable with terms and titles that referred to \nGod and the Spirit of God. This is why Paul in his letters could use \nChrist and Spirit of Christ interchangeably with God and \nSpirit of God, and talk about Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus. \nIts anyones guess how Paul and others might have imagined the \nspecifics of this connection between Jesus and Christ in their \nthinking, and scholars speculate about and argue various points of \nview.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI understand Christ to be a reality connected to the man, Jesus, \nbut greater than the man, Jesus. I let the man, Jesus be a man, and \nthat has helped me to meet Jesus again for the first time, and \nactually see the life and teachings of the human Jesus and the \ncharacter and passion of the human Jesus as real possibilities for my \nhuman life.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe late Clarence Jordan, a Baptist before his time who founded \nKoinonia Farm, an interracial community in Americus, Georgia, once \nsaid in a sermon that by deifying Jesus we effectively rid ourselves \nof him even more than if we had crucified him. In deifying him we \ncan build our cathedrals to him. We can gather on Sundays and sing \nsongs to him and express our belief in him and feel like we have done \nall we need to do. By deifying Jesus we can avoid his very \nextraordinary human life who, though not being perfect or sinless, \nbeautifully embodied Gods love and passion for the broken and \ndowntrodden.\u0014\n\u0014\nIronically, when I believed Jesus was God I didnt take him \nseriously. But when I let him be an imperfect, but courageous and \ncompassionate human being, I discovered a compelling interest in \nbecoming like him. When I believed Jesus was God, he was so high and \nlifted up that he was beyond my reach. When l let him be a human \nbeing I awoke to my responsibility to carry forth his agenda (as in \nLuke 4:18-19). I could no longer hide behind his deity.\u0014\n\u0014\nI am still far away from being like Jesus, from embodying or \nincarnating the character and passion of God to the degree that Jesus \ndid, but I can no longer be dismissive of his life. The life of Jesus \nis a human possibility for all of us. The Christ self is the true \nself of every human being. Becoming who I am  a son of God like \nJesus  is a real, human possibility, and that keeps me going.\u0014",

    "words": "In his article, Discovering the human Jesus opens new possibilities \nfor being like Jesus, Chuck Queen has abandoned the historic faith \nto find a Jesus not worthy of worship but worthy of emulation.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe list of historic Christian doctrines Queen denies is pretty long. \nQueen denies the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and the sinlessness of \nChrist. Queen argues that the earliest disciples did not imagine \nJesus to be God, and it was only after reflection on the resurrection \nthat Jesus was thought of as God.\u0014\n\u0014\nOf course, this ignores 2,000 years of Christian history and the \nScriptures themselves. The Gospels and Acts are clear: the disciples \nworshipped Jesus. The disciples were good Jews and knew that worship \nbelonged to God alone. Worshipping someone or something other than \nGod was tantamount to idolatry, yet they worshipped Jesus. John even \nrecords Thomas statement of Jesus divinity. Lest, however, one \nthinks that John is late and the Synoptics are the only place from \nwhich we are to draw evidence, take a look at a miracle from Matthew \n14 and Mark 6. Jesus is recorded to have walked on water. The Gospels \ndo not present miracles to note that Jesus could do impressive acts. \nThe Gospels present miracles because they say something about Jesus \nthe person. Walking on the water was an act attributed to God in \nJewish tradition. Job 9:8 states, He alone stretches out the heavens \nand treads on the waves of the sea. In other words, the walking on \nthe water miracle is a divine claim made by the Gospel writers.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs Queen attests, the disciples and the early church tradition called \nJesus Lord. Unfortunately, he only sees its use in connection to \nJesus as a subversive counterclaim to Caesars use of the term. While \nCaesar would certainly have been offended, the primary use of the \nword Lord by Christians was not about Caesar. The word Lord comes \nfrom the word Adonai, a divine title. Calling Jesus Lord is to assert \nhis divinity.\u0014\n\u0014\nQueen makes another unfortunate claim about the divinity of Jesus. He \nclaims that in worshipping Jesus as God we are able to dispense with \nJesus agenda. Nothing could be further from the truth. Understanding \nJesus as God reminds us that we will be judged by Jesus. If I believe \nthat Jesus is God, then I know I am accountable to him for the way I \nhave lived. I am accountable for the least of these.\u0014\n\u0014\nQueens article, deeply influenced by the progressive works of Borg, \nRohr, Wink and others is exactly what is wrong with progressive \nChristianity. In a hopeless attempt to make Christianity appeal to \nthe broader culture, historic Christianity is lost. This reinvention \nof Jesus as flawed, sinful, but crucial is not only unhelpful, it is \ndestructive.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nLayne Wallace\u0014\nRoanoke Rapids, North Carolina\u0014",

    "title": "DANCES WITH WOLVES",
    "words": "Dances with Wolves is a 1990 American epic Western film starring, \ndirected and produced by Kevin Costner. It is a film adaptation of \nthe 1988 book of the same name by Michael Blake that tells the story \nof Union Army lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Costner) who travels to the \nAmerican frontier to find a military post and of his dealings with a \ngroup of Lakota Indians. \u0014\n\u0014\nIn 1863, First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar is wounded in battle at St. \nDavid's Field in Tennessee. Choosing death in battle over amputation \nof his leg, he takes a horse and rides up to and along the \nConfederate lines. Despite numerous pot shots, the Confederates fail \nto hit him, and while they are distracted, the Union Army \nsuccessfully attacks the line. Dunbar survives, receives a citation \nfor bravery, and proper medical care. He recovers fully and is \nawarded Cisco, the horse who carried him, and his choice of posting. \nDunbar requests a transfer to the western frontier, so he can see it \nbefore it disappears. \u0014\n\u0014\nDunbar is transferred to Fort Hays, a large fort presided over by \nMajor Fambrough, an unhinged officer who despises Dunbar's \nenthusiasm. He agrees to post him to the furthest outpost they have, \nFort Sedgewick, and kills himself shortly afterwards. Dunbar travels \nwith Timmons, a mule wagon provisioner; they arrive to find the fort \ndeserted. Despite the threat of nearby native tribes, Dunbar elects \nto stay and man the post himself. He begins rebuilding and restocking \nthe fort, and prefers the solitude, recording many of his \nobservations in his diary. Timmons is killed by Pawnee people on the \njourney back to Ft. Hays; his death, together with that of the major \nwho had sent them there, prevents other soldiers from knowing of \nDunbar's assignment, and no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the \npost. \u0014\n\u0014\nDunbar initially encounters his Sioux neighbors when attempts are \nmade to steal his horse and intimidate him. Deciding that being a \ntarget is a poor prospect, he decides to seek out the Sioux camp and \nattempt dialogue. On his way, he comes across Stands With A Fist, the \nwhite adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird, who \nis ritually mutilating herself while mourning for her husband. Dunbar \nbrings her back to the Sioux to recover, and some of the tribe begin \nto respect him. Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking \nBird, the warrior Wind In His Hair and the youth Smiles A Lot, \ninitially visiting each other's camps. The language barrier \nfrustrates them, and Stands With A Fist acts as an interpreter, \nalthough with difficulty; she only remembers English from her early \nchildhood before the rest of her family was killed during a Pawnee \nraid. \u0014\n\u0014\nDunbar discovers that the stories he had heard about the tribe were \nuntrue, and he develops a growing respect and appreciation for their \nlifestyle and culture. Learning their language, he is accepted as an \nhonored guest by the Sioux after he tells them of a migrating herd of \nbuffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgewick, Dunbar \nalso befriends a wolf he dubs \"Two Socks\" for its white forepaws. \nObserving Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, the Sioux give him \nthe name \"Dances With Wolves.\" During this time, Dunbar also forges a \nromantic relationship with Stands With A Fist and helps defend the \nvillage from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe. Dunbar eventually \nwins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands With A Fist and abandons \nFort Sedgewick. \u0014\n\u0014\nBecause of the growing Pawnee and white threat, Chief Ten Bears \ndecides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to \naccompany them but must first retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgewick \nas he realizes that it would provide the army with the means to find \nthe tribe. However, when he arrives he finds the fort reoccupied by \nthe U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, \nkilling Cisco and capturing Dunbar, arresting him as a traitor. Two \nofficers interrogate him, but Dunbar cannot prove his story, as a \ncorporal has found his diary and kept it for himself. Having refused \nto serve as an interpreter to the tribes, Dunbar is charged with \ndesertion and transported back east as a prisoner. Soldiers of the \nescort shoot Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar, \ndespite Dunbar's attempts to intervene. \u0014\n\u0014\nEventually, the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers, and \nfreeing Dunbar. They assert that they do not see him as a white man, \nbut as a Sioux warrior called Dances With Wolves. But, at the winter \ncamp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands With A Fist because his \ncontinuing presence would endanger the tribe. As they leave, Smiles A \nLot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar's liberation, \nand Wind In His Hair shouts to Dunbar, reminding him that he is \nDunbar's friend, a contrast to their original meeting where he \nshouted at Dunbar in hostility. U.S. troops are seen searching the \nmountains, but are unable to locate them, while a lone wolf howls in \nthe distance. An epilogue states that thirteen years later the last \nremnants of the free Sioux were subjugated to the American \ngovernment, ending the conquest of the Western Frontier states and \nthe livelihoods of the tribes in the plains.\u0014",

    "title": "DID GEORGE WHITEFIELD SERVE TWO MASTERS?",
    "words": "Did George Whitefield Serve Two Masters? \u0014\nA new biography helps us come to terms with the unsavory side of the \ngreat revivalists mission to America.\u0014\nRICK KENNEDY| FEBRUARY 22, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\nOn the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, there sits a statue \nof one of the schools co-founders: George Whitefield, the \n18th-century British evangelist and hero of the Great Awakening. \nUnderneath it, one finds a quote from Benjamin Franklin, the schools \nother co-founder (and Whitefields longtime friend): I knew him \nintimately upwards of thirty years. His integrity, disinterestedness \nand indefatigable zeal in prosecuting every good work I have never \nseen equaled and shall never see equaled.\u0014\n\u0014\nPeter Chois biography, George Whitefield: Evangelist for God and \nEmpire, explores various ways that Whitefields zeal for good works \nnot only put him on a pedestal but also entangled him in a war \nagainst Catholicism and the promotion of race-based slavery. By \nexposing less-than-uplifting facts about Whitefield, the book \nilluminates unhealthy aspects of 18th-century evangelicalisms \nintimate relationship with the British Empire.\u0014\n\u0014\nChoi, who is a pastor of spiritual theology at City Church, San \nFrancisco, and director of academic programs at the Newbigin House of \nStudies, is not out to undermine Whitefields reputation for piety or \ndrag his work as a revivalist down into mere politics. Instead, Choi \noffers a revealing case study of evangelicalisms entanglement with \nits host culture. The book is a good example of the maturity of \nevangelicalisms scholarship about itself. Although some prefer to \nemphasize the heavenly side of evangelicalisms history, the truth \nis, as Jesus taught in the parable of the wheat and the tares, the \nheavenly and earthly grow together until the final harvest.\u0014\n\u0014\nEncounters and Entanglements\u0014\n\u0014\nAnglo-American evangelicalism was born in the context of a \ngeopolitical war pitting British Protestantism against Spanish and \nFrench Roman Catholicism. Even after the defeat of the Spanish Armada \nin 1588, the British Empire was weak and small compared to the \nempires of Spain and France. In the following centurybeginning with \nthe Glorious Revolution of 1688 and continuing, after 1714, under the \nHanover monarchs (the various King Georges we know from our history \ntextbooks)the British were energized by a belief that their \nProtestant empire was at war with the antichrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Great Awakening in the American colonies cannot be understood \nwithout appreciating the looming threat of the Spanish and French \nfrom the North, the South, the backcountry to the west, and off the \ncoast. There were many skirmishes that foreshadowed a sort of civil \nwar within American Christendom. Meanwhile, Catholic missionaries \nwere enjoying more success among Native Americans than their \nProtestant counterparts. To all appearances, British Protestantisms \nhold on the eastern edge of the middle of North America was in danger.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe most audacious strategy undertaken by Britain in response was the \nfounding of Georgia in 1732, an event that becomes a major focal \npoint in Chois biography. From a close study of Whitefields \nactivities in colonial Georgia, we can observe how Anglo-American \nevangelicalism joined hope to fear, philanthropy to religious \nbigotry, evangelism to geopolitics, and Protestantism to the British \nEmpire.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn American history textbooks, the founding of Georgia has often been \ntreated as little more than an interesting side story. Choi, however, \nfollows more the recent scholarly recognition that the colony was \nactually at the eye of the imperial storm. In Georgia, he writes, \nthe empire invested its most potent mixture of patriotism and \npiety. In the newspapers of London in the 1730s, Georgiapressed \nclose against Spanish Floridawas where Britain would prove that it \nwas advancing the cause of Christ and stemming the rising tide of \nantichrist.\u0014\n\u0014\nChoi describes how missionary zeal, Christian philanthropy, utopian \nsocial engineering, and bold military strategy came together in the \ncreation of Georgia. In England, he observes, the founding trustees \nof Georgia fanned the flames of euphoria in the early 1730s by \nhiring publicists to write about their cause across the empire. \nFreedom, racial equality before God, respect for Native American \nrights, and all the rights and privileges of republican government \nwere to flourish in a new colony named for King George II, leader of \nthe Protestant world. As young men, the Wesley brothers and George \nWhitefield were swept up in the euphoria and traveled to Georgia as \ncelebrity missionaries.\u0014\n\u0014\nJohn Wesley went there unprepared, inspired by ideals too high to \nachieve. He then allowed himself to be distracted by romantic love \nbefore devoting time to evangelism among Native Americans. In \nWesleys failure, Choi sees the heights of British utopianism (a \nperspective he shares with the historian Geordan Hammond, author of \nJohn Wesley in America: Restoring Primitive Christianity).\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefield, on the other hand, arrived in Georgia well prepared and \nwithout utopian delusions. Choi points out that the Georgia frontier \noffered Whitefield the freedom to experiment with his calling to \npreach about the new birth. It represented a strategic location \nwhere he was free to nurture a form of religion that was experimental \nand entrepreneurial. In Whitefields pragmatism, Choi sees the seeds \nof both his success and his failure. The evangelist established a \nphilanthropic institution (the Bethesda orphanage), but he was not \ncommitted to upholding Georgias anti-slavery ideals, and he \nneglected the Georgia Trustees call for evangelistic work among \nNative Americans.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe orphanage was key to Whitefields role as evangelist for God and \nEmpire. Established near Savannah, Georgia, it began as a hybrid of \na trade school and a plantation. As Choi explains, It mixed moral \nand religious goals with imperial and mercantile aims. The orphans \nserved as both laborers and students. Money was needed, which \nprompted Whitefield to become a traveling revivalist and fundraiser \nall at once. In this role, he sparked and gave direction to a \ntransatlantic Great Awakening.\u0014\n\u0014\nFundraising for the orphanage was highly successful, but the flow of \nmoney eventually slowed when the revivals began to wane. Unwanted \norphans were numerous when Georgia was growing fast, but their \nnumbers also went into decline. At a time when Whitefield should have \ndownsized his orphanage, he aspired to grow it into a university \nalong the lines of the pietist institution that flourished at the \ntime in Halle, Germany. Choi carefully follows Whitfield into \nDickensian situations in which the preacher forcibly removed \nprospective orphans from their siblings and/or guardians.\u0014\n\u0014\nNever an abolitionist, Whitefield bought a plantation in North \nCarolina and became a slave owner as a means to help fund his plans \nfor Bethesda. Economic exigencies spurred his increasingly ardent \ncalls for the Georgia Trustees to lift their ban on slavery. The \neconomy of Georgia, he declared, would be strengthened by abandoning \nthe colonys anti-slavery ideals. If any one person can be credited \nwith responsibility for the introduction of black slavery in \nGeorgia, Choi writes, it should be Whitefield.\u0014\n\u0014\nChoi separates his book into two parts: Encounters and \nEntanglements. The first half sets up the more analytical chapters \nin the second half on Whitefield and Slavery, Whitefield and War, \nand Whitefield and His Colleges. In the chapter on war, Choi notes \nthat Whitefield, like most evangelicals, was a true believer in \nEnglish liberty. For Whitefield, he writes, there was little \ndaylight between the cause of Christ and the fight for empire, and \nthe Catholicism espoused by the French and Spanish was antithetical \nto core political (and Christian) values of liberty and freedom. When \nthe French and Indian War began in 1754, a conflict that soon erupted \ninto a multi-continent clash between Catholics and Protestants, the \nBritish believed themselves to be freedom fighters. Choi notes that \nWhitefield and other evangelicals so identified with this mindset \nthat they managed to shed some of the stigma attached to religious \nfanatics, thus finding a more credible and respectable space for \nthemselves within the British establishment.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe last of Chois entanglements, Whitefield and his Colleges, \ntakes us back to his role in creating the University of Pennsylvania \nand his broader support for Christian education. Choi emphasizes \nWhitefields hope that a network of regional educational institutions \nat the fringes of the empire would not only serve to teach British \nvalues on the frontier but also uphold the initial work begun in the \nenthusiasm of the Great Awakening. For his own Bethesda, Whitefield \nsought, against the advice of others, a royal charter as a \nuniversity. He believed that the British crown best ensured the \nongoing evangelical character of a frontier institution. Choi \nrecognizes in Whitefield a centrifugal vision of empire, with the \ncenter held by the Hanoverian monarchy while far-flung imperial \nuniversities, colleges, and academies spread the political, economic, \nand evangelical benefits of the British culture.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Wheat and the Tares\u0014\n\u0014\nTheres no doubt that the portrait Chois biography paints is deeply \ntroubling, at least in certain respects. Whitefield clearly crossed \nan important moral line when he allowed himself to advocate \ninstalling a race-based slave system in a colony that had established \nitself with the hope of undermining that system. Whatever else might \nbe said of his dynamic preaching and missionary efforts, we have to \nreckon with the ways that Whitefields entanglement with British \nimperialism damaged the integrity of his Christian witness.\u0014\n\u0014\nDoes this mean Whitefield should be removed from the pedestal upon \nwhich evangelicals have placed him? Should his statue at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania come down? Chois theme of entanglement \nencourages sober reflection over precipitous action, in that it \ncompels us to account for how wheat and tares can grow within the \nsame field. Take, for instance, Chois account of Whitefield \nadmonishing Benjamin Franklin that the proposed curriculum in \nPennsylvania needed to convince students of their natural \ndepravity. Even in his capacity as an evangelist for empire, it \nseems that Whitefield never truly ceased being an evangelist for God.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhitefields entanglements with his culture have long been \nrepresentative of evangelical entanglements in general. From \nWhitefields generation up to the present day, evangelicals have \nalways had a tendency to join hope to fear, philanthropy to religious \nbigotry, evangelism to geopolitics, and Protestantism to empire. Like \nWhitefield, we confuse earthly and heavenly politics. Who can throw \nthe first stone? Who deserves to stand on a pedestal if not \nWhitefield?\u0014\n\u0014\nChoi notes that Whitefield, when writing to Franklin about the \ncollege they were founding in Pennsylvania, identified the need for \na well approved Christian Orator, a teacher skilled in Christian \nthinking, wisdom, and citizenship. Choi becomes this teacher in the \nepilogue, as he discusses the tenuous position that Whitefield now \noccupies in the evangelical history. For what its worth, I would \nrecommend pairing Choi with another well approved Christian Orator: \nThomas Kidd, author of George Whitefield: Americas Spiritual \nFounding Father. Kidd and Choi agree on the facts of Whitefields \nlife, but they emphasize different themesdifferent sides of the same \nman. Taken together, they offer a well-rounded picture of \nWhitefields efforts as a dual evangelist for God and empire.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nRick Kennedy teaches history at Point Loma Nazarene University and \nserves as secretary to the Conference on Faith and History. He is \nauthor of The First American Evangelical: A Short Life of Cotton \nMather (Eerdmans).\u0014",

    "words": "Dirk Willem Burned after Rescuing Pursuer\u0014\n                                          Dan Graves, MSL\u0014\n\u0014\nHow many Anabaptists died during the sixteenth century persecution in \nEurope? No one knows for sure. What is certain is that at least 1,500 \nwere cruelly tortured and killed. For the most part these were \npeaceful citizens who did not believe in war and who became the \nforerunners of today's Mennonites and Amish. The main complaint of \nthe authorities against them was that they did not believe infant \nbaptism had any value. They chose to be re-baptized as willing adults.\u0014\n\u0014\nAlthough no other charges were proven against them, they were \nsentenced to death. For the men death was usually by fire; for women \nit was by drowning. Many Anabaptists proved to be so bold in their \nfinal testimony for Christ that authorities began to clamp their \ntongues before leading them out to their execution so that they could \nnot speak up and win more converts.\u0014\n\u0014\nOne of the Anabaptists who died in flames was Dirk Willem. His story \nis particularly touching, because he forfeited a real chance to \nescape when he turned back to help one of his pursuers.\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was captured and imprisoned in his home town of Asperen in the \nNetherlands. Knowing that his fate would be death if he remained in \nprison, Dirk made a rope of strips of cloth and slid down it over the \nprison wall. A guard chased him.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrost had covered a nearby pond with a thin layer of ice. Dirk risked \na dash across it. He made it to safety, but the ice broke under his \npursuer who cried for help. Dirk believed the Scripture that a man \nshould help his enemies. He immediately turned back and pulled the \nfloundering man from the frigid water.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn gratitude for his life, the man would have let Dirk escape, but a \nBurgomaster (chief magistrate) standing on the shore sternly ordered \nhim to arrest Dirk and bring him back, reminding him of the oath he \nhad sworn as an officer of the peace.\u0014\n\u0014\nBack to prison went Dirk. He was condemned to death for being \nre-baptized, allowing secret church services in his home and letting \nothers be baptized there. The record of his sentencing concludes: \n\"all of which is contrary to our holy Christian faith, and to the \ndecrees of his royal majesty, and ought not to be tolerated, but \nseverely punished, for an example to others; therefore, we the \naforesaid judges, having, with mature deliberation of council, \nexamined and considered all that was to be considered in this matter, \nhave condemned and do condemn by these presents in the name; and in \nthe behalf, of his royal majesty, as Count of Holland, the aforesaid \nDirk Willems, prisoner, persisting obstinately in his opinion, that \nhe shall be executed with fire, until death ensues; and declare all \nhis property confiscated, for the benefit of his royal majesty.\"\u0014\n\u0014\nDirk was burned to death on this day, May 16, 1569. His tongue was \nnot clamped. The wind blew the flame away from him so that his death \nwas long and miserable. Time and again Dirk cried out to God. Finally \none of the authorities could not bear to see him suffer any longer \nand ordered an underling to end his torment with a quick death.\u0014\n\u0014\nBibliography:\u0014\n\u0014\n1.Braght, Thieleman J. van.

    "title": "DID JESUS GO TO HELL AFTER HE DIED?",
    "words": "Did Jesus Go to Hell After He Died? \u0014\nApr 19, 2019   Logos\u0014\n\u0014\nSome versions of the Apostles Creed say Jesus descended into hell. \nDid he? \u0014\n\u0014\nFor centuries, Christians have proclaimed,  he [Jesus] descended \ninto hell Other versions of the creed say the grave. \u0014\n\u0014\nWhy do we say those words at all, and what are the implications of \none versus the other?\u0014\n\u0014\nThis brief post is only an introduction to the matter. Ill present \nthe main relevant biblical texts, a brief overview the primary \ninterpretations, and a note or two about how I used Logos to find \nthis information. \u0014\n\u0014\nFinally, I suggest resources for further study. \u0014\n\u0014\nBible verses about Jesus descent into hell\u0014\nThe main texts are Acts 2:31, Rom. 10:67, and Eph. 4:9: Acts 2:31\u0014\n\u0014\n[The patriarch David] foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the \nChrist, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see \ncorruption. Rom. 10:67   (FRS: Very conservative view of the text)\u0014\n\u0014\nBut the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, \nWho will ascend into heaven?  (that is, to bring Christ down) or \nWho will descend into the abyss?  (that is, to bring Christ up \nfrom the dead).\u0014\nEph. 4:79\u0014\n\u0014\nBut grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of \nChrists gift. Therefore it says, \u0014\n     When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, \u0014\n     and he gave gifts to men. \u0014\n\u0014\n(In saying, He ascended, what does it mean but that he had also \ndescended into the lower regions, the earth?)\u0014\n\u0014\nRelated texts are 1 Pet. 3:19 and 1 Pet. 4:6, which speak of Christ \nproclaiming the gospel to the spirits in prison (3:19) and the dead \n(4:6). There are several interpretations on these passages, some \nholding that the spirits in prison are not the same as the dead, but \nare actually hostile angelic powers to whom Christ proclaimed \nvictory upon his ascension.1\u0014\n\u0014\nVarious interpretations \u0014\n\u0014\nLouis Berkhof, in his 1938 Systematic Theology, conveniently \nsummarizes the dominant positions on the creedal expression he \ndescended into hell (the last being his own): \u0014\n\u0014\n(1) The Catholic Church takes it to mean that, after His death, \nChrist went into the Limbus Patrum, where the Old Testament saints \nwere awaiting the revelation and application of His redemption, \npreached the gospel to them, and brought them out to heaven. \u0014\n\u0014\n(2) The Lutherans regard the descent into hades as the first stage of \nthe exaltation of Christ. Christ went into the underworld to reveal \nand consummate His victory over Satan and the powers of darkness, and \nto pronounce their sentence of condemnation. Some Lutherans place \nthis triumphal march between the death of Christ and His \nresurrection; others, after the resurrection. \u0014\n\u0014\n(3) The Church of England holds that, while Christs body was in the \ngrave, the soul went into hades, more particularly into paradise, the \nabode of the souls of the righteous, and gave them a fuller \nexposition of the truth. \u0014\n\u0014\n(4) Calvin interprets the phrase metaphorically, as referring to the \npenal sufferings of Christ on the cross, where He really suffered the \npangs of hell. Similarly, the Heidelberg Catechism. According to the \nusual Reformed position the words refer not only to the sufferings on \nthe cross, but also to the agonies of Gethsemane. \u0014\n\u0014\n(5) Scripture certainly does not teach a literal descent of Christ \ninto hell. Moreover, there are serious objections to this view. He \ncannot have descended into hell according to the body, for this was \nin the grave. If He really did descend into hell, it can only have \nbeen as to His soul, and this would mean that only half of His human \nnature shared in this stage of His humiliation (or exaltation). \nMoreover, as long as Christ had not yet risen from the dead, the time \nhad not come for a triumphal march such as the Lutherans assume. And, \nfinally, at the time of His death Christ commended His spirit to His \nFather. This seems to indicate that He would be passive rather than \nactive from the time of His death until He arose from the grave. \u0014\n\u0014\nOn the whole it seems best to combine two thoughts: (a) that Christ \nsuffered the pangs of hell before His death, in Gethsemane and on the \ncross; and (b) that He entered the deepest humiliation of the state \nof death.\u0014\n\u0014\nR. J. Bauckhams takes a similar view in his entry Descent into \nHell in the New Dictionary of Theology: that the verses in question \nsimply amount to saying that Christ truly died, and are not \nconcerned with whether Christ descended into hell or not.\u0014\n\u0014\nCharles Hodge argues similarly in his systematic theology, saying \nthat the word translated hell is one and the same as grave:\u0014\n\u0014\nFrom the original and proper meaning of the Greek word ?d??, and the \ncorresponding English word hell. Both mean the unseen world. The one \nsignifies what is unseen, the other what is covered and thus hidden \nfrom view. Both are used as the rendering for the Hebrew word ??????? \n(probably from ?????? to ask, or demand), the state or place of the \ndead; the orcus rapax of the Latins. All the dead, the righteous and \nthe wicked, alike go into the invisible world, or, in this sense, \ndescend into hell. Hence to be buried, to go down to the grave, to \ndescend into hell, are in Scriptural language equivalent forms of \nexpression. (emphasis mine)\u0014\n\u0014\nSo whats the answer? \u0014\n\u0014\nThere are certainly traditions that hold that Christ somehow \ndescended to hell in the sense of going spiritually to the \nunderworld, but those are not without major objection (see Berkhofs \nfifth point).\u0014\n\u0014\nIn fact, those theological challenges lead many interpreters (and \nfrom my brief study, it seems most) to hold that the verses and \ncreedal confession affirm simply that Christ truly died and went to \nthe grave. \u0014\n\u0014\nIt is also worth noting that this particular phrase wasnt introduced \ninto the creed until the fourth century, and then not as a separate \nor distinct article, but as merely explanatory. He was dead and \nburied, i.e., he descended into hell. \u0014\n\u0014\nThink long enough about this doctrine, and you will see that it is \nshrouded in mystery, difficult to grasp with reason and the five \nsenses.\u0014",

    "words": "Americas ignorance of race is willful. Immediately\u0014\nafter the end of Reconstruction, a group emerged\u0014\ncalled the Daughters of the Confederacy. Essentially,\u0014\ntheir goal was to rewrite racial history in America.\u0014\n\u0014\nThey had three objectives:\u0014\n\u0014\n1. To prove that the Civil War was not about\u0014\nslavery, but rather, about state sovereignty.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis they sought to establish in spite of the fact\u0014\nthat every Confederate state wrote in its statement\u0014\nof secession that the maintenance of slavery was\u0014\ntheir primary consideration. Alexander Stevens,\u0014\nthe vice president of the Confederacy, said in his\u0014\nCornerstone speech, March 21, 1861: Our new\u0014\ngovernment...rests, upon the great truth that the\u0014\nNegro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u0014\nsubordination to the superior race is his natural\u0014\nand normal condition. This, our new government,\u0014\nis the first, in the history of the world, based\u0014\nupon this great physical, philosophical and moral\u0014\ntruth.\u0014\n\u0014\n2. To prove that slavery was a benign institution\u0014\nin which blacks were treated humanely.\u0014\n\u0014\nFrederick Douglass gave an accurate depiction\u0014\nof the brutality of slavery in his July 5, 1852\u0014\nspeech, What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\u0014\nDouglass posited, What, am I to argue it is\u0014\nwrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their\u0014\nliberty, to work them without wages, to keep them\u0014\nignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to\u0014\nbeat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the\u0014\nlash, to load their limbs with iron, to hunt them\u0014\nwith dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their\u0014\nfamilies, to knock out their teeth, to burn their\u0014\nflesh, to starve them into obedience and submission\u0014\nto their masters? Must I argue that a system\u0014\nmarked with blood, and stained with pollution, is\u0014\nwrong?\u0014\n\u0014\nThe following is an actual advertisement for a\u0014\nrunaway slave:\u0014\n\u0014\nTwenty dollars reward, ran away from the subscriber,\u0014\non the 14th instant, a negro girl named\u0014\nMolly.

To prove that Confederate soldiers were\u0014\nheroic and honorable people. \u0014\n\u0014\nThey were a people who fought courageously against \u0014\noverwhelming odds for a just cause. They erected\u0014\n700 monuments to honor men who engaged in\u0014\nwhat the United Nations would classify as crimes\u0014\nagainst humanity. Going to American historys\u0014\nforbidden zone will show that the leaders of the\u0014\nConfederacy were not heroic; but rather, in the\u0014\nwords of James Baldwin, were moral monsters\u0014\nwho were engaged in acts of treason against the\u0014\nUnited States.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe tragedy of Daughters of the Confederacy is\u0014\nhow they were able to spread this disinformation\u0014\ninto the curriculum of schools systems across the\u0014\nAmerica. When one factors in 246 years of slavery,\u0014\nalong with another 100-plus years of slavery, black\u0014\ndescendants of slavery have a unique justice claim.\u0014",

    "title": "DOES JESUS CONTRADICT THE O.T. ON POLYGAMY?",
    "words": "Does Jesus Contradict the Old Testament on Polygamy?  21 Aug 2019 \u0014\n \u0014\nBy David Instone-Brewer, adapted from the forthcoming Moral Questions \nof the Bible: Timeless Truth in a Changing World (Lexham Press, 2019).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus used the same Old Testament text to teach monogamy as used by \nthe Jews of the diaspora and at Qumran. Polygamy had been useful in \ntimes of war for childless widows, but now it was causing hardship.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen an African tribal chief converts to Christianity, what happens \nto all his wives? Should he divorce them and send them back to their \nparents home in shame and penury, or should he live away from them \nin a separate house, but continue to provide for them financially? \nThis is a classic problem for missionaries in countries that practice \npolygamy, and one to which there is no easy answerjust the fervent \nhope that the next generation will marry only one wife! It must seem \nvery strange for those polygamous families when their normal, \nsocially acceptable lifestyle is suddenly regarded as immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews whom Jesus lived among had the same problem. Polygamy had \nbeen considered perfectly normal and proper until the Romans took \nover and said it was disgusting and immoral. The Romans allowed Jews \nto continue practicing polygamy in Palestine, but elsewhere in the \nempire monogamy was strictly enforced.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Jews living outside Palestine, therefore, got used to the \nprinciple of one wife, and it seemed natural to them. By Jesus time, \nmany Jews had come to agree with the Roman view, and polygamy fell \nout of practice during subsequent generations, although the Jews did \nnot actually outlaw polygamy until the eleventh century.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont know how frequent polygamy was among the Jews in Jesus day \nbecause we have the complete family records of only one family in the \nearly second centurythey were preserved in a bag hidden in a desert \ncave. So it is significant that this family does include a second \nwife. The documents include the marriage certificate of a widow \ncalled Babatha when she married a man who already had a wife. Babatha \nowned her own land and business, so she didnt marry for financial \nsupportperhaps it was for companionship, or even love!\u0014\n \u0014\nPolygamy in the Old Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament allows polygamy but doesnt encourage it. Great men \nsuch as Abraham, Israel, Judah, Gideon, Samson, David, and Solomon \nhad multiple wives, though the Old Testament records many problems \nthat resulted. However, the law actually made it mandatory in one \ncircumstance: if a married man died without leaving a male heir, his \nbrother was required to marry his widow regardless of whether he \nalready had a wife. This was so that she would have support during \nher old age (either from her new husband or from her son) and so that \nthe family name and land would be passed on (Deut 25:56). Polygamy \nwas also allowed in other circumstances, and the only restriction was \nthat you shouldnt marry two sisters (Lev 18:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nPolygamy was beneficial when the number of men was reduced by \nwarfare. It not only helped women who would otherwise be on their own \nbut also helped to replace the population more quickly. In peacetime, \nhowever, this practice meant that if rich men had more than one wife, \nthen some poor men had to remain single.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolygamy in the New Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus took the side of the Romans against the Jewish establishment on \nthis occasion. Most Jews outside Palestine and some in Palestine \ndisagreed with polygamy. For example, the Qumran sect regarded \npolygamy as one of the three great sins of mainstream Judaism. They \ncalled these sins the nets of the devil by which the \nsmooth-speaking Pharisees entrapped the people.\u0014\nThey couldnt actually find a verse in the Old Testament that spoke \nagainst polygamy, so they combined two different verses that both \ncontained the phrase male and femaleGenesis 1:27 and 7:9. The \nfirst says, God created them; male and female, and the second says, \ntwo and two, male and female, went into the ark (esv). Since male \nand female were called two in Genesis 7, the Qumran community \ninferred that it also meant two in Genesis 2 and concluded from \nthis that only two people could marry. They referred to this doctrine \nas the foundation of creation. We may not be convinced by their \nlogic, but as far as they were concerned it was case proven.\u0014\n\u0014\nJews outside Palestine used a different method to show that polygamy \nwas wrongthey added a word to Genesis 2:24. This says a man  is \nunited to his wifewhich implies one man and one wife, so they \nemphasized this conclusion by adding the word two to the next \nphrase: and those two shall become one flesh. We find this \nadditional word in all ancient translations of Genesisin Greek, \nAramaic, Syriac, and even in Samaritanshowing that it had very \nwidespread support. Presumably, it also had some support among Hebrew \nspeakers, but no one in Jesus day would deliberately change the \noriginal text, so no Hebrew Bible has this word.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen the Pharisees were questioning Jesus about divorce, he took the \nopportunity to set them straight about polygamy, too. Jesus used both \nsets of arguments used by other Jews. He quoted the key verse used by \nQumran Jews (Gen 1:27) and even said this was what happened at the \nbeginning of creation (Mark 10:6, which presumably reminded his \nlisteners that Qumran Jews called this the foundation of creation). \nThen he quoted the verse preferred by Jews outside PalestineGenesis \n2:24including the additional word two (Mark 10:8; Matt 19:5). By \ndeliberately using both arguments, Jesus emphasized that he agreed \nwith those Jews who taught monogamy, contrary to the Pharisees.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul took the teaching against polygamy further by reversing the \ncommand that a man had to marry his dead brothers wife. This had \nalways been a difficult rule, though it made sense in the world of \nthe early Old Testament. In Hittite law (and probably other ancient \nNear Eastern laws), a widow could be married against her will to any \nmale relativeeven to her husbands elderly grandfather or infant \nnephew. But Moses law restricted her marriage to someone of roughly \nher agethat is, she should only marry a brother of her husbandand \nshe was allowed to refuse. Paul later decided that this law was \noutmoded. He said that a widow could marry whomever she wanted (1 Cor \n7:39)though he added that she should marry a fellow believer.\u0014\n \u0014\nCreating new problems\u0014\n\u0014\nEnforcing monogamy may have cleared away a scandal, but it created a \nnew problem for the church. Suddenly there were more widows without \nhusbands and without support because they couldnt become anyones \nsecond wife. To try to help these widows, the church created a new \ntype of social club for thema widows association.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis spread outside Palestine as a good solution to a problem they \nshared, because no polygamy was allowed outside Palestine. It was one \nof the first things the fledgling church did, and right from the \nstart it was problematicGreek-speaking widows complained that the \nAramaic speakers were being given more food, for one thing (Acts \n6:1)! Young Timothy, leading the church in Ephesus, had other \nproblems with his widows, and Paul had to write a whole chapter to \nhelp him cope (1 Tim 5). Nevertheless, this association was a good \nsolution to their needs, and it was far better than expecting these \nwomen to each find a new husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did Jesus and Paul change Gods commands? Had God always been in \nfavor of monogamy so that they were now returning to his original \nwishes? Although Jesus said that this was how things were at the \nbeginning, this doesnt mean that God had subsequently given the \nwrong commands to Moses. It was the purpose of these commands, rather \nthan the commands themselves, that was important.

    "title": "DOES JESUS CONTRADICT THE O.T. ON POLYGAMY?",
    "words": "Does Jesus Contradict the Old Testament on Polygamy? \u0014\n21 Aug 2019 \u0014\n\u0014\nBy David Instone-Brewer, adapted from the forthcoming Moral Questions \nof the Bible: Timeless Truth in a Changing World (Lexham Press, 2019).\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus used the same Old Testament text to teach monogamy as used by \nthe Jews of the diaspora and at Qumran. Polygamy had been useful in \ntimes of war for childless widows, but now it was causing hardship.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen an African tribal chief converts to Christianity, what happens \nto all his wives? Should he divorce them and send them back to their \nparents home in shame and penury, or should he live away from them \nin a separate house, but continue to provide for them financially? \nThis is a classic problem for missionaries in countries that practice \npolygamy, and one to which there is no easy answerjust the fervent \nhope that the next generation will marry only one wife! It must seem \nvery strange for those polygamous families when their normal, \nsocially acceptable lifestyle is suddenly regarded as immoral.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Jews whom Jesus lived among had the same problem. Polygamy had \nbeen considered perfectly normal and proper until the Romans took \nover and said it was disgusting and immoral. The Romans allowed Jews \nto continue practicing polygamy in Palestine, but elsewhere in the \nempire monogamy was strictly enforced.\u0014\n\u0014\nMany Jews living outside Palestine, therefore, got used to the \nprinciple of one wife, and it seemed natural to them. By Jesus time, \nmany Jews had come to agree with the Roman view, and polygamy fell \nout of practice during subsequent generations, although the Jews did \nnot actually outlaw polygamy until the eleventh century.\u0014\n\u0014\nWe dont know how frequent polygamy was among the Jews in Jesus day \nbecause we have the complete family records of only one family in the \nearly second centurythey were preserved in a bag hidden in a desert \ncave. So it is significant that this family does include a second \nwife. The documents include the marriage certificate of a widow \ncalled Babatha when she married a man who already had a wife. Babatha \nowned her own land and business, so she didnt marry for financial \nsupportperhaps it was for companionship, or even love!\u0014\n\u0014\nPolygamy in the Old Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nThe Old Testament allows polygamy but doesnt encourage it. Great men \nsuch as Abraham, Israel, Judah, Gideon, Samson, David, and Solomon \nhad multiple wives, though the Old Testament records many problems \nthat resulted. However, the law actually made it mandatory in one \ncircumstance: if a married man died without leaving a male heir, his \nbrother was required to marry his widow regardless of whether he \nalready had a wife. This was so that she would have support during \nher old age (either from her new husband or from her son) and so that \nthe family name and land would be passed on (Deut 25:56). Polygamy \nwas also allowed in other circumstances, and the only restriction was \nthat you shouldnt marry two sisters (Lev 18:18).\u0014\n\u0014\nPolygamy was beneficial when the number of men was reduced by \nwarfare. It not only helped women who would otherwise be on their own \nbut also helped to replace the population more quickly. In peacetime, \nhowever, this practice meant that if rich men had more than one wife, \nthen some poor men had to remain single.\u0014\n\u0014\nPolygamy in the New Testament\u0014\n\u0014\nJesus took the side of the Romans against the Jewish establishment on \nthis occasion. Most Jews outside Palestine and some in Palestine \ndisagreed with polygamy. For example, the Qumran sect regarded \npolygamy as one of the three great sins of mainstream Judaism. They \ncalled these sins the nets of the devil by which the \nsmooth-speaking Pharisees entrapped the people.\u0014\nThey couldnt actually find a verse in the Old Testament that spoke \nagainst polygamy, so they combined two different verses that both \ncontained the phrase male and femaleGenesis 1:27 and 7:9. The \nfirst says, God created them; male and female, and the second says, \ntwo and two, male and female, went into the ark (esv). Since male \nand female were called two in Genesis 7, the Qumran community \ninferred that it also meant two in Genesis 2 and concluded from \nthis that only two people could marry. They referred to this doctrine \nas the foundation of creation. We may not be convinced by their \nlogic, but as far as they were concerned it was case proven.\u0014\n\u0014\nJews outside Palestine used a different method to show that polygamy \nwas wrongthey added a word to Genesis 2:24. This says a man  is \nunited to his wifewhich implies one man and one wife, so they \nemphasized this conclusion by adding the word two to the next \nphrase: and those two shall become one flesh. We find this \nadditional word in all ancient translations of Genesisin Greek, \nAramaic, Syriac, and even in Samaritanshowing that it had very \nwidespread support. Presumably, it also had some support among Hebrew \nspeakers, but no one in Jesus day would deliberately change the \noriginal text, so no Hebrew Bible has this word.\u0014\nWhen the Pharisees were questioning Jesus about divorce, he took the \nopportunity to set them straight about polygamy, too. Jesus used both \nsets of arguments used by other Jews. He quoted the key verse used by \nQumran Jews (Gen 1:27) and even said this was what happened at the \nbeginning of creation (Mark 10:6, which presumably reminded his \nlisteners that Qumran Jews called this the foundation of creation). \nThen he quoted the verse preferred by Jews outside PalestineGenesis \n2:24including the additional word two (Mark 10:8; Matt 19:5). By \ndeliberately using both arguments, Jesus emphasized that he agreed \nwith those Jews who taught monogamy, contrary to the Pharisees.\u0014\n\u0014\nPaul took the teaching against polygamy further by reversing the \ncommand that a man had to marry his dead brothers wife. This had \nalways been a difficult rule, though it made sense in the world of \nthe early Old Testament. In Hittite law (and probably other ancient \nNear Eastern laws), a widow could be married against her will to any \nmale relativeeven to her husbands elderly grandfather or infant \nnephew. But Moses law restricted her marriage to someone of roughly \nher agethat is, she should only marry a brother of her husbandand \nshe was allowed to refuse. Paul later decided that this law was \noutmoded. He said that a widow could marry whomever she wanted (1 Cor \n7:39)though he added that she should marry a fellow believer.\u0014\n\u0014\nCreating new problems\u0014\n\u0014\nEnforcing monogamy may have cleared away a scandal, but it created a \nnew problem for the church. Suddenly there were more widows without \nhusbands and without support because they couldnt become anyones \nsecond wife. To try to help these widows, the church created a new \ntype of social club for thema widows association.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis spread outside Palestine as a good solution to a problem they \nshared, because no polygamy was allowed outside Palestine. It was one \nof the first things the fledgling church did, and right from the \nstart it was problematicGreek-speaking widows complained that the \nAramaic speakers were being given more food, for one thing (Acts \n6:1)! Young Timothy, leading the church in Ephesus, had other \nproblems with his widows, and Paul had to write a whole chapter to \nhelp him cope (1 Tim 5). Nevertheless, this association was a good \nsolution to their needs, and it was far better than expecting these \nwomen to each find a new husband.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhy did Jesus and Paul change Gods commands? Had God always been in \nfavor of monogamy so that they were now returning to his original \nwishes? Although Jesus said that this was how things were at the \nbeginning, this doesnt mean that God had subsequently given the \nwrong commands to Moses. It was the purpose of these commands, rather \nthan the commands themselves, that was important. It was Gods \npurpose that Jesus and Paul were upholding.\u0014\n\u0014\nGods purpose for marriage was to help individuals find mutual \nsupport in families. When there were too few men due to warfare, this \npurpose was accomplished by allowing polygamy to ensure male heirs. \nIn more stable times, polygamy resulted in many men remaining single \nbecause wealthy men could have many wives. In order to maintain Gods \npurposes at times like these, the rule about polygamy had to change. \nGods purposes are eternal, but his commands change in order to carry \nout those purposes in different situations.

    "title": "DAVID RAPED BATHSHEB AND WHY THAT MATTERS",
    "words": "David raped Bathsheba, and why that matters\u0014\nNovember 1, 2019\u0014\n\u0014\n(RNS)  David raped. Its important we get that right.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis crucial bit of biblical interpretation came in a tweet in early \nOctober from Rachael Denhollander, the first young athlete to accuse \nGymnastics USA physician Larry Nassar of sexual assault and now a \nspeaker and author on surviving abuse. She was responding to a tweet \nfrom evangelical leader Matt Smethurst who, while listing the various \nsins of biblical figures, stated, David fornicated.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenhollander followed up her response the next day and again a few \ndays later, outlining the biblical support for her assertion that \nwhat David did to Bathsheba was not fornication or adultery, but rape.\u0014\n\u0014\nAs its often told, Bathshebas story is one of a lustful king who \nsaw her bathing on the roof, (and) her beauty and the moonlight \noverthrew him. Bathsheba is the irresistibly nubile woman who \nknowingly de-robed in Davids line of sight so she could seduce him. \nWhat followed was only what happens between a man lured by the wiles \nof a beautiful woman. If David transgressed, this reading goes, it \nwas in murdering Bathshebas husband, Uriah.\u0014\n\u0014\nDenhollanders contradictory interpretation shouldnt be \ncontroversial. As Denhollander pointed out, when the prophet Nathan \ntells David the parable of the rich man who took his neighbors ewe, \nDavid is portrayed as stealing, and Bathsheba is portrayed as a lamb \nthat is slaughtered.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is important, because the Old Testament distinguishes between \nconsensual and non-consensual sex between married people who are not \nmarried to each other. In Deuteronomy, the laws even mulled whether \nthe act took place in a city, where the woman could cry for aid if \nthe sex was unwanted, or the country, where her ability to resist \nfell only to her, and her innocence was presumed.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat Nathan equates Bathsheba to an innocent lamb suggests that she \ncould not resist David. Therefore he was guilty of rape.\u0014\n\u0014\nNor is Denhollanders take novel. More than a decade ago, popular \nauthor and preacher John Piper also called David a rapist. Scholars \nsuch as George Athas, Richard Davidson, Cheryl Exum and David and \nDiana Garland likewise argue that David raped Bathsheba.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut really we only need use our own eyes and heart to see this truth. \nThe most powerful man in a monarchial society saw a woman he wanted, \nsent other men to bring her to him, vaginally penetrated her with his \npenis, then murdered her husband to avoid being found out. Thats \nrape, folks.\u0014\n\u0014\nEven David recognizes his crime. Nathans parable angered David so \nmuch that he called for the execution of the perpetrator, to which \nNathan famously responded, Thou art the man! The consequences \nplague David for the rest of his life. As Nathan promised, \ndestruction makes its bed in Davids home.\u0014\n\u0014\nWhen most people hear the term rape, what comes to mind is a masked \nman physically overpowering a woman and violently penetrating her. \nThat is rape, to be sure. But using ones power over another person \nto coerce them into sex acts is also sexual violence. Some have \nclaimed that Davids coercion was not physical (though it could have \nbeen; the Bible does not say). Bathsheba could have defied the kings \norder  just as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego chose death rather \nthan worship Nebuchadnezzars statue.\u0014\n\u0014\nThat argument proves the point exactly: Forcing a person to choose \nbetween sex and death is rape. \u0014\n\u0014\nSo why did Denhollanders assertion create a Twitter storm? One \nperson, accusing Denhollander of modern arrogance, chimed in, If \nit was rape, funny how no one bothered to let God know. He condemns \nDavid for sinning against Uriah and God himself. Nothing in the text \nindicates rape. Another argued that since the Bible doesnt indicate \nthere was physical force, then rape was impossible.\u0014\nAn anonymous commenter added, unhelpfully, that David actually raped \nall his wives because he was more powerful than all of them.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe root of these objections seems to be a concern not to apply our \n21st century understanding of sexual abuse to the Bible. However, as \nNathans story and Deuteronomy make clear, even then people \nunderstood that there are situations in which a person does not have \nthe agency to say no.\u0014\n\u0014\nBut theres another reason why some resist calling Davids crime \nrape. The Southern Baptist Convention, like the Roman Catholic \nChurch, is reckoning with decades of sexual abuse. Those covering up \nor defending abuse use words like moral failing, inappropriate \nrelationship, and sexual incident to describe what actually \nhappened. \u0014\n\u0014\nIf we can use a softer label or somehow chalk sexual violence up to \nlust or hormones or a womans seduction, we are off the hook. It \nallows us to think that the preacher just had a lapse in judgment. \nAnd lapses in judgment are understandable, unavoidable even  Boys \nwill be boys. This is what we do when we fail to call Bathshebas \nrape what it is.\u0014\n\u0014\nParticularly relevant to this conversation is the story of Jules \nWoodson, whose alleged abuser recently announced plans to start a new \nchurch. Woodson was 17 years old when, she has publicly declared, her \nyouth pastor, Andy Savage, sexually assaulted her. He never faced \ncharges, due to the statute of limitations.\u0014\n\u0014\nYears later, when Savage addressed his church about Woodsons \naccusations, he called his assault a sexual incident, his response \nbiblical, and the counsel he received wise. His self-acquittal, \nhe said, was done believing that Gods forgiveness is greater than \nany sin.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\nThe church stood and applauded while Savage wiped away tears and his \npastor embraced him. Savage has since confessed that his sexual \nassault was an abuse of power but carefully referred to an \ninappropriate relationship.\u0014\n\u0014\nShould Savage and others like him be forgiven? Yes, absolutely. But, \nas Woodson recently said to me, Grace is not the issue; this is not \nabout forgiveness. This is about justice and accountability.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis is why it matters that we get it right that David raped \nBathsheba. Victims will be denied justice so long as we cant come to \nterms with clergy rape as rape. Ideology drives action, and for many \nevangelicals a skewed perception of power dynamics and sexual \nviolence is at the wheel.\u0014\n\u0014\nIn many ways, evangelical tradition has preferred the alternative: \nthat Bathsheba be the one called to account. In the dark undercurrent \nof purity culture, boys are allowed to be boys, while a woman must \nguard her sexuality with all her might, because that is what \nultimately matters about her. It is the standard by which a future \nhusband will judge her.\u0014\n\u0014\nThis view of female sexuality may seem unrelated to the debate about \nDavid and Bathsheba, but enshrining virginity (vaginal virginity, at \nleast) while excusing men for deviant sexual behavior perpetuates a \nview that women are objects for sexual pleasure  not human beings \nmade in Gods image. \u0014\n\u0014\nConsider the widespread evangelical Christian response to viewing \npornography. A 2016 study showed that some 57% of pastors and 64% of \nyouth pastors have looked at or currently look at pornography. Most \napproaches to the problem focus on reducing access  porn-blocking \nsoftware, accountability groups, etc. Women have a role here, too; \nthey should always dress modestly so as to avoid causing their \nbrothers to lust. If all access is cut off, the logic goes, men would \nnot lust.\u0014\n\u0014\nThe problem with pornography, though, is not that men like looking at \nnaked women, but that it reduces women to sexual objects. Like \nBathsheba, their human agency is stolen. Instead of restricting \naccess, we need to see women, and all humans, as Gods image bearers. \nUntil then, sexual abuse survivors will have no justice, and enablers \nand abusers will thrive among us.\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0014\n(Russell L.

Oh, the unsufferable pangs of Hell!\"\u0014\n\u0014\n     By contrast here are the last words of several believers: Dwight \nL. Moody said, \"This is glorious!  Earth recedes; Heaven is opening; \nGod is calling me!\"  Elizabeth Foulkes, dying for her testimony, \ncried out, \"Farewell, world; farewell, faith; farewell, hope.  \nWelcome, Love!\"  Kissing the stake, John Noise exclaimed, \"Blessed be \nthe time that ever I was born for this day.\"  Then to his fellow \nmartyrs he said, \"We shall not lose our lives in this fire, but only \nchange them for something better.\"  Sir David Brewster declared, \"I \nwill see Jesus--see Him as He is.  I have had the light for many \nyears.  Oh, how bright it is! I feel so safe, so satisfied!\"\u0014",
